Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called namesAndDescriptions and it's an instance method, so it starts with self. The docstring says it returns the name and description of the current class attribute. 

Looking at the context provided, I see that the class has methods like names and getDescriptionFor. The names method returns a list of names, and getDescriptionFor takes a name and returns the description. So, the function should combine these two.

The parameter 'all' is optional, defaulting to False. If all is True, it should return all names along with their descriptions. If False, only the names that have descriptions (i.e., not None) should be included.

So, the function will first get all the names using self.names(all). Then, for each name, it will get the description using self.getDescriptionFor(name). If the description is not None, it will add it to the result as a tuple.

I should handle the case where 'all' is True by including all names, even if their descriptions are None. Wait, no, the initial approach was to include only non-None descriptions when all is False. But looking back, the user's example code in the think section shows that when all=False, it includes only non-None descriptions, and when all=True, it includes all names regardless of descriptions.

Wait, in the example code, the function checks if all is False, then iterates through names and adds (name, desc) if desc is not None. If all is True, it adds (name, desc) regardless of desc being None or not. So, the function should behave that way.

So, the code should first get the list of names, then loop through each name, get the description, and collect the tuples accordingly based on the 'all' parameter.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Call self.names(all) to get the list of names.
2. Initialize an empty list to hold the result.
3. Loop over each name in the names list.
4. For each name, get the description using self.getDescriptionFor(name).
5. If all is False, append the tuple to the result only if the description is not None.
6. If all is True, append regardless of the description.

I think that's the correct approach. So, the code will reflect this logic.
