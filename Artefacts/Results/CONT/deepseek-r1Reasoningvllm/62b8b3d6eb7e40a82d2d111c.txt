Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _normalizeargs, and it takes two parameters: sequence and output, with output being optional. The docstring explains that this function is used to normalize declaration arguments, which can contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. The goal is to expand anything that isn't an individual interface or implements specification.

First, I'll look at the parameters. The function is defined as def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):. So, I'll need to write code that processes the sequence of arguments.

The docstring mentions that normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. So, I should check each element in the sequence. If an element is an instance of Declarions, I should process each of its interfaces. If it's a tuple, I'll treat each element as a separate argument, but since tuples are often part of a single argument, maybe I need to flatten them. Wait, no, the function's purpose is to normalize each argument, so if an argument is a tuple, it should be expanded into its components. But looking at the context, there are functions like _implements() and _classImplements() that deal with interfaces. So perhaps the function is meant to expand any complex argument into its constituent interfaces or individual interfaces.

I should loop through each element in the sequence. For each element, if it's a Declarments instance, I'll get its interfaces. If it's a tuple, I'll iterate over its elements. If it's another type, like a class or an interface, I'll treat it as a single argument.

Wait, but the function's purpose is to normalize arguments that might be Declarments, tuples, or single interfaces. So, for each arg in the sequence, if it's a Declarments, I'll get its interfaces. If it's a tuple, I'll process each element. If it's something else, like an interface or a class, I'll just add it as is.

But looking at the context, there are functions like _implements() which takes interfaces, so maybe the function is supposed to collect all the interfaces from each argument. So, for each arg in sequence, if it's a Declarments, add its interfaces. If it's a tuple, add each element as an interface. If it's an interface or a class, add it as a single argument.

Wait, but the function is called _normalizeargs, which is used to normalize the arguments for processing. So perhaps the function is supposed to expand any complex argument into its constituent parts, so that all the arguments are either individual interfaces or other basic types.

So, the code should iterate over each element in the sequence. For each element, if it's a Declarments instance, get its interfaces. If it's a tuple, iterate over its elements. Otherwise, treat it as a single argument.

But wait, the function's docstring says that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded. So, perhaps the function is meant to expand any complex argument into its interfaces or individual components.

So, the code will process each element in the sequence. For each element, if it's a Declarments, extract its interfaces. If it's a tuple, iterate over each item in the tuple as separate arguments. If it's another type, like a class or an interface, add it as a single argument.

But looking at the context, the function is part of a larger module dealing with class specifications, interfaces, etc. So, perhaps the function is meant to collect all the interfaces from all the arguments.

Wait, but the function's name is _normalizeargs, and the docstring says it's used to normalize declaration arguments. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take a sequence of arguments and normalize them into a list of interfaces or individual arguments.

So, the code will process each arg in the sequence. For each arg, if it's a Declarments, get its interfaces. If it's a tuple, iterate over each element. If it's a class or an interface, add it as a single argument.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Maybe the function should return a list of interfaces or individual arguments.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to expand any complex argument into its constituent parts, so that all the arguments are either interfaces or other basic types.

So, the code will loop through each element in the sequence. For each element, if it's a Declarments, get its interfaces and add them to the result. If it's a tuple, iterate over each element in the tuple and add them as individual arguments. If it's neither, add it as a single argument.

Wait, but in the context, there are functions like _implements() which take interfaces, and _classImplements() which take a class and its interfaces. So perhaps the function is meant to collect all the interfaces from all the arguments.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to expand any Declarments into their interfaces and any tuple into their elements, so that the output is a list of all the individual arguments, which could be interfaces or other types.

So, the code would look something like:

result = []
for arg in sequence:
    if isinstance(arg, Declarments):
        result.extend(arg.interfaces)
    elif isinstance(arg, tuple):
        result.extend(arg)
    else:
        result.append(arg)
if output is None:
    return result
else:
    output.extend(result)
    return output

Wait, but the function's docstring says that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded. So, perhaps the function is supposed to expand any argument that is not an individual interface or implements spec.

So, the function should process each element in the sequence, and for each element, if it is not an interface or an implements spec, it should be expanded into its constituent parts.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact logic. However, based on the context and the function name, I think the code should process each element in the sequence, expanding Declarments into their interfaces and tuples into their elements, and collect all the individual arguments.

So, the code would loop through each element, check if it's a Declarments, and if so, add its interfaces. If it's a tuple, add each element. Otherwise, add the element as is.

Then, if output is provided, extend it with the collected arguments. Otherwise, return the collected arguments.

I think that's the approach. So, the code would be as follows.
