Alright, I need to generate Python code for the function append_text_to_file based on the given signature and context. Let me break down what's required.

First, the function signature is provided: it takes file_name, text_buffer, encoding, and an optional overwrite parameter. The docstring explains that it writes the text buffer to a file. 

I should start by opening the file. Using Python's open function with 'a' mode makes sense because it appends to the file. But I also need to consider if the file exists. If it doesn't, I should create it. The context mentions a method is_file_exist, so I can use that. If the file doesn't exist, I'll create it using open with 'w' mode.

Next, I need to handle the text. The text_buffer might contain newlines, so I should strip any trailing newlines to prevent adding extra ones. Using text_buffer.rstrip('\n') does that.

Now, writing the text to the file. Using file.write ensures that the data is added correctly. But if overwrite is set to True, I should truncate the file first. The context has a method get_file_size, which I can use to check the file's size. If overwrite is True or the file doesn't exist, I'll call truncate.

I also need to handle exceptions. Using a try-except block around the file operations will catch any errors, log them, and return False. If everything goes well, the function should return True.

Logging is another consideration. The context mentions a logger, so I'll add log messages at the beginning and end of the function to indicate success or failure.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the function with these steps: check if the file exists, handle the text, write to the file, truncate if needed, and manage exceptions with logging.

I should make sure all the imports are included, but since the function is part of a class, I'll use self to access the context methods like is_file_exist and get_file_size.

Finally, I'll write the code, ensuring that it follows best practices like using context managers for file operations and proper exception handling with meaningful messages.
