Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called parse and it's part of a class, as indicated by the self in the parameters. The function is supposed to parse a date/time string into a datetime object.

First, I'll look at the parameters. The function takes timestr as the main string, default as the default datetime object, ignoretz to handle time zones, tzinfos which can be a dictionary or function for time zones, and **kwargs which are passed to _parse.

I notice that the docstring provides examples of how the function can be used, like specifying different time zones. Also, there are several methods mentioned in the context, such as _parse, _parsems, _build_tzinfo, etc. This suggests that the function uses these helper methods to parse the string.

I should start by importing the necessary modules. The docstring mentions warnings, time, string, io, __future__, decimal, re, calendar, datetime, six. But since the function is in a class and uses datetime, I'll import datetime from the datetime module.

Next, I'll structure the function. It should handle parsing the string, possibly extracting date and time components, and then converting them into a datetime object. The function should also handle time zones based on the ignoretz and tzinfos parameters.

I'll consider using regular expressions to parse the string, as the examples in the docstring use formats like 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS tzname'. The regex can capture year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and the timezone.

I'll need to loop through each token captured by the regex and extract the numerical values, converting them into integers. For the timezone, if ignoretz is False, I'll look it up in tzinfos and adjust the datetime accordingly.

I should also handle cases where the timezone is specified in the string but ignored due to ignoretz being True. In that case, the timezone parameter is ignored, and a naive datetime is returned.

Additionally, the function should handle potential exceptions, such as invalid date formats, and raise a ParserError if something goes wrong.

Finally, if the parsed datetime is naive and ignoretz is False, the function should convert it to a timezone-aware datetime using the specified tzinfos.

Putting it all together, the code will import necessary modules, define the parse method with the given signature, use regex to parse the string, extract components, convert them, handle time zones, and raise errors as needed.
