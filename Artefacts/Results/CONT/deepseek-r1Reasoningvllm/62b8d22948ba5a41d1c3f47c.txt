Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get and it's an instance method, which means it's defined inside a class. The method takes two parameters: self, key, and default which has a default value of None.

First, I'll start by writing the function definition. Since it's a method, it should have self as the first parameter. The function signature will be def get(self, key, default=None):.

Next, the docstring explains that if the key exists in the class, it returns the corresponding value; otherwise, it returns the default value. So I need to check if the key is present in the class's attributes.

I'll use the hasattr() function to check if the key exists. If it does, return the value using getattr(self, key). If not, return the default value.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: check hasattr, return value if exists, else return default.

I should make sure the code is clean and fits into the class structure. No imports are needed here since it's a simple function.

So the final code is straightforward: check for the key, return the value or default accordingly.
