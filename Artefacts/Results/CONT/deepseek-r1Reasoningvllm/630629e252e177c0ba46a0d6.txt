Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called retrieve_diaspora_host_meta and it takes a host as an argument, returning an XRD instance. 

First, I'll start by looking at the imports provided: typing, logging, xml, json, urllib, xrd, federation, lxml. I'll need to import these. Since the function is part of a class, I'll probably need to import xrd and possibly others like urllib for HTTP requests.

Next, the function should make an HTTP GET request to the host's meta endpoint. I'll use urllib.request.Request and urllib.request.urlopen to handle the HTTP request. I'll set the headers to include 'XRD-VERSION' and 'Host' as specified in the context.

I'll catch HTTPError exceptions and log them using the logging module. If the request is successful, I'll parse the XML response into an XRD object. If there's an error, I'll log it and raise an HTTPError with the response reason.

I should also import logging at the module level so I can log the exceptions. 

Putting it all together, I'll write the function, making sure to handle the request, parse the XML, and handle any errors appropriately.
