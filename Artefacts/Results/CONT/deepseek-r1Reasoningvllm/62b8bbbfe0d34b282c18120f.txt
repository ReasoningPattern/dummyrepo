Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called file_to_textbuffer and it takes two parameters: file_name and encoding. The docstring says it's supposed to load a file into a text buffer. 

First, I should figure out what the function needs to do. It probably reads the contents of the file and converts it into a text buffer, considering the specified encoding. So, I'll need to open the file, read its content, and handle any potential errors.

Looking at the context provided, there are imports like codecs, os, logging, pysolbase. The logger is used within the file, so I should include that. The function might also benefit from error handling, so using a try-except block makes sense. 

I should check if the file exists, but maybe the function is designed to handle that internally, so I'll proceed without explicit checks unless necessary.

The steps I think are: 
1. Open the file in read mode.
2. Read the file content using codecs to handle different encodings properly.
3. Convert the bytes read into a string using the specified encoding.
4. Log the operation for debugging purposes.
5. Return the text buffer.

I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to include the necessary imports and error handling. The function should be concise but robust, handling cases where the file might not be readable or doesn't exist without crashing.
