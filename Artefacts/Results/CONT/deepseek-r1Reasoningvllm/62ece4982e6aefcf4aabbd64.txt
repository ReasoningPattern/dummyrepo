Okay, I need to write a Python function called strip_root that takes two arguments: path and root. The goal is to remove the root directory from the given path. If it fails, I should throw an exception and return the modified path without the root.

First, I'll think about how to check if the path starts with the root. Using the startswith() method seems appropriate here. So, I'll check if path.startswith(root). If it does, I'll need to strip off the root part.

To remove the root from the path, I can use string slicing. For example, if path is '/home/user' and root is '/home', the new path should be 'user'. So, I'll slice the path from the length of the root onwards: path[len(root):].

But wait, I should make sure that the root is actually a prefix of the path. Otherwise, slicing might not give the correct result. So, I'll include an if condition to handle cases where the path doesn't start with the root. In such cases, I should raise a ValueError with a meaningful message.

Also, I need to handle cases where the path is exactly equal to the root. In that case, stripping the root would result in an empty string, which is acceptable.

Putting it all together, the function will first check if the path starts with the root. If yes, it slices the string and returns the new path. If not, it raises a ValueError.

I should also include a docstring as provided, explaining the function's purpose, return value, and the exception it raises.

Now, writing the code step by step:

1. Define the function with the given signature.
2. Use an if statement to check if path starts with root.
3. If true, return the sliced path.
4. Else, raise a ValueError indicating the failure to remove the root.

I think that covers all the cases. Let me write the code accordingly.
