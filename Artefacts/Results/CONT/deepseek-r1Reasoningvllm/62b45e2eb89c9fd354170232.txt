Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called next_version and it takes a version string as input. The docstring says it's for generating the next version identifier following an existing pattern. 

First, I should figure out what the expected pattern is. Since I don't have specific examples, I'll assume a common versioning scheme, like minor and patch increments. So, something like "1.2.3" where each part increases by one.

The function needs to parse the input version string, increment the appropriate parts, and return the next version. I'll split the version string into its components using the split('.') method. 

After splitting, I'll convert each part into an integer to handle numerical increments. I'll start from the end to find the first part that can be incremented. For example, if the version is "1.2.3", I'll increment the last part to get "1.2.4".

If all parts are at their maximum (like "1.9.9"), I'll need to carry over the increment. So, I'll loop through the parts, incrementing each and carrying over if it exceeds 9. If the first part overflows, I'll add a new major version, making it "2.0.0".

Once I have the new version parts, I'll join them back into a string with dots. 

I should also handle cases where the version string is empty or has only one part. For example, if the input is "1", the next version could be "2".

I'll write the code step by step: define the function, split the version string, handle empty cases, increment the parts, manage carry-over, and return the new version string.

I need to make sure the code is efficient and handles all edge cases, like versions with varying numbers of parts and full increments.

Testing with examples would help, but since I can't add explanations, I'll just make sure the code is clean and follows the logic I outlined.

So, putting it all together, the function will parse the version, increment the correct part, handle carries, and return the new version string.
