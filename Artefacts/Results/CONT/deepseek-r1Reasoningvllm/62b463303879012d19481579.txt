Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element and it's supposed to return possible values of number and sup from the contents of an issue. 

First, I'll start by looking at the function signature. It's a method, probably part of a class, and it takes an 'issue' parameter. The docstring explains that it returns possible values for number and supplement. So, I'll need to process the 'issue' object to extract these values.

I should think about what 'issue' might contain. It could be a string, a dictionary, or maybe an object with attributes. Since the context mentions packtools, perhaps it's related to packaging issues, so maybe the 'issue' has attributes like 'number' and 'supplement'.

I'll consider different scenarios. If 'issue' has a 'number' attribute, I should extract that. Similarly, if it has a 'supplement' attribute, extract that too. If these aren't present, return None or default values.

I'll structure the code to check for these attributes. Maybe using if statements or getattr with a default. For example, getattr(issue, 'number', None) would safely get the number if it exists, defaulting to None if not.

I'll also need to handle cases where the attributes might not be present. So, I'll initialize number and supplement as None. Then, check if 'number' exists in the issue's attributes and assign it. Do the same for 'supplement'.

Putting it all together, the function will return a tuple or a dictionary with the extracted number and supplement. Since the return type isn't specified, I'll assume it's a tuple of two elements, possibly None if not found.

I should also consider edge cases, like if either number or supplement is None. The function should handle that gracefully without errors.

So, the code will look something like:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    number = getattr(issue, 'number', None)
    supplement = getattr(issue, 'supplement', None)
    return (number, supplement)

This should cover the extraction from the issue element, handling cases where the attributes might be missing.
