Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called extend_cli and it's part of a class. The docstring explains that this function adds CLI options to the main entry point. It takes a subparser argument.

First, I'll start by looking at the parameters. The function has self and root_subparsers. Since it's a method, I'll define it with def extend_cli(self, root_subparsers):.

Next, I need to add help texts and register commands. Usually, in command-line interfaces, you use argparse's add_argument method. So I'll import argparse if it's not already done, but the context mentions imported packages, and argparse is part of the standard library, so it's probably already imported.

I'll create an argument parser, probably using argparse.ArgumentParser. Then, I'll add help texts using add_argument with the help parameter. It's common to have long help texts explaining what the subparser does.

After setting up the arguments, I need to register the commands. The register command method is typically called on the root subparser. So I'll call parser.register command with self, which adds the parsed arguments to the subparser.

Putting it all together, I'll write the code inside the function. I'll make sure to include the necessary imports, but since the context shows that argparse is imported, I don't need to add it again.

I should also ensure that the code follows the context provided, including any other methods or variables in the class, but since the task is just to generate the extend_cli function, I'll focus on that.

So the code will define the function, create an ArgumentParser instance, add help texts, and register the commands. That should fulfill the requirements of the function signature and docstring.
