Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's part of a class. The docstring says it removes the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns a tuple of the key and value. 

Hmm, I remember that in Python, dictionaries have a popitem method. But wait, in this context, the user mentioned importing the 'cache' package. So maybe this is part of a custom class, perhaps similar to a dictionary but with some cache functionality.

Looking at the context, the class has methods like __init__, pop, popitem, __setitem__, __order, __delitem__, and cache methods like cache_setitem and cache_delitem. So it's likely a subclass of dict or a custom class that uses the cache module.

In the standard dict, popitem() removes and returns an arbitrary item. But here, the requirement is to remove the first inserted key. So I can't just use dict's popitem because it doesn't guarantee removing the first key.

Wait, the context mentions self.__order, so maybe the class keeps track of the order of keys. So to implement popitem, I need to find the first key in the order list and remove it, then return its value.

So the steps are:
1. Check if the dictionary isn't empty.
2. Get the first key from self.__order.
3. Remove that key using self.pop with a specific key.
4. Return a tuple of (key, value).

I should also handle the case where the dictionary is empty to avoid errors.

Putting it together, the function would look like:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): LRU dict too small to remove")
    key = self.__order[0]
    del self[key]
    return (key, self[key])

Wait, but in the standard dict, popitem removes and returns an arbitrary item. Here, the first inserted key is the one to remove. So using self.__order[0] makes sense because it's the first in the order list.

I think that's the correct implementation. It ensures that the first key is removed and its value is returned as a tuple. Also, it raises a KeyError if the dict is empty, which is consistent with the standard dict's behavior.
