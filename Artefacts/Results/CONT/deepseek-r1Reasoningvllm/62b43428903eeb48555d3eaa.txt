Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called formatmany and it's part of a class. Let me look at the details.

The function signature is:
def formatmany(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:

The docstring says it's converting sql using self._converter.convert_many.

First, I'll start by writing the function definition. It's a method, so I'll use self as the first parameter. The function takes sql as a string and many_params, which is a Union of two types: Iterable of Dictionaries or Iterable of Sequences. The return type is a Tuple containing the converted SQL string and the processed many_params.

Next, I'll write the docstring. It should explain that this function converts the SQL string using self._converter.convert_many. I'll structure it with Args and Returns sections for clarity.

Inside the function, the first step is to process the many_params. I'll check if each item in many_params is a dictionary or a sequence. I'll create a list comprehension that iterates over each item, checks if it's a dict, and if so, converts it to a list of dictionaries. If it's a sequence, I'll convert it to a list as well.

Then, I'll call self._converter.convert_many with sql and the processed many_params. This should return a tuple where the first element is the converted SQL string and the second is the processed parameters.

I'll make sure to return this tuple from the function.

I should also ensure that the code is clean and follows Python best practices, using type hints correctly. Since the user didn't mention any specific imports beyond what's provided, I'll assume that the necessary modules are already imported.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code with proper indentation and syntax.
