Okay, I need to write a Python function called _get_seq_with_type that returns a tuple of a sequence and its type. The function takes an argument seq and an optional bufsize which defaults to None. The docstring explains that the returned sequence is derived from the input seq, or it's seq itself if it's a sequence. 

First, I should determine if the input seq is a sequence. In Python, sequences are types like list, tuple, etc. I remember that collections.abc has a Sequence ABC which includes these. So I'll need to import ABC from collections.abc.

Wait, the user mentioned that the imports include itertools and copy, but not ABC. So I'll have to import ABC myself. 

So, the function will start by checking if seq is an instance of ABC.Sequence. If it is, then the derived sequence is just seq. If not, I need to convert it into a sequence. The options are list(seq) or tuple(seq). I'll have to decide which one to use. The user's example uses list(seq), so I'll go with that.

Next, I'll get the type of the derived sequence using type(). Then, I'll return a tuple containing the derived sequence and its type.

I should also handle the case where seq is None. If seq is None, then list(seq) would throw an error. So I need to check if seq is None before processing. If it is, perhaps return (None, type(None)).

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Check if seq is None. If yes, return (None, NoneType).
2. Else, check if it's a sequence. If yes, use it as is.
3. If not, convert it to a list.
4. Return the derived sequence and its type.

I should also make sure to import ABC. So at the top, I'll add 'from collections.abc import Sequence'.

Testing some cases:

- If seq is [1,2,3], it's a list, so derived_seq is [1,2,3], type is list.
- If seq is 'abc', it's a string, so derived_seq is ['a','b','c'], type is list.
- If seq is 123, it's not a sequence, so derived_seq is [123], type is list.
- If seq is None, derived_seq is None, type is NoneType.

I think that covers the functionality. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
