Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_arguments that takes *arguments and returns an ArgumentParser instance. The docstring says that given command-line arguments, this function parses them and returns the parser.

First, I remember that the argparse module is used for parsing command-line arguments in Python. So I'll need to import argparse.

The function signature is given as def parse_arguments(*arguments):, so it's expecting any number of positional arguments.

I think the function should create an ArgumentParser instance. So I'll start by creating a parser object, maybe using argparse.ArgumentParser().

Next, I need to tell the parser how to handle the arguments passed to the function. Since the function receives *arguments, which are the command-line arguments, I should use parser.add_argument() to add these arguments to the parser.

Wait, but how? Oh right, the add_argument method can take a list of arguments. So I can pass *arguments to add_argument. That way, each element in arguments becomes an argument in the parser.

So inside the function, I'll do something like parser.add_argument(*arguments). But wait, I should make sure that the arguments are in the correct format. Maybe I should convert them to strings in case they contain special characters, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

I should also consider whether I need to set any flags or positional arguments. The function is called parse_arguments, so perhaps it's meant to be used in a way that the arguments are directly added without any additional processing.

Putting it all together, the function will create a parser, add all the arguments passed to it using *arguments, and then return the parser object.

I should also make sure that I import argparse at the top of the file. The user mentioned that the imported packages include sys and argparse, so I'll include that import statement.

Wait, but the user specified not to include any explanation or markdown formatting, just the code. So I'll make sure to write only the function and the import line.

So the code will look like:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument(*arguments)
    return parser

I think that's it. This function creates a parser, adds all the provided arguments, and returns the parser instance as required.
