Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_run_el that checks whether a given object's class has the run method. The function signature is provided, so I just need to fill in the implementation.

First, I should think about how to check if a method exists in a class. I remember that the hasattr() function in Python is used to check if a certain attribute exists in an object. So, I can use hasattr(obj, 'run') to see if the run method is present.

Wait, but wait. The obj is passed as an argument, but I'm not sure if it's an instance or the class itself. The function is named is_run_el, which suggests it's checking the class, not an instance. So, I should pass the class of obj to hasattr. So, I'll get the class using type(obj).

So, putting it together, the function will return True if the class has the run method, else False. That means the return statement will be a boolean expression: hasattr(type(obj), 'run').

I should make sure to handle cases where obj might not be an instance of a class. But since the function is designed to check the class, using type(obj) should be safe because type() returns the class if obj is an instance.

So, the code will be concise. I'll write the function, use type(obj) inside hasattr, and return the result.

Let me put it all together. The function definition is given, so I just need to add the body.

So, the code will be:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(type(obj), 'run')

That should do it. I don't think I need any imports because hasattr is a built-in function. So, no additional packages are needed.
