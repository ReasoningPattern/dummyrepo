Okay, I need to figure out how to write the Python function based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _inline_r_setup and takes a code argument of type str and returns a str. The docstring explains that some R behavior can't be configured via environment variables and must be set via R options once R starts. These are handled here.

So, the function's purpose is to execute R code snippets that configure settings after R has started. The code argument is the string of R code to run. I think the function needs to evaluate this R code within an R environment.

I remember that in Python, you can use the rpy2 library to interface with R. So, I'll need to import rpy2 and set up a backend. The function should create an R instance, evaluate the provided code, and then extract the necessary variables.

Wait, the function is supposed to return the variables from the R code. So, after evaluating the code, I need to collect the variables. Maybe using a dictionary comprehension to get the values from the global environment of the R instance.

I should make sure to import rpy2.rinterface and set up the backend properly. Also, I need to suppress any warnings or output from R by setting options like verbose = FALSE.

Putting it all together, the function will import the necessary modules, create an R instance with a backend, evaluate the code with settings that suppress output, and then return the variables from the R environment.

I need to make sure that the function doesn't include any explanations or markdown, just the code. So, the final code will import rpy2, set up the R instance, evaluate the code, and return the variables.
