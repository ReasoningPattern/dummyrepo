Okay, I need to write a Python function called force_string based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function should force decode obj with 'utf-8' if it's a numpy.bytes or bytes type. Otherwise, it should return obj as is. So, the function needs to check the type of obj and decide whether to decode it or not.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. Since the function deals with bytes-like objects, I'll need to import numpy. Wait, the context already mentions that numpy is imported, so I don't need to worry about that.

Next, I'll look at the parameters. The function takes obj as an argument. The docstring says it's a consistency config, but that's probably not important for the code.

Now, I'll think about how to check if obj is a numpy.bytes or bytes instance. In Python, I can use isinstance() for this. So, I'll check if isinstance(obj, (bytes, numpy.bytes_)). Wait, numpy.bytes_ is a separate type, so using (bytes, numpy.bytes_) as the second argument to isinstance will cover both cases.

If it is either of these types, I need to decode it using 'utf-8'. So, I'll return obj.decode('utf-8'). If it's not, I'll just return obj as is.

Putting it all together, the function will have an if statement checking the type. If true, decode; else, return obj.

Wait, but what if obj is a bytes-like object from another library? Well, the function specifically checks for numpy.bytes or bytes, so it won't decode other types.

I should also consider edge cases, like if obj is already a string. In that case, the function will leave it as is, which is correct because the docstring says to return obj if it's not a bytes or numpy.bytes object.

Testing this logic: if obj is a bytes string, it decodes to a regular string. If it's a numpy.bytes object, it also decodes. For other types, like int or None, it returns them unchanged.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
