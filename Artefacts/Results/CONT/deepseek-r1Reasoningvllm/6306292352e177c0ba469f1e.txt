Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called process_text_links and it's supposed to process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links. The context mentions importing typing, urllib, re, and bleach, but within the file, it's within a class. 

First, I'll start by defining the function with the correct signature. It's a function that takes 'text' as an argument and returns something, probably a dictionary since the docstring mentions attributes and linkifying.

I'll need to import the necessary modules. Since the context says to import typing, urllib, re, and bleach, I'll include those at the top. But wait, the user said not to include any markdown or explanations, so I'll just list the imports.

Next, inside the function, I'll use regular expressions to find all URLs in the text. Using re.findall with a pattern like r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+'. This pattern captures URLs with http:// and https://.

For each URL found, I need to check if it's valid. Using urllib.parse.urlparse should help. I'll iterate through each url and create a dictionary entry with attributes like scheme, netloc, path, etc.

But wait, the function is within a class, so I should probably initialize some instance variables here, like self.domain_links and self.url_info. Each URL found will be added to these variables.

I also need to handle cases where the URL might not have a scheme, so I'll check if the scheme is not empty before processing. If it's valid, I'll add it to the dictionaries.

I should make sure to import the required modules at the top, but the user said not to include any markdown or explanations, so I'll just list the imports without any extra formatting.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function, import the modules, and make sure the code is clean and follows the structure the user provided.
