Okay, I need to write a Python function called split that takes a string s and an optional platform argument. The function should split the string based on the platform rules. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the docstring says that if platform is 'this', it should auto-detect the current platform. So I need to determine whether the current system is Windows or Linux/MacOS. On Windows, I should split on '\', and on others, I should split on '\', '/', or maybe other separators.

Wait, the POSIX style uses '/' as the separator, right? So when platform is 1, I split on '/'. For Windows (platform 0), I split on '\'. But what about other platforms like macOS? Well, the problem says if platform is 0, use Windows/CMD style, which is splitting on '\'.

So, the plan is: check the platform. If it's 1, split on '/'. If it's 0, split on '\'. If it's 'this', detect the OS and choose the appropriate separator.

To detect the OS, I can use the platform module. So import platform. If platform.system() is 'Windows', then use '\'. Otherwise, use '/'.

Wait, but what about on Linux? On Linux, sometimes paths use both '/' and '\', but in practice, most are using '/' as the separator. So I'll default to '/' for non-Windows platforms.

Next, the function should return a list of the split strings. So I'll use the split method of the string with the appropriate separator.

Putting it all together: the function will first determine the separator based on the platform. Then, split the string s using that separator and return the list.

Let me structure the code. Import re isn't needed here, but I have to check the platform module.

Wait, the context says imported packages are re, but in the code, I don't think I need it. Maybe it's a mistake, but I'll proceed without it.

So, the steps in code:

1. Import platform.

2. In the function, determine the separator:
   - If platform is 1, sep = '/'
   - elif platform is 0, sep = '\\'
   - else, check the OS: if Windows, sep = '\\', else sep = '/'

3. Split s using sep and return the list.

Wait, but the default when platform is 'this' is to auto-detect. So in the function, the platform parameter is given as 'this' by default, right? Wait, looking back, the function signature is def split(s, platform='this'), so yes, when called without the platform argument, it's 'this'.

So inside the function:

if platform == 1:
    sep = '/'
elif platform == 0:
    sep = '\\'
else:
    # auto-detect
    os = platform.system()
    sep = '\\' if os == 'Windows' else '/'

Then, return s.split(sep)

Wait, but what about empty strings in the result? For example, if s is an empty string, split returns [''], which is correct. If s is None, but the function expects s to be a string, so perhaps it's handled.

Testing some examples:

split('path/to/file', 1) should split on '/' → ['path', 'to', 'file']

split('path\\to\\file', 0) → ['path', 'to', 'file']

split('path/to/file', 'this') → check OS. On Windows, split on '\', so ['path', 'to', 'file']. On Linux, split on '/', same result.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for 'this' platform, it's auto-detecting current platform. So on Windows, split on '\', on others split on '/'.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code should handle all these cases.

I think that's the plan. Now, write the code accordingly.
