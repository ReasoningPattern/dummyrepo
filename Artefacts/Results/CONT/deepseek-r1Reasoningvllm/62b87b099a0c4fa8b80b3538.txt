Okay, I need to generate a Python function based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_fill_request_el and it's supposed to check if the obj class has the fill and request attributes. 

First, I'll look at the function signature: it's a single function named is_fill_request_el that takes one parameter, obj. The docstring explains that this function checks whether the obj class has the 'fill' and 'request' attributes. 

I remember that in Python, to check if an object has an attribute, we use the hasattr() function. But since the function is checking the class of 'obj', I should use type(obj) to get the class. Then, I'll call hasattr() on that class with the attributes 'fill' and 'request'.

Wait, but the function is supposed to check if both attributes exist, right? So I should use the 'and' operator. That way, it returns True only if both hasattr(type(obj), 'fill') and hasattr(type(obj), 'request') are True.

Putting it all together, the function body will be a single return statement that uses hasattr with the two conditions connected by an 'and'. 

So the code should look like:

return hasattr(type(obj), 'fill') and hasattr(type(obj), 'request')

I think that's all. I don't need any imports here because hasattr is a built-in function. Also, the function is straightforward, so no explanation is needed.
