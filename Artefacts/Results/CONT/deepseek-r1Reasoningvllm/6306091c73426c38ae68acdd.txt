Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called validate_from_file, and it takes two parameters: cls and yaml_file, which is optional. The docstring says it loads and validates that a YAML file has all required fields. It raises an exception if mandatory data is missing and returns a dictionary with the data.

Looking at the imports, I see os, jsonschema, six, and infrared are imported. So I should probably use os to read the file and jsonschema to validate the schema.

First, I'll need to open the YAML file. Since yaml_file is optional, I should check if it's None. If it is, maybe raise an error because the user needs to provide the path. Otherwise, open the file using os.open, but I should handle exceptions in case the file can't be opened or read.

Next, I'll read the contents of the file. Using os.read to get the entire content as a string. Then, I'll need to parse it into a dictionary using json.load, but since it's YAML, maybe json.load with some options. Oh, right, sometimes YAML files have whitespace issues, so using SafeLoader might help, but I think the default is okay unless there are issues.

Now, I need to validate this data against a schema. The function should have a schema that defines the required fields. Since the schema isn't provided, I'll assume it's imported or defined somewhere. I'll use jsonschema.load to load the schema, maybe with the pretty format for readability, but again, the actual loading method depends on how the schema is provided.

After loading the schema, I'll perform a schema validation on the loaded data. If it's invalid, I'll raise an IRValidatorException, which I assume is a custom exception. The exception should include a message indicating which fields are missing. I'll loop through the required fields and check if each is present in the data. If any are missing, collect them and include them in the error message.

Finally, if everything is valid, return the data as a dictionary.

I should also consider error handling. For example, if the file can't be opened, os will raise an exception, which I should propagate. Similarly, if the JSON is invalid, json.load will raise a JSONDecodeError, which I should catch and handle by raising an exception.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code to open the file, read the content, parse it, validate, and handle exceptions. I'll make sure to include the necessary imports and raise the appropriate exceptions with meaningful messages.
