Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_choices_args and takes self and args as parameters. The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is one of the available choices.

First, I'll think about what this function needs to do. It should validate that the provided arguments are among the defined choices. So, I'll need a way to access those choices. Since the function is part of a class, using self.choices makes sense. I'll assume choices is a dictionary where keys are valid argument values and the value is True.

I'll start by checking if self.choices exists to avoid an AttributeError. If it doesn't, I'll raise an exception.

Next, I'll extract the possible_values from self.choices using self.choices.keys(). Then, I'll get the provided value from args[0].

I need to ensure that the value is a string because comparing different data types (like int and string) can cause issues. So, I'll convert the value to a string.

If the string value is in the possible_values, I'll return True. Otherwise, I'll return False.

I'll structure the code with docstrings for both the function and the exception message to make it clear and maintainable.

Finally, I'll test the code with some examples to ensure it works as expected. For instance, if choices are 'a' and 'b', and the argument is 'a', it should return True. If the argument is 'c', it should return False.
