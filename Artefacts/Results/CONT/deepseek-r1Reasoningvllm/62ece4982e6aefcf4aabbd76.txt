Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called match and takes a filename as an argument. The goal is to check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'. 

First, I'll look at the docstring. It says that the function returns True if the filename in lowercase is 'doxyfile'. So, I need to check if the filename, when converted to lowercase, equals 'doxyfile'. 

The function signature is given, so I don't need to change that. The docstring is already provided, so I just need to implement the logic inside the function.

I should import the os module as per the context, but looking at the function, it doesn't seem to use any os functions. So maybe the import isn't necessary here, but since it's listed, I'll include it just in case.

Wait, the function is named match, and it's supposed to check the type. So, the logic is straightforward: return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'. 

I should make sure that the function returns a boolean, True or False, based on this comparison. 

So putting it all together, the function will take the filename, convert it to lowercase, and compare it to 'doxyfile'. If they are equal, return True; otherwise, False.

I think that's all. The code should be simple and direct.
