Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_valid and it's an instance method because it has 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it returns True if the identifier is valid, and in this base implementation, it always returns True. 

Hmm, so the task is to write the function body. Since it's a class method, I'll define it inside a class. The function takes 'self' and 'identifier' as parameters. The body should just return True. 

I should make sure the indentation is correct, using four spaces for the function body. Also, since it's a method, I'll add a colon at the end of the function definition. 

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: it's inside a class, named is_valid, takes self and identifier, and returns True. No need for any complex logic since the base implementation always returns True.

I think that's all. Just write the function as specified without any additional comments or explanations.
