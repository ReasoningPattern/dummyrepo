Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me see what the user provided.

The function is called workspace_manager and it's a method of a class. The docstring says it gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So I need to write a method that returns this service.

Looking at the context, the imports are os, sys, and infrared. The class has several other methods like _get_service, setup, plugins_manager, ansible_config_manager, execution_logger_manager, register_service, and workspace_manager. So the class is part of some infrared setup.

The function should call self._get_service with the class name and the service name 'WORKSPACE_MANAGER'. So the code would be something like:

return self._get_service(cls, ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

I should make sure to include this line inside the workspace_manager method. No need for any imports since they're already handled elsewhere.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so the method should be indented under the class. The user didn't specify the class definition, but the code should be properly formatted as a method.

So putting it all together, the code will define the workspace_manager method which returns the service using the provided method.
