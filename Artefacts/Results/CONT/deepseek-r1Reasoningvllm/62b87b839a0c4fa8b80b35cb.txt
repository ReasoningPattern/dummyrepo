Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _get_err_indices and it takes self and coord_name as parameters. The docstring says it's supposed to find all error indexes corresponding to coord_name.

First, I should think about what this function needs to do. It probably returns a list of indices where errors occurred for the given coordinate name. But how?

Looking at the context provided, I see that the class has attributes like coords, field_names, and _parsed_error_names. These might be useful. The function might need to look up the coordinate name in the parsed error names and return the indices where they occur.

So, the function should access the _parsed_error_names attribute. It should find all keys in this dictionary that match the coord_name. For each matching key, it should get the list of indices and return them as a list of tuples, where each tuple is (coord_name, index).

I should also handle cases where the coord_name isn't found. Maybe return an empty list or raise an error, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume it returns an empty list if not found.

Putting it all together, the function will loop through the items in _parsed_error_names, check if the key matches coord_name, and collect the indices. Then, it will return the list of tuples.

I should write the code accordingly, making sure it's concise and fits the requirements.
