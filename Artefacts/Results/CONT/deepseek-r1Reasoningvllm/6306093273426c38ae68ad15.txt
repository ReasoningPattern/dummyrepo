Okay, I need to help the user generate Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring. The function is called _run_playbook and it's supposed to run Ansible CLI with a vars dictionary. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll look at the parameters. The function takes cli_args, which is a list of command line arguments. Then there's vars_dict, which is a dictionary that will be passed as Ansible extra-vars. The other two parameters are ir_workspace and ir_plugin, which are objects from the Infrared library. The function should return the Ansible results.

I remember that in Ansible, you can pass variables using the extra_vars parameter. So I'll need to create an ExtraVars object from vars_dict. The ExtraVars class probably takes a dictionary as input.

Next, I should use the run Playbook action from Ansible. The run Playbook action is accessed via the module playbook module. So I'll need to import Playbook from ansible.module_utils.

Wait, but Ansible modules are usually imported from module_utils, so I'll import Playbook as Playbook_module. Then, I'll create a Playbook instance by passing cli_args, extra_vars, and the workspace and plugin objects.

Once the Playbook is created, I need to run it. The Playbook.run() method returns a result object. I should capture this result and return it from my function.

Putting it all together, I'll start by creating the ExtraVars instance. Then, instantiate Playbook with the necessary parameters. Run the Playbook and return the result.

I should make sure to handle any exceptions or errors, but the current code doesn't include try-except blocks, so maybe the user expects it to handle errors gracefully. I'll assume that for now and just return the result as is.

So the code will look like importing Playbook, creating the extra_vars, initializing the Playbook, running it, and returning the result. That should cover everything the function needs to do.
