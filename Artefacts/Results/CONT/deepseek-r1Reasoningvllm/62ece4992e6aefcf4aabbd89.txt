Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called gaussian and takes a single argument x. The docstring says it calculates a Gaussian centered with u=0.2 and sigma=0.1.

First, I remember that the Gaussian function, also known as the normal distribution, has the formula (1/(σ√(2π))) * exp(-((x - μ)^2)/(2σ²)). Here, μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

In the problem, μ is 0.2 and σ is 0.1. So I'll substitute these values into the formula. 

I should import numpy as np because it's mentioned in the context and it's useful for mathematical operations. But looking at the imports, numpy is already imported as np, so I don't need to add it again.

The function body will compute the Gaussian. I'll calculate the exponent part first: - (x - 0.2)^2 / (2 * 0.1^2). Then take the exponential of that. Next, compute the normalization factor: 1 divided by (0.1 * sqrt(2 * pi)). Multiplying the exponential by this factor gives the Gaussian value.

Putting it all together, the function will return (1/(0.1 * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))) * np.exp(-(x - 0.2)**2 / (2 * 0.1**2)).

I should make sure that the code is concise and matches the function signature exactly. Also, since numpy is already imported, I don't need to include any additional import statements.
