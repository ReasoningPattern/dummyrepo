Okay, so I need to generate Python code for a function called _reset_logging that resets the logging system. The function is part of a class, and the docstring explains that it's resetting the logging system. 

First, I should think about what resetting logging typically involves. Usually, that means turning off all existing loggers, handlers, and listeners so that the application starts fresh in terms of logging.

I remember that in Python's logging module, there's a function called reset_logging() which does exactly this. So using that function would be efficient.

But maybe I should also handle the root logger explicitly. So I can get the root logger using logging.getLogger(''). Then, I can set its handlers, listeners, and other handlers to None. This ensures that any handlers attached to the root logger are removed, which might be necessary if they were set up before.

Additionally, I should reset all named loggers. That means looping through all the loggers registered and setting their handlers and listeners to None. I can do this by iterating over logginggers = logging.getloggers(), then for each logger, I set their handlers and other handlers to None.

Putting it all together, the function would first call reset_logging() to handle the root and module loggers, then reset each individual logger. Also, it's a good idea to reset the loggers used by the module's own handlers so that those are also cleared.

I should make sure to import the logging module, but since the user didn't mention any imports, I assume it's already imported. 

So the steps are:

1. Reset the root logger.
2. Reset all named loggers.
3. Reset loggers used by handlers.
4. Reset loggers used by handlers of handlers.

This should cover all bases and ensure a clean reset of the logging system.
