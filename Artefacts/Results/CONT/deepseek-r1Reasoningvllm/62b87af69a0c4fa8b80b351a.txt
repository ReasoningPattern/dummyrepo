Alright, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_compute_el that checks if a given object's class has the fill and compute methods. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that in Python, I can use the hasattr() function to check if a class has a certain method. So, I'll need to import the inspect module because it provides useful functions for getting attributes of objects.

Wait, actually, the inspect module has a method called hasMethod(), which can check if a class has a method. But hasattr() can also be used by checking if the class is in the __dict__ of the class or if it's a method descriptor.

Hmm, maybe using hasattr() is simpler here. I can check if the class has an attribute 'fill' which is a method. But wait, that's not exactly right because the method might be named differently, like 'fill_method' or something else. Oh, but the function is called is_fill_compute_el, and the docstring says it checks for the fill and compute methods. So the methods must be named exactly 'fill' and 'compute'.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The method names could be other things, but the function is checking for the presence of the fill and compute methods. So perhaps the function should check if the class has methods named 'fill' and 'compute'.

So, using hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute') would be the way to go. But wait, I should also ensure that these are methods, not attributes. So maybe I should check if they are callable.

Alternatively, using inspect.ismethod() would be better because it checks if the attribute is a method. But I think using hasattr() is sufficient for this check.

Putting it all together, the function will import inspect, then return True if both hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute') are True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Wait, but sometimes, the method might be inherited, so checking the class's __dict__ might miss it. Using inspect.ismethod() would correctly identify if the method exists, even if it's inherited.

So, I should import inspect and use inspect.ismethod() for both 'fill' and 'compute'. That way, it checks if these methods exist in the class hierarchy.

So, the function will import inspect, then return True if both methods are present, else False.

Putting it all together, the code should look like this: import inspect, then define the function that uses inspect.ismethod() on both 'fill' and 'compute' for the object's class.

I think that's the correct approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
