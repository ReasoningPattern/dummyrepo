Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_option_spec and it's part of a class. The docstring says it gets the specification for a given option name by calling self.get_parser_option_specs() for the command_name.

First, I'll look at the function signature. It takes self, command_name, and argument_name as parameters. The function is inside a class, so I'll need to access the method correctly.

The docstring mentions that it uses self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name). So I should call that method on the instance. That means the code will be something like return self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name).

I should make sure to include the colon at the end and return the result. There's no need for any additional imports or parameters beyond what's given.

Putting it all together, the function will simply return the result of get_parser_option_specs with the provided command_name.
