Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring for the lru_cache decorator. The user wants only the code in Python markdown format, so no explanations or markdown here.

First, I recall that in Python, decorators can be written as functions that take other functions as arguments. The lru_cache decorator is used for memoization, which caches the results of function calls to avoid redundant computations.

The function signature given is def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):. This means the decorator accepts two optional parameters: maxsize (default 128) and typed (default False).

The docstring explains that this decorator wraps a function with a memoizing callable using an LRU algorithm, saving up to maxsize results. It's important to note that this is a decorator factory, returning an actual decorator that can be applied to functions.

I remember that to create a decorator factory, the function needs to return another decorator. So, the structure would be something like:

def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # implementation here
        return wrapped_func
    return decorator

Now, for the decorator, I need to implement memoization with LRU. Python's built-in functools module has a decorator called lru_cache, but since we're supposed to create our own, I'll need to implement the caching logic.

I'll use a dictionary to store the cache. Each key will be the arguments of the function, and the value will be the result. To get the arguments as a hashable type, I'll convert them into a tuple using functools.WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS, which handles different function argument types.

I'll also need to manage the cache size. When the cache exceeds maxsize, the least recently used item should be removed. To track usage, I'll use a counter that increments each time the function is called. The least recently used entry will be the one with the oldest counter value.

Additionally, the typed parameter determines if the function is typed. If True, the arguments are checked against expected types before hashing. If False, all arguments are used as is, which might cause hashing issues if not hashable.

Putting it all together, the decorator will wrap the function, manage the cache, handle argument types, and maintain the LRU order. I'll also need to import necessary modules like functools for wrapper assignments and ordering.

Wait, but in the code, I see functools is imported, and WRAPPER_ASSIGNMENTS and WRAPPER_UPDATES are used. So, I'll include those imports at the top.

Let me structure the code step by step:

1. Import functools.
2. Define lru_cache with maxsize and typed parameters.
3. Inside, define the decorator function that takes func as an argument.
4. Create a cache dictionary.
5. Use a deque to manage the order of usage, keeping track of the most recently used items.
6. Define a wrapper function that checks if the arguments are typed, converts them to a tuple, checks if it's in the cache, and computes the result.
7. If not in cache, compute the result, update the usage, and add to the cache.
8. If typed is True, validate each argument against the expected type before hashing.
9. Return the wrapper function as the decorated function.

I think that covers all the parts. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle all edge cases like non-hashable arguments and type checking.
