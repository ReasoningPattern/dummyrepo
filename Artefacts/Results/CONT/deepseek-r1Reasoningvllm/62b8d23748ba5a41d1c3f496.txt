Okay, I need to generate Python code for an LRU cache decorator based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that Python has built-in decorators like `@lru_cache` which uses an LRU strategy. But here, the requirement is to create an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache instead. So I can't just use the built-in one; I need to implement my own.

The function signature is `def lfu_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):`. This decorator will wrap a function, so I'll need to create a wrapper function that manages the cache.

I'll start by importing necessary modules. Since it's a decorator, I'll probably need `functools` for ` wraps` to preserve the function's metadata. Also, for ordering and tracking usage, I'll need data structures. A dictionary for the cache makes sense because it allows easy access to the most or least recently used items. For ordering, an OrderedDict from `collections` would be useful because it maintains insertion order, which I can use to determine the least frequently used item when the cache is full.

Next, I'll define the decorator function. Inside it, I'll create a class, maybe `LFU`, which handles the caching logic. This class should be callable so that it can wrap the function.

In the `__init__` method of the `LFU` class, I'll initialize the cache as a dictionary, the maximum size, and a flag for typed caching. I'll also create an OrderedDict to keep track of the usage order. If `typed` is True, the cache will be a dictionary of dictionaries to handle different types of objects.

The `__call__` method will handle the actual caching. Before adding a new item, I'll check if it's already in the cache. If it is, I'll update its position in the OrderedDict. If not, I'll add it. If the cache exceeds `maxsize`, I'll remove the least recently used item, which is the last one in the OrderedDict. For typed caching, I'll handle each type appropriately, ensuring that the cache is structured correctly.

I also need to decorate the function using `functools.wraps` to maintain its metadata. The `@` decorator syntax will apply this to the wrapper function.

Wait, but in the code I wrote, I have a class inside the decorator function. That's fine because the decorator function returns an instance of this class when called. Each instance can wrap the function each time it's called.

I should also make sure that when `typed=False`, the cache is a simple dictionary, and when `typed=True`, it's a dictionary of dictionaries. This way, each key in the cache corresponds to a specific type, and the value is another dictionary of items.

Testing the code, I should ensure that when the cache is full, the least recently used item is evicted. For example, if I have items A, B, C in the cache and add D, then C should be removed if the maxsize is 3. Also, each access to an item should move it to the front of the order.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to include all necessary imports and structure the code properly.
