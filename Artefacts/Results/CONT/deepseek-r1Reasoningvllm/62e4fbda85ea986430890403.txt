Okay, so the user is asking me to generate Python code based on a given function signature and docstring. They specifically mentioned not to include any explanations or markdown, just the code in Python markdown format. Let me break this down.

First, the function is called _shuffled and it takes a sequence of strings as input. It returns a list of strings. The docstring explains that it shuffles the given sequence using a FIXED RANDOM SEED. So, the main goal is to shuffle the sequence in a reproducible way.

I know that in Python, the random.shuffle function shuffles a list in place. But since the user wants a fixed seed, using random.seed() before shuffling would ensure the same order every time. That makes sense for reproducibility.

Wait, but the input is a Sequence[str]. So, I need to make sure that the function can handle any sequence, like a list or a tuple of strings. The function should convert the input into a list, shuffle it, and then return it as a list.

So the steps are: set the random seed, convert the sequence to a list, shuffle it, and return the shuffled list. I should also make sure to import the random module, but the user mentioned that the imported packages include 'random', so I don't need to add that.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: set the seed, convert the sequence to a list, shuffle, and return. I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
