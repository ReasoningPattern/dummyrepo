Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _get_conditionally_required_args and it's part of a class. Let me look at the parameters and what it's supposed to do.

The function takes three parameters: self, command_name, options_spec, and args. The docstring says it lists arguments with the required_when condition matched. So, I need to write a method that filters arguments based on some condition related to their required status.

I remember that in Python, when working with command-line arguments, each argument can have attributes like 'required', 'default', etc. The required_when condition probably checks if the argument is required given the current context, like whether it's mandatory for the command to run.

Looking at the context provided, I see that the class has methods like validate_min_max_args, validate_arg_sources, and others. These methods likely handle validation based on arguments. The _get_conditionally_required_args method is used to find arguments that are conditionally required, meaning they must be provided under certain conditions.

So, the code should iterate over the args, check each argument's required status, and collect those that meet the condition. I'll need to use a list comprehension for this. For each arg in args, I'll check if arg.required is True. If it is, I'll include it in the result list.

I should make sure that the function returns a list of argument names that are conditionally required. So, the list will be [arg.name for arg in args if arg.required].

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: define the method, use a list comprehension to filter args based on the required attribute, and return the list.

I don't see any imports needed here since the function is part of a class and the required attribute is part of the argument objects. So, the code should be straightforward.
