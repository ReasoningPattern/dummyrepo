Okay, I need to write a Python function called get_nodeinfo_well_known_document. The function takes two parameters: url and document_path, which has a default value of None. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary including info like url and document_path.

First, I'll start by defining the function with the given signature. Since the user mentioned not to include any explanation or markdown, I'll focus on the code.

I'll import the necessary modules. From the context, I see that the function uses json, os, base64, and warnings. So I'll import those. Also, os.path is needed for file operations.

Next, I'll create an empty dictionary to store the information. I'll set the default values for url and document_path in the dictionary. Then, I'll process the document_path if it's not None. Using os.path.basename, I'll extract the filename and decode it from base64 to get the actual document name.

I'll add this processed document_path to the dictionary. Then, I'll structure the JSON response with a "nodeinfo" key containing the processed info and a "meta" key with additional data. I'll include a timestamp using datetime.now() and format it.

Finally, I'll return the formatted dictionary. I'll make sure to include the necessary imports and that the function is properly defined. I'll also add the specified warnings to handle any potential issues.

I think that covers all the requirements. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
