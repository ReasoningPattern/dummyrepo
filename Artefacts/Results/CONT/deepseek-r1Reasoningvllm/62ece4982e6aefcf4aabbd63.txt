Alright, I need to write a Python function called is_none_string based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's break down what the function needs to do.

First, the function takes a single argument, val, which can be of any type. The goal is to check two things: whether the type of val is a string, and if the lowercase version of that string is exactly 'none'. 

So, the function should return True only if both conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns False.

Let me think about the steps involved. 

1. **Check if val is a string:** I can use the isinstance function for this. So, I'll check if isinstance(val, str) is True. If not, the function should return False immediately.

2. **Convert the string to lowercase:** Since the comparison is case-insensitive, I'll convert val to lowercase using the lower() method. 

3. **Compare the lowercase string to 'none':** After converting, I'll check if the result equals 'none'. If it does, return True; otherwise, return False.

I should also consider edge cases. For example, if val is not a string at all, like an integer or None, the function should return False. Also, if the string is empty or has extra characters, it shouldn't match.

Putting it all together, the function will first check the type, then the lowercase conversion, and finally the comparison. 

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
