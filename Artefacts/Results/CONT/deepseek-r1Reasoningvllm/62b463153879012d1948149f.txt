Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called _eval_file and it takes two arguments: prefix and file_path. The docstring explains that this function identifies the type of a given file. If the file doesn't match the prefix or it's an XML file, it returns None. 

If the file type is PDF, it should return a dictionary with the key 'component_id' and the value being the file_path. For other file types, it should return a dictionary containing 'component_id', 'file_path', 'ftype' (the file type), and 'file_path' again. Wait, that seems a bit redundant. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps 'ftype' should be a different key. But I'll follow the instructions as given.

Looking at the context, the imports include os, logging, zipfile, packtools. The functions mentioned like select_filenames_by_prefix, match_file_by_prefix, explore_source, etc., suggest that the function might be part of a larger script, possibly dealing with file exploration, logging, and handling zip files.

So, the function needs to determine if the file matches the given prefix. If it doesn't, return None. If it's a PDF, return the component_id and file_path. For other files, include the file type.

I should structure the code to first check if the file matches the prefix. If not, return None. Then, determine the file type. If it's PDF, return the appropriate dictionary. Otherwise, include the file type in the dictionary.

I'll need to use os.path.basename to get the file name and then check the extension. Also, logging might be used to handle exceptions or debug information, but the function doesn't explicitly mention logging, so maybe it's not necessary here unless the code calls it elsewhere.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Check if the file matches the prefix. If not, return None.
2. Get the file name and determine the file type.
3. If it's a PDF, return {'component_id': component_id, 'file_path': file_path}.
4. For other types, return a dictionary with component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
