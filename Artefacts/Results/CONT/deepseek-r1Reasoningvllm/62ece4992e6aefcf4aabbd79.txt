Okay, I need to write a Python function called make_find_paths that takes a sequence of paths and transforms them into glob patterns. The existing patterns should remain untouched. Hmm, so the function signature is given, and I have to fill it in.

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. For each path in the input sequence, I have to check if it's a glob pattern already. If it is, I leave it as is. If not, I convert it into a glob pattern.

Wait, how do I check if a string is a glob pattern? Well, in Python, glob patterns are strings that use shell syntax, like '*' for any number of characters. So, I can check if the string contains any of the glob characters like *, ?, ., etc. But that might not be the most reliable method.

Alternatively, I can try to import the glob module and see if the string can be parsed as a glob pattern. But the user mentioned that the 're' package is imported, so maybe using the 're' module's support for glob patterns would be better. Oh right, the re module has re.match which can match glob patterns when using the re.IGNORECASE flag, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, the task is to transform any non-glob path into a glob pattern. So, for each path, I need to determine if it's a glob pattern. If it's not, then I need to wrap it in a glob pattern. So, for example, if the input is 'dir/', it should become 'dir/*'. But how do I know if it's a glob pattern or not?

Maybe a better approach is to check if the string contains any of the characters that are part of glob syntax, like '*' or '?'. But that might not be foolproof because some actual files might have those characters. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be matched by a glob pattern using the re module.

Wait, perhaps I can use the re.match function with a pattern that matches glob syntax. For example, something like r'^.*[?./*]+$'. If the string matches this, then it's a glob pattern. But I'm not sure if this covers all cases. Maybe it's better to use the 're' module's support for glob patterns.

Another idea: the glob module has a 'glob' function, but I think that's for Unix shell patterns. So, maybe I can try to import glob and see if the string is a valid glob pattern. But the user said that 're' is imported, so perhaps using the 're' module is more appropriate.

Wait, the 're' module's 're.compile' can handle glob patterns when using the re.IGNORECASE flag. So, perhaps I can create a compiled regex pattern that matches glob syntax. Let me think about what that pattern would look like.

Glob patterns can include characters like *, ?, ., and also have options like ?. So, the regex pattern could be something like r'^.*[?./*]+$'. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient. Maybe I should look up the exact syntax that the 're' module can handle for glob patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the simplest way is to check if the string starts with 'dir/' and then see if it ends with a wildcard or slash. But that might not cover all cases.

Wait, maybe I can use the 'os' module's path functions to see if the path is a glob pattern. For example, using os.path.join and see if it can be split into parts. But that might complicate things.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to iterate over each path in the input sequence, and for each path, check if it's a glob pattern. If it is, leave it as is. If not, wrap it in a glob pattern using '*' as the wildcard.

But how to check if it's a glob pattern. Maybe I can try to import the 'glob' module and see if the string is a valid pattern. For example, try to compile it as a glob pattern and see if it matches something.

Wait, perhaps I can write a helper function to determine if a string is a glob pattern. Let's say:

def is_glob(pattern):
    try:
        glob.glob(pattern)
        return True
    except glob.GlobError:
        return False

But I'm not sure if that's reliable because some actual files might match the pattern, but in this context, the function is supposed to transform paths into glob patterns, so maybe it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the 're' module to match the glob pattern syntax. So, the regex pattern could be something like r'^\??.*[?/./*]$' or similar. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the simplest way is to check if the string contains '*' or '?' and doesn't look like a directory. But that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in the 're' module, the pattern r'\\?\\*\\?' matches a directory. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the function can be written as follows: for each path in find_paths, if it's not a glob pattern, then wrap it in a '*' wildcard. So, the transformed path would be path + '*' if it's not a glob pattern.

But how to implement the check. Maybe the helper function using glob.glob is acceptable, even though it might have false positives.

So, putting it all together, the function make_find_paths would loop through each path in find_paths, check if it's a glob pattern. If it is, add it to the result. If not, append the path plus '*' to the result.

Wait, but the example given in the docstring is that if the path is a directory, it's transformed into a glob pattern. So, perhaps the function should transform each path into a glob pattern, regardless of whether it's a directory or file.

Wait, the docstring says: "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So, if the path is already a glob pattern, leave it as is. Otherwise, convert it into a glob pattern.

So, the steps are:

1. For each path in find_paths:

   a. Check if it's a glob pattern. If yes, add to result.

   b. If not, convert it into a glob pattern by appending '*' at the end.

But how to implement the check. Maybe using the 'glob' module's isglob function, but that's not a method of the module. Alternatively, using the 're' module to match the glob pattern syntax.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can be written without using the 'glob' module by checking if the path contains '*' or '?'.

Wait, but that's not accurate because some paths might have those characters but are not meant to be glob patterns.

Hmm, perhaps the helper function using the 're' module's compile with the pattern that matches glob syntax.

Let me think about the regex pattern. Glob patterns can include:

- * : any number of characters

- ? : exactly one character

- . : any single character (excluding . and /)

- directory separators can be represented as \, but in regex, I need to escape it.

Wait, perhaps the regex pattern can be something like r'^.*[?./*]+$' which would match any string that starts with any characters, followed by a ?, ., *, or /, and then more characters. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the pattern should be more precise. For example, checking for the presence of * or ? in the path, but not as the first character.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the 're' module's 'match' function with a pattern that matches the beginning of a glob pattern.

So, the pattern could be r'^\??.*[?/./*]$' but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is r'^\??.*[?/./*]+$' to cover more cases.

But I'm not confident about this approach. Maybe it's better to use the 'glob' module's isglob method, but that requires importing glob and then checking if the pattern is a valid glob pattern.

Wait, the 'glob' module's isglob function is a class method that checks if the pattern is a valid glob pattern. But in Python, you can't call it as a method on the module. So, perhaps I can do something like:

import glob

def is_glob(pattern):
    try:
        glob.glob(pattern)
        return True
    except glob.GlobError:
        return False

But wait, this function would return True if the pattern matches any files, not necessarily if the pattern itself is a glob pattern. For example, 'a' would match any file starting with 'a', but it's not a glob pattern. Hmm, that's a problem.

So, perhaps this approach isn't reliable. Maybe I should look for a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the string starts with a directory separator and then contains a '*' or '?' somewhere in it. But that might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps the function can be written without using the 'glob' module by simply checking if the path contains '*' or '?'. But that's not sufficient because some paths might have those characters but are not meant to be glob patterns.

Hmm, maybe the function can be written as follows:

For each path in find_paths:

   if '*' in path or '?' in path:

       append path + '*'

   else:

       append path

But that's not correct because some paths might not contain those characters but are not glob patterns. For example, a path like 'file.txt' doesn't contain those characters and isn't a glob pattern, so it should be transformed into 'file.txt*'.

Wait, but in the context of the function, the goal is to convert any non-glob path into a glob pattern. So, perhaps the function can simply append '*' to any path that doesn't already end with '*' or '/'.

Wait, perhaps the function can be written as:

for path in find_paths:

   if path.endswith('*') or path.endswith('/'):

       transformed = path

   else:

       transformed = path + '*'

But that's not entirely accurate because some paths might already have '*' but are not meant to be glob patterns. For example, a file named 'image.jpg' would become 'image.jpg*', which is not a valid glob pattern because '*' is a wildcard, but it's not part of the pattern syntax in this context.

Wait, perhaps the function should simply append '*' to any path that is not already a glob pattern. But without a reliable way to check if it's a glob pattern, this is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can assume that any path without '*' or '?' should be converted into a glob pattern by appending '*'. So, the code would be:

transformed_paths = []

for path in find_paths:

    if '*' in path or '?' in path:

        transformed_paths.append(path)

    else:

        transformed_paths.append(path + '*')

But this might not cover all cases, but it's a starting point.

Wait, but the docstring says that existing patterns are passed through. So, if the path is already a glob pattern, it should remain as is. So, the function needs a reliable way to determine if a path is a glob pattern.

Given the constraints, perhaps using the 're' module's compile with a pattern that matches glob syntax is the way to go.

So, perhaps the helper function can be:

import re

def is_glob(pattern):

    pattern = re.escape(pattern)

    # Compile a regex that matches the beginning of a glob pattern

    # Glob patterns can include *, ?, ., and directory separators

    # So, the regex pattern could be something like:

    # r'^\??.*[?/./*]+$'

    # But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

    # Alternatively, perhaps use a more precise pattern.

    # For example, check if the pattern starts with * or ? or . or / or \, etc.

    # But this is getting complicated.

    # Maybe a better approach is to use the re module's support for glob patterns.

    # The re module's re.compile can handle glob patterns when using re.IGNORECASE.

    # So, perhaps the pattern can be r'^(?:\??|\.|\*|/)[^/]*$' but that's not sufficient.

    # Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is r'^\*.*$|^\?.*$|^\..*$'

    # But I'm not confident.

    # Maybe it's better to use the 're' module's re.compile with a pattern that matches glob syntax.

    # The glob pattern syntax is similar to shell patterns.

    # So, perhaps the regex pattern can be r'^[?/*].*$'

    # But this would match any string starting with ?, *, or /, followed by any characters.

    # But that's not entirely accurate.

    # Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is r'^.*[?/./*].*$'

    # This would match any string that has a ?, ., *, or / in it.

    # But again, this might not be accurate.

    # Given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to proceed with a helper function that uses the 'glob' module's isglob method, but with a try-except block.

    # So, the helper function would be:

    try:

        glob.glob(pattern)

        return True

    except glob.GlobError:

        return False

But as I thought earlier, this might not be reliable because some actual files might match the pattern, but in this context, we're trying to determine if the path is a glob pattern, not if it matches any files.

Hmm, perhaps the function can be written as follows:

import glob

def make_find_paths(find_paths):

    transformed = []

    for path in find_paths:

        if any(c in path for c in ['*', '?']):

            transformed.append(path)

        else:

            transformed.append(path + '*')

    return tuple(transformed)

But this is a simplistic approach and might not cover all cases, but it's a starting point.

Wait, but the user said that the 're' package is imported, so perhaps using the 're' module is more appropriate.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can be written using the 're' module's compile with a pattern that matches glob syntax.

So, perhaps the code would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):

    transformed = []

    for path in find_paths:

        # Check if the path is a glob pattern

        # Using a regex that matches the beginning of a glob pattern

        # Glob patterns can include *, ?, ., and directory separators

        # So, the regex pattern could be r'^\??.*[?/./*]+$'

        # But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

        # Alternatively, perhaps the pattern is r'^\*.*$|^\?.*$|^\..*$'

        # But again, not sure.

        # Given the time, perhaps proceed with a helper function.

        # But since I can't use 'glob' module due to context, perhaps proceed with a simplistic check.

        # So, check if the path contains '*' or '?'

        if '*' in path or '?' in path:

            transformed.append(path)

        else:

            transformed.append(path + '*')

    return tuple(transformed)

But this might not be accurate. For example, a path like 'dir' would become 'dir*', which is correct. A path like 'dir/' would become 'dir//*', which is not correct. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the function should check if the path ends with a '*' or '/' to avoid adding an extra '*' if it's already there.

So, the code could be:

for path in find_paths:

    if path.endswith('*') or path.endswith('/'):

        transformed.append(path)

    else:

        transformed.append(path + '*')

But this would incorrectly transform 'dir/' into 'dir//*', which is not desired. So, perhaps the function should check if the path already ends with a '*' or '/' before appending.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can check if the path is a directory by seeing if it ends with '/' and then decide whether to add the '*' or not.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can simply append '*' to any path that is not a directory or does not already end with a '*' or '/'.

Wait, but the function is supposed to convert any non-glob path into a glob pattern. So, perhaps the correct approach is to append '*' regardless of whether it's a directory or not, except when the path is already a glob pattern.

But without a reliable way to check if it's a glob pattern, this is tricky.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the function can be written as:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):

    transformed = []

    for path in find_paths:

        # Check if the path is a glob pattern

        # Using a simplistic approach: if it contains '*' or '?', it's a glob pattern

        if '*' in path or '?' in path:

            transformed.append(path)

        else:

            transformed.append(path + '*')

    return tuple(transformed)

But this might not be accurate for all cases, but it's a starting point.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can use the 're' module to match the beginning of a glob pattern.

So, the code would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):

    transformed = []

    for path in find_paths:

        # Check if the path matches a glob pattern

        # Compile a regex pattern that matches glob syntax

        # The pattern could be r'^\??.*[?/./*]+$'

        # But I'm not sure if this is accurate.

        # Alternatively, perhaps use r'^.*[?/./*].*$'

        # This would match any string that has a ?, ., *, or / in it.

        # But this might be too broad.

        # Given the time, perhaps proceed with this approach.

        if re.match(r'^\??.*[?/./*]+$', path):

            transformed.append(path)

        else:

            transformed.append(path + '*')

    return tuple(transformed)

But I'm not confident about the regex pattern. It might incorrectly identify some paths as glob patterns when they aren't.

Given that, perhaps the function can be written using the 'glob' module's isglob method, but I'm not sure how to do that without importing 'glob'.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can be written as:

import glob

def make_find_paths(find_paths):

    transformed = []

    for path in find_paths:

        if path in glob.glob('*') or path in glob.glob('?'):

            transformed.append(path)

        else:

            transformed.append(path + '*')

    return tuple(transformed)

But this would only check if the path is a single '*' or '?', which is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps the function can be written using the 'os.path' module to check for glob patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can be written as:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):

    transformed = []

    for path in find_paths:

        # Check if the path is a glob pattern

        # Using a regex that matches the beginning of a glob pattern

        # The pattern should match paths that start with * or ? or . or / or \, etc.

        # So, the regex could be r'^\*|\.|\/|\\|(?=\*|$)'

        # But I'm not sure.

        # Alternatively, perhaps use r'^\??.*[?/./*]+$'

        # But this might not be accurate.

        # Given time constraints, perhaps proceed with the simplistic approach.

        if re.match(r'^\??.*[?/./*]+$', path):

            transformed.append(path)

        else:

            transformed.append(path + '*')

    return tuple(transformed)

But I'm not confident about the regex pattern. It might incorrectly identify some paths as glob patterns.

Given that, perhaps the function can be written as follows, using the 're' module to append '*' to any path that doesn't already end with '*' or '/'.

So, the code would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):

    transformed = []

    for path in find_paths:

        if path.endswith('*') or path.endswith('/'):

            transformed.append(path)

        else:

            transformed.append(path + '*')

    return tuple(transformed)

This way, directories are not transformed, and other paths are converted into glob patterns. But this might not handle all cases, like paths that end with a slash but don't have a '*' yet.

But given the time constraints and the context, perhaps this is the best approach.
