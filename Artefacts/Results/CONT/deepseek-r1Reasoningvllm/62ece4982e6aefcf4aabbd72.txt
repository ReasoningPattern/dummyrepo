Okay, I need to write a Python function called unquote that removes quotes from a given name using a regular expression. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function signature is given: def unquote(name):. So I just need to fill in the body.

The docstring explains that it removes quotes using a regex. The argument is 'name', and it returns the name after removal. So the main task is to process the input string and remove any quotes.

I remember that in Python, the re module can be used for regular expressions. So I should import re, but the context already says it's imported, so I don't need to worry about that.

What kind of quotes are we dealing with? Probably both single and double quotes. So the regex should match both. Using r'"' will make it a raw string, which is good for readability.

I think the pattern should be r"'?" to match either quote. But wait, in regex, ? is a quantifier, so I need to escape it with a backslash. So the correct pattern is r"['"]".

Wait, actually, in a raw string, the backslash is just a backslash, so r"['']" will match either a single or double quote.

So the plan is to use re.sub to replace all occurrences of these quotes with an empty string.

Putting it all together, the function will import re (though it's already imported), then return re.sub with the pattern and an empty string.

So the code inside the function is return re.sub(r"['\"]", "", name).

Let me double-check: if name is "Hello", it becomes "Hello". If it's "Hello'", it becomes "Hello". Similarly for double quotes. That makes sense.

I think that's all. The function should handle any combination of quotes correctly.
