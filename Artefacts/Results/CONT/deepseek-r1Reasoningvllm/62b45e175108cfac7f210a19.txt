Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_fixity and takes two parameters: self and fixity, along with manifest_files. 

First, I'll start by looking at the function signature. It's a method, so it should be indented under a class. The parameters are self, fixity, and manifest_files. 

The docstring explains that this function validates the fixity block in an inventory. It checks that only files listed in the manifest are referenced and returns an error if there's a problem. So, the function needs to compare the fixity block against the manifest_files.

I remember that in Python, the error() method can be used to raise an error, typically with a message. So, I'll need to check each entry in the fixity block. For each key-value pair, the value should be in manifest_files. If not, I'll raise an error with a message indicating which file is invalid.

I'll start by iterating over each item in fixity. For each item, I'll get the file_path from fixity[item]. Then, I'll check if file_path is in manifest_files. If it's not, I'll format an error message and call self.error() with that message.

I should also make sure that the code is properly indented. Since it's a method, the code should be indented under the class. The function will have a colon at the end, and the body will be indented further.

Putting it all together, I'll write a loop that goes through each key in fixity. For each key, I'll check if the corresponding value is in manifest_files. If any value isn't found, I'll raise an error with a descriptive message.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
