Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to generate the Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _create_in_regex and it's supposed to return a re.Pattern object. 

Looking at the context, I see that the class imports 'typing' and 're'. The function is within a class, and there are several other methods listed, but I don't have their code, so I need to focus on what's given.

The docstring says that this function creates the in-style parameter regular expression. So, I need to create a regular expression pattern that matches the 'in' keyword as used in SQLAlchemy's bind parameters.

In SQLAlchemy, when using an in-style parameter, the parameter name is prefixed with 'in='. So the regular expression should match 'in=' followed by a space and a variable name. The variable name can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores, and it should be followed by a space or the end of the string.

I'll start by importing the re module if it's not already imported, but since it's listed in the context, I don't need to add it. 

Next, I'll define the function. It should return a re.Pattern object. The pattern should match 'in=' followed by optional whitespace, then a word character string. So the regex pattern would be r'in=\s*[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*'.

Putting it all together, the function will compile this pattern using re.compile and return it.

I should make sure that the function returns the compiled pattern, so the code will be something like:

return re.compile(r'in=\s*[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*')

I don't see any other requirements, so this should be the correct implementation.
