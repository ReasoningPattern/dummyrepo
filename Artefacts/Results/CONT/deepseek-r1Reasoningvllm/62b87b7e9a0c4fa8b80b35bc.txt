Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called _update_context and takes self and context as parameters. From the docstring, it looks like this function is meant to update a context object with properties from a graph. The context is a dictionary that gets updated, appending error indices under the "error" key. 

The example given shows that for a graph with fields "E", "t", and "error_E_low", the error is stored as {"x_low": {"index": 2}}. So, the function needs to iterate over each field in the graph and check if there's an error associated with it. If there is, it should add this error to the context under "error", with the key being the coordinate name (like "x", "y", or "z") and the value being a dictionary containing the "index".

I notice that the function uses self to access instance variables. The class has methods like _get_err_indices and _parse_error_names, which probably handle determining the coordinate names and parsing error names. So, the _update_context function should call these methods to get the necessary coordinate names.

The function should loop through each field in field_names. For each field, it should check if there's an error by looking into self._parsed_error_names. If the error exists, it should get the coordinate name using self._get_err_indices and then append the index to the corresponding key in the "error" dictionary within the context.

I should also make sure that existing values in the context's value and its subcontexts are not removed. That means appending to any existing lists or nested dictionaries under "error".

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Iterate over each field in self.field_names.
2. For each field, check if an error exists in self._parsed_error_names.
3. If an error exists, determine the coordinate name using self._get_err_indices.
4. Append the index to the corresponding key in the "error" dictionary in the context.

I need to make sure that the keys in the error dictionary are correctly formed, using the coordinate name as the key and a dictionary with "index" as the value.

Let me structure the code step by step. First, loop through each field. Then, check for the presence of the error. If found, get the coordinate name and append the index. Finally, return the updated context.

I should also ensure that the function correctly handles cases where no errors are present by not modifying the context unnecessarily.

Testing the code with the example provided should result in the context's "error" key containing the appropriate nested dictionaries. This should integrate well with the class's existing methods and structure.
