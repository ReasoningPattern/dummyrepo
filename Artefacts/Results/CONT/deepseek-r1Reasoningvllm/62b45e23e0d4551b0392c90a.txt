Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_version_inventories and takes version_dirs as an argument. 

First, I'll start by importing the necessary modules. From the context, I see that the imports include json, re, namaste, pyfs, fs, digest. So I'll list those as the import statement.

Next, the function signature is given, so I'll write that out. The function doesn't return anything, so I'll set it to return None.

Looking at the docstring, it mentions that each version should have an inventory up to that point. Also, it needs to record content digests different from the root inventory for validation. 

I'll think about what this function needs to do. It probably needs to validate each version's inventory against the root. So, I'll loop through each version directory in version_dirs.

For each version, I'll check if the inventory exists. If not, it's an error. Then, I'll compare the current inventory's digest with the root's. If they don't match, log an error.

I'll also need to check if the current inventory includes all the necessary files from the root. Using the obj_fs, I can check the existence of each file in the root. If any are missing, log that as an error.

After checking all versions, if everything's fine, set the status to 'success'.

I'll structure the code with these steps, making sure to handle each version correctly and log any issues encountered.
