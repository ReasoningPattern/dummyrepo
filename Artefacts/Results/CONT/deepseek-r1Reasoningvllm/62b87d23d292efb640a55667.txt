Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called register_vcs_handler, and it's supposed to create a decorator that marks a method as a handler for a VCS (Version Control System). 

First, I'll look at the function signature: it takes two arguments, vcs and method. The docstring explains that this is a decorator to mark a method as the handler of an object. So, I need to create a decorator that wraps the method and assigns it to the vcs object.

I remember that decorators can return objects that have certain attributes or methods. In this case, the decorator should probably add an attribute to the vcs object, like a handler, which points to the method. 

So, the register_vcs_handler function should return a decorator. That decorator will take the method as an argument and then assign it to the vcs's handler attribute. 

Putting it all together, the decorator inside register_vcs_handler will look like this: it takes the method, assigns vcs.handler = method, and then returns the method back so that it can be used as a decorator.

I should make sure the code is clean and follows standard practices. So, the code will define the decorator function inside register_vcs_handler, assign the handler attribute, and return the method.

I think that's all. The code should be straightforward without any extra imports since the context doesn't mention any required packages beyond what's within the file.
