Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called deprecated and it's supposed to return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods. 

First, I'll look at the function signature provided: def deprecated(message):. This means the function takes one argument, message, and returns something. Since it's a decorator factory, it should return a decorator that can be applied to other functions.

I remember that in Python, a decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function. So, the deprecated function needs to return a decorator that will handle the deprecation warning.

Looking at the context, there are imports like warnings, sys, functools, tracemalloc, asyncio. I recall that functools is used for decorator utilities, and the decorator could use the warnings module to issue deprecation messages.

The docstring says the function should return a decorator for deprecating functions and methods. So, the decorator will probably wrap the target function and issue a warning when it's called.

I think the structure would be something like this: the deprecated function takes the message, then returns a decorator that takes the function to be deprecated. Inside the decorator, before calling the function, it issues a warning using warnings.warn or similar, appending the message.

Wait, but the context mentions functions like deprecation_warn and unclosed_resource_warn. Oh, right, the user provided some context with functions like deprecation_warn and unclosed_resource_warn. So perhaps the deprecated function should use these existing functions.

So, the deprecated decorator will wrap the target function. When the target function is called, the decorator will call deprecation_warn with the message and the stack level. It should also mark the function as deprecated and maybe issue a deprecation notice.

Putting it all together, the code should define the deprecated function, which returns a decorator. The decorator will, upon being called, issue a warning and then execute the target function.

I should also consider that the decorator might need to update the function's __name__ or __doc__ to indicate it's deprecated, but that might be optional unless specified.

So, the code will look like this: define deprecated(message), which returns a lambda or another function that takes the function to wrap. Inside that, when the wrapped function is called, it issues a warning and then calls the original function.

I think that's the basic structure. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to include the necessary parts without any extra explanations.
