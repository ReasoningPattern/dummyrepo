Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_logical_path_map and it takes two arguments: inventory and version. The docstring says it returns the file paths of the states in the inventory as a dictionary. 

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. It probably processes the inventory and version to map each logical path to its corresponding file path. But without more context, I'll assume that the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a version and the value is the path.

Looking at the example provided, the function returns a dictionary like {'v1.0': '/path/to/file.xml', ...}. So the keys are versions and the values are file paths.

Now, considering the parameters, inventory is a list of Inventory objects. Each Inventory object likely has attributes like path and version. So the function needs to iterate over each Inventory in the inventory list, extract the version and path, and build the dictionary.

I should also consider that the version might be in a different format, but since the example uses 'v1.0', I'll assume the version is a string starting with 'v'. So I'll process each version by removing the 'v' prefix.

Putting it all together, the function will loop through each inventory item, extract the version and path, format the version by removing 'v', and add it to the dictionary with the path as the value.

I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to return the dictionary after processing all inventory items.
