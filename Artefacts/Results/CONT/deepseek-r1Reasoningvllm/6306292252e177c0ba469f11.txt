Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called format_dt and it takes a parameter dt. The docstring says it uses ensure_timezone to format the time of dt and returns the time.

First, I should import the ensure_timezone function. Since it's imported within the file and not specified here, I'll assume it's from a third-party library like pytz. So I'll import it as from pytz import ensure_timezone.

Next, the function body. It's straightforward: call ensure_timezone with dt as the argument and return the result. So the code inside the function will be return ensure_timezone(dt).

Putting it all together, I'll write the import statement at the top and then define the function with the return statement. I'll make sure to follow proper syntax and indentation.
