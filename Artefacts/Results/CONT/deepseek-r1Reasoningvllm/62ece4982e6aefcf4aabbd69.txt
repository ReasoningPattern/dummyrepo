Okay, I need to write a Python function called _replace_register based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me see what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it should replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]. 

Hmm, so the function takes three arguments: flow_params, which is a list, register_number, and register_value, which are integers. The idea is to replace the value at one register with the value from another and then remove the second register from the list.

First, I should check if both register numbers are within the valid range of indices in flow_params. If not, maybe raise an IndexError. That makes sense because accessing an index that doesn't exist would cause an error.

Next, I'll get the value from register_value. Since we're going to delete that register, I should store its value before removing it. So, value = flow_params.pop(register_value). The pop method removes the element at the given index and returns it. That handles both getting the value and deleting the register.

Then, I need to replace the value at register_number with this stored value. So, flow_params[register_number] = value.

I should also consider the case where register_number and register_value are the same. In that case, trying to replace and delete would cause issues because we'd be trying to delete the same register we're replacing. So, I should add a condition to check if they are the same and handle that. Maybe raise a ValueError since it's an invalid operation.

Putting it all together, the function should first check if either register is out of bounds. If so, raise IndexError. Then, if they're the same, raise ValueError. Otherwise, proceed to get the value, replace, and delete.

I should write the code step by step, making sure to handle all edge cases. Testing with different scenarios would help, but since I'm just writing the code, I'll structure it accordingly.

So, the code will start by checking the indices, then handle the same register case, and finally perform the pop and assignment. That should cover everything the docstring requires.
