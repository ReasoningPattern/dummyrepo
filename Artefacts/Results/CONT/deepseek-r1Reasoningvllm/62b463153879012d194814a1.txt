Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called add_rendition, and it takes self, lang, and file_path as parameters. The docstring explains that this function assigns the filepath from filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions.

First, I should look at the context provided. The class has attributes like _renditions, which is a list of Rendition objects. Each Rendition has a lang attribute and a file_path attribute. So, the goal is to add a new Rendition to the _renditions list using the provided lang and file_path.

I remember that in Python, to add an element to a list, we use the append() method. So, I can create a new Rendition instance and append it to _renditions. The Rendition's __init__ method probably takes lang and file_path as parameters, so I can instantiate it with those.

Putting it together, the function will create a Rendition object with the given lang and file_path, then append it to self._renditions. I should make sure to include a docstring that explains what the function does, as per the given docstring.

I also need to ensure that the function is correctly indented and follows Python syntax. Since the function is part of a class, it should be a method, hence the leading colon and indentation.

So, the code will look like this: create a new Rendition instance inside the function, then append it to self._renditions. The docstring will briefly describe the function's purpose.
