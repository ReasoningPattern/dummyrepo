Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_deprecated_args and it's part of a class. The docstring says it returns a dictionary with options that deprecate other options. So, the function should collect deprecated arguments from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs().

First, I'll start by defining the function with the correct signature. It's an instance method, so it takes self as the first parameter. The function doesn't need any other parameters since it's just collecting data from the spec_helper.

Next, I'll think about how to iterate over the option specs. The method iterate_option_specs() probably yields or returns objects that represent each option. For each of these, I need to check if they are deprecated. So, I'll loop through each spec in self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs().

For each spec, I'll check if it's a deprecated option. Assuming there's a method or attribute like is_DEPRECATED in the OptionSpec class, I can use a generator expression to filter these out. Then, I'll collect them into a dictionary where the keys might be the option names or something similar.

I should handle cases where there are no deprecated options, so returning an empty dict is safe. Also, I'll make sure to use the correct class methods, like self.get_env_option(name) to retrieve the option's name if needed.

Putting it all together, the function will iterate, collect deprecated options, and return them as a dictionary. I'll make sure the code is clean and follows standard Python practices without any unnecessary explanations.
