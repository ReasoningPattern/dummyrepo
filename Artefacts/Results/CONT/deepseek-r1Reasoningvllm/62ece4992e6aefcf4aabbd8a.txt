Okay, I need to write a Python function called load_configurations based on the given signature and docstring. Let's see what the function is supposed to do.

The function takes three arguments: config_filenames, which is a sequence of filenames; overrides, which is optional and defaults to None; and resolve_env, which is a boolean. The docstring says that the function loads and validates each configuration file, returns a tuple with a dict of filenames to parsed configs and a sequence of LogRecord instances for any errors.

First, I'll need to import the logging module since it's mentioned in the context. So I'll add 'import logging' at the top.

Next, the function needs to process each config_filename. For each file, I'll try to read it. If reading fails due to permissions or parsing errors, I should log an error. Otherwise, parse the config and store it in the dictionary.

I'll start by initializing two variables: a results dictionary and an errors list to collect the LogRecord instances.

Loop through each filename in config_filenames. For each, open and read the file. If there's an exception during opening or reading, log an error using logging.error, create a LogRecord instance, and append it to the errors list.

If reading is successful, parse the configuration. Then, check if there are any errors in the parsed configuration. If there are, log them and append the LogRecord to errors.

After processing all files, return the results and errors as a tuple.

Wait, how do I create a LogRecord? I think I need to import it from the logging module or another module, but since it's not provided, I'll assume it's available as logging.LogRecord. So I'll just create instances like logging.LogRecord(...) with the necessary fields.

I should handle exceptions properly. Maybe wrap each file reading and parsing in a try-except block. For each file, try to open it, read it, parse it, and handle any exceptions, logging them if they occur.

Also, need to make sure that the function returns a tuple of the results dict and the errors list. So the return statement will be return results, errors.

Putting it all together, the function will loop through each filename, handle each case, collect the results and errors, and return them at the end.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
