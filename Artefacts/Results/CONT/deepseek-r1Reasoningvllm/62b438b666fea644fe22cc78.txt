Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called parse_arguments and it takes *arguments as a parameter. The docstring explains that this function parses command-line arguments and returns an ArgumentParser instance.

First, I remember that in Python, to handle command-line arguments, we typically use the argparse module. So I'll need to import argparse.

The function signature is provided, so I'll start by writing the function definition. It should import argparse inside the function to avoid issues with multiple imports. That way, if argparse is already imported elsewhere, it won't cause problems.

Inside the function, I'll create a parser object using argparse.ArgumentParser(). Then, I'll return this parser. The docstring should be updated to reflect this change, but since the user didn't mention modifying the docstring, I'll leave it as is.

Wait, the user said not to include any explanation or markdown, just the code. So I'll make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function, import argparse inside it, create the parser, and return it. That should fulfill the requirement.
