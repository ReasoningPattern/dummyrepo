Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called normalized and it's part of a class. The docstring says it's supposed to normalize all units of time to integers. 

First, I should look at the context provided. The class has various attributes like day, microseconds, days, etc., and methods like __add__, __abs__, and others. It also imports datetime, operator, math, calendar, warnings, six. 

I remember that in Python, when you want to convert a time object into an integer representation, a common approach is to use the total seconds. So, I should create a method that calculates the total seconds from the current time attributes.

I'll start by defining the normalized method. Inside, I'll calculate the total seconds by adding up each component multiplied by their respective units. For example, years converted to seconds, months treated as years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Then, I'll take the floor of that sum to ensure it's an integer.

I should also consider any potential issues, like leap years or varying month lengths, but since the problem is about normalization, using total seconds should suffice.

Finally, I'll return the total_seconds as an integer. I'll make sure to use the self. prefix for all class attributes to access them correctly.

Putting it all together, the code should look like this: calculate the sum of each time component in seconds, take the floor, and return it as an integer.
