Okay, I need to write a Python function called files_list that returns the files in a given path. The user provided a function signature and a docstring, so I should make sure my code matches that exactly.

First, I'll look at the context they provided. They mentioned importing packages like logging, os, zipfile, tempfile, shutil, and re. But since the function is supposed to return files, I think os is the most relevant here. Maybe I'll use os.listdir or os.scandir for listing files.

Wait, os.listdir returns all entries, including directories, while os.scandir is better because it gives more information like names, sizes, and types. Using scandir might be more efficient, especially if the path is a directory.

So, I'll import os and use os.scandir. Then, I'll loop through each entry in the directory. For each entry, I'll check if it's a file using the is_file() method. If it is, I'll add it to a list.

I should also make sure to handle cases where the path doesn't exist. But the function's docstring says "given path," so maybe it's assumed to be valid. However, adding a check might make it more robust. But the user didn't specify handling errors, so I'll proceed without it unless told otherwise.

Putting it all together, I'll initialize an empty list, loop through each item in the directory, check if it's a file, and append the name to the list if it is. Then, return the list.

I should write the code accordingly, making sure to import os and use the scandir method. Also, I'll format the code in Python markdown as the user requested.
