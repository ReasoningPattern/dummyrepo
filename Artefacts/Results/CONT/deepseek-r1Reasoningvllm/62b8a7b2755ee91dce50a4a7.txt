Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called default_tzinfo, and it takes two parameters: dt and tzinfo. The docstring explains that this function sets the tzinfo parameter on naive datetimes only. So, if dt is naive, it should assign the given tzinfo to it, making it aware. Otherwise, it should leave dt as it is.

Looking at the doctest examples, when a naive datetime is parsed without a timezone, default_tzinfo adds the default tzinfo. But when a datetime with an explicit timezone is provided, it leaves it unchanged.

So, the function needs to check if dt is naive. In Python, a naive datetime doesn't have a tzinfo attribute. So, I can check if hasattr(dt, 'tzinfo') is False. If it is, then I create a new datetime with the tzinfo. If not, return dt as is.

Wait, but in the doctest, when the datetime is parsed with '2014-01-01 12:30 UTC', it's treated as naive, so it gets the dflt_tz. But when it's parsed with no timezone, it's naive, so the function adds the default tzinfo. That makes sense.

So, the function should return a new datetime with tzinfo if dt is naive. Otherwise, return dt.

Now, how to implement this. I can write:

if dt.tzinfo is None:
    return dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
else:
    return dt

Wait, but using replace might not be the best approach because it creates a new instance. Alternatively, I can create a new datetime with the same time but the given tzinfo.

But I need to ensure that if dt is naive, it becomes aware. So, in code:

if hasattr(dt, 'tzinfo') and dt.tzinfo is None:
    return dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
else:
    return dt

Wait, but in Python, the 'hasattr' check might not be necessary because if dt is naive, it doesn't have tzinfo. So, perhaps a simpler way is to check if dt is naive.

Alternatively, I can check if dt.tzinfo is None, but that might not cover all cases if tzinfo is an empty tzinfo object or something. But in most cases, for naive datetimes, tzinfo is None.

So, the code could be:

def default_tzinfo(dt, tzinfo):
    if dt.tzinfo is None:
        return dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
    else:
        return dt

But wait, in the doctest, when the datetime is parsed with '2014-01-01 12:30', which is naive, it gets the dflt_tz. So, this code should handle that.

Testing this, if dt is naive, it replaces the tzinfo, else returns dt. That should work.

I think that's the correct approach. So, the function is straightforward: check if dt is naive and if so, set the given tzinfo.
