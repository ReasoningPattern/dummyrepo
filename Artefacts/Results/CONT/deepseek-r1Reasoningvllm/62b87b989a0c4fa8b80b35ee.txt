Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called reset, and it's part of a class. The docstring explains that when reset is called, the current context is set to an empty dict, and the bins are reinitialized either with an initial_value or by calling make_bins().

First, I'll look at the parameters. The function takes self, which is standard for a method. The docstring mentions that the bins are reinitialized with the initial_value or make_bins(). So, I should check if initial_value is provided.

I'll start by checking if initial_value is not None. If it is, then I'll set self._initial_value to initial_value and call self._hist with it. If initial_value is None, I'll call self._make_bins() to initialize the bins.

Next, I need to clear the current context. The docstring says it's set to an empty dict, so I'll set self._cur_context to an empty dictionary.

Putting it all together, the function will have an if-else structure. I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle both cases properly.
