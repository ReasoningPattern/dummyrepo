Okay, I need to write a Python function called xml_children_as_dict that takes an XML node and returns a dictionary where the keys are the tag names and the values are the child nodes. The docstring explains that this function should turn the children of an XML node into a dictionary, keyed by their tag name.

First, I should think about how XML nodes work in Python. Since the context mentions lxml is imported, I can assume that the node is an lxml element object. lxml provides methods like tag and children, which will be useful here.

So, the function will iterate over each child element of the given node. For each child, I need to extract its tag name and the node itself. Then, I'll create a dictionary where each tag name is a key pointing to its corresponding node.

I should start by initializing an empty dictionary. Then, loop through each child in node.children. For each child, get the tag using child.tag. Then, add an entry to the dictionary with tag as the key and child as the value.

Wait, but what if two children have the same tag name? In that case, the latter child will overwrite the former in the dictionary, which might not be intended. However, the problem statement doesn't specify handling such cases, so I'll proceed under the assumption that each tag is unique.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: initialize an empty dict, loop through each child, add to the dict, and return it.

I should also make sure to import any necessary modules, but the context says the function is within a file where typing is imported, so I don't need to worry about that here.

So the code will be straightforward. I'll write the function, use a dictionary comprehension or a loop to populate the dict, and return it.

Testing the function: If node has children with tags 'a', 'b', and 'c', the function should return a dict with keys 'a', 'b', 'c' and values as the respective child nodes.

I think that's all. The code should be concise and fit the requirements.
