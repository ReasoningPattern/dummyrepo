Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what's required.

The function is called validate_hierarchy, and it's part of a class. The parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings, all with default values. The docstring explains that this function validates the storage root hierarchy and returns the number of checked objects and the number that are valid.

Looking at the context provided, I see that the class has several methods related to file system operations, validation, and logging. It also uses some imported packages like logging, json, re, etc.

I should structure the code to include these imports. Since the function is part of a class, I'll define it inside the class. The function needs to perform validation checks, so I'll probably use some of the existing methods like check_root_structure and validate_extensions_dir.

I'll initialize some logging to handle warnings and errors. If show_warnings is True, I'll log a warning for each invalid object. For each warning, I'll increment the num_traversal_errors and update the num_objects and good_objects counts.

I'll also check the digests if check_digests is True. If any digest fails, I'll log an error and increment the error count.

Finally, the function will return the counts as a dictionary. I'll make sure to handle cases where validate_objects is False by skipping object checks.

I'll structure the code with proper docstring, imports, and method definitions. I'll also ensure that all necessary variables like self.log, self.num_traversal_errors, etc., are accessible within the method.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function, include the logging statements, and return the appropriate values.
