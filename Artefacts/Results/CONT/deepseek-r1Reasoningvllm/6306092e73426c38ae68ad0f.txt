Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is called get_nested_custom_and_control_args and takes a single parameter args, which is a list of collected arguments. The function is supposed to split these arguments into three categories: control_args, nested_args, and custom_args. The return value should be a tuple of two dictionaries.

Looking at the docstring, I see that controls arguments are those that control the IR behavior and are not put into the spec yml file. Nested arguments are used by Ansible playbooks and are included in the spec yml. Custom arguments are for Ansible variables and replace the nested usage.

I need to figure out how to categorize the arguments. But the problem is that the code context doesn't provide specific logic for how to split these arguments. Without knowing the criteria for each category, it's impossible to write the actual splitting logic.

I should inform the user that the function can't be implemented without additional information on how to determine which arguments belong to each category. I'll ask them to provide the logic or criteria for classifying the arguments into control, nested, and custom.

Additionally, I'll list some common scenarios where such a function is used. For example, in Ansible playbooks, certain arguments might control the flow (like when to apply a module) and shouldn't be in the spec, while others specify what to include and should be in the spec. Custom arguments might come from environment variables or other sources and should be handled separately.

I'll also mention that without knowing the specific rules for each category, the code can't be completed accurately. It's important to ensure that the classification logic aligns with the intended behavior of the function.

In summary, I'll explain that the function requires specific criteria to split the arguments and offer to help if those criteria are provided.
