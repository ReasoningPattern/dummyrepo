Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called on, and it's a method in a class. The docstring says it's a decorator function to add a new handler to a "hook" in the registry.

First, I'll start by writing the method definition. It's an instance method, so it starts with def on(self, hook):. The docstring is already provided, so I'll include that.

Next, the method needs to return a decorator. Decorators are functions that take another function as an argument and return a new function. So inside on, I'll define a decorator function.

The decorator should add the handler to the registry. I'll assume the registry is an instance variable, so I'll assign self.registry. Then, I'll check if the registry exists; if not, I'll create it using type().

The decorator function will take a handler as an argument. It will add this handler to the registry under the given hook. So I'll use setattr to add the handler to the registry with the key as the hook.

Finally, I'll return the decorator function. I'll make sure the code is clean and follows best practices, using proper indentation and avoiding any unnecessary imports since they're already listed.

Putting it all together, the code should look like this. I'll make sure it's concise and fits within the class structure provided.
