Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called from_raw_values, and it's supposed to create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark strings. 

First, I'll start by looking at the function signature. It takes two parameters: cls, which is the class to instantiate, and values, which is a list of strings. The docstring explains that this function creates a Bookmarks object from these raw values.

I remember that in Python, when you want to create an instance of a class, you typically call the class as a function. So, the first line inside the function should be something like return cls(...). But what arguments do I need to pass?

The values parameter is a list, so I can pass it directly to the constructor. But wait, sometimes classes expect individual arguments rather than a single list. I should check the __init__ method of the Bookmarks class. Since I don't have that code, I'll assume that it can accept a single list argument.

So, the function can simply return cls(values). That should create the instance with the given values.

I should also consider if there are any additional parameters or keyword arguments needed in the constructor. But since the function signature only includes values, I'll stick with that.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: it returns the class instantiated with the values list. That should fulfill the requirement as per the docstring.
