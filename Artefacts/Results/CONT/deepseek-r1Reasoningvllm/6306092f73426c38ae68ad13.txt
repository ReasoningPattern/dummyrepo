Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what's required.

The function is called ansible_playbook and takes several parameters. The first three are mandatory: ir_workspace, ir_plugin, and playbook_path. Then there are optional parameters: verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args.

Looking at the docstring, it explains what each parameter does. The function wraps the 'ansible-playbook' CLI, so it's likely used to run Ansible playbooks from a Python script.

I notice that in the context, the import includes 'infrared' and 'ansible'. The function _run_playbook is called within the same file, which probably handles the actual CLI execution.

I should import the necessary modules. Since we're using tempfile, I'll import that. Also, os and subprocess are probably needed to run the CLI.

The function should set up the command line arguments. Using tempfile.mkstemp will create a temporary file for the CLI output. Then, using subprocess.run with shell=True makes sense because we're executing an external command.

I'll construct the command string, including the playbook_path and any additional arguments from ansible_args. If verbose is provided, I'll add the -v flag the appropriate number of times.

Then, I'll pass the args to subprocess.run, capturing the output and stderr. The function should return the return code, stdout, and stderr as a tuple.

Wait, in the example, _run_playbook is called with args, vars_dict, and the objects. So I need to make sure that the subprocess.run arguments are correctly structured. Using check=False allows for non-zero exit codes, which is good because the CLI might fail.

I should also handle any potential exceptions, but the current code doesn't include a try-except block. Since the user didn't specify handling errors, I'll leave it as is.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function with the necessary imports and structure. Make sure the docstring is properly included and that all parameters are correctly mapped.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
