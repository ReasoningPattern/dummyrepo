Okay, I need to write a Python function called oneline. The function takes a script and a separator, which defaults to " && ". The goal is to convert the script into a one-line command using the given separator. 

Hmm, how does the script look? I'm assuming it's a multi-line string where each line is separated by newlines. So, I need to join these lines with the separator. 

Wait, maybe the script is a list of commands or a multi-line string. The function should handle both cases. But looking at the function signature, script is a str, so probably a multi-line string.

So, the plan is to split the script into lines, then join them using the separator. But I should also make sure to strip any whitespace around each line to avoid unnecessary spaces.

I'll use the splitlines() method to split the script into lines. Then, I'll apply the sep.join() method with the separator. 

Wait, what if the separator is something with spaces? Like " && " which is used as an example. That should work because sep.join() will place the separator between each line exactly as provided.

Testing with an example: if script is "line1\nline2", and separator is "x", the result should be "line1xline2". But if I want them separated by newlines, maybe the separator should be "\n". But according to the problem, the separator is given, so I shouldn't change it.

So, the code will be something like:

return sep.join(script.splitlines())

But wait, should I strip each line first? Because if script has leading or trailing whitespace on each line, it might result in extra spaces in the output. The example in the docstring doesn't mention this, but it's a good practice. So, maybe I should add a strip() to each line.

So, the code becomes:

return sep.join(line.strip() for line in script.splitlines())

That way, any leading or trailing whitespace on each line is removed before joining.

Let me test this logic. Suppose script is:

"  hello  \n  world  "

Splitting into lines gives ["  hello  ", "  world  "]. Stripping each gives ["hello", "world"]. Joining with " && " gives "hello && world". That looks correct.

Another test case: empty lines. If script has "\n\n", splitlines() will include empty strings. Stripping them would result in empty strings, which when joined, would leave nothing. But in the context of a script, maybe that's acceptable or handled elsewhere.

So, the function should handle all these cases correctly.

Putting it all together, the function will be:

def oneline(script, seperator=" && "):
    return sep.join(line.strip() for line in script.splitlines())

Wait, but the parameter is called 'seperator' in the function, but in the docstring, it's written as 'separated'. Oh, no, looking back, the function signature uses 'seperator' as the parameter name, but the docstring says 'separator'. That's a typo. So, in the code, I should use 'separator' as the variable name. So, inside the function, it's 'separator'.

So, the correct code is:

def oneline(script, separator=" && "):
    return sep.join(line.strip() for line in script.splitlines())

Wait, no, in the code, the variable is 'separator', so inside the function, it's 'separator'. So, the join uses 'separator' as the argument.

So, the code should be:

def oneline(script, separator=" && "):
    return separator.join(line.strip() for line in script.splitlines())

Yes, that's correct.
