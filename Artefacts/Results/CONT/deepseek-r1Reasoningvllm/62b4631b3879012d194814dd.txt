Okay, I need to write a Python function called fix_namespace_prefix_w that replaces "w:st=" with "w-st=". The user provided a code snippet that's supposed to do this using regular expressions. Let me see how that works.

First, I'll look at the code they gave. They're importing re and copy, so I'll need those. The function takes 'content' as input, which I assume is a string.

The code uses re.sub to replace the pattern. The pattern is r'w:\s*st=', which matches 'w:' followed by optional whitespace and 'st='. The replacement is r'w-st', which changes that part to 'w-st'.

Wait, but what about cases where there's more than 'st'? Like 'w:somethingelse='. The current pattern would only replace 'st' if it's exactly that. So maybe I should make it case-insensitive, but the problem statement says to replace 'w:st=', so perhaps it's better to keep it exact unless specified otherwise.

Hmm, the problem says to replace "w:st=", so I should stick with that unless the user specifies otherwise. So the pattern is correct as is.

Next, the function needs to return the modified content. So after substitution, we just return the result.

I should also consider edge cases. For example, if the string is None, but the function expects a string, so maybe it's safe to assume content is a string.

Putting it all together, the function imports re and copy, but wait, copy isn't used here. So maybe it's unnecessary, but the user included it, so I'll include it in the imports.

So the code will import re and copy, define the function, use re.sub with the pattern and replacement, and return the result.

I think that's all. The code should work as intended, replacing exactly 'w:st=' with 'w-st'.
