Okay, I need to write a Python function based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _c_optimizations_ignored and it's supposed to return True if the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable is not None and not 0. Otherwise, it returns False.

First, I'll look at the function signature provided. It's an empty function, so I need to fill that in. The docstring explains that it should check for the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable. So, I'll need to access this variable.

I remember that in Python, environment variables can be accessed using os.environ. So, I'll import the os module since it's listed in the context.

The condition is that the environment variable should not be None and not be 0. Wait, but 0 is a valid integer, so if the variable is set to 0, the function should return False. So, the condition should be that the variable is not None and not equal to 0.

Putting it together, the function will import os, get the environment variable, check if it exists (is not None) and is not 0, then return True or False accordingly.

I should make sure to handle cases where the environment variable might not exist. If it's not present, os.environ.get will return None by default, so the condition will correctly evaluate to False.

So, the code will import os, then in the function, use os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON") to safely retrieve the value. Then, check if it's truthy (i.e., not None and not 0).

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
