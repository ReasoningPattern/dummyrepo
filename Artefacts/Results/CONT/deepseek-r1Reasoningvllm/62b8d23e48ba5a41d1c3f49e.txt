Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's part of a class. The docstring says that it should find, remove, and return a random (key, value) pair using __choice.

First, I remember that in Python, the random module has a choice method which selects a random element from a non-empty iterable. So, I should probably use that.

Looking at the context, the class imports random and cache. It also has attributes like self.pop and self.choice. Wait, but self.choice is already a method, so maybe I should use self.__choice instead to avoid confusion.

The function needs to return a tuple of (key, value). So, I'll use random.choice on self.pop, which is a list of tuples. That makes sense because pop is a list that's maintained elsewhere.

I should make sure that self.pop is not empty before calling choice. But the function signature doesn't include any checks, so I'll assume that it's always non-empty as per the class's responsibility.

Putting it all together, the function will import random, use random.choice on self.pop, then pop the item from the list. Finally, it returns the selected tuple.

Wait, do I need to handle any exceptions? The docstring doesn't mention it, so maybe not. Just return the item.

So, the code will import random, then define popitem as described. It uses self.__choice to call the method, which is the correct approach to avoid attribute conflicts.

I think that's all. The code should be concise and follow the given structure.
