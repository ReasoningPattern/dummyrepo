Okay, I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that takes a list of nodes and merges any duplicate keys. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, I need to think about how to handle this.

First, I should probably create a dictionary to keep track of the merged nodes. Since the nodes might be nested structures, I need to traverse each node and check if its key already exists in the dictionary.

Wait, what's a MappingNode? Oh right, it's a node that has a __getitem__ method, so I can treat it like a dictionary. So, for each node in the nodes list, I'll check if it's a MappingNode. If it is, I'll iterate through its items and update the dictionary, but if a key already exists, I should only keep the last value.

If the node is not a MappingNode, then I can just assign it to the dictionary's value for that key, overwriting any existing value.

But how do I check if something is a MappingNode? I can use isinstance(node, MappingNode). So, I'll need to import MappingNode from the appropriate module, maybe from ruamel.yaml or another library.

Wait, in the context, the imports include 'ruamel' and 'os' and 'logging'. Maybe MappingNode is from ruamel.yaml node. So, I'll import MappingNode from ruamel.yaml.nodes.

Now, I'll initialize an empty dictionary, let's call it merged_nodes. Then, iterate over each node in the input list nodes.

For each node, if it's a MappingNode, I'll loop through its key-value pairs. For each key, value in node.items(), I'll check if the key is already in merged_nodes. If it is, I'll update it with the current value. If not, I'll add it to the dictionary.

If the node is not a MappingNode, I'll check if the key exists in merged_nodes. If it does, I'll overwrite it with the current node. If not, I'll add the key with the current node as its value.

Wait, but what if the node is a list or another type? For example, if a node is a list, assigning it to a key in the dictionary would overwrite the previous value. But in the context, the function is supposed to merge nodes, so perhaps it's intended that non-dict nodes are overwritten.

So, the function will process each node, and for each key, it will either add it or update it in the merged dictionary.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this:

Import MappingNode from ruamel.yaml.nodes.

Define the function deep_merge_nodes(nodes).

Initialize merged_nodes as an empty dict.

Loop over each node in nodes:

    if isinstance(node, MappingNode):

        for key, value in node.items():

            merged_nodes[key] = value

    else:

        merged_nodes[node] = node

Wait, no. Because for non-MappingNode nodes, assigning node to merged_nodes[node] would overwrite any existing key. But in the case of duplicates, the last one should remain. So, if a key already exists, the new node replaces the old one.

Yes, that's correct.

But wait, what if the node is a list or another iterable? For example, if a node is a list, then node would be a list, and assigning it to merged_nodes[node] would put the list as a value. But in the context, the function is supposed to merge nodes, so perhaps it's intended that non-dict nodes are overwritten.

So, the code should handle that correctly.

Now, considering edge cases: what if nodes is empty? The function should return an empty dict. What if a node is None? Then, trying to access node as a key would cause an error. But perhaps the function should handle None by skipping it or treating it as a key. Hmm, but in the context, nodes are probably non-None.

So, the code should be safe as written.

Wait, but in the else clause, when the node is not a MappingNode, we are assigning the node to merged_nodes[node]. But if node is, say, an integer, then node as a key would be the integer itself. So, if two nodes have the same integer key, the last one would overwrite the previous. But in the problem statement, the function is supposed to merge nodes with duplicate keys, so perhaps the keys are supposed to be unique or the function is designed to handle that.

But in the problem statement, the function is supposed to handle any node, so the code as written should work.

So, the final code would be:

Import MappingNode from ruamel.yaml.nodes.

Define the function, loop through each node, and update the dictionary accordingly.

I think that's the correct approach.
