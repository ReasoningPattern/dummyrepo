Okay, so the user wants me to generate some Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me see what they provided.

The function is called protocol_handlers and takes two parameters: cls and protocol_version, which has a default value of None. The docstring says it returns different forms of Bolt protocol handlers based on the protocol_version.

Looking at the context, there are a lot of methods listed, but I don't see any that directly relate to protocol handlers. Hmm, maybe the user is referring to existing methods in a class that handle different protocol versions.

I need to create a function that, based on protocol_version, returns the appropriate handler. Since the default is None, it should handle both cases. I'll probably use a dictionary to map protocol versions to their respective handler methods.

Wait, the user didn't provide specific handler methods, so I'll have to make up some example handlers. Let's say version 1.0 uses a specific handler and version 2.0 uses another.

I'll structure the code to check if protocol_version is None and return a default handler, else return the handler based on the version. I'll include comments for clarity.

I should make sure the code is clean and only includes the necessary parts. No explanations or markdown, just the code in Python markdown format.

So, putting it all together, I'll define the protocol_handlers function, use a dictionary to map versions, and return the appropriate handler. That should meet the user's requirements.
