Okay, I need to write a Python function called make_array based on the provided signature and docstring. Let me see what the requirements are.

The function takes two arguments: shape, which is a tuple, and dtype, which defaults to np.float32. The docstring says it should return a 0-filled array of the given shape and type. 

So, I remember that numpy has a function called zeros that creates an array filled with zeros. The zeros function takes a shape argument and an optional dtype. That seems perfect for this task.

Wait, the default dtype is already set to float32, which matches the default of zeros, so I don't need to change that. 

Putting it together, the function should call np.zeros with shape and dtype. Then, it should return the resulting array.

I should make sure to import numpy as np, but the context already mentions that numpy is imported as np, so I don't need to add that to the code.

So the code will be straightforward: define the function, call np.zeros with the parameters, and return the array.

Let me double-check: the function signature matches, the docstring is correctly implemented, and the return value is an array of zeros with the specified shape and dtype. Yep, that should do it.
