Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _create_converter and returns an instance of _converting._Converter. 

First, I'll start by defining the function. It should be an instance method, so I'll include self as the first parameter. The return type is _converting._Converter, so I'll use the return type annotation from the imported 'typing' module.

Next, the docstring explains that this function creates the parameter style converter and returns it. I'll make sure the docstring is properly formatted with a newline after the closing colon for multi-line descriptions.

I'll check if there are any imports needed. Since the return type uses _converting._Converter, I assume that's already imported or available in the module. There's no need for additional imports beyond what's provided, which includes 'typing' and 're'.

Looking at the context, the function is part of a class and uses attributes like _converter. I'll make sure the code correctly references these attributes without any typos.

I don't see any specific logic needed inside the function beyond returning the converter instance. So, the implementation is straightforward.

Putting it all together, the function will be a simple method that returns self._converter, as indicated by the class structure.
