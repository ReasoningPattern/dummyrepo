Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _validate_labels and it's supposed to check that the keys and values in the given labels meet certain criteria using validate_key and validate_value functions.

First, I'll start by looking at the imports. The user mentioned several packages like dataclasses, enum, typing, re, datetime, marshmallow, serializable. I'll need to import these at the top. Then, there are variables like _label_key_pattern, _label_value_pattern, etc., which are probably regex patterns used for validation. There are also functions like validate_key, validate_value, _get_labels_regex, and others in the context.

I'll structure the code starting with the necessary imports. I'll import re, datetime, marshmallow, and the others as needed. Then, I'll define the _validate_labels function. Inside this function, I need to validate each key and value in the labels dictionary.

For each key in labels, I'll check if it matches the _label_key_pattern using re.fullmatch. If not, I'll raise a marshmallow error with a message indicating the invalid key. Also, I'll validate the key using the validate_key function.

Similarly, for each value in labels, I'll check if it matches the _label_value_pattern. If it doesn't, another marshmallow error is raised. Then, I'll validate the value with validate_value.

I should also handle cases where the labels might be None or not a dictionary, so I'll add checks for that and raise appropriate errors.

Putting it all together, I'll make sure to use marshmallow's ValidationError for custom error messages and ensure that all validations are in place. I'll structure the code so that it's clean and follows best practices, including proper error handling and clear variable names.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
