Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called mru_cache and it's a decorator used for memoization with a Most Recently Used algorithm. 

First, I remember that in Python, the standard library has a decorator called @lru_cache which uses an LRU algorithm. But here, the requirement is to implement an MRU (Most Recently Used) cache. So I can't just use the built-in lru_cache; I need to create my own.

The function signature is def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):, and it has a docstring explaining it's a decorator for memoization based on MRU. 

I should import necessary modules. Since it's a decorator, I'll probably need functools for the wraps and other utilities. So I'll import functools.

Now, the mru_cache decorator is a class, right? Because it's a wrapper that can hold the cache. So I'll create a class called MRUCache. This class will handle the caching logic.

Inside the class, there's a __init__ method that initializes the cache as a dictionary and sets the max size. Also, a count attribute to keep track of hits and misses. The typed parameter is for typed extensions, so in __init__, if typed is True, it sets a type hint for the key.

The __call__ method is where the magic happens. It checks if the arguments have changed since the last call. If they have, it adds the old entry to the cache (LRU eviction) and then computes the new key. The key is created by hashing the arguments using the functools.creduce function, which applies a hashing function to all the arguments.

The decorator function, mru_cache, uses functools.wraps to wrap the original function. It creates an instance of MRUCache, calls the __call__ method, and returns the result.

I also need to handle the case where the function doesn't take any arguments, which would cause an error when hashing. But since functools.creduce can handle that by using a default of hash for the initial value, it should be okay.

Putting it all together, I'll write the imports, define the MRUCache class, and then the mru_cache function. I'll make sure to include the docstring as specified.

I think that covers everything. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly.
