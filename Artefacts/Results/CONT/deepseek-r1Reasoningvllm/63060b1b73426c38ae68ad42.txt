Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. The function is called inject_config and it's a method in a class. The docstring explains that if the ANSIBLE_CONFIG property isn't in os.environ, it should be set to self.ansible_config_path.

First, I'll need to check if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' is already in the os.environ dictionary. If it's not there, then I should set it using the value from self.ansible_config_path. 

So, the code structure would be something like: check if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' is in os.environ, and if not, assign self.ansible_config_path to it. 

I should also make sure to use the correct syntax. The function is defined as def inject_config(self):, so I'll start with that. Inside the function, I'll use an if statement to check the condition. 

Wait, I should also consider importing os if it's not already imported, but the context mentions that os is imported, so I don't need to worry about that. 

Putting it all together, the code will check for the presence of 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' in the environment and set it if necessary. That should fulfill the requirement specified in the docstring.
