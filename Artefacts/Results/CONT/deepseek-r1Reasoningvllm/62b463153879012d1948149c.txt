Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called select_filenames_by_prefix, and it takes two arguments: prefix and files. The docstring says it returns all files that match the given prefix.

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. It should iterate over each file in the files list and check if the file name starts with the given prefix. If it does, the file should be included in the result.

I remember that in Python, string.startswith() can be used to check if a string starts with another string. So I can use that method.

I'll start by initializing an empty list to hold the matching files. Then, I'll loop through each file in the files list. For each file, I'll check if file.startswith(prefix) is True. If it is, I'll append it to the result list.

Putting it all together, the function will look something like this: create an empty list, loop through each file, check the condition, and collect the matches.

I should make sure the function returns the list of matching filenames. Also, I need to ensure that the code is properly indented and follows Python syntax.

Wait, are there any edge cases? Like if the prefix is an empty string, it should return all files. Or if no files match, it returns an empty list. That's handled by the code as is.

I don't think I need to import anything for this function since it's just using string methods. The imported packages mentioned are os, logging, zipfile, packtools, but they might not be needed here unless the function uses them, which it doesn't seem to.

So the final code should be straightforward: initialize the list, loop, check, append, and return.
