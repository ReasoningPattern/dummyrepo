Okay, I need to write a Python function called send_document based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to send a POST request with some data. Let me think about what steps are involved in sending a POST request in Python.

First, I remember that the requests library is commonly used for HTTP requests. So I should import requests. Also, looking at the context, other libraries like urllib, uuid, datetime, and logging are imported, so I might need some of those too.

The function parameters are url, data, timeout, method, and some *args and **kwargs. The docstring says it sends a response containing data through the POST method. So the function will make a POST request to the given URL with the provided data.

I should start by creating a session using requests.Session() because it allows for making multiple requests and managing cookies if needed.

Next, I'll use session.post() to make the POST request. The first argument is the URL. The second is the data, which can be in various forms like bytes, str, or dict. The timeout is an optional parameter, so I'll include it in the method call.

The method parameter is the HTTP method, which is usually "post", but the function allows changing it. So I'll set it as the method argument.

Now, handling the response. The response object has attributes like text, which is the content as a string, and status_code, which gives the HTTP status code.

I should log the response details. The context mentions a logger, so I'll use logger.info to log the request and response. I'll include the method, URL, status code, and the response text.

If the response status code is not in the successful range (200-299), I should log an error. The context doesn't specify handling this, but it's a good practice, so I'll add a check for that.

If the response is successful, I'll return the response object. If not, I'll raise an exception. The exception message should include the status code and the response text for clarity.

I also need to consider any additional headers. The function signature includes *args and **kwargs, so I should pass any extra arguments to session.post().

Wait, the initial code I wrote didn't include the headers. Should I fetch them somehow? The context mentions fetch_document and other functions, but without more info, I'll assume that the data is sent as is, without additional headers unless specified elsewhere.

Putting it all together, the function will create a session, make a POST request, handle the response, log appropriately, and return or raise an error.

I should also make sure to import the necessary modules. So I'll include 'import logging' and 'import requests' at the top.

Let me structure the code step by step. First, create the session, then make the request, then handle the response, log it, and return or raise.

I think that covers all the requirements. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
