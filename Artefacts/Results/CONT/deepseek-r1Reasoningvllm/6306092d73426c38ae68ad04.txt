Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_parser_option_specs and it's part of a class. The docstring says that this function gets all the options for a specified command. 

Looking at the context provided, I see that the function is used within a class and interacts with various methods like self.get_option_spec, self._include_groups, and self._get_all_options_spec. It also imports 'infrared' and 'copy'. 

I remember that in Python, when dealing with command-line options, the getopt module is often used, but here it seems like we're using infrared, which is a library for parsing command-line arguments. So, the function is probably part of a custom command-line parser setup using infrared.

The function signature is def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):, so it's a method of a class. It returns a list of option specs. 

I think the function needs to return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about an option, like name, short and long forms, default value, etc. 

Looking at the context, the function calls self._get_all_options_spec(parser_dict), which suggests that it's part of a larger process where parser_dict is built. So, the function likely constructs this parser_dict and then extracts the options from it.

I should consider how to structure the returned list. Each option should have keys like 'name', 'long_name', 'short_name', 'default', 'type', etc. 

Since the function is part of a class, it can access instance variables like self._option_specs. It should iterate over these specs and collect the necessary information.

I'll start by initializing an empty list. Then, for each spec in self._option_specs, I'll create a dictionary with the required keys. For each key, I'll extract the relevant information from the spec object.

I'll loop through each option in self._option_specs and append the details to the options list. Finally, return this list.

I should make sure that all the necessary keys are present in each spec. If any are missing, I might default to None or an empty string, but since the context doesn't specify handling missing data, I'll assume all keys are present.

Putting it all together, the function will build the options list by iterating over each option spec and constructing the dictionaries accordingly.
