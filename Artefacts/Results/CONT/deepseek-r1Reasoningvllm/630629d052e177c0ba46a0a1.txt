Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called verify_relayable_signature and takes three parameters: public_key, doc, and signature. The docstring explains that this function verifies the signed XML elements to confirm the author of the message.

First, I should import the necessary modules. Since the function deals with cryptographic signatures, I'll need the hashlib module for handling hashes and the xml.etree.ElementTree module to parse the XML document.

Next, I'll define the function. The function will start by extracting the data from the XML document using ElementTree's parse method. I'll convert the data into a byte stream to compute the hash.

Then, I'll compute the SHA-256 hash of the data. Using this hash, I'll create a byte representation of the public key's fingerprint. I'll concatenate the public key fingerprint and the hash to form the input for the private key's signature.

I'll use the RSAPKCS1SignatureAlgorithm class from the cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa module to create a signature object. I'll update this object with the combined bytes and then sign the hash using the private key.

Finally, I'll compare the generated signature with the provided signature. If they match, the function returns True, indicating the signature is valid. Otherwise, it returns False.

I should make sure all imports are correct and that the modules are properly used. Also, I'll ensure that the function correctly handles the conversion between bytes and the signature format.

Wait, I should check if cryptography is installed because it's a third-party library. The user might need to install it separately, but since it's not specified in the context, I'll assume it's available or the code will be run in an environment where it's installed.

Putting it all together, the code imports the necessary modules, defines the function with the correct parameters, and performs the cryptographic operations as outlined.
