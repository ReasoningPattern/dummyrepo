Okay, I need to write a Python function called get_repo_archive. The function takes a URL and a destination path, and it should retrieve and extract a .tar.gz archive containing 'desc' files for each package. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll need to download the file from the given URL. The requests library is imported, so I'll use that. I'll use requests.get to fetch the URL. But I should probably handle cases where the download might fail, so adding a try-except block makes sense. If it fails, I'll raise an exception.

Next, once the file is downloaded, I need to extract it. The destination_path is a Path object, so I'll use Path to handle the file paths. The file I downloaded has a .tar.gz extension, so I'll need to extract it into a directory within the destination_path.

I remember that for extracting tar.gz files, using tarfile.open with ':memory:' as the mode can load the archive into memory without creating an intermediate directory. This is efficient, especially for large files. So I'll open the tar.gz file in that mode and extract it into the destination_path.

I should also make sure that the destination_path exists. If it doesn't, I'll create it using Path.mkdir with parents=True and exist_ok=True to avoid errors if the parent directories don't exist.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Attempt to download the URL.
2. Check if the download was successful.
3. Create the destination directory if necessary.
4. Extract the .tar.gz archive into the destination path.
5. Return the Path object of the extracted directory.

I think that covers all the steps. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
