Alright, I need to write a Python function called parse_arguments that takes a variable number of unparsed arguments and returns them as a dictionary. The function signature is given, so I just need to implement the logic inside it.

First, I remember that when using argparse, the main parsing happens in the main namespace, so I should probably use the sys module to access that.

I should import sys so I can get the usage information. Then, I'll use the get_usage() method to get the command usage string, which helps in error messages.

Next, I need to parse the arguments. I'll call argparse.ArgumentParser's parse_args() method with the unparsed_arguments. This will handle the parsing based on the defined command-line options.

After parsing, I need to check if there were any errors. If there are errors, I should print them and exit the program to handle them properly.

Then, I should extract the arguments from the parsed namespace. I can loop through each key-value pair in the parsed_args dictionary and add them to the result dictionary.

I also need to ensure that the result is a dictionary, so I'll initialize it as an empty dict and populate it with the parsed arguments.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code step by step, making sure each part is correctly implemented. I'll test it with some sample arguments to see if it works as expected, but since I can't run code here, I'll just make sure the logic is sound based on my knowledge.

Finally, I'll write the code, ensuring that all necessary imports are included and that the function returns the correct dictionary.
