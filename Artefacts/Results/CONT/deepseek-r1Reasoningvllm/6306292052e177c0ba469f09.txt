Okay, I need to write a Python function called identify_request based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function checks if the request body, when loaded as JSON, contains events. If it does, return True. If not, check if the XML tag is Magic_ENV_TAG. If that's the case, return True. Otherwise, return False.

First, I'll need to import necessary modules. The context mentions importing typing, logging, json, base64, urllib, federation, lxml. So I'll include those in the imports.

Next, the function takes a RequestType parameter. I'm not sure what that is, but I'll assume it's something that has a body attribute, maybe a flask object.

Inside the function, I'll start by trying to load the request body as JSON. Using json.loads makes sense here. I'll check if the 'events' key is present in the JSON data. If it is, return True.

If there are no events, I'll then parse the body as XML. Using lxml's etree module, I'll convert the request body to a string, then parse it into a document. I'll then look for the Magic_ENV_TAG in the document. If found, return True.

If neither condition is met, the function should return False.

I need to handle exceptions, so wrapping each parsing step in a try-except block is important. For JSON, if json.JSONDecodeError occurs, catch it and proceed. For XML, if there's a parsing error, also catch it and proceed.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code with these steps, making sure each part is properly indented and the function returns the correct boolean values.
