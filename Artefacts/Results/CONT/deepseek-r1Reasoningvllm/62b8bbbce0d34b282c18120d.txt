Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_file_exist and it takes a file_name as an argument. The docstring says it checks whether the file_name is an existing file.

First, I should think about how to determine if a file exists in Python. The os module has functions for file operations, so I'll probably need to import os. The function os.path.exists() comes to mind. It returns True if the file exists, False otherwise.

Wait, but what about directories? The function is supposed to check for a file, so if the file_name points to a directory, it should return False. So using os.path.exists() directly might not be sufficient because it returns True for both files and directories.

Hmm, how can I differentiate between a file and a directory? Oh right, the os.path module has isfile() and isdir() functions. So I should check if the file exists and also if it's a file.

So the steps are: import os, then in the function, use os.path.exists(file_name) and os.path.isfile(file_name). Both conditions need to be True for it to be a file.

Wait, but what about symbolic links? The default os.path.exists() considers them as existing, but os.path.isfile() would return False if the symlink points to a directory. So if the function is supposed to strictly check for files, including handling symlinks correctly, I should use os.path.isfile().

Putting it all together, the function can be written as:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, looking at the context provided, there are other functions like is_dir_exist and is_path_exist. But the task is only to generate the function for is_file_exist, so I don't need to include those.

So the code should import os, and then define the function to return whether file_name is a file.

I should also consider any edge cases, like if the file doesn't exist, it returns False, which is correct. What about non-string file_name? But since the function is called with a string as per the context, maybe it's safe to assume file_name is a string.

So the final code is straightforward: import os, then the function returns os.path.isfile(file_name).
