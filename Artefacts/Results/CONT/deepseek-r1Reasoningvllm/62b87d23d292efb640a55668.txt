Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_config(), and it's supposed to return a new VersioneerConfig() and set various attributes of it. 

First, I'll start by defining the function. It should return an instance of VersioneerConfig, so I'll write that. 

Next, the docstring says it should set various attributes. I'll need to create a class or a module-level object that has these attributes. Since the function is returning VersioneerConfig(), I'll assume that's a class, possibly located in another module. 

I'll create an instance of VersioneerConfig inside the function. Let's name it config. Then, I'll set each attribute one by one. 

Looking at the context provided, there are several methods and attributes mentioned, like git_get_keywords, git_versions_from_keywords, etc. I'll set these attributes by calling the respective methods. 

For example, config.git_get_keywords(versionfile_abs) will call the git_get_keywords method. Similarly, I'll set the other attributes like git_versions_from_keywords, git_pieces_from_vcs, plus_or_dot, render_pep440, and so on. 

I'll make sure to use the correct method signatures. For instance, git_versions_from_keywords takes self, keywords, and verbose as arguments. I'll pass self since it's an instance method. 

I'll also set the version and release version attributes by calling get_version() and get_release_version() respectively. 

Finally, I'll add a docstring to the function that explains what it does, as provided. 

I should ensure that all the attributes are properly set and that the function returns the config instance correctly. 

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
