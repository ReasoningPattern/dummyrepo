Okay, I need to write a Python function called difference that takes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, and an optional level parameter. The function should return a new dictionary containing items from d1 that are not present in d2. 

First, I should think about how to compare the dictionaries. If level is -1, it means I should compare them as they are. But if level is greater than -1, I need to go deeper into nested structures, like lists or other dictionaries inside the values.

Wait, the context mentions functions like get_recursively and update_recursively, so maybe I need to use those. Oh, right, the function is supposed to handle nested structures up to a certain level. So, for each key-value pair in d1, I need to check if that value exists in d2, but considering the nested level specified.

So, I'll create a helper function that recursively checks each value in d1 against d2. This helper will take the current level as an argument. If the level exceeds the specified level, it will just compare the values directly. Otherwise, it will check if the value is a dictionary or a list and recursively check each item.

In the helper, for each key-value in d1, I'll check if the key exists in d2. If it does, I'll compare their values. If the values are both dictionaries, I'll call the helper again with level+1. If they are lists, I'll check each item recursively. If they are other types, I'll just compare them directly.

Once I have the helper, I'll loop through each key-value pair in d1. If the helper returns False, meaning the value isn't in d2, I'll add it to the result dictionary.

Wait, let me think about the parameters. The helper function needs to know the current level. So, I'll define it inside the difference function. Let's name it _check, and it will take d, key, level, and d2 as arguments.

In the _check function, if level is greater than the given level, I'll just compare the values directly. Otherwise, I'll handle nested structures. For lists, I'll iterate through each item and check if any of them are in d2. For dictionaries, I'll recursively check each key-value pair.

So, putting it all together, the helper function will return True if the value exists in d2 at the specified level, and False otherwise. Then, in the main function, I'll collect all key-value pairs from d1 where the helper returns False.

I should also handle cases where the value in d1 is not present in d2 at all, regardless of the level. For example, if a value is a string, and d2 doesn't have that string, it should be included in the result.

Testing this logic: if d1 has a key with a value that's a dictionary, and d2 also has a corresponding nested dictionary, it should go deeper. If the level is 1, it checks the top level; if level is 2, it goes one more level in.

I think I've covered the necessary cases. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle all these scenarios.
