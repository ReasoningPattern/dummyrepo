Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called check_sender_and_entity_handle_match, and it takes two parameters: sender_handle and entity_handle. The docstring explains that this function checks if the sender_handle is the same as entity_handle and returns True if they are the same, otherwise False.

First, I'll look at the function signature. It's straightforward with two parameters. The docstring is clear, so I just need to translate that logic into code.

The function body should compare the two handles. If they are equal, return True; else, return False. So, the code inside the function will be a simple if statement.

I don't see any imports needed here since it's a standalone function. The context mentions some imports like typing, logging, etc., but since the function doesn't use them, I can ignore them.

Putting it all together, the function will take the two handles, compare them, and return the boolean result. That's it. No need for any additional processing or error handling unless specified, which it isn't in this case.
