Okay, so the user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. They specified not to include any explanations or markdown, just the code in Python markdown format.

Looking at the function signature, it's called parse_arguments and takes *unparsed_arguments. The docstring says it parses command-line arguments and returns a dict mapping subparser names to argparse.Namespace instances.

I remember that argparse in Python uses subparsers to handle different command-line options. The main script can have subparsers, each with their own options. So, the function needs to process these subparsers and collect the arguments.

I think the function needs to use the get_subparser_args function, which is typically used in scripts that have subparsers defined. This function returns a dictionary where each key is the subparser name, and the value is the namespace.

So, the code should import get_subparser_args from somewhere. Wait, the user mentioned imports: collections, argparse, borgmatic. So, I should import argparse and maybe get_subparser_args from argparse.

Putting it all together, the function will call get_subparser_args with the unparsed_arguments and return it. That should give the desired dictionary.

I should make sure the code is concise and only includes the necessary lines without any extra explanations. So, the code will import argparse, define the function, and return the result of get_subparser_args.

I think that's all. Let me write that out.
