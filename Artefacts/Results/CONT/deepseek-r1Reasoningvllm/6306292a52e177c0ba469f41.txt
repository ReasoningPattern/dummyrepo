Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called test_tag, takes a string tag as input, and returns a boolean. The docstring says it checks whether each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag. If any character is in the tag, return False; otherwise, return True.

Wait, so LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a set of allowed characters that can be in a tag. The function should check if any character in the input tag is not in this allowed set. If even one character is not allowed, it returns False. Only if all characters are allowed does it return True.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Define the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS as a set containing allowed characters. From the context, I see that the package 'typing' is imported, so I can define it as a typing.Set.

2. Iterate over each character in the input tag.

3. For each character, check if it is in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS.

4. If any character is not found in the set, immediately return False.

5. If all characters are found, return True.

I should also make sure that the function handles empty strings gracefully. If the tag is an empty string, it should return True since there are no characters to check.

Now, considering the context, there are other functions like decode_if_bytes, encode_if_text, etc., but they aren't directly needed here. The function only needs to check each character against the allowed set.

Putting it all together, the code will define LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS as a set, then loop through each character in the tag. If any character isn't in the set, return False. Otherwise, return True.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
