Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called generate_default_observer_schema and it takes an 'app' as an argument. The docstring says it generates the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in spec.manifest where a custom schema hasn't been specified.

First, I should think about what this function needs to do. It probably needs to iterate over the resources in the app's manifest. For each resource, if there's no custom observer schema defined, it should generate a default one.

I'll need to import necessary modules. Looking at the context, imports like inspect, typing, and maybe others are already included, but I might need to import something specific for generating schemas, like a ObserverSchema class or similar.

Next, I'll create a dictionary to hold the observer schemas. I'll loop through each resource in the app. For each resource, I'll check if ' observer_schema' is in the resource's spec. If it's not there, I'll generate a default schema.

The default schema should include all necessary components like kind, name, namespace, etc. I'll structure it as a dictionary with keys like 'kind', 'name', 'namespace', 'api_version', 'server_side', ' observer_schema', and 'metadata' which includes 'name' and 'labels'.

I'll also need a way to generate the observer_schema string for each resource. Maybe a helper function inside the main function would be useful, but since the code is concise, I'll handle it inline.

Finally, I'll return the observer_schemas dictionary containing the default schemas for all applicable resources.

I should make sure the code is clean and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity. Testing it with sample data would help, but since it's a template, it should be adaptable to different manifests.

Putting it all together, the code will loop through each resource, check for the absence of a custom observer_schema, generate a default one, and compile them into a dictionary to return.
