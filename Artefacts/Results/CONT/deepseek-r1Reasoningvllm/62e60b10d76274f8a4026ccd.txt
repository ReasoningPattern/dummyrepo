Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called data and takes *keys as a parameter. The docstring says it returns the keys processed by the transform method of the RecordExporter class. 

First, I'll start by defining the function. Since it's part of a class, I'll use the def syntax with self as the first parameter. The function is supposed to return something, so I'll have it return a value. 

Looking at the context provided, I see that the class has methods like keys(self), which returns an iterable of keys. So, it makes sense that the data method would return these keys. 

I'll call self.keys() inside the function to get the list of keys. Then, I'll return this list. 

I should make sure that the function doesn't include any unnecessary code or explanations, just the code itself. So, the function will be concise, just returning self.keys().

I think that's all. The code should be straightforward.
