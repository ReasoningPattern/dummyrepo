Okay, I need to write a Python function called parser_flags that takes an argparse.ArgumentParser instance and returns its argument flags as a space-separated string. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you use argparse, the flags are stored in the parser object. There's a method called get_flags() which returns all the flags. But wait, I think get_flags() might return them in a way that includes all possible flags, not just the ones that were actually used in the program. So maybe I should look for a way to get only the flags that were used.

Hmm, I recall that the argparse module has something called 'namespace' which contains the arguments. But how do I get the flags from the namespace? Oh right, the namespace is a namespace object, and it has attributes for each flag. So I can iterate over the attributes of the namespace and collect the flags.

So the plan is: take the parser, get its namespace, then loop through each attribute in the namespace. For each attribute, if it's not None, add its name to a list. Then join that list into a space-separated string.

Wait, but what about cases where the attribute is None? Because by default, argparse sets None for unused flags. So I should only include attributes that are not None.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Get the namespace from the parser using parser.namespace.
2. Iterate over the namespace's attributes.
3. For each attribute, if it's not None, add its name to a list.
4. Join the list into a string with spaces.

I should also handle cases where the namespace is None, although I think that's not possible because the parser must have a namespace.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this. I'll initialize an empty list, loop through each key in the namespace, check if the value is not None, and append the key if so. Then, join the keys into a string separated by spaces.

I think that's it. Let me write the code accordingly.
