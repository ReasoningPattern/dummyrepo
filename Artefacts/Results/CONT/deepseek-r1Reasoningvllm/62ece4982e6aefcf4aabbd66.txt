Okay, I need to write a Python function called was_processed based on the given docstring and function signature. Let me read through the docstring carefully to understand what it's supposed to do.

The function is supposed to check if a file or directory has already been processed. It takes three arguments: processed, which is a set; path_name, which is the path to check; and verbose, a boolean for output.

The docstring mentions that to prevent recursion, the path name should be expanded to an absolute path. So, I think the function needs to resolve the path_name to an absolute path. How can I do that? Oh, right, I can use the os module. Specifically, os.path.abspath() will give me the absolute path.

The function should call itself with a set that includes all the processed entries. Wait, but looking at the function signature, processed is a set that's passed by reference. Oh, but in Python, sets are mutable, so changes inside the function will affect the original set. That makes sense because we want to track which paths have been processed.

The function needs to check if the path is already in the processed set. If it is, return True and inform the user if verbose is True. If not, add it to the set and return False.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Import os at the top of the file.
2. In the function, get the absolute path using os.path.abspath(path_name).
3. Check if this absolute path is already in the processed set.
4. If it is, print a warning if verbose is True and return True.
5. If it's not, add the path to the processed set.
6. Return False to indicate it's now processed.

Wait, but what about different directory levels? For example, if someone passes a directory, does it matter? The function's docstring says it handles both files and directories, so I don't need to worry about that here. The check is just based on the path being in the set.

I should also consider edge cases, like if path_name is None or an invalid path. But the function's context doesn't mention handling errors, so I'll assume that path_name is a valid string.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function with the necessary imports and logic. I'll make sure to handle the verbose output correctly, only printing a warning when needed.

So, the code will start by importing os. Then, define the function. Inside, compute the absolute path. Check if it's in processed. If yes, warn and return True. Else, add to processed and return False.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
