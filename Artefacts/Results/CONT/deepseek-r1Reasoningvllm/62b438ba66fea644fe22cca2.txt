Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called deep_merge_nodes and takes a parameter nodes. The goal is to merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys, returning the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one should remain.

First, I'll look at the imports. The context mentions importing os, logging, and ruamel. Since the function deals with nodes and merging, I suspect it might be using ruamel's YAML module for handling nested mappings. So I'll import load and_dump from ruamel.yaml.

Next, I'll consider the structure of the function. The function needs to iterate through each node in the input. For each node, I'll check if its key is already in a dictionary. If the key exists, I'll compare the current value with the existing one. If both are MappingNodes, I'll recursively merge them. Otherwise, the last value should be kept.

I'll initialize an empty dictionary called merged_nodes. Then, loop through each key, value in nodes.items(). For each value, I'll check if it's a MappingNode using isinstance. If it is, I'll merge it into the existing value if it's already a MappingNode. If not, I'll just update the value in merged_nodes.

Wait, but how do I merge two MappingNodes? I think I need a helper function, deep_merge, which takes two arguments. This function will check if both are MappingNodes and recursively merge their key-value pairs. If one is a MappingNode and the other isn't, it will replace the value with the non-MappingNode's value.

In the helper function, I'll use a recursive approach. For each key in the first node, I'll check if the key exists in the second node. If both have the key, I'll call deep_merge again on their values. If only the first has the key, I'll add it to the result. If only the second has the key, I'll add it as well.

Putting it all together, the deep_merge_nodes function will build the merged structure by handling each node appropriately. Finally, I'll use the safe_dump method from ruamel.yaml to serialize the merged structure back into a YAML format, ensuring it's safe for loading.

I should also make sure to handle cases where nodes might be nested deeply. The recursive approach should take care of that. Testing with sample data would help, but since I can't do that here, I'll ensure the code structure logically follows the requirements.

So, the code will import necessary modules, define the helper function for merging nested structures, and then implement the main function to process each node, handling duplicates by either merging or keeping the last value.
