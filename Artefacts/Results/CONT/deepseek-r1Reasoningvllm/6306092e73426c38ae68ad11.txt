Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called merge_extra_vars and takes two parameters: vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring explains that this function extends vars_dict with extra_vars. 

First, I'll start by writing the function definition. The parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars, with extra_vars defaulting to None. So I'll set extra_vars=None inside the function.

Next, I need to handle the case where extra_vars is None. If it is, I should set extra_vars to an empty list because you can't iterate over None. That way, the function can proceed without errors.

Then, I'll loop through each item in extra_vars. For each key-value pair, I'll update the vars_dict by setting the key to the value. This effectively merges the extra_vars into vars_dict.

I should make sure that the code is clean and follows standard Python practices. Since the function is part of a class, using self. is appropriate if this method is inside a class, but the provided code context doesn't specify that, so I'll just use the parameters as given.

Putting it all together, the function will check if extra_vars is None, convert it to an empty list if necessary, then iterate through each item in extra_vars to update vars_dict.

I think that's all. The code should be straightforward and handle all cases properly.
