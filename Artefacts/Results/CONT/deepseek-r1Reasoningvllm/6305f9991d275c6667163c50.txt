Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called set_cut_chars and it's part of a class. Let me look at the details.

The function signature is def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:. So it takes two bytes parameters, before and after, and returns None. 

The docstring explains that this function sets the bytes used to delimit slice points. So it's probably used to define how data is split before and after certain points.

Looking at the context provided, there are imports like argparse, typing, re, logging, pathlib, abc, os. The class has methods like add_arguments, DEFAULT_CUT_AFTER, parts, set_cut_chars, _cutter, split_parts, and others. 

I notice that the function is called set_cut_chars, which suggests it's setting attributes related to cutting characters. The parameters before and after are bytes, so they're likely strings or byte sequences.

I should probably assign these parameters to instance variables. So self._before = before and self._after = after makes sense. 

I should add a docstring to the function that mirrors the one provided, explaining what each parameter is. 

Putting it all together, the function will take the before and after bytes, assign them to the instance variables, and return None as specified.

I don't see any other considerations here. The code should be straightforward.
