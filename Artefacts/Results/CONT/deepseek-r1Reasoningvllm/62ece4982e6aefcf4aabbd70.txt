Okay, I need to write a Python function called os_is_mac that checks if the current operating system is macOS. The function should return a boolean, True if it is macOS, and False otherwise. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that the os module in Python has functions to get information about the operating system. The function os.name is commonly used for this purpose. I remember that os.name returns a string indicating the OS. For macOS, it should return 'macOS'.

So, the function can be as simple as checking if os.name equals 'macOS'. That seems straightforward. I should import the os module, but the context says it's already imported, so I don't need to worry about that.

Wait, are there any edge cases? Well, I'm assuming that the function is being run in a macOS environment, but sometimes, especially in virtual machines or containers, the name might be different. But given the problem statement, I think checking os.name == 'macOS' is sufficient.

So, putting it all together, the function will import os, check if the name is 'macOS', and return the boolean result. That should do it.
