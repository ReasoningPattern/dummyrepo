Okay, I need to write a Python function called match_file_by_prefix. The function takes two arguments: prefix and file_path. The docstring says that the function should return True if the basename of the file_path starts with either prefix+ "-" or prefix+ ".". 

First, I should think about how to get the basename of the file. In Python, the os module has a basename function that returns the filename from a path. So I'll import os and use os.path.basename(file_path) to get the filename.

Once I have the filename, I need to check if it starts with either prefix + "-" or prefix + ".". So I'll construct two possible strings: one with a hyphen and one with a dot. Then, I'll check if the filename starts with either of these using the startswith() method.

Wait, but what if the prefix is empty or the filename is shorter than the prefix? I should handle those cases, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe it's safe to assume that the inputs are valid as per the function's intended use.

Putting it all together, the function will import os, get the basename, then check if it starts with either of the two constructed strings. If it does, return True; else, return False.

I should write the code without any explanations, just the function. So the code will import os, then define the function. Inside the function, extract the basename, then the two possible prefixes, and use startswith to check.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
