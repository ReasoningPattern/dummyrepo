Okay, I need to write a Python function called _replace_url_args that takes a url and a url_args dictionary. The goal is to replace parts of the URL with the values from url_args. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should parse the URL into its components. I remember that the urlparse module can split a URL into parts like scheme, netloc, path, etc. So I'll import urlparse from urllib.parse.

Next, I'll check if the URL has a netloc. If it does, I'll split it into the base URL and the parameters. If there's no netloc, I'll use the entire URL as the base.

Then, I'll create a new dictionary to hold the parts of the URL after replacements. I'll start by adding the base URL to this dictionary.

Now, I'll iterate over each key-value pair in url_args. For each key, I'll check if it's one of the main URL components: 'scheme', 'netloc', 'path', 'query', or 'fragment'. If it is, I'll update the corresponding part in my new dictionary. If it's another parameter, I'll append it to the query string.

After processing all the url_args, I'll combine the new dictionary back into a URL object using urlunparse. Finally, I'll return the modified URL as a string.

Wait, I should handle cases where the URL doesn't have a netloc. So, if urlparse(url).netloc is empty, I treat the whole URL as the base. Otherwise, the base is the part before the '?', and the parameters are the part after.

I also need to make sure that if a parameter in url_args doesn't correspond to any URL component, it's just added to the query string. For example, if someone passes a 'foo' parameter that's not a standard URL part, it should still be included.

Let me test this logic with an example. Suppose url is 'http://example.com/path?param=1', and url_args is {'path': 'test', 'foo': 'bar'}. The function should replace the path to 'test' and append 'foo=bar' to the query string, resulting in 'http://example.com/test?param=1&foo=bar'.

I think this covers the cases. Now, I'll write the code step by step, making sure to handle each part correctly.
