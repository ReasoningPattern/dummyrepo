Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_config_manager and it's a method of a class. The docstring says it gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

First, I should look at the context provided. The imports are os, sys, and infrared. Within the file, there are several class methods mentioned, including setup, plugins_manager, ansible_config_manager, etc. The method I'm supposed to generate is ansible_config_manager, which is a method of the class cls.

The docstring indicates that this function uses cls._get_service() to retrieve the service. So, I need to write a method that calls _get_service with the appropriate parameter. The parameter is ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER, which in Python is typically accessed using dot notation, so it should be ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER.

Putting it together, the method will call self._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER). That makes sense because it's using the class's own method to get the service configuration.

I should make sure the code is properly indented and fits within the class structure. Since the function is a method, it should be indented under the class definition. The function should return whatever _get_service returns, so there's no return statement needed unless specified.

So the code will be a method named ansible_config_manager that takes no parameters and returns the result of _get_service called with the specified service name.
