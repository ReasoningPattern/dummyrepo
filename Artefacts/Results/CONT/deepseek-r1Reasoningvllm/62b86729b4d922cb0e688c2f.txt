Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called base_config, and it takes a user parameter and has default values for etcd_host and etcd_port. The docstring mentions that the configuration should have key parameters: "tls", "authentication", "authorization", "etcd", "docs", and "log".

First, I'll start by defining the function. It should return a dictionary containing the specified keys. The user parameter will be included as well. The etcd parameters will use the provided defaults if not specified.

I'll structure the function to accept the user, etcd_host with a default of "localhost", and etcd_port with a default of 2379. Then, I'll create a config dictionary.

I'll add each key from the docstring. The user is included as a required parameter. For the etcd section, I'll include host and port based on the function parameters. The other keys like tls, authentication, authorization, docs, and log will each have a value of None since their values aren't specified in the defaults.

I need to make sure the function returns this dictionary correctly. Also, I should ensure that the code is clean and follows proper Python syntax without any unnecessary comments or explanations since the user specified not to include any.

Putting it all together, the function will take the user, set the etcd parameters, and populate the rest with None. This should meet the requirements outlined in the docstring.
