Okay, I need to write a Python function called identify_request that checks if the request body contains events when loaded with JSON. The function takes a RequestType parameter and returns a boolean. 

First, I should import the necessary modules. Since the context mentions importing 'json', I'll need to import that. Also, 'logging' is imported, but I'm not sure if I need to use it here. The docstring says to check if the request body has events, so maybe I don't need logging unless I'm logging something else, but the function itself doesn't require it.

Next, I'll need to load the JSON data from the request body. Using json.loads makes sense here. I'll assign it to a variable, maybe data.

Then, I need to check if this data contains events. The RequestType is a generic type, so I'm assuming it's a type that can be subscripted, like a list or a dictionary. To check if it has events, I can use the 'hasattr' function to see if 'events' is an attribute of data. If it is, return True; otherwise, return False.

Putting it all together, the function will import json, load the data, check for the 'events' attribute, and return the boolean result.

I should make sure the code is clean and only includes what's necessary. No extra imports or variables. Also, since the function is straightforward, there's not much else to consider. 

So, the code will import json, define the function, load the data, check for events, and return the result.
