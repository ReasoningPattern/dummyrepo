Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called pretty, and it's part of a class. The docstring explains what it should do.

First, the function takes three parameters: self, indent, and debug. The default for indent is 0, and debug is False. 

The function's purpose is to return a pretty-formatted string representation of self. The first part of the docstring says that if self.obj is a string, it should be enclosed in single quotes. Otherwise, it should use the repr() function on self.obj. 

Then, the formatted string should start with spaces based on the indent parameter. After that, it appends the class name, possibly with debug details, and the formatted self.obj.

Looking at the return statement, it's using an f-string. The debug_details part is a bit tricky because the docstring doesn't specify what to include when debug is True. But since the example in the docstring shows that when self.obj is a string, it's wrapped in single quotes, and for other types, it uses repr(), I can assume that debug_details might include some debug information, perhaps the original object or other debug flags.

I also notice that the example uses f"'{self.obj}'" when self.obj is a string. So, in the code, I need to check if isinstance(self.obj, str). If yes, then use that string. Else, use repr(self.obj).

Putting it all together, the function should look like this:

- Start with the class name and the arguments in parentheses.
- The arguments include debug_details and obj, which are determined by the conditions.
- The obj is the result of either wrapping self.obj in single quotes if it's a string or using repr() otherwise.

I should make sure that the code correctly handles both cases and formats the string as specified. Also, the indentation should be correct, using the indent parameter to add the necessary spaces before the formatted string.

I think that's all. The code should be concise and follow the structure outlined in the docstring.
