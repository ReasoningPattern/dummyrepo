Okay, I need to write a Python function called files_list_from_zipfile that takes a zip_path as an argument and returns the files in that zip. The function should be based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that to work with zip files in Python, the zipfile module is the way to go. So I'll probably need to import zipfile. Also, the context mentions that logging, os, tempfile, shutil, and re are imported, but I'm not sure if I need them here. Since the task is just to list files, maybe only zipfile is necessary.

The function should return the list of files in the given zip. I think using the ZipFile class from zipfile would be appropriate. So I'll open the zip file, iterate over its entries, and collect their names.

Wait, how do I handle different types of zip files? The function might need to support both old and new zip formats. Oh, right, the 'old' and 'new' formats are distinguished by the way they store entries. So when opening the zip, I might need to specify the correct format.

Hmm, but the function signature doesn't include any parameters for that. So perhaps the function should handle both cases. I can open the zip with both modes and iterate through each, then combine the results to avoid duplicates.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Open the zip file in 'old' and 'new' modes.
2. For each mode, extract the list of entries.
3. Combine the entries from both modes to get all unique files.
4. Return the sorted list of these files.

Wait, but if I open the zip twice, once in each mode, that might be inefficient. Alternatively, I can try opening it in both modes and collect the entries each time, then merge them, removing duplicates.

Another approach is to iterate through each entry in both modes and collect them into a set to avoid duplicates.

So, the code structure would be something like:

- Open the zip in 'old' mode, get entries.
- Open the zip in 'new' mode, get entries.
- Combine the entries, ensuring no duplicates.
- Sort the list.
- Return it.

I should also handle exceptions, like if the zip file is invalid. Maybe wrap the code in a try-except block to catch zipfile errors and log them if necessary, but the context doesn't specify logging requirements, so perhaps it's optional.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function using both modes, collect the entries, merge them, sort, and return.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the files, not directories. So I should make sure to exclude directories from the list. How does the ZipFile class handle that? I think when you iterate over the entries, it includes both files and directories. So when I extract the names, I can include them as they are, since the names already indicate whether it's a file or directory.

So the code would look like this:

Import zipfile.

Define the function.

Inside, try:
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zf:
        old_entries = zf.namelist('old')
        new_entries = zf.namelist('new')
        all_files = set(old_entries) | set(new_entries)
        sorted_files = sorted(all_files)
        return sorted_files
except zipfile.PlikNotZipError:
    # Log error if needed
    raise

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the files in the zip, so maybe just return the sorted list of all unique entries.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle exceptions and return the sorted list of files.
