Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _explore_folder and it's supposed to group files in a given folder using _group_files_by_xml_filename. Let me break this down.

First, looking at the function signature: it takes 'folder' as an argument. The docstring says it groups files by using _group_files_by_xml_filename, so I need to call that function somewhere inside _explore_folder.

I should start by importing the necessary modules. The context mentions os, logging, zipfile, and packtools are imported. So I'll include those in the imports.

Next, the function needs to get a list of files in the given folder. I can use os.listdir(folder) for that. But wait, that includes all files and directories. I should filter out only the files. So I'll loop through each item in the list and check if it's a file using os.path.isfile.

Once I have the list of files, I need to process each one. For each file, I'll check if it's a directory or a file. If it's a directory, I should recursively call _explore_folder on it. If it's a file, I'll call _group_files_by_xml_filename, passing the file path and any necessary parameters like prefix, source, and xmls.

Wait, the parameters for _group_files_by_xml_filename aren't clear. The initial call in the code I have is _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files). But in the function signature, the parameters are source, xmls, and files. So I need to make sure that when I call it, I pass the correct arguments. 

In the code, for each file, I'm passing folder, which is the file path, along with prefix, source, and xmls. So the arguments are correct as they are.

I should also handle logging. The context mentions a logger, so I'll import it and use it to log when exploring a directory and when grouping files. That way, we can track the process.

Putting it all together, I'll start by importing the modules. Then, define the function. Inside, I'll get the list of files, loop through each, check if it's a directory or file, and process accordingly. I'll use logging.info for directories and logging.debug for files to provide useful tracking information.

I should make sure that the code is clean and follows best practices, like proper indentation and error handling, but since the problem doesn't specify handling errors, I'll focus on the main logic.

So the final code will import the necessary modules, define the function, and use os and logging to handle the file exploration and grouping.
