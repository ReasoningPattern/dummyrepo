Okay, I need to write a Python function called subprocess_run_helper based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me break down what the function needs to do.

First, the function takes four arguments: func, *args, timeout, and extra_env. The docstring says that this function runs a function in a sub-process. The func is the function to run, and it must be importable from a module. The *args are additional command line arguments passed to subprocess.run. The extra_env is optional and contains additional environment variables.

The function should return a CompletedProcess instance, which I think is what subprocess.run returns. So I need to call subprocess.run with the appropriate arguments.

I remember that subprocess.run has parameters like command, which can be a string or a list. Since func is a function, I need to convert it into a command string. Using inspect to get the arguments of func might be a good approach. So I'll need to import inspect and get the args from func.__code__.co_argcount, then combine them with the provided *args.

Wait, but if func is a function, when I call it from a subprocess, I need to pass its arguments as a list. So I should collect all the arguments, including those from func and any additional args.

Also, the timeout parameter is for subprocess.run, so I'll include that. If extra_env is provided, I need to pass it as the envvar argument in subprocess.run.

Putting it all together, I'll import inspect and subprocess. Then, inside the function, I'll get the arguments for func, combine them with args, create the command string, and call subprocess.run with all the parameters.

I should make sure that if extra_env is None, it's treated as an empty dictionary to avoid errors.

Let me draft the code. I'll start by importing inspect and subprocess. Then, in the function, I'll get the number of arguments func expects using func.__code__.co_argcount. Then, create a list of args by extending [func] with args. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, func is the function, so I need to get its arguments. So the total args for the command string should be the arguments of func plus the provided *args.

So, I'll generate a list of strings where each argument is converted to a string. Then, join them with spaces to form the command string.

Then, call subprocess.run with this command, the timeout, and the envvar if extra_env is provided.

I think that's the plan. Let me write the code accordingly.
