Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_min_max_args and it's part of a class. The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is between the minimum and maximum values.

First, I'll look at the function signature. It's a method, so it starts with def validate_min_max_args(self, args):. The args parameter is likely a list or tuple of values to validate.

Next, I need to implement the validation logic. The function should iterate over each value in args. For each value, I'll check if it's greater than or equal to min_val and less than or equal to max_val. If any value doesn't meet both conditions, the function should raise a ValueError with a message indicating the invalid value and the range.

I should also include a docstring for the method that explains its purpose, arguments, and possible exceptions. The docstring should be concise and follow standard Python conventions.

I'll choose min_val and max_val as class-level attributes. Since the context mentions imports, I'll check if these should be class attributes. They are, so I'll make sure to declare them with the class.

Putting it all together, I'll write the docstring, define the method, and implement the loop with the necessary checks. I'll also make sure to handle cases where min_val is greater than max_val, which would mean no valid values are allowed.

Finally, I'll test the code mentally to ensure it correctly identifies values outside the range and raises the appropriate error.
