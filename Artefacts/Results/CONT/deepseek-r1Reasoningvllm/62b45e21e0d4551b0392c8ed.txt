Okay, I need to write a Python function called find_path_type that determines what kind of object is at a given path. The function should return a string indicating the type.

First, I'll think about the possible types that could be stored at a path. Common types might include integers, strings, lists, dictionaries, booleans, floats, sets, tuples, and None. I should cover all these cases.

I'll start by checking if the value at the path is an integer. Using isinstance(value, int) should work, but I need to make sure it's not a boolean since bool is a subclass of int in Python. So I'll check if the type is exactly bool before checking for int.

Next, for strings, I'll use isinstance(value, str). That's straightforward.

Then, I'll check for lists with isinstance(value, list). Similarly, tuples can be checked with isinstance(value, tuple).

For dictionaries, I'll use isinstance(value, dict). Including None, I'll check if the value is None using value is None.

Booleans come next, but I've already handled them when checking for integers, so I'll make sure to check for bool before int to avoid misclassification.

Floats can be identified with isinstance(value, float).

If none of these types match, the default type is probably something else, like another object or None. So I'll return 'unknown' in that case.

I need to structure the function with these checks in order. Starting from the most specific types to the more general ones to avoid incorrect classifications.

Putting it all together, I'll write each condition in sequence, returning the appropriate string when a match is found. If none match, return 'unknown'.

I should test this logic with various values to ensure it correctly identifies each type. For example, testing with 5, 'hello', [1,2,3], {'a':1}, True, False, 3.14, None, and an arbitrary object like {} should cover all cases.

I think this approach covers all the necessary type checks and handles edge cases like booleans correctly. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
