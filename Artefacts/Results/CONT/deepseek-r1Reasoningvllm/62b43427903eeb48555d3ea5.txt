Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by carefully reading the provided information.

The function is called `format` and it's an instance method, indicated by the `self` parameter. It takes two arguments: `sql` of type `AnyStr` and `params` which is either a `Union` of dictionaries or sequences. The return type is a tuple containing a formatted string and the original parameters.

The docstring says the function converts the SQL string using `self._converter.convert`. So, the main task is to apply this conversion method to the `sql` parameter and return the result along with the original `params`.

First, I'll structure the function. Since it's a method, I'll define it inside a class. The parameters are already given, so I'll include them as `sql: AnyStr` and `params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]`. The return type is `Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]`.

Inside the function, I'll call `self._converter.convert(sql)` to perform the conversion. Then, I'll return a tuple where the first element is the converted SQL string and the second is the original `params`.

I should make sure to import any necessary modules. The context mentions `typing` and `re`, but since the function doesn't use `re`, I might not need to import it unless the `_converter` relies on it. However, the code doesn't show the `_converter`, so I'll proceed without additional imports unless specified.

Putting it all together, the function will look straightforward. It takes the SQL, converts it, and returns the new string along with the original parameters.

I should double-check the return type to ensure it's a tuple of the correct types. The first element is `AnyStr`, which is correct, and the second is the same type as the input `params`.

So, the code should be concise and follow the structure provided. I'll write the function, make sure the parameters are correctly annotated, and return the tuple as specified.
