Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called to_csv and it's a method of a class. The docstring explains what the function does, so I should make sure the code reflects that.

First, the function parameters: self, separator which defaults to ",", and header which is None by default. So I'll set those in the method definition.

The docstring mentions that this function is deprecated, so I should include a deprecation warning. I'll use Python's warnings module for that. I'll check if the deprecated module is imported; if not, I should import it.

Next, the function's purpose is to convert the graph's points into a CSV format. It mentions that if header is not None, it's added as the first line. Also, each point's coordinates are separated by the separator, and each part of the value is also separated by it.

I'll need to loop through each point in self.points. For each point, I'll convert its value to a string, splitting it by the separator. Then, I'll join these parts with the separator. After that, I'll join all the points with newlines.

If the header is provided, I'll add it as the first line before the points, followed by a newline.

I should also handle the case where the points list is empty to avoid empty lines in the output.

Putting it all together, I'll start by importing warnings if it's not already imported. Then, in the function, I'll construct the lines, handle the header, and finally join everything with newlines.

I'll make sure to return a single string with the CSV content. Also, I'll include the deprecation warning using warnings.warn with a message indicating that to_csv is deprecated and suggesting to use ToCSV instead.

Wait, I should check if the warnings module is imported in the context. The user mentioned 'imported packages: warnings', so I don't need to add it. Good.

I'll structure the code step by step: first, handle the deprecation, then process each point, build the lines, add the header if needed, and finally join everything.

I think that covers everything. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
