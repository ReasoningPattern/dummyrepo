Okay, so the user is asking me to generate Python code based on a given function signature and docstring. They provided the function signature as def plugins_manager(cls): and the docstring explaining that it gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions using cls._get_service(), so I should look into how that method works. From the context, I see that there's a method called self._get_service(cls, name), which suggests that this is a class method that can be called with a name argument.

The goal is to call this _get_service method without any arguments and then access the PLUGINS_MANAGER service. So, the function should probably be a class method as well, following the pattern of other methods like setup(cls, core_settings) and plugins_manager(cls).

I should check if the function needs to return the service object or if it just retrieves it. The docstring doesn't specify, but typically, such methods return the service instance. So, the function should return the result of cls._get_service() called without any arguments.

Putting it all together, the function should be a class method that calls _get_service() and returns the service object with the key PLUGINS_MANAGER. I'll make sure to annotate the return type as ServiceName, assuming that ServiceName is a module-level type or similar.

I should also ensure that the code is properly indented and follows Python syntax. Since the function is a class method, it should start with @classmethod decorator. The parameters are cls, but since it's a class method, we don't pass any arguments to it.

So, the code will look like this: a class method that calls _get_service() without arguments and returns the service with the specified key.
