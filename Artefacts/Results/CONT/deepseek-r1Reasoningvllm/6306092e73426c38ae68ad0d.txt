Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by carefully reading the problem.

The function is called create_complex_argument_type and it's part of a class. The parameters are self, subcommand, type_name, option_name, and spec_option. The docstring explains that this function returns a corresponding function from COMPLEX_TYPES based on type_name and then calls complex_action with specific arguments.

First, I notice that COMPLEX_TYPES is a dictionary where keys are type names, and the values are the corresponding functions. So, I'll need to access this dictionary using type_name.

The function should retrieve the appropriate function from COMPLEX_TYPES using type_name. Then, it should call this function with the arguments: complex_action, option_name, a tuple of self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path, subcommand, and spec_option.

I should make sure to use square brackets for accessing the dictionary, as it's a common practice in Python for such lookups. Also, since the function is part of a class, I'll need to include self as the first parameter to access instance variables.

Putting it all together, the function will look up the correct function from COMPLEX_TYPES and execute it with the provided arguments. I'll write the code accordingly, ensuring that the syntax is correct and that all parameters are properly passed.
