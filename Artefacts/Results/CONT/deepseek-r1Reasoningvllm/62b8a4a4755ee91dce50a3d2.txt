Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _fromutc and it's a method of a class. The docstring says that given a timezone datetime in a given timezone, it calculates a timezone datetime in a new timezone. 

Hmm, I remember that in Python, the datetime module has timezones, and perhaps the pytz library is commonly used for timezone handling. So maybe the class is part of a timezone-aware datetime handling, like in a library such as pandas or something similar.

The function takes 'dt' as an argument, which is a datetime object in a specific timezone. It needs to convert this datetime to a new timezone. So I should probably use the pytz library to handle the timezones.

First, I'll need to import pytz. Then, within the method, I'll get the timezone from the 'dt' object. So using dt.tzinfo should give me the timezone information. 

Next, I need to define the new timezone. The docstring doesn't specify how to choose the new timezone, so I'll make it a parameter. I'll add a parameter 'new_tz' with a default value, maybe None. If it's None, the method can convert to UTC, which is a common default.

So, if new_tz is None, I'll create a timezone object for UTC using pytz.timezone('UTC'). Otherwise, I'll parse the new_tz string into a timezone object.

Once I have both the original and new timezones, I'll convert the datetime. The correct method to use is replace(tzinfo=new_tz), because simply changing the tzinfo might not adjust the underlying timestamp correctly. Using replace ensures that the datetime is properly adjusted to the new timezone.

Putting it all together, the method will import pytz, check if new_tz is provided, create the appropriate timezone objects, and then replace the tzinfo of 'dt' with the new_tz.

I should also make sure that the code is properly indented and that all necessary imports are included. Since the function is part of a class, I don't need to import anything inside the method, just at the top of the file.

Wait, the user mentioned to not include any explanation, so I'll just output the code as per the requirements.
