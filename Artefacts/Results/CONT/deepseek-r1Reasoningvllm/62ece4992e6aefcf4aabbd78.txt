Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_local that checks if a given host is localhost. The docstring explains that localhost includes things like 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', local IP, username, and local domain. So the function should return True only for these cases.

First, I'll import the socket module as it's mentioned in the context. The function takes a single argument, host, which can be a hostname or IP address.

I remember that in Python, socket.gethostbyname can resolve a hostname to an IP address, and socket.inet_aton can convert an IP address to an dotted quad string. So I'll use these functions.

I should handle both cases where the host is already an IP address and where it's a hostname. So I'll check if the host is an IP address by trying to convert it using inet_aton. If it is, I'll compare the string to '127.0.0.1'.

If the host is a hostname, I'll resolve it to an IP address and then compare that IP to '127.0.0.1'. Also, I should check if the resolved host is actually localhost by using socket.inet_aton(socket.gethostbyname(host)) and seeing if it equals '127.0.0.1'.

Wait, but what about other localhost-like cases? The function should return True only if the host is exactly localhost or 127.0.0.1. So the condition should be that the resolved IP is '127.0.0.1' and the original host is not None.

I'll structure the function: first, check if the host is None, return False. Then, try to convert the host to an IP address. If it's an IP, compare directly. If it's a hostname, resolve it and compare. If either case matches, return True; else, False.

Testing edge cases: if host is '127.0.0.1', it should return True. If it's 'localhost', also True. If it's '192.168.1.1', it should return False. What about a domain like 'example.comlocalhost'? That's unlikely, but the function would treat it as an IP and check, which might not be correct, but according to the problem, we're only checking for localhost, so perhaps that's acceptable.

Putting it all together, the code should import socket, handle both IP and hostname inputs, and return True only for localhost and 127.0.0.1.
