Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's part of a class. The docstring says it should remove and return the most recently used (key, value) pair. 

Looking at the context provided, I see that the class has methods like __init__, pop, popitem, __update, and others related to cache operations. It's using packages like collections and cachetools. So, this class is probably a custom cache implementation.

The function signature is def popitem(self):, so it's an instance method. The docstring explains that it removes and returns the most recently used item. In Python, the OrderedDict has a popitem method, but since this is a custom cache, it's likely overriding it.

I need to make sure that the popitem method updates the internal state correctly. Typically, when an item is popped, the least recently used item becomes the new least recent. But since this is the most recently used, we might need to adjust the order accordingly.

Wait, in the context, the class has a __setitem__ method, which probably handles adding items. The __order attribute might be tracking the order of items. So, when popitem is called, it should remove the item and update the order so that the next pop would get the new most recent item.

I should check if the __order is a list or another structure. If it's a list, popping from the end would be efficient. But in the code, after popping, the method should update the order so that the popped item is moved to the end, making it the most recent. Wait, no, actually, when you pop the most recent item, the next item becomes the new most recent. So, after popping, we need to add the key to the end of the order list.

Wait, no, in the __setitem__ method, when an item is set, it's moved to the end, making it the most recent. So, when we popitem, we should remove the last item and then insert it back to the front, because the next pop would want the most recent to be the one after that. Hmm, that might not be right.

Let me think again. When you add an item, it's placed at the end, making it the most recent. So, the order list would be [item1, item2, ..., itemN]. When you popitem, you remove itemN, which was the most recent. But after popping, the next most recent becomes itemN-1. So, to maintain the order, after popping, we should add itemN to the front so that it's the most recent before the others. Wait, no, that would make it the most recent, but when you pop again, you'd get it first. That might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after popping, the order list should have the remaining items in the same order, and the popped item is moved to the front. Or maybe the order is maintained such that when you pop, the most recent is the last one, and after popping, the next one is the new last. So, perhaps the order list is a deque, and when you pop, you take from the end, and then append the popped item to the front.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that after popping, the method should update the order so that the next pop will get the new most recent item. So, perhaps the order is maintained in the order of least recent to most recent. So, when you pop the most recent, you remove it, and the next most recent becomes the new most recent. So, in the order list, the popped item should be moved to the front.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is maintained in reverse, with the first item being the least recent and the last being the most recent. So, when you pop, you take the last item, and then insert it at the front so that the next pop will get it as the new most recent.

Wait, looking at the __setitem__ method, which is probably in the same class, I can infer that when an item is set, it's added to the end of the order. So, the order list is ordered from least recent to most recent. So, when you pop the most recent item, you remove the last element, and then you need to move it to the front so that it's considered the most recent for the next operation.

So, in the popitem method, after popping, we take the popped key and value, and then insert the key into the order list at position 0, making it the most recent. Then, we return the (key, value) pair.

Wait, but in the __setitem__ method, when an item is set, it's added to the end, so the order list is [old1, old2, ..., oldN, new]. So, when you popitem, you remove new, and then you need to move new to the front, so the next pop will get it as the most recent. So, in the code, after popping, we insert the key into the order list at position 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is a deque, and when you pop, you pop from the end, and then appendleft the popped key. That way, the most recent is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the order is a list where the last element is the most recent. So, when you pop, you remove the last element, and then insert it at the beginning so that it's the most recent for the next pop.

So, in the code, after popping, we do something like self.__order.insert(0, key). But that might not be efficient if the list is large. Alternatively, using a deque and appending to the left.

But the code provided doesn't show the __order attribute, so I have to assume it's a list or some other structure.

Putting it all together, the popitem method should:

1. Pop the last item from the order list (most recent).
2. Remove it from the cache.
3. Insert the key into the order list at the beginning so it's now the most recent.
4. Return the (key, value) pair.

So, the code would look something like:

def popitem(self):
    key, value = self.popitem()  # Wait, no, self.popitem is the method. So, perhaps we need to get the key and value.

Wait, in the __setitem__ method, when an item is set, it's added to the end. So, the order list is maintained such that the last item is the most recent. So, when we call popitem, we need to remove the last item, and then insert it at the front.

Wait, but the popitem method is supposed to remove and return the most recent. So, in the code, perhaps self.__order.pop() gives the key, and then we insert it at the front.

Wait, perhaps the code should be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("Cache is empty")
    key = self.__order.pop()
    # Or wait, if __order is a list, then pop() removes the last element, which is the most recent.
    # Then, we need to insert it at the front so that it's the most recent for the next pop.
    # So, insert at index 0.
    self.__order.insert(0, key)
    value = self[key]
    self.pop(key)  # Or maybe self.__setitem__(key, value) is called?
    return (key, value)

Wait, but in the __setitem__ method, when you set an item, it's added to the end, making it the most recent. So, perhaps after popping, we need to move it to the front.

Alternatively, perhaps the order list is a deque, and when you pop, you pop from the end, and then append to the front.

But without seeing the entire class, it's a bit tricky. But given the context, I think the order list is a list where the last element is the most recent. So, when you pop, you take the last element, and then insert it at the beginning.

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("Cache is empty")
    key = self.__order.pop()
    self.__order.insert(0, key)
    value = self[key]
    return (key, value)

Wait, but in Python, the popitem() method of OrderedDict returns the last added item, which is the most recent. So, perhaps in this custom cache, the order list is similar. So, when you pop, you get the last item, remove it from the order list, and then insert it at the front so that it's the new most recent.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the code should pop the key, insert it at the front of the order list, and then return the key and value.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("Cache is empty")
    key = self.__order.pop()
    self.__order.insert(0, key)
    value = self[key]
    return (key, value)

Wait, but in the __setitem__ method, when you set an item, it's added to the end, so the order list is ordered from least recent to most recent. So, popping the last item (most recent) and inserting it at the front would make it the new most recent.

Yes, that should work.

So, the final code is as above.
