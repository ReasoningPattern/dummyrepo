Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _getTargetClass, and it's supposed to return the implementation without the 'Py' or 'Fallback' suffix. 

First, looking at the function signature, it's inside a class method since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring explains that this method should return the implementation name without certain suffixes. 

So, the function needs to take a string, probably the fully qualified class name, and strip off 'Py' and 'Fallback'. I remember that in Python, you can split a string by underscores and then join the remaining parts. 

Let me think about how to split the string. Using split('_', 1) will split the string into two parts at the first underscore. Then, I can take the first part, which is the base class name, and join the rest. Alternatively, using split('_', 1)[0] gives me the base, and then I can join the rest using '_'.join(splits[1:]).

Wait, another approach is to split on underscores and then slice the list to exclude the first two elements if they are 'Py' and 'Fallback'. But that might not cover all cases. The initial approach of splitting at the first underscore and then joining the rest seems more reliable.

So the code inside the function would be something like: return '_'.join(split_list[1:]). 

Putting it all together, the function will split the target_class into parts, take the first part, and then join the rest, effectively removing 'Py' and any 'Fallback' suffixes.

I should also make sure that the function handles cases where there are no underscores after the first split. But in the context of class names, that's unlikely, so it should be fine.

So the final code will be a single return statement that splits the input string, takes the first part, and joins the rest with underscores.
