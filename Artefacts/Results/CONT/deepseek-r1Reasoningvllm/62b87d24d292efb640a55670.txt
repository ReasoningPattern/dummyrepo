Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_versions() based on the provided docstring. The docstring says it obtains version information and returns a dictionary with specific keys. If it can't get the version, it returns the default value.

First, I'll start by defining the function with the correct signature. The docstring mentions that if the version info can't be obtained, the default is returned, so I'll include a default parameter.

I'll import the necessary modules like subprocess, re, os, and sys as shown in the context. I'll also need to import git_get_keywords and git_versions_from_keywords since they're referenced in the context.

Next, I'll initialize an empty dictionary to hold the version info. The keys I need are 'major', 'minor', 'micro', 'dev', 'pre', and 'post'. All will be set to None by default.

To get the version, I'll use git_get_keywords to get keywords from a version file. If that fails, it returns None, so I'll handle that case by returning the default dict.

If git_get_keywords is successful, I'll extract the version number using git_versions_from_keywords. This will set the major, minor, micro, and release candidates if possible.

Then, I'll check if a runner is provided. If so, I'll use git_pieces_from_vcs to get more detailed version info, including pre and post versions. This involves running git commands to get the latest commit and branch info.

After fetching the pieces, I'll process them to extract the pre and post versions using the plus_or_dot function and render the necessary parts.

Finally, I'll return the processed version info as a dictionary. If any key isn't found, it will default to None.

I'll make sure to include all necessary imports and handle any potential exceptions, but since the context doesn't specify error handling beyond returning defaults, I'll focus on the successful flow.

Putting it all together, the function will attempt to get the version via git, and if successful, process it into the required format. If any step fails, it'll return the default values.
