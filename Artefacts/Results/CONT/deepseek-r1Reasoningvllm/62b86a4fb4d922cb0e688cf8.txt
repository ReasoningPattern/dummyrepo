Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_value, and it's supposed to validate a given value against a regular expression. 

Looking at the context provided, I see that there are several regex patterns and helper functions involved. There's _get_resource_name_regex() which probably returns a regex pattern for resource names. So, the validate_value function likely needs to use this pattern to check if the value matches.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. The context mentions 're' for regular expressions, so I'll need to import that. Also, since the function is part of a class, I'll use super() to call the parent class's method. The parent's validate_value probably handles basic validation, so I'll keep that simple.

Next, I'll retrieve the regex pattern. The helper function _get_resource_name_regex() is available, so I'll call it without arguments to get the pattern. Then, I'll compile this regex using re.compile() to create a regex object for faster matching.

Now, the validate_value function should take 'value' as an argument. It will first check if the value is a string, just in case someone passes a different type. If it's not a string, I'll raise a TypeError.

Then, I'll use the compiled regex to search the value. If re.search() returns a match object (which it does if there's a match), I'll return True. Otherwise, return False.

I should also make sure to handle any potential exceptions, but since the regex is compiled and the function is straightforward, it might not be necessary unless there are specific error handling requirements not mentioned here.

Putting it all together, the function will import re, call the regex helper, compile it, check the type, and then perform the regex search. That should cover the basic validation as described.
