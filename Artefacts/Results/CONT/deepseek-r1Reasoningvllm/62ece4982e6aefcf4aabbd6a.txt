Alright, I need to write a Python function called replace_dots that replaces all occurrences of '.' in a given string with a specified argument. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function signature is given: def replace_dots(value, arg):. So I know the parameters are value (the string to process) and arg (the string to replace '.' with).

The docstring explains that it replaces all '.' in value with arg. So the function should take each character in value and if it's a '.', replace it with arg.

How can I do this efficiently? Well, one straightforward way is to loop through each character in the string and build a new string. Alternatively, Python has string methods that can help. The replace() method comes to mind. It replaces all occurrences of a substring with another.

Wait, but in this case, the substring is just a single '.', so using replace() should work. So value.replace('.', arg) should do the trick. That's simple and concise.

I should make sure that edge cases are handled. For example, if value is an empty string, replace() will return an empty string, which is correct. If there are no '.', it still returns the original string. So it should handle all cases.

I don't see any imports needed since this is a simple string operation and doesn't rely on external packages.

Putting it all together, the function body will return value.replace('.', arg). That's it. It's efficient and meets the requirements.
