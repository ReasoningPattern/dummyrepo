Okay, so the user is a Python software engineer and they provided a function signature and docstring. They want me to generate Python code based on that without any explanations or markdown. Let me break this down.

First, the function is called try_retrieve_webfinger_document and it takes a handle string as input, returning an Optional[str]. The docstring explains that it tries to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document and doesn't raise an error if it fails. So the function should handle cases where the document isn't found gracefully.

Looking at the context, there are several imported packages: typing, re, logging, datetime, uuid, calendar, urllib, socket, requests, federation. The logger is mentioned, so I'll need to import logging and maybe datetime for timestamps.

The function probably needs to make an HTTP request to fetch the document. Since it's dealing with webfinger documents, which are typically fetched from a server, I'll assume it's making an HTTP GET request. The handle is likely the path or filename of the document.

I should structure the function to first log the start, then attempt to fetch the document. If the fetch fails, it should log the error and return None. If successful, it returns the document content.

I'll need to import requests and maybe socket for any exceptions, but since requests handles most HTTP errors, I'll focus on that. Also, logging should be handled with the logger variable, but since it's not provided, I'll just use logging module.

Putting it all together, the function will log the attempt, use requests.get with the handle URL, handle possible exceptions, and return the content or None.

I should make sure to include try-except blocks to catch exceptions like requests.exceptions.RequestException and handle them by logging and returning None.

So the code will start with logging.info, attempt the request, catch exceptions, log any errors, and return the content or None.
