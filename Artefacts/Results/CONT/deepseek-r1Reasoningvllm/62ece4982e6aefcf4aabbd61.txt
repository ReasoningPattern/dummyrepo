Alright, I need to write a Python function called _dictsum that takes a list of dictionaries and returns a new dictionary where the values with the same keys are summed. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should figure out what the function needs to do. The example given shows that when you have two dictionaries, dict1 and dict2, the function should add their values for the same keys. So, for 'a', it's 1 + 5 = 6, and for 'b', it's 2 + 0 = 2.

I'll start by initializing an empty dictionary to hold the summed values. Then, I'll loop through each dictionary in the input list. For each dictionary, I'll loop through its key-value pairs. If the key is already in the result dictionary, I'll add the current value to it. If not, I'll create a new entry with the key and the value.

Wait, but the function signature shows that the parameter is 'dicts', which is a list of dictionaries. So I need to make sure I'm iterating over each dictionary in that list.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary, let's call it result.
2. Iterate over each dictionary in the dicts list.
3. For each dictionary, iterate over its items (key, value).
4. For each key-value pair:
   a. If the key is in result, add the value to result[key].
   b. If the key is not in result, set result[key] to the value.

That makes sense. Now, how to implement this in code.

I'll start with the function definition:

def _dictsum(dicts):
    result = {}
    for d in dicts:
        for key, value in d.items():
            if key in result:
                result[key] += value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but what if the dicts list is empty? The function should return an empty dictionary, which this code handles.

Testing the example:

dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'a': 5, 'b': 0}
 dicts = [dict1, dict2]
The function should return {'a':6, 'b':2}.

Let me see: for 'a', it's 1 in dict1, then 5 in dict2, so 6. For 'b', 2 and 0 sum to 2. Correct.

What if there are more than two dicts? It should still sum all values correctly.

What about duplicate keys in different dicts? The code handles that by adding each time.

I think this should work. I don't see any edge cases that would cause issues, like non-dictionary items in the dicts list, but since the function is supposed to handle dictionaries, perhaps that's outside the scope.

So the code should be as written.
