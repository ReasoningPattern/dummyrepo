Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _convert_non_cli_args and takes two parameters: parser_name and values_dict. The docstring explains that this function casts arguments to their correct types, with all values initially being strings.

First, I'll look at the context provided. It mentions several methods and packages imported, but the main focus is on the function itself. The function is part of a class, as indicated by the trailing semicolon and the context showing class methods.

I know that in Python, argument parsing is often done using argparse. The function likely processes command-line arguments that were not explicitly provided by the user (non-CLI args) and converts them to the correct data types.

Since the function is part of a class, it probably has access to instance variables or methods that define how each argument should be converted. So, I should include a loop that iterates over each key-value pair in values_dict.

For each key, I need to check if the argument should be an integer, float, boolean, or string. The context mentions methods like self._get_defaults and self.defaults, which might hold the expected types for each argument.

I'll start by iterating through values_dict.items(). For each key, I'll determine the type based on the class's configuration. If the type is int, I'll convert the value using int(). Similarly, for float and boolean. If no specific type is set, I'll keep it as a string.

I should also consider that some arguments might not need conversion, so I'll include a condition to check if the type is not None before converting.

Putting it all together, the code will loop through each argument, check the type, convert if necessary, and store the result back in values_dict.

I need to make sure the code is clean and efficient, handling each case appropriately without unnecessary complexity.
