Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _get_resource_name_regex() and it's supposed to return regular expressions used to validate Krake resource names.

First, I'll look at the context provided. There are several variables and functions mentioned like _label_key_pattern, _label_value_pattern, etc., which might be related to resource names. But the main focus is on creating regex patterns.

I notice that the function returns a tuple of two regex patterns. So, I'll need to create two regular expressions.

The first regex, _resource_name_pattern, seems to check for alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens. It should allow lowercase letters and numbers, but also uppercase letters. So, using [a-zA-Z0-9] covers that, plus the underscore and hyphen. The pattern should start with [a-zA-Z0-9] to ensure it doesn't match empty strings. The re.IGNORECASE flag will make it case-insensitive.

The second regex, _resource_name_regex, is similar but allows dots as well. So, I'll add the dot character to the character set. Again, starting with [a-zA-Z0-9] and using the IGNORECASE flag.

I should import the re module to use these flags and patterns. Then, define each regex pattern as a string with the appropriate characters and flags.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function, define the two patterns, and return them as a tuple. I'll make sure to include the re.IGNORECASE flag in both to allow case variations.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
