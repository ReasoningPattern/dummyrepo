Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called names, part of a class, and it takes an optional parameter 'all' which defaults to False. The docstring says it returns the attribute names of the current class.

First, I remember that in Python, to get the list of attributes or variables in a class, you can use the __dict__ attribute. But wait, __dict__ gives all instance attributes, not class-level attributes. Oh right, to get the class attributes, you need to access the __annotations__ or __dict__ of the class itself, not an instance.

Wait, but the function is part of a class, so inside the class method, 'self' refers to an instance. To get the class's own attributes, I should look at self.__class__.__dict__. That makes sense because __class__ gives the class of the instance, and then __dict__ gives its attributes.

So the function should return self.__class__.__dict__. But wait, what about if the class has attributes that are not meant to be part of the public API? Maybe using dir() would include more, but the problem says to return the attribute names, so perhaps it's intended to return the class's own attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the attributes of the instance, but the docstring says "current class", so it's likely the class's attributes.

Putting it all together, the function will return self.__class__.__dict__. But wait, __dict__ returns a dictionary, but the problem says to return the attribute names. So perhaps it should return a list of the attribute names.

Wait, the function is called names, and the docstring says to return the attribute names. So maybe it's supposed to return a list of strings, each being the name of an attribute.

So, to get the attribute names, I can use self.__class__.__dict__.keys(), which gives a view of the attribute names. But if 'all' is True, maybe I need to include something else? Or perhaps 'all' is a parameter that affects the return value.

Wait, the current code I have is:

def names(self, all=False):
    return self.__class__.__dict__.keys()

But if 'all' is True, maybe it's supposed to return all attributes, including inherited ones. But __class__.__dict__ only includes the attributes of the current class, not those inherited from superclasses. So if 'all' is True, perhaps I need to include all attributes from the entire hierarchy.

Hmm, how can I get all the attributes, including inherited ones? Maybe using vars(), but that might include more than just the class attributes. Alternatively, perhaps using the __dict__ of the entire module or something, but that's not right.

Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify what 'all' does. It just says when all=False, return the attribute names. So perhaps for now, I'll proceed with the initial code, and if 'all' is True, maybe we need to do something else, but without more context, I'll stick to the basic implementation.

So the code would be as I wrote before. I think that's the correct approach given the information provided.
