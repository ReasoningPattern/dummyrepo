Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the validate_key function based on the given function signature and docstring. They mentioned not to include any explanations or markdown, just the code in python markdown format.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it validates the key against a regular expression. The context mentions some variables like _label_key_pattern, _label_key_regex, and _get_labels_regex. So probably, the function uses one of these regex patterns to check if the key is valid.

Looking at the context, there's a mention of _label_key_regex. Maybe that's the regex pattern used for validating keys. The function might compile this regex and check if the key matches.

Wait, the function is called validate_key, and the parameters are just 'key'. So the code should take the key string and check against the regex. Also, the context shows that _get_labels_regex() is defined, which might return the regex pattern. But the function might be using _label_key_regex directly.

So the steps would be: compile the regex pattern (if not already compiled), then use match or fullmatch to check the key. Since the docstring says "validate against the corresponding regular expression," it's likely that the regex is predefined.

Assuming that _label_key_regex is a precompiled regex object, the function can simply check if the key matches. But maybe the regex is stored as a string in _label_key_pattern, which is then compiled when needed.

Wait, in the context, there's _label_key_pattern and _label_key_regex. Maybe _label_key_regex is the compiled version. So the function can use that.

So the code would be something like:

import re

def validate_key(key):
    """
    Validate the given key against the corresponding regular expression.
    """
    if not _label_key_regex.fullmatch(key):
        raise ValueError("Invalid key format")

But wait, the user's context shows that _label_key_regex is defined somewhere. So the function would use that. But since the user hasn't provided the actual regex patterns, I need to infer based on common practices.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the _get_labels_regex() function, which returns the regex. But without knowing the exact pattern, I have to make an educated guess.

Another possibility is that the key needs to match a specific pattern, like DNS labels. For example, a regex that allows letters, numbers, hyphens, and starts/ends with letters or numbers.

So perhaps the regex is something like ^[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?$.

But since the user's context includes _label_key_pattern and _label_key_regex, maybe those are defined elsewhere. However, since the user hasn't provided them, I need to create the regex within the function.

Wait, but the user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The existing code in the context might have those variables defined. But since they aren't provided, perhaps the function uses a predefined regex.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has these variables. But the user's context shows that the function is within a file, not a class. So perhaps the variables like _label_key_regex are global.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual regex patterns, I need to make assumptions. Let's assume that _label_key_regex is a compiled regex pattern. So the function would check if the key matches that pattern.

So the code would be:

import re

def validate_key(key):
    """
    Validate the given key against the corresponding regular expression.
    """
    if not _label_key_regex.fullmatch(key):
        raise ValueError("Invalid key format")

But wait, the user's context includes imported packages like re, so that's okay. However, the function might need to compile the regex if it's not already compiled. But if _label_key_regex is already a compiled regex, then this code would work.

Alternatively, if the pattern is stored as a string in _label_key_pattern, then the function would compile it. For example:

def validate_key(key):
    """
    Validate the given key against the corresponding regular expression.
    """
    pattern = _label_key_pattern
    if not re.fullmatch(pattern, key):
        raise ValueError("Invalid key format")

But since the user's context mentions _label_key_regex, perhaps it's already compiled. So using fullmatch is appropriate.

Another consideration: the function might need to check that the entire string matches the regex, not just a substring. Hence, using fullmatch instead of match.

Putting it all together, the code would import re, use the predefined _label_key_regex, and check for a full match. If not, raise an error.

So the final code would be as follows.
