Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function _shuffled based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to shuffle a sequence using a fixed random seed. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a sequence of strings and returns a list of strings. The key point is that the shuffling must use a fixed random seed. That means I need to set a specific seed value before shuffling. But wait, the docstring mentions a FIXED_RANDOM_SEED, which is probably a constant defined somewhere in the code. Since the user mentioned that the function is part of a larger codebase with imports like random, I should use the random module's shuffle function.

Wait, the user provided some context about imported packages, including 'random'. So I can use random.shuffle. But to ensure the same seed is used every time, I need to set the seed using random.seed(). However, the docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". So the function probably uses a predefined seed value. But how is that seed determined? The user hasn't provided the value, but maybe it's a constant in the code. Since the function is named _shuffled, maybe the seed is set inside the function.

Wait, the user's context shows that within the file, there's a FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. So the function should use that constant. But since the code is to be generated, I need to assume that FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is defined elsewhere. So in the function, I should set the random seed to that value before shuffling.

So the steps are: import random, set the seed to FIXED_RANDOM_SEED, shuffle the sequence, and return the result. But wait, the function's parameters are seq: Sequence[str], so I need to make sure that the input is a sequence. The function should return a list of strings.

Wait, the function returns a list[str], so the input sequence is converted into a list? Or maybe the input is a list. But the parameter is a Sequence, so perhaps it's a list or another sequence type. However, the function needs to shuffle it. So perhaps the function converts the sequence into a list, shuffles it, and returns the list.

Wait, the function is called _shuffled, and the docstring says "Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". So the function should take the sequence, shuffle it using the fixed seed, and return the shuffled list.

So the code would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    shuffled_seq = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_seq)
    return shuffled_seq

But wait, the user's context shows that the function is part of a codebase where FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is defined. So the code should reference that constant. However, the user hasn't provided the value, so the code will use the constant as is.

But the user's context also includes other functions and variables, like SHIMS_RE, exe_exists, etc. But for this function, the main thing is to use the random module and the fixed seed.

Wait, but in Python, if you set the seed and then shuffle, the same sequence will be shuffled the same way each time. So the code should set the seed, then shuffle the list.

But the function's parameter is a Sequence, so converting it to a list is necessary because shuffle modifies the list in place. So the code would create a list from the sequence, shuffle it, and return it.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    shuffled = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled)
    return shuffled

But wait, the user's context includes 'imported Packages: os typing random multiprocessing __future__ re', so the code should import random. However, the function is part of a codebase where the imports are already handled. But the user's code may not have the import, so maybe the function is in a module that already imports random. However, to be safe, the code should include the import. But the user's context shows that 'random' is imported, so perhaps the code doesn't need to import it again. But the function's code will need to use random, so the import is necessary.

Wait, but the user's context says that the function is within a file that has imported 'random', so maybe the code doesn't need to import it again. However, in Python, the import is at the top of the module. So the function code can use random without importing again. But the code generated here should include the import statement?

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function's code will need to use the random module, so the import should be present. However, the user's context shows that 'random' is already imported. So perhaps the code doesn't need to import it again. But in practice, the function's code would need to have the import. However, the user's code may have the import at the top. But since the user's code is not provided, the generated code should include the necessary imports.

But the user's context shows that the function is part of a codebase where 'random' is imported. So maybe the code doesn't need to import it again. However, the generated code should include the import statement. Or maybe the function is in a module where 'random' is already imported. But the user's code may not have that. So to be safe, the code should include the import.

But the user's context shows that the function is in a file that has imported 'random', so perhaps the code doesn't need to import again. However, the generated code may not have that. So perhaps the code should include the import.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a module that already has the import. But the user's code may not have it. So the generated code should include the import.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the necessary imports. However, the user's context shows that 'random' is imported, so perhaps the code can assume that. But in practice, the function would need to import random. So the code should include the import.

But the user's code may have the import at the top. So the generated function code would not need to import again. However, the generated code may not have that. So perhaps the code should include the import.

But the user's code may have the import, so the function can use random without importing again. However, the generated code may not have that. So I need to decide whether to include the import.

Looking back, the user's context says that the function is part of a codebase where 'random' is imported. So the code can assume that the import is present. Therefore, the function code can use random without importing again. Therefore, the generated code does not need to include the import statement.

So the code would be:

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    shuffled = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled)
    return shuffled

But wait, the function uses 'Sequence' from the typing module. So the code should import Sequence from typing. However, the user's context includes 'imported Packages: os typing random multiprocessing __future__ re', so 'typing' is imported. Therefore, the code can use Sequence without importing again.

But the code may need to import Sequence. However, the user's code may have that already. So the generated code can assume that.

So the final code would be as above. But the user's context shows that the function is part of a codebase where 'FIXED_RANDOM_SEED' is defined. Therefore, the code uses that constant.

So the generated code is as written.
