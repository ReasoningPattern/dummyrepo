Okay, let me try to figure out how to generate the Python code for the get_spec_defaults method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user mentioned that I should not include any explanations or markdown, just the code in Python markdown format.

First, looking at the function signature: it's a method called get_spec_defaults belonging to a class, as indicated by the self parameter. The docstring says it resolves arguments' values from the spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). 

Now, considering the context provided, there are several other methods and variables mentioned, like self._get_defaults, self.defaults, and others related to argument parsing and validation. The function seems to be part of a class that handles command-line argument processing, possibly using a spec dictionary and various validation methods.

The docstring mentions resolving arguments from the spec and other sources, so the method might be gathering default values from the spec and possibly other sources like environment variables or configuration files. The _get_defaults method is probably a helper that retrieves these defaults.

Looking at the context, there's a mention of self._get_defaults being called. So the get_spec_defaults method might be calling this helper method. Also, there are methods like validate_arg_sources, which could be involved in ensuring that the sources of the arguments are valid.

I need to structure the code so that get_spec_defaults calls self._get_defaults, perhaps passing some parameters. The parameters might include the spec, or other sources. But since the function signature doesn't have parameters listed, maybe it's using the class's attributes like self.spec_dict or self.defaults_dir.

Wait, the __init__ method of the class has parameters like spec_dict, defaults_dir, etc. So the get_spec_defaults might be using those. But the function signature as given doesn't have parameters, so the method is likely using instance variables.

So the code for get_spec_defaults would probably call self._get_defaults, maybe with some arguments. But since the docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()", the method might be invoking that helper function.

Looking at the context, there's a mention of self._get_defaults(self, default_getter_func). So perhaps the method is calling self._get_defaults with a default_getter_func. But the function signature of get_spec_defaults doesn't have parameters, so maybe it's using a default function.

Alternatively, maybe the method is simply calling self._get_defaults without parameters. But the context shows that _get_defaults has a parameter default_getter_func. Hmm, perhaps the get_spec_defaults method is using a specific default getter function.

Alternatively, maybe the method is gathering defaults from the spec and other sources, then passing them to _get_defaults. But without more information, it's a bit tricky.

Given the lack of parameters in the function signature, the code would likely be something like:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    self._get_defaults()

But wait, the docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()", which suggests that the method is using _get_defaults to do the actual work. So the code would call self._get_defaults, possibly with some parameters.

But since the function signature doesn't have parameters, maybe it's using the class's attributes. For example, maybe the _get_defaults method is called with the spec_dict or other variables.

Alternatively, looking at the context, there's a method called self._get_defaults(self, default_getter_func). So perhaps the get_spec_defaults method is passing a specific default_getter_func to _get_defaults.

But without knowing the exact parameters, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given the information, the most straightforward implementation would be to call self._get_defaults(), assuming that it's designed to handle the resolution of defaults from the spec and other sources.

Another possibility is that the method is collecting defaults from the spec and other sources, then passing them to _get_defaults. But again, without more details, it's hard to say.

Given the constraints, the code would likely be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    self._get_defaults()

But maybe there's more to it. For example, perhaps it's gathering defaults from the spec and other sources, then merging them. However, the docstring indicates that the method uses self._get_defaults(), so the code should call that method.

Another thing to consider is that the method might be part of a larger argument processing pipeline. For instance, after parsing CLI arguments, the method might resolve defaults from the spec and other sources. But again, without more context, the code is likely to be a simple call to _get_defaults.

So, the final code would be the method calling self._get_defaults(), possibly with parameters. But since the function signature doesn't have parameters, and the context shows that _get_defaults has a parameter, maybe the code is:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    self._get_defaults(self._get_defaults)

Wait, but that would pass self._get_defaults as the default_getter_func. Alternatively, maybe it's using a different function. However, without knowing the exact parameters, it's safer to assume that the method calls self._get_defaults without parameters, or with some default parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is using the spec_dict and defaults_dir from the __init__ method. For example:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    self._get_defaults(self.spec_dict, self.defaults_dir)

But again, without knowing the exact parameters of _get_defaults, it's hard to say. However, the context shows that in the __init__ method, the parameters include spec_dict, defaults_dir, etc. So maybe the get_spec_defaults method is using those.

But given the lack of information, the safest bet is to write the method as calling self._get_defaults(), assuming that it's designed to handle the resolution of defaults from the spec and other sources.

So the final code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    self._get_defaults()

But I need to check if there's any other context. The user mentioned that the method is part of a class with various other methods, and the _get_defaults is a method that's called. So the code would be as simple as calling that method.
