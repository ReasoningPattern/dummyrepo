Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called string_to_int that converts a string into an integer based on a given alphabet. The function takes two parameters: a string and a list of characters. The goal is to map each character in the string to its position in the alphabet list and then calculate the corresponding number.

First, I should check if the string contains only characters from the alphabet. But the docstring says that the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so maybe I don't need to handle invalid cases. But maybe the function should still handle them? The problem statement says to assume the string is valid, so perhaps no error checking is needed.

Next, each character in the string corresponds to a digit in a base equal to the length of the alphabet. For example, if the alphabet has 10 characters, it's like base 10. So the first character is the most significant digit. Wait, but how to convert that into a number. For example, if the string is 'abc' and the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2. So the number would be 0 * 3^2 + 1 * 3^1 + 2 * 3^0 = 0 + 3 + 2 = 5. Wait, but maybe the first character is the least significant digit? Or is it the most significant? That's a crucial point.

Wait, the problem says "the corresponding number of the given string using the given transition rule." The example isn't given, but the usual way is that the leftmost character is the most significant digit. For example, in base conversion, the leftmost digit is the highest place value. So for 'abc' with alphabet ['a','b','c'], the value would be a * len(alphabet)^(n-1) + b * len(alphabet)^(n-2) + ... + c * len(alphabet)^0, where n is the length of the string.

But wait, maybe the function is similar to how a number is represented in a different base. For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b'], then 'ab' would be 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 2. Wait, but 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1. So 'ab' would be 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 1? Or is it the other way around? This is ambiguous. But the problem says that the string is made of letters in the alphabet, so perhaps the first character is the most significant. But how to determine that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to treat the string as a sequence of digits in a base equal to the length of the alphabet. For example, each character's position in the alphabet is a digit, and the number is the sum of each digit multiplied by the base raised to the power of their position from the right. For example, the string 'ab' with alphabet ['a','b'] would be 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 1. But if the first character is the most significant, then 'ab' would be 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 1. Wait, that's the same as before. Wait, no. If the string is 'ab', then the first character is 'a' which is 0, and the second is 'b' which is 1. So the number would be 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 1. But if the first character is the most significant, then it's 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0. So that's the same as the usual base conversion. So the way to compute it is to process each character from left to right, multiplying the current result by the base and adding the value of the current character.

Wait, let's think of it as a base conversion. For example, the string 'abc' with alphabet ['a','b','c'] would be 0 * 3^2 + 1 * 3^1 + 2 * 3^0 = 0 + 3 + 2 = 5. Alternatively, if you process each character left to right, starting with 0, then for each character, you do current = current * base + value. So for 'a', current is 0. Then 'b' is 0*3 + 1 = 1. Then 'c' is 1*3 + 2 = 5. Which gives the same result. So that's the approach. So the algorithm is:

Initialize result as 0.

For each character in the string:

   result = result * len(alphabet) + position of the character in the alphabet.

So that's the way to compute it.

So first, I need to map each character in the string to its index in the alphabet. So for each character in the string, find its index in the alphabet list. Then, compute the result as above.

So the steps are:

1. Check that each character in the string is present in the alphabet. But the docstring says the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so maybe we don't need to handle that. But perhaps the function should still handle it? Well, the problem says to assume that the string is valid, so maybe no error checking is needed.

2. For each character in the string, get its index in the alphabet.

3. Compute the number using the base conversion method.

So, in Python code:

First, the function is given 'string' and 'alphabet'. The alphabet is a list of strings. So for each character in the string, we need to find its index in the alphabet. So for example, for 'a' in the alphabet, index is 0.

So, for each char in string:

   index = alphabet.index(char)

But using .index() is O(n) for each lookup. However, given that the alphabet is a list, and assuming that the alphabet is not too big, this is acceptable. Alternatively, we can create a dictionary for O(1) lookups. But since the problem says that the string consists of letters in the alphabet, perhaps it's safe to use .index().

But for efficiency, perhaps creating a dictionary is better. So, perhaps:

char_to_index = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(alphabet)}

Then, for each char in string, get the index from the dictionary.

But the problem says that the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so the dictionary will have all the necessary keys.

So, the code steps:

- Create a dictionary mapping each character in the alphabet to its index.

- Initialize result as 0.

- For each char in the string:

   result = result * len(alphabet) + char_to_index[char]

- Return result.

So, putting that into code.

Now, the function signature is given. The parameters are string (str) and alphabet (List[str]). The return is int.

So, in Python code:

from typing import List

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    char_to_index = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(alphabet)}
    result = 0
    for char in string:
        result = result * len(alphabet) + char_to_index[char]
    return result

Wait, but what if the alphabet is empty? Well, the problem says that the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so the alphabet must have at least one character. So no need to handle that case.

Testing this function with an example. Let's say alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], string is 'ab'.

char_to_index is {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2}.

result starts at 0.

First character 'a': 0 * 3 + 0 = 0.

Second character 'b': 0 *3 +1 = 1. So returns 1. Which is correct as 'ab' would be 0*3 +1 =1.

Another example: string 'abc' with same alphabet. The result would be 0*3 +0=0, then 0*3 +1=1, then 1*3 +2=5. Which is 5, which matches the earlier calculation.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the code should be as written.
