Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_config function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it returns a new VersioneerConfig instance and sets various attributes. So first, I'll create the function def get_config(): and then return a VersioneerConfig object.

But wait, the VersioneerConfig class isn't defined here. Maybe it's part of the existing code in the file. Since the user mentioned other functions like get_keywords and register_vcs_handler, perhaps VersioneerConfig is a class that's already defined elsewhere in the module. So I don't need to define it here.

The function needs to return a new instance. So the code would be something like return VersioneerConfig(). But the docstring mentions setting various attributes. So maybe the function initializes the config with some default values or sets certain attributes.

Looking at the context, there are other functions like get_keywords, register_vcs_handler, etc. Maybe the VersioneerConfig class has attributes related to version control systems, keywords, and version rendering. For example, attributes like vcs, keywords, tag_prefix, verbose, etc.

So the get_config function might initialize these attributes. Let me think about possible attributes. Maybe it sets up the VCS handler, initializes keywords, sets the tag prefix, and verbose flag. Also, perhaps it registers the VCS handlers.

Wait, the function register_vcs_handler is mentioned in the context. So maybe get_config is setting up the VCS handlers. But the function's docstring says it returns a new VersioneerConfig and sets various attributes. So perhaps the function is initializing the config with default settings.

Let me think of possible attributes. The VersioneerConfig might have attributes like vcs, keywords, tag_prefix, verbose, and maybe a runner. Also, maybe it's setting up the default VCS handler.

So the code for get_config could be:

def get_config():
    """
    Return a new VersioneerConfig() and set various attribute of it.
    """
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.vcs = 'git'  # or some default
    config.keywords = get_keywords()
    config.tag_prefix = 'v'
    config.verbose = False
    # Maybe register default VCS handlers
    register_vcs_handler('git', 'git')
    return config

But I need to make sure that the attributes are set correctly. However, without knowing the exact structure of VersioneerConfig, it's a bit tricky. But given the context, perhaps the function is initializing the config with default values and setting up the necessary attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the function is just returning a new instance with some default settings. Since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, I have to make educated guesses based on the context.

Another possibility is that the function is setting up the config with default values for the VCS, keywords, and other parameters. For example, setting the VCS to 'git' by default, initializing keywords, and setting the tag prefix.

So the code could be:

def get_config():
    """
    Return a new VersioneerConfig() and set various attribute of it.
    """
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.vcs = 'git'
    config.keywords = get_keywords()
    config.tag_prefix = 'v'
    config.verbose = False
    register_vcs_handler('git', 'git')
    return config

But I'm not entirely sure. However, given the information, this seems like a plausible implementation. The function returns a new VersioneerConfig instance, sets some attributes, and registers the VCS handler for 'git'. This would align with the context provided, where functions like git_get_keywords and git_versions_from_keywords are present, suggesting that Git is the default VCS.

So I'll proceed with this code.
