Okay, let's see. I need to create a Python function called make_find_paths that takes a sequence of paths and transforms them into glob patterns. The existing patterns should remain untouched. The user mentioned using the re module, so I should probably use regular expressions for this.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a glob pattern. Glob patterns typically use wildcards like * (matches any number of characters), ? (matches a single character), and [set] for character sets. But the problem says to transform all paths into glob patterns, but leave existing patterns as they are. Wait, how do I determine if a path is already a pattern?

Hmm, maybe the existing patterns are those that already contain these wildcards. So the function should check each path: if it contains any of the glob wildcards, leave it as is. Otherwise, convert it into a glob pattern by adding wildcards around it. Wait, but the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So perhaps the existing patterns are those that already have the glob syntax. So the function should check if a path is already a glob pattern. If it is, leave it. If not, convert it into a glob pattern.

But how to detect if a path is already a glob pattern? For example, if the path has * or ? or [ etc. So maybe the function should check if any of the glob special characters are present. If they are, leave it as is. Otherwise, add * around it? Or maybe add a wildcard at the end? Wait, the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns". So maybe the intention is to make each path a glob pattern, which usually means adding a wildcard at the end. But if the path already has wildcards, leave it.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to take paths that are exact and convert them into patterns that can match files. For example, a path like 'file.txt' would become 'file.txt*' to match any file starting with 'file.txt'. But if the path already has a wildcard, like 'file*.txt', leave it as is.

So the approach would be: for each path in find_paths, check if it contains any of the glob pattern characters. If it does, leave it. Otherwise, add a '*' at the end to make it a glob pattern.

But how to check for existing patterns? Let's think about the glob characters: *, ?, [ etc. So perhaps we can use a regular expression to check if the path contains any of these. For example, the regex [*?[] would match any of these characters. Wait, but [ is a special character in regex, so we need to escape it. So the regex pattern would be [*\?[\[].

Wait, maybe the function should check if the path contains any of the glob special characters. So, if any of * ? [ are present, then it's considered a pattern and left as is. Otherwise, convert it into a pattern by adding a * at the end.

So the steps for each path:

1. Check if the path contains any of the glob characters (*, ?, [). If yes, leave it as is.
2. If not, add a * at the end to make it a glob pattern.

But how to implement this? Using the re module. So, for each path, check if re.search(r'[*?[\[]', path) is not None. Wait, but the regex needs to match any of those characters. So the pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but in a regex, the [ is a special character, so we need to escape it. Wait, in a regex, to match a literal [ or ], you need to escape them. So the regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but maybe I need to use a regex that matches any of those characters. Let me think: the regex [*\?[\[] would match any of *, ?, [ or ].

Wait, but in regex, the [ is used to start a character class. So to match a literal [ or ], you need to escape them. So the correct pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but perhaps I should use a regex that matches any of the glob characters. Let me think: the glob characters are *, ?, [ and ] (since [ is used for character ranges, but ] is also a special character). Wait, but in a glob pattern, [ is used to start a character set, and ] is used to end it. So, for example, [abc] matches a, b, or c. So, if a path contains [ or ], it's part of a character set. So, perhaps the function should consider any occurrence of * or ? or [ as indicating that the path is already a pattern. But how to check for that?

Alternatively, maybe the function should check if the path contains any of the glob pattern characters. So, if the path has any of *, ?, [ or ] (since ] is part of a character set in glob patterns), then it's considered a pattern. But how to detect that with regex?

Alternatively, perhaps the function should check if the path contains any of the characters that are part of glob syntax. So, for example, if the path has * or ? or [ or ] (since those are used in glob patterns), then it's considered a pattern. But maybe the presence of [ or ] is not sufficient, because they could be part of a normal path, like a directory named [abc]. But perhaps the function is intended to treat any occurrence of these characters as part of a glob pattern.

So, perhaps the approach is: for each path, check if it contains any of the characters * ? [ or ]. If it does, leave it as is. Otherwise, add a * at the end.

But how to implement this? Using re.search with a regex pattern that matches any of these characters. So the regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but I need to escape the ] inside the character class. Wait, in a regex, to match a literal ] inside a character class, you can escape it with a backslash, but in a regex pattern, you need to write it as \]. However, in a regex, the [ is used to start a character class, so to match a literal [ or ], you need to escape them. So the regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but I need to make sure that the ] is properly escaped.

Wait, let's think about the regex pattern. To match any of the characters *, ?, [ or ], the regex would be [*\?[\[] — but in a regex, the [ is the start of a character class, so to match a literal [ or ], you need to escape them. So the correct pattern is [*\?[\[] — but I need to write it as a regex string. Let me think:

The regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but in Python, to represent this as a string, I need to escape the backslashes. Wait, no. Let me think again. The regex pattern to match any of *, ?, [ or ] would be [*\?[\[] — because:

- The [ starts the character class.
- * is a literal *.
- ? is a literal ?.
- \ is needed to escape the [ and ] inside the character class. Wait, no. Wait, inside a character class, the [ and ] are treated as literal characters if they are not the first or last character. Wait, no. Actually, in a regex character class, the [ is only special if it's the first character. So, for example, [abc] matches a, b, or c. If you want to match a literal [ or ], you can include them in the character class. For example, [a-z[]] would match any lowercase letter or [ or ].

So, to match any of *, ?, [ or ], the regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but I need to make sure that the ] is properly placed. Let me think:

The correct regex pattern to match any of *, ?, [ or ] is [*\?[\[] — but in Python, when writing this as a string, I need to escape the backslashes. Wait, no. Let me think again. The regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — but in Python, to represent this as a string, I need to write it as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is an escape character. Wait, no. Let me think:

The regex pattern to match any of *, ?, [ or ] is [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string should be written as r'[*\?[\[]' — because:

- The [ starts the character class.
- * is a literal *.
- ? is a literal ?.
- \ is used to escape the [ and ] inside the character class. Wait, no. Wait, inside a character class, the [ and ] are treated as literal characters if they are not the first or last character. So, to include a literal [ in the character class, you can just put it in there. Similarly for ].

Wait, for example, the regex [a-z[]] would match any lowercase letter, or [ or ].

So, to match any of *, ?, [ or ], the regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string should be written as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is used to escape the ] in the character class. Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's break down the pattern:

The regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — which is:

- [ starts the character class.
- * is a literal *.
- ? is a literal ?.
- \ is used to escape the [ and ] inside the character class. Wait, no. Wait, inside the character class, the [ and ] are treated as literal characters if they are not the first or last. So, to include a literal [ in the character class, you can just put it in there. Similarly for ].

Wait, but if I want to match a literal [ or ], I can include them in the character class. So, the pattern [*\?[\[] would match any of *, ?, [ or ].

Wait, but in the regex, the ] is the last character in the character class. So, if I want to match a literal ], I need to put it in the character class. But if it's the last character, it's not necessary to escape it. Wait, no. For example, the regex [a-z] matches a-z. If I want to match a literal ], I can write [a-z]] — but that would match a-z or ].

So, to match any of *, ?, [ or ], the regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string should be written as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is used to escape the ] in the character class. Wait, no. Let me think: the regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is used to escape the ] in the character class. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Actually, in the regex pattern, the [ is the start of the character class. The * and ? are literals. Then, to include [ and ] in the character class, we need to put them in there. So the pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is used to escape the ] in the character class. Wait, no. The ] is the last character in the character class. So, in the regex, the pattern is [*\?[\[] — which is:

- [ starts the character class.
- * is a literal *.
- ? is a literal ?.
- \ is used to escape the [ and ] inside the character class. Wait, no. Wait, in the regex, the [ is the start of the character class. So, to include a literal [ in the character class, you can just put it in there. Similarly for ].

So, the correct regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is used to escape the ] in the character class. Wait, no. Let me think again. The pattern [*\?[\[] would be written as r'[*\?[\[]' — but that would have the backslash before the [ and ].

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let's think of it as a regex pattern. The pattern to match any of *, ?, [ or ] is [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string should be written as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is used to escape the ] in the character class. Wait, no. The ] is the last character in the character class. So, in the regex, it's not necessary to escape it. Wait, but if I want to include a literal ] in the character class, I need to put it in there. So, the pattern would be [*\?[\[] — which is:

- [ starts the character class.
- * is a literal *.
- ? is a literal ?.
- [ is a literal [.
- ] is a literal ].

Wait, but how do I include ] in the character class? If I put it as the last character, it's not necessary to escape it. So the pattern would be [*\?[\[] — which is:

- [ starts the character class.
- * is a literal *.
- ? is a literal ?.
- [ is a literal [.
- ] is a literal ].

So, the regex pattern would be [*\?[\[] — and in Python, the string is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — but that would have the backslash before the [ and ]? Wait, no. Let me think again. The string in Python would be written as r'[*\?[\[]' — but that would have a backslash before the [ and ]? No, because in the regex, the [ and ] are part of the character class. So, the correct way to write this in Python is r'[*\?[\[]' — but I'm not sure. Maybe I should use a regex that matches any of these characters.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the path contains any of the characters * or ? or [ or ].

So, for each path, check if any of these characters are present. If yes, leave it as is. Otherwise, add a * at the end.

So, in code:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    # Check if a path is already a glob pattern
    def is_glob_pattern(path):
        return re.search(r'[*?[\[]', path) is not None

    # Transform each path
    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if is_glob_pattern(path):
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            transformed.append(path + '*')
    return tuple(transformed)

Wait, but the regex pattern r'[*?[\[]' — in Python, the string is written as r'[*?[\[]' — but the [ and ] inside the regex are part of the character class. Wait, no. The regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is used to escape the ] in the character class. Wait, no. Let me think again. The regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — but in Python, the string is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — but that would have a backslash before the [ and ]? No. Wait, the regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — which in Python is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — but the backslash before the [ and ] is not needed. Wait, no. Let me think: in the regex, the [ starts the character class. The * and ? are literals. The [ and ] are part of the character class. So the regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — which in Python is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — but the [ and ] are part of the character class. Wait, no. Wait, the regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — which is:

- [ starts the character class.
- * is a literal *.
- ? is a literal ?.
- [ is a literal [.
- ] is a literal ].

But how to write this in Python as a regex string. The correct way is to write it as r'[*\?[\[]' — because the backslash is used to escape the ] in the character class. Wait, no. The ] is the last character in the character class. So, in the regex, it's not necessary to escape it. So the pattern would be [*\?[\[] — which in Python is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — but I'm not sure. Maybe I should test this.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex pattern is r'[*?[\[]' — but I'm not sure. Let me think: the regex [*\?[\[] would match any of *, ?, [ or ].

But perhaps the correct regex is r'[*?[\[]' — but in Python, the string is written as r'[*?[\[]' — but the [ and ] inside the regex are part of the character class. Wait, no. The [ starts the character class. So the pattern is [*\?[\[] — which would match any of *, ?, [ or ].

But perhaps the correct way to write this in Python is r'[*\?[\[]' — because the ] is the last character in the character class. Wait, no. Let me think again. The regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — which is:

- [ starts the character class.
- * is a literal *.
- ? is a literal ?.
- [ is a literal [.
- ] is a literal ].

So, the regex pattern is [*\?[\[] — which in Python is written as r'[*\?[\[]' — but the backslash before the [ and ] is not needed. Wait, no. The ] is the last character in the character class. So, in the regex, it's not necessary to escape it. Therefore, the correct regex pattern is r'[*?[\[]' — but in Python, the string is written as r'[*?[\[]' — but the [ and ] are part of the character class. So, the code for is_glob_pattern would be:

return re.search(r'[*?[\[]', path) is not None

But I'm not sure. Let's test with some examples.

For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the regex would not match. If the path is 'file*', the regex would match. If the path is 'file?', it would match. If the path is 'file[abc]', it would match. If the path is 'file[', it would match. So, the regex seems to work.

But in Python, the string is written as r'[*?[\[]' — but the [ and ] inside the regex are part of the character class. Wait, no. The regex is written as r'[*?[\[]' — which would be interpreted as a regex pattern where the [ starts the character class, then * and ? are literals, then [ and ] are part of the character class. But the ] is the last character in the character class, so it's not escaped. So, the regex would match any of *, ?, [ or ].

So, the code for is_glob_pattern would be:

def is_glob_pattern(path):
    return re.search(r'[*?[\[]', path) is not None

But in Python, the regex is written as r'[*?[\[]' — but the ] is the last character in the character class, so it's not escaped. So, this should work.

So, the code for the function would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    def is_glob_pattern(path):
        return re.search(r'[*?[\[]', path) is not None

    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if is_glob_pattern(path):
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            transformed.append(path + '*')
    return tuple(transformed)

Wait, but what about paths that contain other characters that are not glob patterns? For example, a path like 'file.txt' would be converted to 'file.txt*', which is a glob pattern. But if the path is 'file[123]', it would be considered a glob pattern because of the [ and ] and left as is.

This seems to meet the requirements. The function checks if the path contains any of the glob characters. If yes, leave it. Otherwise, add a * at the end.

But what about paths that have other special characters, like 'file.name'? Those would not be considered glob patterns and would be converted to 'file.name*'.

I think this should work. So the code would be as above.

But the user mentioned that the imported packages include re, so the code should import re.

So the final code would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    def is_glob_pattern(path):
        return re.search(r'[*?[\[]', path) is not None

    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if is_glob_pattern(path):
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            transformed.append(path + '*')
    return tuple(transformed)

But wait, the problem says that the function should return a tuple of transformed paths. So, the code is correct.

But what about cases where the path is empty? Or has multiple wildcards? The code should handle those.

Another thing to consider: the regex may match parts of the path that are not intended. For example, a path like 'file[abc]' would be considered a glob pattern, which is correct. But a path like 'file[123]' would also be considered a glob pattern. So the code is correct.

So this should be the correct implementation.
