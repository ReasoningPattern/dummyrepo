Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function get_logical_path_map based on the given signature and docstring. The function takes an inventory and a version, and returns a dictionary of file paths for the states in the inventory.

First, I need to understand what the inventory and version parameters represent. Since the docstring mentions "file paths of the states," maybe the inventory is a list of state names or some structure that includes their paths. The version might affect how the paths are determined, like different versions having different directory structures.

But the problem is, without more context, I have to make assumptions. The user mentioned that the code should not include explanations, just the code. So I need to write a function that returns a dictionary. Let's think about possible implementations.

Maybe the inventory is a list of states, and for each state, we need to construct a logical path based on the version. For example, if the version is 'v1', the path could be something like 'states/v1/state_name.py'. But how to get the state names from the inventory?

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state name, and the value includes the path information. But the function's parameters are inventory and version, so maybe the inventory is a list of state names, and the version determines the directory structure.

Wait, the function's docstring says "file paths of the states in the inventory". So the inventory contains states, and for each state, we need to map it to a logical path. The version might influence the path, like different versions having different directories.

Let me think of a possible implementation. Suppose the inventory is a list of state names. For each state, the logical path could be constructed by combining a base directory (maybe determined by the version) with the state name. For example, if the version is 'v1', the base directory is 'versions/v1', and each state's path is 'versions/v1/state_name.py'.

But how to handle that in code? The function needs to process each state in the inventory and generate the path. Let's assume that the inventory is a list of state names. Then, the code could be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    path_map = {}
    base_dir = f'versions/{version}'
    for state in inventory:
        path = f'{base_dir}/{state}.py'
        path_map[state] = path
    return path_map

But this is just one possible way. The actual implementation might vary. However, since the user hasn't provided specific details about the inventory structure or how the version affects the path, this is a reasonable assumption.

Another possibility is that the inventory is a dictionary with state names as keys and some path info as values. But the function's parameters don't indicate that. So the simplest approach is to assume that inventory is a list of state names, and the version determines the base directory.

So the code would loop through each state in the inventory, create a path based on the version, and map each state to that path. That seems to fit the docstring's description.

I should also make sure that the function returns a dictionary. The code above does that. So this should be the correct approach.
