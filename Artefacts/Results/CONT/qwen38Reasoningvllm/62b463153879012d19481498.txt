Okay, I need to create a Python function called files_list that takes a path and returns the list of files in that directory. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should use the os module since it's common for file operations. The os.listdir() function can list all entries in a directory. But wait, that includes both files and directories. The docstring says "files," so maybe I should filter out directories.

Wait, the user might consider directories as files? Or maybe they want only files, not directories. The docstring says "return the files in given path," so probably files, not including directories. So I need to check each item in the directory to see if it's a file.

So, using os.listdir(path) gives all entries. Then, for each entry, check if it's a file using os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, entry)). That way, I can filter out directories.

But what about the path? The function's path parameter is the directory path. So, I need to join the path with each entry to check if it's a file.

Wait, but if the path is a directory, then os.listdir(path) will list the contents. But if the path is a file, then os.listdir would throw an error. So maybe the function should handle that? The docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps assume that the path is a valid directory.

So, the steps are:

1. Use os.listdir(path) to get all entries.
2. For each entry, check if it's a file using os.path.isfile.
3. Collect all entries that are files.
4. Return the list.

But wait, the user might want to include subdirectories? No, the function is supposed to return files in the given path, which is the immediate directory. So no recursion.

Another thing: the function may need to handle cases where the path doesn't exist. But again, the docstring doesn't mention error handling, so maybe just proceed and let exceptions propagate.

So the code would be:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    files = []
    for entry in os.listdir(path):
        entry_path = os.path.join(path, entry)
        if os.path.isfile(entry_path):
            files.append(entry)
    return files

Wait, but the user mentioned that the imported packages include logging, os, zipfile, tempfile, shutil, re. So os is already imported. So the code can use os functions.

But wait, the function is supposed to return the list of files. So the code above would return the list of filenames, not their full paths. That's correct based on the docstring.

But maybe the user wants the full paths? The docstring says "files in given path," which could be interpreted as the filenames. But perhaps the function should return the full paths. Hmm. The docstring isn't clear. But since the function is called files_list, maybe it's intended to return the filenames, not the full paths. But maybe the user wants the full paths. However, without more info, I'll assume the filenames.

Wait, but in the code example I wrote, it appends the entry (the filename) to the list. But maybe the user wants the full path. Let me check the function's purpose again. The docstring says "Return the files in given path." So perhaps the full path is needed. For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs', then the files would be '/home/user/docs/file1.txt', etc. But the function's name is files_list, which might imply just the names. However, it's ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the function should return the list of file paths relative to the given path. For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs', then the files would be ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt'].

But the user's code example may vary. Since the docstring is minimal, perhaps the function should return the list of filenames, not the full paths. So the code as written is correct.

Another consideration: the function may need to handle cases where the path is a file itself. But os.listdir would throw an error if the path is not a directory. So perhaps the function should check if the path is a directory. But again, the docstring doesn't mention error handling. So perhaps the function is intended to be used with a valid directory path.

So the code would be as I wrote before.

But wait, the user's code may need to handle cases where the path is a zip file? Because the imported packages include zipfile. But the function's purpose is to list files in a given path, which is a directory. Unless the path is a zip file, but that's not clear. The function's name is files_list, which suggests it's for a directory. So perhaps the function is intended to list files in a directory, not in a zip file. So the code as written is correct.

So the final code is:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    files = []
    for entry in os.listdir(path):
        entry_path = os.path.join(path, entry)
        if os.path.isfile(entry_path):
            files.append(entry)
    return files

But wait, the user's code may need to handle other cases. For example, if the path is a symlink. But again, without more info, the code is as above.

Another thing: the function may need to return the full path. Let me think again. Suppose the path is '/home/user/docs', and there's a file 'test.txt'. The function returns ['test.txt'], or ['/home/user/docs/test.txt']?

The docstring says "files in given path", which could be interpreted as the full path. But perhaps the user wants the filenames. However, in the absence of clear instructions, it's safer to return the full paths. Let me adjust the code.

So, in that case, the code would append entry_path instead of entry. So:

files.append(entry_path)

But then, the function returns the full paths. However, the function's name is files_list, which might imply that the list contains filenames. But perhaps the user wants the full paths. It's ambiguous. However, given that the function is called files_list, perhaps the intended behavior is to return the list of filenames, not the full paths. So the original code is correct.

But perhaps the user expects the full paths. Let me check the initial problem again. The user says "Return the files in given path." So, for example, if the path is '/home/user/docs', then the files would be the list of files in that directory. So the filenames. So the code as written is correct.

Thus, the code is as written before.
