Okay, I need to create a Python function called subclasses that returns all subclasses of a given class, recursively. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a class 'cls' as input. The goal is to find all classes that inherit from 'cls', including those that are nested deeper in the inheritance hierarchy.

I remember that in Python, you can get the base classes of a class using the __subclasses__() method. But that only gives immediate subclasses. To get all subclasses recursively, I need to traverse each subclass and check their subclasses as well.

So maybe I can start by getting the immediate subclasses using cls.__subclasses__(), then for each of those, recursively call the same function. Then combine all the results and remove duplicates.

Wait, but how do I handle duplicates? If a subclass is found through multiple paths, like if a class is a subclass of two different classes that both lead to it, I should avoid adding it multiple times.

So perhaps I can use a set to collect all the subclass instances to avoid duplicates. Then, for each subclass, add it to the set and then add all its subclasses recursively.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize a set to hold all subclasses.
2. Get the immediate subclasses of cls using cls.__subclasses__().
3. For each subclass in the immediate list, add it to the set.
4. Recursively call subclasses on each subclass and add those results to the set.
5. Finally, convert the set to a list and return it.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return all subclasses, including those that are not direct. So the recursion is necessary.

But how to handle the recursion? Let me think of an example. Suppose class A has subclass B, which has subclass C. Then subclasses(A) should return B and C. So for each immediate subclass, we need to collect their subclasses as well.

So the function could be written as:

def subclasses(cls):
    result = set()
    for sub in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.add(sub)
        result.update(subclasses(sub))
    return list(result)

Wait, but this would recursively collect all subclasses. Let me test this logic.

For example, if cls is A, then the immediate subclasses are B and D. B has subclass C. D has subclass E. Then the function would collect B, C, D, E. But what if there's a class that is a subclass of multiple classes? The set will handle duplicates.

But wait, the initial call to cls.__subclasses__() gives all direct subclasses. Then for each of those, we add them to the set and then their subclasses. So the recursion should cover all levels.

But what about the base case? When a class has no subclasses, the function returns an empty list.

But wait, the initial code would return a list of the set. However, the order might not be preserved, but the problem doesn't specify ordering, so that's acceptable.

But wait, the function is supposed to return all subclasses, including the immediate ones. So the code above would collect all of them.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say cls is A. The first step is to get all direct subclasses of A. For each of those, add them to the result set, and then recursively get their subclasses. So for example, if B is a subclass of A, then we add B to the set, then get all subclasses of B (like C), add them, etc.

Yes, that seems correct.

But what about the base case? For example, if a class has no subclasses, then the function returns an empty list. That's correct.

But what about the original class itself? No, the function is supposed to return subclasses, not the class itself. So the code is correct.

Now, what about the initial call? For example, if someone calls subclasses(A), it returns all subclasses of A, including indirect ones.

But wait, the code as written would collect all subclasses, including those that are not direct. Let me test with a simple example.

Let me imagine:

class A: pass
class B(A): pass
class C(B): pass
class D(A): pass

Then subclasses(A) should return [B, C, D].

Let's see:

First, cls is A. cls.__subclasses__() returns [B, D]. Then for each of B and D:

For B: add B to the set, then call subclasses(B). For B's subclasses, which is [C]. Add C. Then for C's subclasses, which is empty. So the result for B is B and C.

For D: add D, and call subclasses(D), which returns empty. So the total set is {B, C, D}.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code seems to work.

But what about if a class is a subclass of multiple classes? For example, if C is a subclass of B and also of D. But in that case, the code would collect all subclasses, but since it's a set, duplicates are handled.

But in reality, a class can't have multiple parents unless it's a multiple inheritance scenario. But the code would still work, as the set would collect each subclass once.

So the code should work.

Now, the function is supposed to return a list of classes. The code returns a list of the set. However, the order is not guaranteed. But the problem doesn't specify ordering, so that's acceptable.

Now, the code needs to be written. Let me write it.

But wait, the function is called subclasses, and it's supposed to be a function, not a method. So the code would be:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    result = set()
    for sub in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.add(sub)
        result.update(subclasses(sub))
    return list(result)

Wait, but what if the class is not a class? Well, the function is supposed to be called with a class, so assuming that the input is a class.

But in Python, __subclasses__ is a method of a class, so cls must be a class.

But what about if the class is not a new-style class? Well, in Python 3, all classes are new-style, so that's not an issue.

But what about if the class is a built-in type? Like int. Then __subclasses__ would return its subclasses.

So the code should work.

But let me test for a case where a class has multiple levels of inheritance.

Another thing to consider: the function is recursive, so for very deep inheritance hierarchies, it could hit the recursion limit. But that's a problem with the input, not the code.

So the code seems correct.

But the initial code uses a set to collect all subclasses. However, when you call subclasses(sub), it returns a list, and then result.update() is called with that list. Since update() takes an iterable, that's okay.

Wait, no. The result is a set. The code does result.update(subclasses(sub)), which is adding all elements from the list returned by subclasses(sub) into the set. That's correct.

Yes.

So the code should work.

Now, the user provided the function signature and the docstring. The code should be written with that.

So the final code would be:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    result = set()
    for sub in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.add(sub)
        result.update(subclasses(sub))
    return list(result)

But wait, what if the class has no subclasses? Then the loop doesn't run, and returns an empty list. Which is correct.

Yes.

So this should be the correct code.
