Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function's docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary including url and document_path. The parameters are url and document_path, which is optional. The context mentions some other functions like generate_host_meta and generate_nodeinfo2_document, but I'm not sure how they fit in yet. However, the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, so I need to make assumptions based on common practices.

Well-known documents, like the one for NodeInfo, typically involve generating a JSON document that includes links to various services. The function might be generating such a document. The parameters url and document_path suggest that the function is creating a document that points to the given URL and possibly a specific path.

Looking at the context, there's a mention of NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH, which might be a constant or variable that holds the default path for the document. If document_path is not provided, maybe it uses this default.

The function needs to return a dictionary. Let's think about the structure. A well-known document for NodeInfo usually has a "links" array with entries like "self" pointing to the NodeInfo document. So the dictionary might include the url, document_path, and possibly other metadata.

Wait, the docstring says the dictionary includes url and document_path. So the function's output should at least have those two keys. But maybe more. For example, the NodeInfo document might include additional fields like "links", "metadata", etc.

But since the user hasn't provided specifics, I'll stick to the docstring. The function should return a dictionary with url and document_path. However, considering the context of generating NodeInfo documents, perhaps the function is generating a well-known document that points to the NodeInfo endpoint.

In that case, the function might construct a JSON document that includes the url and the path to the NodeInfo document. For example, the well-known document might have a "links" section with a link to the NodeInfo document.

But the user's docstring says the function returns a dictionary with url and document_path. So maybe the function is just returning those two values as keys in the dictionary. However, the function's name suggests it's related to generating a well-known document, which is typically a JSON file.

Wait, maybe the function is generating the well-known document (like the .well-known/nodeinfo file) and returning its content as a dictionary. In that case, the dictionary would include the necessary fields for the NodeInfo document, such as the links to the service.

But without more details, I need to make an educated guess. Let me think about the parameters. The url parameter is probably the base URL of the service, and document_path is the path to the NodeInfo document (like '/.well-known/nodeinfo'). If document_path is not provided, maybe it uses a default value, such as '/.well-known/nodeinfo'.

So the function could generate a dictionary that includes the url and the document_path, and possibly other fields required by the NodeInfo specification. For example, the NodeInfo 2.0 document includes a "links" array with a "self" link pointing to the document itself.

Putting this together, the function might construct a dictionary like:

{
    "url": url,
    "document_path": document_path or default_path,
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "self",
            "href": f"{url}{document_path or default_path}"
        }
    ]
}

But the docstring says the dictionary includes url and document_path. Maybe the function is simpler, just returning those two keys. However, considering the context of generating a well-known document, it's more likely that the function is building the content of that document.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is generating the well-known document's content, which is a JSON object. For example, the well-known document for NodeInfo 2.0 would have a "links" array and other metadata.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, I'll proceed with the information given. The function's docstring says it returns a dictionary including url and document_path. So the function should return a dictionary with those two keys. However, the function's name suggests it's related to generating the well-known document, which is a JSON file. So perhaps the function is generating that JSON content.

In that case, the function might construct a dictionary that includes the necessary fields for the well-known document. For example, the well-known document might have a "links" array with a "self" link pointing to the NodeInfo document.

But again, without more details, I need to make assumptions. Let me check the context again. The context mentions functions like generate_nodeinfo2_document(), which might be used to generate the actual NodeInfo document. The function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document might be generating the well-known document that points to the NodeInfo document.

So the well-known document (like /.well-known/nodeinfo) would contain a JSON object with a "links" array, where one of the links points to the NodeInfo document. The function's parameters are url and document_path. The url is the base URL of the service, and document_path is the path to the NodeInfo document (e.g., '/nodeinfo/2.0'). If document_path is not provided, maybe it uses a default path.

So the function could generate a dictionary that includes the url and document_path, and also constructs the links. For example:

{
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "self",
            "href": f"{url}{document_path}"
        }
    ]
}

But the docstring says the dictionary includes url and document_path. So perhaps the function is returning those two keys. However, the function's name suggests it's generating the well-known document, which is a JSON object. Therefore, the function might be generating that JSON object.

Putting it all together, the function might return a dictionary with the url and document_path, and possibly other fields required by the well-known document format. Since the user hasn't provided specifics, I'll proceed with the minimal structure based on the docstring.

So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path
    }

But wait, the context mentions that there's a variable called NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH. So the function might use that as the default if document_path is not provided. Therefore, the code would check if document_path is None and use the default.

But the user hasn't provided the value of NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH, so I'll assume it's a predefined constant in the code.

Additionally, considering that the well-known document is a JSON object, perhaps the function is generating that JSON. For example, the well-known document might have a "links" array, so the function might include that.

But again, without more details, I'll stick to the docstring. The function returns a dictionary with url and document_path. So the code would be as above.

However, the user's context also includes functions like generate_host_meta and generate_legacy_webfinger, which might be related to generating different types of well-known documents. But since the function is specifically for NodeInfo, perhaps it's generating the NodeInfo well-known document.

In conclusion, the function likely returns a dictionary with the url and document_path, possibly using the NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH as a default. So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path
    }

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct imports. The context mentions imported packages like json, base64, etc. However, the function doesn't seem to use them, so maybe the code doesn't need them. But the user hasn't specified any particular logic, so the code is minimal.

Another possibility is that the function is generating the actual JSON content for the well-known document. For example, the well-known document might be a JSON object with a "links" array. So the function could generate that.

In that case, the code might look like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH
    return {
        "links": [
            {
                "rel": "self",
                "href": f"{url}{document_path}"
            }
        ]
    }

But the docstring says the dictionary includes url and document_path, not just links. So perhaps the function returns both. Maybe the dictionary includes both the url and document_path as keys, along with the links.

But without more information, it's hard to say. The user's docstring is minimal, so I'll proceed with the initial code that returns the url and document_path as keys.
