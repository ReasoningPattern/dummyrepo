Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate Python code for the status_str method based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, and the docstring says it returns a string representation using self.log.status_str with an optional prefix.

First, I need to make sure I understand the method's purpose. The docstring mentions using self.log.status_str, so I should check if the log object has a method called status_str. Since the context includes 'self.log', it's safe to assume that's available.

The method takes a 'prefix' parameter, which is optional and defaults to an empty string. The goal is to return the status string with this prefix. So, the code should probably call self.log.status_str and prepend the prefix to it.

Wait, but how exactly is the prefix applied? The docstring says "with optional prefix," so maybe the prefix is added before the status string. For example, if the status_str returns "OK", then with prefix "INFO:", it becomes "INFO: OK".

So the code would be something like returning the prefix followed by the result of self.log.status_str. But I need to make sure that the prefix is included even if it's empty. Wait, the default is an empty string, so if no prefix is provided, it's just the status string.

But maybe the prefix is meant to be part of the status string. For example, the status_str might be a method that returns a specific string, and the prefix is added to it. So the code would be:

return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str()}"

But I need to check if the log's status_str method requires any arguments. The given context doesn't show any parameters for self.log.status_str, so assuming it's a method that returns a string without parameters.

Also, the method is part of a class, so 'self' is the instance. The method is called status_str, so the code should be inside the class.

Putting it all together, the function would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str()}"

Wait, but maybe the prefix is supposed to be part of the status string in a different way. For example, maybe the status_str includes the prefix internally. But according to the docstring, the prefix is optional, so the method should allow adding it.

Another possibility is that the status_str method of the log is called with the prefix. But the docstring says "with optional prefix," which might mean that the prefix is passed to the log's status_str. However, the function signature of status_str here doesn't have any parameters except 'prefix', so perhaps the log's status_str is called without parameters, and the prefix is added externally.

Given the information, the safest approach is to prepend the prefix to the result of self.log.status_str(). So the code would be as above.

I should also check if there are any other methods or attributes that might be relevant. The context includes 'self.log', so that's the correct attribute to use. The method is part of a class, so the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code should be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return string representation with self.log.status_str, with optional prefix.
    """
    return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str()}"

But wait, the user said to output only the code in Python markdown format. The original code had the docstring, so I need to include that. The function signature includes the docstring, so the code should have the docstring as given.

Wait, the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the code should be generated based on that. The original function has the docstring as:

"""
Return string representation with self.log.status_str, with optional prefix.
"""

So the generated code should include that docstring. The user's example shows that the code should include the docstring. So the code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return string representation with self.log.status_str, with optional prefix.
    """
    return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str()}"

But I need to make sure that the code is correctly formatted. Also, the user mentioned not to include any explanations, just the code. So the final answer is the code as above.
