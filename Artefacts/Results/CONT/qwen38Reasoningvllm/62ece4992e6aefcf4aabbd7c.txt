Okay, I need to create a Python function called oneline that takes a script and a separator, and converts the script into a single line command using the separator. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to join multiple lines of a script into one line. The separator is given as " && " by default. So, maybe the script is a string where each line is separated by newlines, and I need to replace those newlines with the separator.

Wait, but how is the script structured? If the script is a multi-line string, then splitting by newlines and joining with the separator would work. For example, if the script is "cmd1\n cmd2", then splitting gives ["cmd1", "cmd2"], then joining with " && " gives "cmd1 && cmd2".

But wait, maybe there are multiple newlines, like in the middle of the script. So splitting on newlines and then joining with the separator would handle that. But I should check if the script has leading or trailing whitespace. Maybe using splitlines() would be better, as it splits on any newline and removes the newline characters.

Wait, the function's docstring says script is a str. So the input is a string. Let me think: if the script is a multi-line string, then splitting it into lines and joining with the separator would make it one line. But perhaps the script is already a list of commands, but the function expects a string. So the function is designed to take a string where each line is a command, and join them with the separator.

So the steps would be:

1. Split the script into lines. Using splitlines() would split on any newline, which is better than split('\n') because splitlines() handles different types of newlines (like \r\n, etc.) and removes them.

2. Then, join those lines with the separator. But wait, the separator is given as a parameter. So the function would take the list of lines and join them with the separator.

But wait, the separator is " && " by default. So for example, if the script is "cmd1\n cmd2", splitting into lines gives ["cmd1", "cmd2"], then joining with " && " gives "cmd1 && cmd2".

But what if the script has empty lines? For example, if the script is "cmd1\n\n cmd2", then splitting into lines would give ["cmd1", "", "cmd2"], and joining with the separator would result in "cmd1 &&  && cmd2". But maybe the function should ignore empty lines? The problem statement doesn't mention that, so perhaps we should not filter them. However, the user might expect that empty lines are handled properly. But since the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps we should just join all lines as they are.

But the function's name is oneline, which suggests that it's taking a script (probably a list of commands) and joining them into a single line. So perhaps the input script is a string with each command on a separate line, and the function joins them with the separator.

So the code would be:

def oneline(script, separator=" && "):
    lines = script.splitlines()
    return separator.join(lines)

Wait, but the separator is a string. For example, if the separator is " && ", then joining the lines with that would put " && " between each line. But what if the lines have trailing or leading spaces? For example, if a line is "  cmd1  ", then joining with " && " would result in "  cmd1  && cmd2".

But the function's purpose is to convert the script into a single line command. So perhaps the lines are supposed to be joined with the separator, regardless of their content. So the code would be as simple as splitting the script into lines and joining with the separator.

But wait, the function's docstring says "Convert a script to one line command with the given separator." So the script is a string, and the function returns a single line string.

But what if the script is already a single line? Then splitting into lines would give a list with one element, and joining with the separator would return that element. So that's handled.

But what about if the script is empty? Well, the function would return an empty string, which is correct.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to take a script, which is a string, and join its lines with the separator. So the code would be as simple as:

return separator.join(script.splitlines())

But wait, the separator is a string. For example, if the separator is " && ", then joining the lines with that would put " && " between each line. But what if the separator is something else, like "; "?

Yes, that's correct.

But the function's docstring says that the separator is a string. So the code is straightforward.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a single line command. So if the script has multiple lines, they are joined with the separator. But what about if the script has leading or trailing whitespace? For example, if the script is "  cmd1\n cmd2  ", then splitting into lines gives ["  cmd1", " cmd2  "], and joining with " && " gives "  cmd1 &&  cmd2  ".

But that's correct. The function doesn't trim any whitespace, as per the problem statement.

So the code would be:

def oneline(script, separator=" && "):
    """
    Convert a script to one line command with the given separator.

    Args:
        script: str
        separator: str
    Returns:
        str, the one-line command.
    """
    return separator.join(script.splitlines())

Wait, but the problem says that the function is part of a class? No, the context says "Within class: " but it's empty. So the function is not part of a class. So the code is as above.

But the user mentioned that the imported packages include textwrap. However, in this code, we're not using textwrap. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding. But the function's code doesn't require textwrap. So maybe the user included textwrap by mistake, but the code doesn't need it.

So the code is as written above. Let me test with an example.

Example:

script = "echo hello\nworld"
oneline(script) would return "echo hello && world".

Yes.

Another example: script is "cmd1\n cmd2\n cmd3", then the result is "cmd1 &&  cmd2 &&  cmd3".

But perhaps the user expects that the lines are joined with the separator, regardless of any leading/trailing spaces. So the code is correct.

Therefore, the code is simply joining the splitlines of the script with the separator.
