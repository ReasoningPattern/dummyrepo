Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function _replace_register based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function replaces the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and then deletes flow_params[register_value]. Wait, wait. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. Oh right, the function replaces the value at register_number with the value from register_value, then deletes the entry at register_value. So, for example, if flow_params is a dictionary, then flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value], and then del flow_params[register_value]. But wait, what if register_value is the same as register_number? Then we would be overwriting and then deleting, which would remove the key. But maybe the function is designed to handle that case, or maybe the parameters are supposed to be different. But the function's job is to do exactly as described.

So the steps are: first, take the value from register_value, assign it to register_number, then delete register_value. So the code would be:

flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, what if register_value is not present in flow_params? That would cause a KeyError. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps it's assumed that register_value exists. So the code would proceed as such.

So the function would take flow_params, which is presumably a dictionary, and the two register numbers. So the code would be straightforward. Let me write that.

Wait, the parameters are register_number and register_value. Are they integers? Probably, since they're used as keys in a dictionary. So the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, the docstring says "Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]". So the first step is to assign the value from register_value to register_number, then delete register_value. That's exactly what the code does.

But what if register_number and register_value are the same? Then we would be overwriting the value and then deleting it, which would result in the key being removed. But that's probably intended. The function's responsibility is to do exactly as described, regardless of the parameters.

So the code is as above. Let me check for any possible errors. For example, if flow_params is not a dictionary, but maybe a list? But the function uses square brackets, so it's likely a dictionary. The problem statement says "flow_params" which is probably a dictionary of registers. So the code should work.

So the generated code is as written.
