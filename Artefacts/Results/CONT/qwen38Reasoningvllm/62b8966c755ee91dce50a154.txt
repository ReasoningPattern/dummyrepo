Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the isoparse method based on the provided function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is supposed to parse an ISO-8601 datetime string into a datetime.datetime object. The docstring mentions various date and time formats, including common and uncommon ones, as well as time zone offsets. Also, there are some specific notes about handling midnight, decimal separators, and time zones.

First, I should consider the structure of the function. The method is part of a class, as indicated by the 'self' parameter. The function needs to handle different date and time formats, split them, parse each part, and then combine them into a datetime object.

Looking at the imported packages: functools, re, calendar, datetime, six. These suggest that regular expressions will be used for parsing, and possibly some helper functions from the calendar module for week calculations.

The existing methods in the class include _parse_isodate, _parse_isotime, _parse_tzstr, and others. So the isoparse method should probably call these helper methods.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Split the input string into date, time, and timezone parts. The date and time are separated by the separator (default 'T'), and the timezone is handled separately.

2. Parse the date part using the _parse_isodate method, which might call _parse_isodate_common or _parse_isodate_uncommon depending on the format.

3. Parse the time part using _parse_isotime, which handles the time and fractional seconds.

4. Parse the timezone offset using _parse_tzstr, which converts it into a timezone object.

5. Combine the parsed date, time, and timezone into a datetime object.

Wait, but the function signature is part of a class, so the method is likely using instance variables like _sep, _DATE_SEP, _TIME_SEP, etc. The docstring mentions that the date and time are separated by a single character, which is 'T' by default. The _sep variable might hold this separator.

So the first step is to split the input string into date and time parts using the separator. Then handle each part.

But the input could be a string or a stream. However, the function's parameter is dt_str, which is a string or stream. But since the function is part of a class, perhaps the stream is handled by reading from it, but the docstring says it's a string or stream. However, the code might need to read the entire string. For simplicity, maybe the function expects a string, and if it's a stream, it's read as a string. But the code might not handle streams, so perhaps the function assumes dt_str is a string.

Next, the date parsing. The _parse_isodate method is called, which in turn calls _parse_isodate_common or _parse_isodate_uncommon. The common formats include YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYYMM, YYYY-MM-DD, YYYYMMDD. The uncommon ones are ISO week formats.

So the _parse_isodate method would check the format and parse accordingly. For example, if the date string ends with 'W', it's an ISO week format.

Once the date is parsed, the time is parsed similarly. The time can be hh, hh:mm, hh:mm:ss, etc., with possible fractional seconds. Also, the decimal separator can be a dot or comma. The _parse_isotime method would handle this.

Timezone parsing: the _parse_tzstr method handles the timezone offset. It checks for 'Z' (UTC), or ±HH:MM, ±HHMM, ±HH. The function then creates a tzoffset or tzutc object.

Now, putting this together in the isoparse method:

The method would first split the input string into date and time parts. Then parse each part, then combine them into a datetime object with the timezone.

But how to split the string? The separator is stored in self._sep, which is probably initialized in the __init__ method. The default is 'T', but maybe the user can specify a different separator.

So the code would split dt_str into date_part and time_part using self._sep. However, the separator could be present or not. For example, if the string is only a date, then time_part is None.

Wait, the docstring says that incomplete date formats (like YYYY-MM) may not be combined with a time portion. So if the date is incomplete, there should be no time part. So the code needs to check that.

So the steps:

- Split the dt_str into date_part and time_part based on the separator. If the separator is present, split into date and time. If not, then it's just the date.

But how to split? For example, if the separator is 'T', then split on 'T' once. But the separator could be any single character. So using split(self._sep, 1) would split into two parts.

Once split, the date_part is parsed using _parse_isodate, and the time_part is parsed using _parse_isotime. Then the timezone is parsed from the end of the string, if present.

Wait, the timezone is part of the string. For example, "2023-10-05T14:30+02:00". So after splitting date and time, the remaining part is the timezone.

So after splitting into date and time, the code would check if there's a timezone part. For example, using a regular expression to capture the timezone.

Alternatively, after splitting date and time, the remaining string is the timezone. But perhaps the timezone is part of the time component. Wait, no. The timezone is usually at the end. For example, in the format "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS±HHMM".

So after splitting date and time, the code would check if there's a timezone part. So perhaps after splitting into date and time, the code would process the timezone.

But how to handle that? Let's think: the entire string is split into date, time, and timezone. So for example, if the input is "2023-10-05T14:30+02:00", then date_part is "2023-10-05", time_part is "14:30", and tz_part is "+02:00".

So the code would split the string into date_part and the rest, then split the rest into time_part and tz_part.

Alternatively, the code could split the entire string into three parts: date, time, and timezone. But how?

Perhaps using a regular expression to match the entire string. But given the complexity, maybe the code first splits on the separator (date and time), then splits the time part into time and timezone.

Wait, the timezone is part of the time component. For example, in "2023-10-05T14:30+02:00", the time is "14:30+02:00". So after splitting the date_part and time_part, the time_part includes the timezone.

So the code would split the original string into date_part and time_tz_part. Then split the time_tz_part into time_part and tz_part.

So the code would do something like:

date_part, time_tz_part = dt_str.split(self._sep, 1) if self._sep in dt_str else (dt_str, "")

Then, split time_tz_part into time_part and tz_part. For example, using a regular expression to capture the timezone.

But how to split the time and timezone? The timezone can be 'Z', or ±HH:MM, ±HHMM, ±HH. So the code can check if the time_tz_part ends with a timezone.

Alternatively, the code can split on the timezone part. For example, using a regular expression to match the timezone at the end.

So, after splitting date_part and time_tz_part, the code can process the time_tz_part by checking for the timezone. For example, using a regex to find the timezone.

But perhaps the _parse_tzstr method is used here. So, the code would call self._parse_tzstr on the time_tz_part, which would return the time_part and tz_part.

Wait, maybe the _parse_tzstr method is designed to parse the timezone part. But how?

Alternatively, the code could split the time_tz_part into time_part and tz_part by checking for the presence of a timezone. For example, if the time_tz_part ends with 'Z', then tz_part is 'Z' and time_part is the rest. If it ends with a ±HH:MM, then split accordingly.

But this seems error-prone. Maybe the code uses the _parse_tzstr method, which takes the time_tz_part and returns the time and timezone.

Alternatively, the code could split the time_tz_part into time_part and tz_part by checking for the timezone. For example:

if the time_tz_part ends with 'Z', then tz_part is 'Z', time_part is the part before.

Else, check for the timezone offset. For example, using a regex to match the timezone.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about the helper methods.

The existing methods include _parse_tzstr, which is called by parse_tzstr and _parse_tzstr. The _parse_tzstr method probably parses the timezone part and returns the offset.

So perhaps, after splitting the date and time parts, the code would process the time part to extract the timezone.

Wait, the _parse_isotime method might be responsible for parsing the time and timezone. Let me check the helper methods.

The _parse_isotime method is called by parse_isotime. The _parse_isotime method would parse the time string, which may include the timezone.

Alternatively, the _parse_isotime method could split the time string into time and timezone parts.

But given the complexity, perhaps the code splits the original string into date, time, and timezone parts as follows:

1. Split the input string into date_part and time_tz_part using the separator.

2. Split the time_tz_part into time_part and tz_part using the timezone parsing logic.

Once the date, time, and timezone are parsed, then the datetime object is created.

Now, the code for isoparse would need to:

- Split the input string into date_part and time_tz_part.

- Parse date_part into a date object using _parse_isodate.

- Parse time_tz_part into time_part and tz_part using _parse_tzstr or similar.

But how to split time_tz_part into time and timezone? Let's assume that the _parse_tzstr method is used here. For example, the code could call self._parse_tzstr on the time_tz_part, which returns the time_part and the timezone offset.

Alternatively, the code could split the time_tz_part into time_part and tz_part by checking for the presence of a timezone.

But given the existing methods, perhaps the code uses the _parse_tzstr method to parse the timezone from the time_tz_part.

Wait, looking at the existing methods: there's a method called _parse_tzstr, and another called parse_tzstr. The _parse_tzstr is probably a helper function that parses the timezone string.

So, the code could split the time_tz_part into time_part and tz_part by checking if there's a timezone. For example:

time_part, tz_part = self._parse_tzstr(time_tz_part)

But how does _parse_tzstr work? It might return the time_part and the timezone offset. Alternatively, it might split the time_tz_part into time and timezone.

Assuming that, the code would proceed.

Once the date, time, and timezone are parsed, the datetime object is created.

Now, considering the datetime module: the datetime.datetime object can be created with the parsed date and time, and then the timezone is applied.

But the timezone parsing needs to create a timezone object. The docstring says that UTC is represented as tzutc, and other offsets as tzoffset.

So, the code would create a datetime object with the parsed date and time, then apply the timezone.

Putting this together, the code for isoparse would look something like:

def isoparse(self, dt_str):
    # Split into date and time parts
    if self._sep in dt_str:
        date_part, time_tz_part = dt_str.split(self._sep, 1)
    else:
        date_part = dt_str
        time_tz_part = ""
    
    # Parse date
    date = self._parse_isodate(date_part)
    
    # Parse time and timezone
    time_part, tz_offset = self._parse_tzstr(time_tz_part)
    time = self._parse_isotime(time_part)
    
    # Combine date and time
    dt = datetime.datetime.combine(date, time)
    
    # Apply timezone
    if tz_offset:
        dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=tz_offset)
    
    return dt

But this is a rough outline. Now, considering the helper methods:

The _parse_isodate method would parse the date_part into a date object. The _parse_isodate method might call _parse_isodate_common or _parse_isodate_uncommon based on the format.

Similarly, _parse_isotime would parse the time_part into a time object, handling the fractional seconds and decimal separators.

The _parse_tzstr method would parse the timezone part into a tz_offset.

But how to handle the decimal separators (dot or comma) in the time part? The _parse_isotime method would need to handle that. For example, replacing commas with dots before parsing.

Also, the note says that fractional components other than seconds are not implemented, but the code should handle up to 6 digits.

So, in the _parse_isotime method, the code would split the time string into hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional part. The fractional part would be converted to microseconds.

But the code needs to handle decimal separators as either '.' or ','.

Now, considering the code for _parse_isotime:

def _parse_isotime(self, timestr):
    # Split into time and fractional part
    if '.' in timestr:
        time_part, frac_part = timestr.split('.', 1)
    elif ',' in timestr:
        time_part, frac_part = timestr.split(',', 1)
    else:
        time_part = timestr
        frac_part = ''
    
    # Parse time_part into hours, minutes, seconds
    # Assuming time_part is in hh:mm:ss format
    # Split into hh, mm, ss
    # Handle leading zeros, etc.
    # Then parse into time object
    
    # Then handle fractional part
    # Convert frac_part to microseconds
    # For example, '123' becomes 123000 microseconds
    # But need to handle up to 6 digits
    
    # Return a datetime.time object or similar

But this is getting complex. The code would need to handle various time formats.

But since the user is asking for the isoparse method, not the helper methods, perhaps the code for isoparse is as outlined earlier, with calls to the helper methods.

Now, putting all together, the code for isoparse would:

- Split the input into date and time parts.

- Parse the date using _parse_isodate.

- Parse the time and timezone using _parse_tzstr.

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct helper methods and variables.

Also, the code needs to handle the case where there's no timezone, so tz_offset is None, and the datetime is naive.

Another thing: the docstring says that the date and time portions are separated by a single character, which is 'T' by default. So the _sep variable is used.

Now, considering all this, the code for isoparse would be:

def isoparse(self, dt_str):
    # Split into date and time parts
    if self._sep in dt_str:
        date_part, time_tz_part = dt_str.split(self._sep, 1)
    else:
        date_part = dt_str
        time_tz_part = ""
    
    # Parse date
    date = self._parse_isodate(date_part)
    
    # Parse time and timezone
    time_part, tz_offset = self._parse_tzstr(time_tz_part)
    time = self._parse_isotime(time_part)
    
    # Combine date and time
    dt = datetime.datetime.combine(date, time)
    
    # Apply timezone
    if tz_offset:
        dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=tz_offset)
    
    return dt

But this is a simplified version. However, the actual code might have more error handling and validation.

Also, the _parse_isodate and _parse_isotime methods are part of the class, so they are called with self.

But the code needs to import the necessary modules. The imported packages include datetime, so that's okay.

Now, considering the helper methods:

- _parse_isodate is called with date_part, which is parsed into a date object.

- _parse_isotime is called with time_part, which is parsed into a time object.

- _parse_tzstr is called with time_tz_part, which returns the time_part and tz_offset.

But how does _parse_tzstr work? Let's assume it splits the time_tz_part into time_part and tz_offset.

For example, if time_tz_part is "+02:00", then time_part is empty, and tz_offset is "+02:00".

But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the _parse_tzstr method is called with the entire time_tz_part, which includes the time and timezone. For example, if time_tz_part is "14:30+02:00", then the method would split into time_part "14:30" and tz_offset "+02:00".

So the _parse_tzstr method would process the time_tz_part to extract the timezone.

But how? Perhaps using a regular expression to match the timezone at the end.

So, the _parse_tzstr method could look like this:

def _parse_tzstr(self, timestr):
    # Check for timezone
    tz_match = re.match(r'([+-]?\d{2}:\d{2}|[+-]?\d{2}\d{2}|[+-]?\d{2})$', timestr)
    if tz_match:
        tz_offset = tz_match.group(1)
        time_part = timestr[: -len(tz_offset)]
    else:
        tz_offset = None
        time_part = timestr
    return time_part, tz_offset

But this is a rough idea. However, the actual implementation might be more complex, especially handling cases like 'Z' for UTC.

But since the user is asking for the isoparse method, not the helper methods, perhaps the code for isoparse is as outlined.

Another thing to consider: the date parsing. For example, if the date is in ISO week format, like "2023-W01", the _parse_isodate method would parse it into a date object using the _parse_isodate_uncommon method.

But the code for _parse_isodate would handle that.

In summary, the isoparse method would split the input into date and time parts, parse each using helper methods, combine them into a datetime object, and apply the timezone.

Now, writing the code for isoparse with the given helper methods and variables.
