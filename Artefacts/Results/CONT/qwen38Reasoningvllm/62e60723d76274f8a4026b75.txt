Okay, I need to create a Python function called round_half_to_even that rounds a floating-point number. The docstring says it's for rounding, but I need to figure out the exact behavior. Wait, the function name suggests it's using the "round half to even" strategy, which is the default rounding method in Python. But maybe the user wants to implement it manually?

Wait, Python's built-in round function already uses round half to even. So maybe the task is to replicate that behavior. But perhaps the user wants to ensure that the function is implemented correctly, maybe handling edge cases or specific scenarios.

Wait, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is just "Round a floating-point number", which is quite generic. But the function name implies that it's supposed to perform the round half to even method.

But since Python's round function already does that, maybe the user wants to use the built-in round function. However, perhaps there's a need to handle some specific cases or maybe the user is aware that the default rounding might not be sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to implement the rounding logic manually.

Wait, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't provide more details, so perhaps the function is supposed to be a wrapper around the built-in round function. But maybe the user wants to implement the rounding logic from scratch.

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting to use the decimal module for precise rounding. Let me think: the round_half_to_even is also known as "bankers rounding". So, the function should round to the nearest even number when the number is exactly halfway between two integers.

So, how to implement that? Let's think. For example, round_half_to_even(2.5) should return 2, and round_half_to_even(3.5) should return 4.

The built-in round function in Python does this. So perhaps the function can simply call round(n). But maybe the user wants to ensure that the function is implemented correctly, perhaps due to some specific requirements or to handle cases where the built-in round might not be available.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to implement the logic manually. Let's consider how to do that.

First, we can take the number, separate the integer and fractional parts. Then check if the fractional part is exactly 0.5. If it is, then check if the integer part is even or odd. If even, round to it; if odd, round to the next even number. Otherwise, round normally.

But how to handle negative numbers? For example, -2.5 should round to -2 (since -2 is even), and -3.5 should round to -4.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Determine the integer part and the fractional part.
2. Check if the fractional part is exactly 0.5.
3. If yes, check if the integer part is even. If even, return it. If odd, add 1 (or subtract 1, depending on the sign).
4. Otherwise, round normally.

But how to handle the fractional part? For example, for n = 2.5, the fractional part is 0.5. For n = 2.6, it's 0.6, which is more than 0.5, so round up. For 2.4, round down.

But how to accurately check if the fractional part is exactly 0.5? Because floating-point numbers can have precision issues. For example, 2.5 is exactly representable, but numbers like 0.1 might not be. However, the function is supposed to round a floating-point number, so perhaps the input is a float, and the function is supposed to handle it as is.

Alternatively, perhaps using the decimal module would be better for precise control. But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, and the user hasn't mentioned any specific requirements for handling decimal points.

Alternatively, maybe the function can be implemented using the built-in round function, which already does the round half to even. So the function could simply return round(n). But perhaps the user wants to ensure that the function is implemented correctly, maybe for educational purposes.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. Since the docstring is minimal, perhaps the function is supposed to be a wrapper around the built-in round function. However, maybe the user wants to implement the rounding logic manually.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is aware that the built-in round function may not be sufficient for certain cases, and wants a custom implementation.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to use the built-in round function. However, the function name is round_half_to_even, which is exactly what the built-in round does. So the function can be as simple as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But maybe the user expects a more detailed implementation. Let me check the problem again. The user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is just "Round a floating-point number", so perhaps the function is supposed to be a wrapper around the built-in round function.

But perhaps the user wants to implement the rounding logic manually. Let me think about how to do that.

Another approach: using the decimal module with ROUND_HALF_TO_EVEN as the rounding mode.

So, for example:

from decimal import Decimal, getcontext, ROUND_HALF_TO_EVEN

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    # Convert the float to a Decimal
    decimal_number = Decimal(str(n))
    # Set the rounding mode
    getcontext().rounding = ROUND_HALF_TO_EVEN
    # Round to the nearest integer
    return float(decimal_number.to_integral_value())

But converting the float to a string could introduce precision issues. For example, if the float is 2.5, converting to a string would be '2.5', which is accurate. However, for numbers that can't be represented exactly as a float, converting to a string might lose precision. But perhaps this is acceptable for the purpose of the function.

Alternatively, using the decimal module with the appropriate context.

But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. Since the user hasn't specified any particular requirements, perhaps the simplest solution is to use the built-in round function.

But maybe the user wants to ensure that the function is implemented correctly, perhaps because the built-in round function may not be available in some contexts. However, in standard Python, round is available.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to handle cases where the number is very close to a halfway point due to floating-point precision errors. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity, but given that the function name is round_half_to_even, which is the same as the built-in round function, the most straightforward implementation is to return round(n). However, perhaps the user expects a more detailed implementation.

But since the user hasn't provided more details, and the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, which is minimal, the correct approach is to use the built-in round function.

Therefore, the code would be:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But maybe the user wants to handle cases where the input is not a float? Well, the function is supposed to round a floating-point number, so the input is assumed to be a float.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to implement the rounding logic manually. Let me think about that.

Another approach is to check the fractional part. For example:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    integer_part = int(n)
    fractional_part = n - integer_part
    if fractional_part == 0.5:
        if integer_part % 2 == 0:
            return integer_part
        else:
            return integer_part + 1
    elif fractional_part > 0.5:
        return integer_part + 1
    else:
        return integer_part

But this approach has several issues. For example, when n is negative, the logic might not work correctly. Also, comparing floating-point numbers for equality is problematic due to precision issues. For example, if n is 2.5, then fractional_part is exactly 0.5. But for numbers like 2.5000000001, it would be treated as greater than 0.5. However, the function is supposed to round a floating-point number, so perhaps the input is intended to be a float that can be accurately represented.

But this approach also has issues with negative numbers. For example, -2.5 would have integer_part -2, fractional_part 0.5. According to the code, since integer_part is even (-2 is even), it returns -2. Which is correct. For -3.5, integer_part is -3 (odd), so returns -3 + 1 = -2. But wait, -3.5 is halfway between -4 and -3. According to round half to even, it should round to -4 (since -4 is even). But according to the code, it would return -3 + 1 = -2, which is incorrect. So the code has a flaw in handling negative numbers.

So, the code needs to handle negative numbers correctly. Let's adjust the logic:

The correct approach is to check if the fractional part is exactly 0.5, and then decide whether to round up or down based on whether the integer part is even or odd. However, for negative numbers, the logic is a bit different. For example, -2.5 is halfway between -2 and -3. The even number is -2, so it should round to -2. -3.5 is halfway between -4 and -3. The even number is -4, so it should round to -4.

So, the code needs to check if the fractional part is exactly 0.5, and then check if the integer part is even. If it is, round to it. If not, round to the next even number. However, for negative numbers, the next even number could be in either direction.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to look at the integer part's parity. For example, if the fractional part is 0.5, then:

If the integer part is even, round to it.

If the integer part is odd, round to the nearest even number, which would be integer_part + 1 if it's positive, or integer_part - 1 if it's negative.

Wait, for example, integer_part is -3 (odd), so adding 1 would make it -2 (even). For integer_part -3.5, adding 1 would make it -2, which is correct. For integer_part 3 (odd), adding 1 would make it 4 (even). So the code can be adjusted as:

if fractional_part == 0.5:
    if integer_part % 2 == 0:
        return integer_part
    else:
        return integer_part + 1 if n >= 0 else integer_part - 1

But how to handle the sign? Alternatively, perhaps the code can check if the integer part is even, and if not, round to the nearest even number, which would be integer_part + 1 if the number is positive, or integer_part - 1 if negative.

But this requires checking the sign of the number.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can calculate the nearest even integer by adding 1 if the integer part is odd, but adjusting based on the sign.

This is getting complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to use the built-in round function, as it already handles all these cases correctly.

Thus, the code would be:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But the user might have expected a manual implementation. However, given the lack of specific instructions, using the built-in function is the most straightforward and correct approach.
