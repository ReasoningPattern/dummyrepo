Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the format method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what's required.

The function is part of a class, as indicated by the 'self' parameter. The method takes 'sql' and 'params' as inputs. The 'sql' is of type AnyStr, which I know is a union of str and bytes. The 'params' can be either a dictionary with string or integer keys and any values, or a sequence of any elements. The return type is a tuple where the first element is AnyStr and the second is either the same type as params.

The docstring says that the method converts SQL using self._converter.convert. So, I need to call that method. But wait, what's the purpose of this format method? It probably processes the SQL string and parameters, maybe replacing placeholders with actual values using the converter.

Looking at the context provided, there are several attributes in the class like self._converter, self._in_regex, self._create_in_regex, self._create_converter, etc. The _create_converter is mentioned as a method that's called in the __init__ method. So, the _converter is likely an instance of a converter class that handles the actual conversion of parameters into SQL-safe values.

The format method needs to apply the converter to the SQL and parameters. But how? Maybe the converter has a method called convert that takes SQL and parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the converter is used to process the SQL string and parameters in some way, like escaping or formatting.

Wait, the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert". So the method should call self._converter.convert(sql, params). But what's the return value? The converter's convert method might return the processed SQL and parameters. However, the return type of the format method is a tuple of AnyStr and the same type as params. So perhaps the converter's convert method returns the modified SQL and the parameters, but the parameters might be adjusted in some way.

Alternatively, maybe the format method is responsible for applying the converter to the SQL string and parameters, possibly replacing placeholders. For example, if the SQL has placeholders like %s, the converter might replace them with the parameters. But the parameters could be a sequence or a dictionary, so the converter needs to handle both cases.

Wait, the parameters can be a sequence or a dictionary. If it's a dictionary, maybe the SQL uses named placeholders, and if it's a sequence, it uses positional placeholders. The converter might handle that based on the in_style and out_style attributes, which are part of the class.

Looking at the context, there's self._in_style and self._out_style, which are probably the styles for input and output. Also, there's self._in_regex, which might be a regular expression used to find placeholders in the SQL string. The _create_in_regex method is called in the __init__, so that's probably setting up the regex pattern for placeholders.

So, the format method might be using the converter to process the SQL string and parameters. The converter could be an instance that handles escaping or formatting based on the in_style and out_style. For example, if the in_style is 'format', it might use Python's string formatting, or if it's 'qmark', it might use ? as placeholders.

But the exact implementation details aren't provided. The user just wants the code that calls self._converter.convert(sql, params) and returns the result as a tuple. However, the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and the same type as params. So, perhaps the converter's convert method returns the processed SQL and the parameters, but the parameters might be modified. Wait, but the parameters are passed in, and the return type's second element is the same type as the input params. So maybe the converter doesn't modify the parameters but just processes the SQL.

Alternatively, maybe the converter's convert method returns the processed SQL and the original parameters. So the format method would return (processed_sql, params). But the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert", which implies that the converter is responsible for both converting the SQL and the parameters. However, the parameters are passed as a parameter to the format method, so perhaps the converter is used to process the SQL string, and the parameters are passed through.

Wait, perhaps the format method is part of a class that handles SQL formatting, like a database driver. The _converter could be responsible for escaping parameters, and the format method applies that to the SQL string. For example, if the SQL has placeholders, the converter replaces them with the escaped parameters.

But without knowing the exact implementation of _converter.convert, I have to make an educated guess. The docstring says to convert the SQL using the converter, so the code would likely be:

return self._converter.convert(sql, params)

But the return type is a tuple. So maybe the converter's convert method returns a tuple of (processed_sql, processed_params). However, the return type's second element is Union[Dict[...], Sequence[...]], which matches the params type. So perhaps the converter returns the same type of params, but maybe modified. But the user's docstring doesn't specify that, so maybe the format method just returns the result of the converter's convert method, which is a tuple.

Alternatively, maybe the format method is supposed to return the processed SQL and the original parameters. But the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and the same type as params. So, if the converter's convert method returns (processed_sql, params), then that would fit.

But how to implement this? Let me think. The code for the format method would be:

def format(self, sql, params):
    return self._converter.convert(sql, params)

But the parameters are of type Union[Dict[...], Sequence[...]], and the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and the same type. So, assuming that the _converter.convert method returns a tuple where the first element is the processed SQL (AnyStr) and the second is the params (same type as input), then this code would work.

But the user's docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert", which suggests that the method is supposed to apply the converter to the SQL and parameters. So the code would be as simple as calling that method.

But wait, maybe the converter is supposed to process the SQL string and the parameters. For example, if the SQL has placeholders, the converter replaces them with the parameters. In that case, the converter might need to process the SQL string and the parameters, and return the formatted SQL and the parameters (or maybe the parameters are modified in some way).

But without knowing the exact implementation of _converter.convert, I can't be sure. However, given the information, the most straightforward code is to call self._converter.convert(sql, params) and return the result as a tuple.

So the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    return self._converter.convert(sql, params)

But wait, the return type is a tuple. So the _converter.convert method must return a tuple of (AnyStr, params_type). Therefore, the code is correct.

But I need to make sure that the parameters are passed correctly. Also, the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert", which implies that the method is delegating the conversion to the converter. So this code should be correct.

Another thing to consider: the parameters could be a sequence or a dictionary. The converter might handle both cases based on the in_style or other attributes. But since the code is supposed to be generated based on the given info, and the docstring says to use the converter, the code is as above.

So the final code is as written.
