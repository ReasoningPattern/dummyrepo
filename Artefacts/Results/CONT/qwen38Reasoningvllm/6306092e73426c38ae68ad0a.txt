Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_choices_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do.

The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is one of the available choices. So, the method should iterate through the arguments and verify each one against a list of allowed choices. 

First, I should consider how the arguments are structured. Since it's part of a class, maybe the args are stored in self.vars or another attribute. Wait, looking at the context, there's a mention of self.vars. So perhaps the arguments are in self.vars. Also, there's a method called _iterate_received_arguments which might be used to process the args.

The method needs to check each argument's value against its allowed choices. So, for each key in args, I should check if the value is in the choices specified in the spec. But where are the choices stored? Maybe in the spec_dict passed during initialization. The __init__ method has parameters like spec_dict, so perhaps the spec is part of the class instance.

Wait, the function signature is def validate_choices_args(self, args):, so the args are passed as a parameter. But in the context, there's a method called parse_args which might be related. Also, there's a method called get_spec_defaults which could be where the choices are defined.

Alternatively, maybe the choices are part of the options_spec. The method create_complex_argumet_type mentions spec_option, which might include choices. So perhaps each argument has a spec that defines allowed choices.

So, the approach would be: for each argument in args, check if it's in the allowed choices. If not, raise an error.

But how to get the allowed choices? Maybe the spec_dict has entries for each option, and each entry has a 'choices' key. So, for each key in args, look up the corresponding spec in the spec_dict to find the choices.

Wait, the class has an __init__ method that takes spec_dict. So the spec_dict is an attribute of the class. Therefore, the method can access self.spec_dict to get the choices.

So, the steps would be:

1. Iterate over each key-value pair in args.
2. For each key, check if it exists in self.spec_dict.
3. If it does, get the choices from self.spec_dict[key].
4. Check if the value is in the choices. If not, raise a ValueError or similar.
5. If any argument fails this check, the method should return False or raise an exception.

But the method's return type isn't specified. Looking at other methods like validate_min_max_args, they might return a boolean. However, the docstring doesn't specify, but the function is named validate_choices_args, so perhaps it's expected to validate and return a boolean indicating success.

Wait, but in the context, there's a method called validate_min_max_args which is called in the same context. So maybe the validate_choices_args is part of a series of validation methods that return a boolean or raise exceptions.

But the user hasn't specified, so I need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the method should check all arguments and return True if all are valid, False otherwise. Or perhaps it raises an exception if any invalid choice is found.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to validate each argument and collect errors. But without more info, I'll proceed with checking each argument's value against its choices and raising an error if any is invalid.

So, the code would look something like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    :param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key in self.spec_dict:
            choices = self.spec_dict[key].get('choices', [])
            if value not in choices:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice for {key}: {value}")
    return True

Wait, but maybe the args are not a dictionary. The context mentions self._iterate_received_arguments, which might process the args. Also, the method's parameter is args, which could be a list or another structure. However, the docstring says "the given args", which is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps args is a dictionary of arguments, and each key corresponds to an option with a spec in self.spec_dict. So the code above would work.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the context includes methods like self.get_answers_file_args, which might be related to handling arguments from files, but perhaps that's beyond the current scope.

Another consideration: the method is called validate_choices_args, so it's possible that the args are passed as a dictionary, and each key's value needs to be checked against the choices in the spec_dict.

So, the code would iterate over each key in args, check if the key exists in the spec_dict, and then check if the value is in the choices. If not, raise an error.

But what if the key isn't in the spec_dict? Maybe it's allowed to have arguments not in the spec_dict. The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps we should only check the keys that are present in the spec_dict.

So the code would be as above.

But the user might expect that the method returns a boolean. However, in some cases, it might be better to raise an exception. But the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the method should return True if all are valid, False otherwise. However, that's not clear.

Alternatively, the method might be part of a validation process that accumulates errors, but again, without more info, it's hard to tell.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code that checks each argument's value against the choices in the spec_dict and raises a ValueError if any invalid choice is found. The method could return True if all are valid, but perhaps the method is designed to raise exceptions, which is common in validation.

But looking at other methods in the context, like validate_min_max_args, they might return a boolean. However, without knowing the exact behavior, I'll proceed with raising an error.

Another point: the method is part of a class that has a spec_dict, which is passed in the __init__ method. So the code can access self.spec_dict.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    :param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key in self.spec_dict:
            choices = self.spec_dict[key].get('choices', [])
            if value not in choices:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice for {key}: {value}")
    return True

But wait, the method's parameter is args, which is passed as a parameter. However, in the context, there's a method called self.parse_args which might be responsible for parsing the arguments into a structure. So perhaps args is a dictionary of parsed arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the args are a list of arguments, but that's less likely given the context. The method's name and the docstring suggest that each argument's value should be checked against choices.

Another consideration: the method might need to handle nested arguments or custom types, but again, without more info, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, the code should iterate through the args, check each value against the choices in the spec_dict, and raise an error if any are invalid. The code would look like the above.
