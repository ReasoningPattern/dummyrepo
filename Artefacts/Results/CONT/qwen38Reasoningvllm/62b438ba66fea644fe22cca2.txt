Okay, I need to generate Python code for the deep_merge_nodes function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function's purpose is to merge nodes, handling duplicate keys. The docstring mentions that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, I need to handle nested structures and merge them recursively.

First, I should check if the input is a Mapping (like a dict). If it's not, return it as is. Then, iterate through the items. For each key, check if it exists in the result. If it does, merge the values. But how to handle merging?

Wait, the problem says to merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys. So, if two nodes have the same key, their values should be merged. But if the values are not MappingNodes, the last one wins. So, for each key, if the existing value is a Mapping, we need to merge recursively. Otherwise, we take the last value.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that it's handling a list of nodes, each of which might be a Mapping. So maybe the nodes parameter is a list of dictionaries or similar structures. Wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes(nodes), so nodes is a list of nodes. Wait, but the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So perhaps each node is a dictionary, and the function merges all nodes in the list, combining their keys. For example, if two nodes have the same key, their values are merged. But how?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes (each being a dictionary-like structure) into a single merged dictionary. For example, if nodes is a list of dictionaries, then deep_merge_nodes would combine them, merging nested dictionaries and overwriting non-dictionary values with the last occurrence.

So the approach would be to iterate through each node in the nodes list, and for each key in the node, merge it into the result. If the key already exists in the result, then if both values are mappings (like dicts), merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last value.

But how to handle the merging? Let's think of it as a recursive function. For each key in the current node, check if it exists in the result. If it does, and both are mappings, then merge them. Otherwise, take the last value.

Wait, but the nodes parameter is a list of nodes. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list. So, for example, if nodes is a list of dictionaries, then the function merges them into one. So the first step is to initialize the result as the first node, then iterate through the rest, merging each into the result.

But the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that it's handling a list of nodes (each being a node structure, perhaps from ruamel.yaml's MappingNode). But the user mentioned imported packages include ruamel, so maybe the nodes are instances of ruamel.yaml's nodes.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains."

So, the function takes a list of nodes (each being a node, possibly a MappingNode), and merges them. For each key, if there are multiple nodes with the same key, their values are merged. If the values are not MappingNodes, the last one is kept.

So, the approach is to process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, merge it into the result. The merging is done recursively for nested nodes.

But how to check if a node is a MappingNode? Since the user mentioned the imported package is ruamel, perhaps using ruamel.yaml's classes. So, for each value, check if it's a MappingNode. If so, recursively merge. Otherwise, take the last value.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes(nodes), and the nodes are probably a list of nodes. So, the function needs to merge all nodes in the list. Let me think of an example.

Suppose nodes is a list of two dictionaries. The first has key 'a' with value 1, and the second has key 'a' with value 2. The merged result should have 'a' with value 2. If the first has 'a' as a dict { 'b': 1 }, and the second has 'a' as { 'b': 2 }, then the merged 'a' should be { 'b': 2 }.

So the function needs to process each node in the list, merging their keys into a single structure. The merging is done recursively for nested structures.

So the code structure would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    # Initialize result as the first node
    result = nodes[0]
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        # Merge node into result
        # For each key in node:
        #   if key exists in result:
        #       if both are mappings, merge recursively
        #       else, take the last value
        #   else:
        #       add the key to result
    return result

But how to handle the merging? Let's think in terms of the ruamel.yaml's MappingNode. But perhaps the function is supposed to handle any Mapping-like structures. However, the user mentioned that the imported packages include ruamel, so maybe the nodes are instances of ruamel.yaml's nodes.

But the function's parameters are nodes, which is a list. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes (each being a MappingNode) into a single node. So, for example, if the nodes are a list of MappingNodes, then the function merges them.

But how to handle the merging. Let me think of the code.

First, check if nodes is empty. If not, take the first node as the base. Then for each subsequent node, merge it into the base. For each key in the current node, check if it's present in the base. If it is, and both are mappings, then merge them. Otherwise, take the last value.

But how to check if a value is a mapping. For ruamel.yaml's MappingNode, perhaps we can check if it's an instance of MappingNode. However, the code may need to handle other types as well. But according to the docstring, if the values are not MappingNode, the last one remains.

So, the code would need to recursively merge the nodes. Here's a possible approach:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    if not nodes:
        return None
    result = nodes[0]
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        # Merge node into result
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], MappingNode) and isinstance(value, MappingNode):
                    # Recursively merge
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    # Take the last value
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But wait, this assumes that each node is a MappingNode. But the function's parameters are nodes, which is a list. So perhaps the nodes are a list of MappingNodes. However, the code may need to handle other types as well. But according to the docstring, if the values are not MappingNode, the last one remains.

But how to check if a value is a MappingNode. The ruamel.yaml's MappingNode is a class, so we can check using isinstance.

But the problem is that the code may not have access to the ruamel.yaml's classes. However, the user mentioned that the imported packages include ruamel, so perhaps the code can use those classes.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge them. But the docstring mentions MappingNode, so maybe it's using ruamel's nodes.

But the user's code includes 'imported Packages: os logging ruamel', so the code can use ruamel's classes.

So, the code would need to check if a value is a MappingNode. However, in ruamel.yaml, the MappingNode is a class, so perhaps the code can use that.

But the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that it's handling a list of nodes. So, the code would process each node in the list, merging them into a single node.

But the initial code example I wrote earlier may not be correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes(nodes), where nodes is a list of nodes. So, for example, nodes could be a list of dictionaries. But the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys", which suggests that each node is a dictionary, and the function merges all of them into one.

But the code needs to handle nested structures. So, for each key in the current node, if it exists in the result, then check if both are mappings. If so, merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last value.

But how to handle the merging of the nodes. Let me think of the code.

Another approach: the function deep_merge_nodes takes a list of nodes (each being a dictionary or a MappingNode), and returns a merged node. The merging is done by combining all the nodes, with later nodes overwriting earlier ones for the same key, and merging nested structures.

So, the code could be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    if not nodes:
        return {}
    result = nodes[0].copy()
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But this assumes that the nodes are dictionaries. However, the docstring mentions MappingNode, which is part of ruamel.yaml. So, perhaps the code should check if the value is a MappingNode. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, the code may need to use the ruamel.yaml's functions to merge nodes. However, without knowing the exact structure of the nodes, it's hard to say.

But given the user's context, the code may be part of a YAML processing library using ruamel.yaml. So, perhaps the nodes are instances of ruamel.yaml's MappingNode. In that case, the code would need to check if the value is a MappingNode.

But the code may need to handle both MappingNodes and regular dictionaries. However, the function's name suggests that it's handling nodes, which are likely from ruamel.yaml.

But given that the user hasn't provided the exact structure, I'll proceed with the assumption that the nodes are dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge them recursively.

But the initial code I wrote would work for dictionaries. However, the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that it's handling nodes, which may have more complex structures.

But given the information, I'll proceed with writing code that handles dictionaries, merging them recursively.

But the user's code includes 'imported Packages: os logging ruamel', so perhaps the code is using ruamel.yaml's nodes. So, the code may need to handle MappingNode instances.

In that case, the code would need to check if a value is a MappingNode. For example:

from ruamel.yaml.nodes import MappingNode

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    if not nodes:
        return None
    result = nodes[0]
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], MappingNode) and isinstance(value, MappingNode):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But I'm not sure if this is correct. Also, the function may need to handle other types of nodes. But given the information, this seems like a possible approach.

However, the function's parameters are nodes, which is a list. So, the code is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. The initial code starts with the first node and merges the rest into it.

But in the case of ruamel.yaml's nodes, the code may need to use the ruamel's merge functionality. However, the user's code may not have that, so the code needs to implement it manually.

Another thing to consider: the function is supposed to return the merged node. So, if the nodes are MappingNodes, the result should be a MappingNode as well.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, based on the docstring and the function signature, the code should merge the nodes, handling duplicates, and return the merged result.

So, putting it all together, the code would look something like this:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    if not nodes:
        return None
    result = nodes[0]
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But this assumes that the nodes are dictionaries. However, if they are MappingNodes, the code may need to handle them differently. But given the lack of specific information, this is the best I can do.

Another thing: the function may need to handle the case where the nodes are not dictionaries. But the docstring says that if the values are not MappingNode, the last one remains. So, perhaps the code should check if the value is a MappingNode. However, without knowing the exact classes, it's hard to say.

But since the user mentioned the imported package is ruamel, I'll assume that the nodes are instances of ruamel.yaml's nodes, and that the code should check for MappingNode.

So, modifying the code:

from ruamel.yaml.nodes import MappingNode

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    if not nodes:
        return None
    result = nodes[0]
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], MappingNode) and isinstance(value, MappingNode):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But this code may not work as expected. For example, if the nodes are not MappingNodes but regular dictionaries, the code would still work. However, the function's name suggests that it's handling nodes, which may be more complex.

But given the information, this is the best approach. Also, the user mentioned that the function is part of a file that includes 'logger ; load_configuration(filename) ; include_configuration(loader,filename_node) ; DELETED_NODE ; deep_merge_nodes(nodes) ; ', so perhaps the nodes are part of a configuration system using ruamel.yaml.

In conclusion, the code should handle merging nodes, checking if they are MappingNodes, and recursively merging them. The code above should be the correct approach.
