Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the protocol_handlers method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The docstring says that protocol_handlers returns a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers keyed by version tuples. If a specific protocol version is provided, it should return either zero or one item depending on support. If not, return all available versions. Also, it raises a TypeError if the protocol version isn't a tuple.

First, I need to check if the protocol_version is provided. If it's not None, I need to validate that it's a tuple. So, the first step is to check if protocol_version is not None and not a tuple. If that's the case, raise a TypeError.

Next, the method should return a dictionary. The keys are version tuples, and the values are handler classes. The question is, where do these handler classes come from? The context mentions that within the class, there's a self.PROTOCOL_VERSION and other attributes. Maybe the handlers are stored in a class-level dictionary or determined based on the version.

Looking at the context, there's a method called version_list which takes versions and a limit. Also, there's a self.protocol_handlers method, which suggests that the class might have a way to determine supported versions. Maybe the class has a list of supported versions, and the protocol_handlers method checks against that.

Wait, the method is part of a class, so perhaps the class has a list of supported protocol versions. For example, maybe the class has an attribute like _supported_versions which is a list of tuples. Then, the protocol_handlers method would filter this list based on the provided protocol_version.

So, the steps would be:

1. Check if protocol_version is provided. If so, validate it's a tuple.
2. Determine the list of supported versions. Maybe from self._supported_versions or similar.
3. If protocol_version is provided, check if it's in the supported versions. If yes, return a dict with that version as the key and the corresponding handler class.
4. If not provided, return all supported versions as keys with their handler classes.

But how to get the handler classes? The context mentions self.HYDRATION_HANDLER_CLS and self.UNPACKER_CLS, but not sure. Maybe each version has a specific handler class. Alternatively, perhaps the handlers are determined based on the version, like using a factory function.

Alternatively, maybe the class has a dictionary of handlers, like self._handlers, which maps version tuples to handler classes. Then, the protocol_handlers method would return a subset of that based on the protocol_version.

But since the method is a class method (cls is the first parameter), perhaps it's using class-level data. Wait, the method is defined as def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):, so it's a class method. So, the class might have a list of supported versions and a way to map versions to handlers.

Wait, the context shows that within the class, there's a self.protocol_handlers method. So, maybe the class has an attribute that holds the supported versions and their handlers. For example, maybe the class has a _protocol_handlers dictionary that maps version tuples to handler classes.

So, the code would look something like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol version must be a tuple")
        # Check if the version is supported
        if protocol_version in cls._supported_versions:
            return {protocol_version: cls._handlers[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        # Return all supported versions
        return {v: cls._handlers[v] for v in cls._supported_versions}

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct attributes. The context mentions self.PROTOCOL_VERSION, which might be the current version, but the method is about returning all available handlers.

Alternatively, maybe the class has a list of versions and for each version, there's a handler. For example, the class could have a _protocol_handlers dictionary.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I have to infer based on the context. The context shows that within the class, there's a self.protocol_handlers method, which suggests that the class has some internal data structure for handling protocols.

Another possibility is that the method is part of a class that has a list of supported versions, and the handlers are determined based on those versions. For example, the class might have a list like SUPPORTED_VERSIONS = [(3, 0), (3, 1), ...], and for each version, there's a corresponding handler class.

So, the code could be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol version must be a tuple")
        # Check if the version is supported
        if protocol_version in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS:
            return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        # Return all supported versions
        return {v: cls._HANDLERS[v] for v in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS}

But I need to check if the class has these attributes. The context shows that there's a self.PROTOCOL_VERSION, which might be the current version, but the method is about returning all available versions.

Alternatively, perhaps the class has a list of versions and the handlers are determined based on that. For example, the class might have a list of versions and a dictionary mapping versions to handlers.

But without knowing the exact structure, I have to make assumptions. The user's code might have a class with a _protocol_handlers dictionary and a list of supported versions.

Another approach is to look at the context. The context includes methods like self.version_list, which might be related to versions. Also, there's a self.protocol_handlers method, which is the one we're implementing.

Wait, the context shows that within the class, there's a self.protocol_handlers method. So, the method is part of the class, and the code is to be generated for that method. So, the code should use instance variables or class variables.

But the method is defined as a class method (since the first parameter is cls). Wait, no, the method is defined as def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):, which is a class method. So, it's using the class, not an instance. But in the context, the method is part of the class, and the code is to be generated for that method.

So, the code should use class-level attributes. For example, the class might have a list of supported versions and a dictionary of handlers.

So, the code could be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol version must be a tuple")
        # Check if the version is supported
        if protocol_version in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS:
            return {protocol_version: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        # Return all supported versions
        return {v: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER[v] for v in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS}

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct attributes. However, without knowing the exact structure, I have to make educated guesses.

Another possibility is that the class has a list of versions and the handlers are determined by some logic. For example, the class might have a list of versions and for each version, there's a handler class.

Alternatively, the method might use the class's version list and the handlers are determined by the version.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I have to proceed with the information given.

Another thing to note is that the method is part of a class that has attributes like self.PROTOCOL_VERSION, which might be the current version, but the method is about returning all available versions.

In the absence of specific information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the class has a list of supported versions and a dictionary mapping versions to handler classes. The code would check the protocol_version against the supported versions and return the appropriate dictionary.

So, the final code would be as follows, with the necessary checks and returns.
