Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function get_option_spec based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is part of a class, as indicated by the self parameter. The docstring mentions that it gets the specification for a specified option name. It also refers to using self.get_parser_option_specs() for getting options of the given command_name. 

Looking at the context provided, there are several methods mentioned like _include_groups, iterate_parsers, _get_all_options_spec, and others. The spec_dict is an attribute of the class, which probably holds the specifications for options and commands.

The function signature is def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):. So, the goal is to retrieve the option specification for a particular command and argument.

First, I should figure out how the data is structured. The spec_dict likely contains entries for commands, each with their own options. So, maybe the spec_dict is a nested dictionary where the top level is commands, and each command has a list of options.

The get_parser_option_specs method is mentioned in the docstring. Perhaps that method is responsible for retrieving the options for a specific command. So, maybe get_option_spec calls get_parser_option_specs to get the options for the command, then searches through those options to find the one with the given argument_name.

Alternatively, the _get_all_options_spec might be used to collect all options, and then filter based on command_name and argument_name.

Looking at the context, there's a method _get_all_options_spec which takes a parser_dict. Maybe the spec_dict is structured in a way that allows traversing through parsers and their options.

Another point: the function needs to return the specification for the option. So, perhaps the spec_dict has entries like 'command_name': {'options': [{'name': 'argument_name', 'spec': ...}]}.

So, the steps could be:

1. Retrieve the parser options for the given command_name using get_parser_option_specs.
2. Iterate through those options to find the one with the matching argument_name.
3. Return the specification for that option.

Alternatively, if the spec_dict is a flat structure, maybe we need to search through all commands and options to find the matching command and argument.

But given the context mentions self.get_parser_option_specs, which is a method that probably returns the options for a command, I think the approach would be to call that method to get the options for the command, then look for the argument_name in that list.

So, the code might look like:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    for option in options:
        if option['name'] == argument_name:
            return option['spec']
    return None

But I need to make sure that the structure of the options is such that each option has a 'name' and 'spec' key. Also, the docstring mentions that the function gets the specification for the specified option name, so the return value should be the spec.

Another thing to consider: the method _include_groups might be involved in including groups, but perhaps that's handled elsewhere. The iterate_parsers method might be used to traverse through different parsers, but again, the exact structure depends on the internal data.

Alternatively, if the spec_dict is a dictionary where each command has a list of options, then maybe:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    for cmd in self.spec_dict:
        if cmd == command_name:
            for option in self.spec_dict[cmd]['options']:
                if option['name'] == argument_name:
                    return option['spec']
    return None

But without knowing the exact structure of spec_dict, it's a bit tricky. However, the presence of get_parser_option_specs suggests that this method is responsible for getting the options for a command, so the first approach is more likely.

Also, the docstring says "Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()", which implies that get_parser_option_specs is called to get the options for the command, and then the function needs to find the specific argument_name within those options.

So, putting it all together, the code would call get_parser_option_specs for the command_name, then iterate through the returned options to find the one with the matching argument_name and return its spec.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    for option in options:
        if option['name'] == argument_name:
            return option['spec']
    return None

But I need to make sure that the code is in Python markdown format, which just means the code is written as Python code, not in any other format. Also, the user said not to include explanations, just the code.

Another thing to check: the parameters are command_name and argument_name. The function is supposed to get the option spec for the argument_name in the command_name. So the code should correctly handle that.

I think that's the correct approach. So the final code is as above.
