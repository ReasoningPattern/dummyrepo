Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the workspace_manager function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the docstring says. The function is supposed to get the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

So, the function is a method of a class, probably part of a service manager. The _get_service method is likely a helper that retrieves a service by name. The docstring mentions using ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER, which suggests that there's an enum or a constant named ServiceName with a member called WORKSPACE_MANAGER.

Looking at the context, the function is within a class that has several other methods like _get_service, setup, plugins_manager, etc. The workspace_manager is called as a method, so it's part of the class's methods.

The function signature is def workspace_manager(cls):, but wait, in Python, if it's a method, it should take self as the first parameter. However, the given signature has cls as the first parameter. That might indicate that this is a class method or a static method. But the context shows that within the file, the function is called as self.workspace_manager(cls), which suggests that maybe the function is intended to be a class method. Or perhaps there's a confusion here. Wait, looking at the context again: the user provided that within the class, there's self.workspace_manager(cls). So, the function is called as a method of the class, but the parameter is cls. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the function is a class method, so it's decorated with @classmethod. Or perhaps the function is supposed to be a static method that takes the class as an argument.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class and is called as a method, but the parameter is cls, which is the class itself. That would make sense if it's a class method. But the original function signature shows def workspace_manager(cls):, which would be a class method if decorated. However, the user hasn't provided any decorators. So perhaps the function is intended to be a static method, or maybe it's a regular method that takes the class as an argument.

But given the context, the function is called as self.workspace_manager(cls), which implies that the function is a method of the class, and the first parameter is self. But the given function signature has cls as the first parameter. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the function signature. Let me check again.

The user provided the function signature as def workspace_manager(cls):, but in the context, it's called as self.workspace_manager(cls). So, perhaps the function is supposed to be a method that takes self as the first argument, but the given signature has cls. That might be an error. However, the user says to generate code based on the given function signature, so I have to follow that.

So, the function is defined as def workspace_manager(cls):, which would be a class method if decorated. But the user hasn't provided any decorators. However, the context shows that within the class, the function is called as self.workspace_manager(cls), which suggests that the function is a method of the class, taking self as the first argument. But the given function signature has cls as the first parameter. This is conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the function signature. But since I have to generate code based on what's given, I'll proceed with the provided signature.

The docstring says that the function gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So, the function is supposed to call cls._get_service with the service name ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER.

So, the code would be something like:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But wait, the function is supposed to be part of a class. If the function is a method, then the first parameter should be self. However, the given function signature has cls as the first parameter. That suggests that it's a class method, perhaps. But without a decorator, it's unclear. However, the user's context shows that within the class, the function is called as self.workspace_manager(cls), which implies that the function is a method that takes self as the first argument. But the given function signature has cls as the first parameter. This is conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is a static method that takes the class as an argument. But again, without decorators, it's hard to tell. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So I have to follow that.

So, the code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName is imported. However, the user's context shows that the imported packages are os, sys, infrared. So ServiceName might be part of the infrared module or another module. But since the user hasn't provided that, I'll assume that ServiceName is available in the scope.

Another thing to consider: the function is called as self.workspace_manager(cls) in the context. If the function is a method, then the first parameter should be self. But the given function signature has cls as the first parameter. That suggests that the function is a class method, perhaps. So maybe the function is decorated with @classmethod. But the user hasn't provided that. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature, so I shouldn't add any decorators unless specified.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to be a static method, and the cls is the class itself. So, the code would be as above.

Therefore, the generated code would be as follows.
