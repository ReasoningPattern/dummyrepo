Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the find_tags function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function takes a text string and an optional replacer callable. It should find tags in the text, ignoring those inside code blocks. If a replacer is provided, it should replace the tag words using that function. The return is a set of tags and the modified text.

First, I need to figure out how to identify tags and code blocks. The docstring mentions ignoring tags inside code blocks, so I probably need to use regular expressions to find code blocks and then process the text outside of them.

Looking at the imported packages: re is available, which is good for regex. Also, bleach is imported, but I'm not sure yet how it fits in. Maybe for sanitizing? Or perhaps not. The function's purpose is to find tags, so maybe bleach isn't directly used here.

The function needs to find tags. What defines a tag? The problem mentions "tags" but doesn't specify the exact pattern. However, looking at the context, there's a function called test_tag(tag), which might be used to validate tags. Also, there's a variable ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS, which probably contains characters that are not allowed in tags. So, the tag might be something like words that start with a certain pattern, maybe with specific delimiters.

Wait, the function returns a set of tags. So, the tags are probably words or patterns found in the text, but not inside code blocks. Also, the replacer function is called with the tag word to replace it.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Split the text into parts that are inside code blocks and outside. For example, code blocks might be enclosed in delimiters like ``` or <!-- -->. But since the exact delimiters aren't specified, maybe the code blocks are identified by a regex pattern. However, without knowing the exact delimiters, I need to make assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are marked with a specific pattern, like triple backticks.

But the problem states that the function should ignore tags inside code blocks. So, the approach could be:

- Find all code blocks in the text.
- For the text outside code blocks, find tags.
- Replace the tags if a replacer is provided.

But how to find code blocks? Let me think. Maybe code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks. So, using a regex to find those regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are identified by a specific pattern. However, without more context, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's assume that code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks, like:

```
Some code here
```

So, the regex for code blocks could be something like ```(.*?)``` but need to account for possible newlines.

But perhaps the code blocks are marked with a specific start and end. Alternatively, maybe the code blocks are identified by a certain pattern, like <!-- code --> or similar. But since the exact method isn't specified, maybe the code blocks are identified by a regex that matches them.

Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are not part of the text processing, and the function is supposed to ignore any tags that are within code blocks. But how to determine that?

Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are identified by a regex that matches them, and then the text outside is processed for tags.

Another approach: split the text into code blocks and non-code parts. For example, using a regex to find all code blocks and then process the remaining text.

But since the exact code block delimiters are not given, maybe the function uses a specific pattern. Let me think about the context again. The imported packages include urllib, re, bleach. The function decode_if_bytes(text) and encode_if_text(text) are mentioned. Maybe the text is HTML, and code blocks are within <pre> or <code> tags? Or maybe the code blocks are marked with a certain pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are identified by a regex that matches them, and then the text outside is processed for tags.

But since the exact method isn't specified, I need to make an assumption. Let me proceed with the following steps:

1. Use regex to find all code blocks in the text. For example, assuming code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks.

But perhaps the code blocks are identified by a regex that matches them, and then the text outside is processed for tags.

Alternatively, maybe the code blocks are identified by a certain pattern, and the function uses that to split the text.

Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are not part of the text processing, and the function just ignores any tags that are within code blocks. But how to determine that?

Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are identified by a regex that matches them, and then the function processes the text outside of those code blocks.

But without knowing the exact code block markers, this is challenging. However, given that the function is called find_tags and the context includes process_text_links, which might be part of a text processing pipeline, perhaps the code blocks are marked with a certain pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are identified by a regex that matches them, and the function uses that to split the text into code and non-code parts.

Let me proceed with the following approach:

- Use a regex to find all code blocks in the text. For example, assuming code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks.

But perhaps the code blocks are identified by a regex like r'```(.*?)```' with the re.DOTALL flag to capture newlines.

Once the code blocks are identified, the remaining text (outside code blocks) is processed for tags.

So, the steps would be:

1. Split the text into code blocks and non-code parts.

2. For each non-code part, find tags.

3. Collect all tags found.

4. If a replacer is provided, replace each tag with the result of the replacer function.

But how to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts?

Let me think about using re.split to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts. For example, using a regex that matches code blocks and captures them, then the remaining parts are non-code.

Alternatively, using re.sub to replace code blocks with a placeholder, then process the remaining text.

But perhaps the code blocks are identified by a regex, and then the text outside is processed for tags.

But since the exact code block markers are not given, I need to make an assumption. Let me assume that code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks, like:

```
Some code here
```

So, the regex pattern for code blocks would be r'```(.*?)```' with re.DOTALL to capture newlines.

Once the code blocks are identified, the remaining text is processed for tags.

So, the code could look like this:

- Use re.findall to find all code blocks, then split the text into parts that are not code blocks.

But perhaps the code blocks are split into parts, and the rest is processed.

Alternatively, using a regex to find all code blocks and then process the text outside of them.

But how to split the text into code and non-code parts?

An alternative approach is to use a regex to find all code blocks, then for each part of the text that is not in a code block, process for tags.

But how to split the text into these parts?

Let me think of using a regex to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts. For example:

import re

def find_tags(text, replacer=None):
    # Find code blocks
    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', text, re.DOTALL)
    # The rest of the text is non-code parts
    # But how to split the text into non-code parts?
    # Maybe using re.split to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts
    # For example:
    parts = re.split(r'```(.*?)```', text, flags=re.DOTALL)
    # parts will be a list where the even indices are non-code parts, and the odd are code blocks
    # Then, process each non-code part for tags

But this might not capture all cases, but it's a starting point.

Once the non-code parts are obtained, process each part for tags.

Now, for finding tags in the non-code parts. What defines a tag? The problem mentions that the function returns a set of tags. So, the tags are probably words that match a certain pattern. For example, words that start with a certain character, or have a certain format.

Looking at the context, there's a variable ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS, which probably contains characters that are not allowed in tags. Also, there's a function test_tag(tag) which might be used to validate tags.

So, perhaps the tags are words that are not in code blocks, and match a certain pattern. For example, words that start with a certain prefix, or have a certain format.

But without knowing the exact pattern, I need to make assumptions. Let's assume that a tag is a word that is not in code blocks and matches a certain regex, such as starting with a specific character (like #) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are words that are enclosed in certain delimiters, like <tag> or similar. But again, without knowing the exact format, this is challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are words that are not in code blocks and are not part of URLs or other structures. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are words that are not in code blocks and are not part of links. Since there's a function process_text_links, which might be part of the text processing.

But this is getting too speculative. Let me think of the function's purpose again. The function is supposed to find tags in the text, ignoring those inside code blocks. So, the tags are probably words or phrases that are considered tags, like hashtags, or specific keywords.

Assuming that tags are words that start with a certain character, like #, and are not inside code blocks.

So, the regex for tags could be something like r'#(\w+)' to find hashtags.

But again, without knowing the exact tag format, this is a guess. However, given the context, perhaps the tags are words that are not in code blocks and are not part of URLs.

Alternatively, the tags could be words that are not in code blocks and are not part of any other structure, like links or code.

But since the function is called find_tags, perhaps the tags are words that are not in code blocks and are not part of any other structure.

But how to define that?

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are words that are not in code blocks and are not part of URLs. For example, using the process_text_links function to process links and then find tags in the remaining text.

But again, without knowing the exact implementation, this is challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are words that are not in code blocks and are not part of any other structure, and are matched by a regex.

Let me proceed with the following steps:

1. Split the text into code blocks and non-code parts.

2. For each non-code part, find all tags using a regex that matches the tag pattern.

3. Collect all tags into a set.

4. If a replacer is provided, replace each tag with the result of the replacer function.

But again, the exact regex for tags is unclear. However, given the context, perhaps the tags are words that are not in code blocks and are not part of URLs. So, perhaps the function uses a regex to find tags, and then replaces them.

Alternatively, maybe the tags are words that are not in code blocks and are not part of any other structure, like links or code.

But without more information, I need to make an assumption. Let me assume that tags are words that start with a specific character, like #, and are not in code blocks.

So, the regex for tags would be r'#(\w+)'.

But then, the function would find all such words and collect them.

Now, putting this together:

The code would:

- Split the text into code blocks and non-code parts.

- For each non-code part, find all tags using a regex.

- Collect all tags into a set.

- If a replacer is provided, replace each tag in the original text with the replacer's result.

But how to replace the tags in the original text? Because the code blocks are split, and the non-code parts are processed.

Alternatively, the function needs to process the entire text, replacing tags that are not inside code blocks.

But how to do that?

Another approach: process the entire text, but when inside code blocks, ignore tags. Otherwise, find and replace tags.

But how to do that with regex?

Perhaps using a regex that matches code blocks and then processes the rest.

Alternatively, using a regex that matches tags outside of code blocks.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think of using a regex that matches code blocks and then processes the text outside of them.

So, the code could be:

import re
from typing import Tuple, Set

def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set[str], str]:
    # Find code blocks
    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', text, re.DOTALL)
    # Split the text into parts that are not code blocks
    parts = re.split(r'```(.*?)```', text, flags=re.DOTALL)
    # Process each part for tags
    tags = set()
    modified_text = text
    for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        # Find tags in this part
        # Assuming tags are words starting with #, for example
        tag_matches = re.findall(r'#(\w+)', part)
        tags.update(tag_matches)
        # Replace tags if replacer is provided
        if replacer:
            # Replace each tag with replacer(tag)
            # But how to do that?
            # Maybe using a regex substitution
            # For example, replace each #tag with the replacer's result
            # But need to capture the tag and replace it
            # So, using a lambda function in re.sub
            # However, the replacer is a function that takes the tag as an argument
            # So, for each match, call replacer on the tag
            # So, the substitution would be:
            part = re.sub(r'#(\w+)', lambda m: replacer(m.group(1)), part)
        # Reconstruct the modified text
        # But how to handle the code blocks?
        # Wait, the code blocks are in the parts as well? Or are they split out?
        # Wait, the split using re.split(r'```(.*?)```', text, flags=re.DOTALL) will split the text into parts that are not code blocks, and the code blocks are in the parts as well? Or are they split into separate elements?
        # Let me think: re.split with a pattern that includes the code block content will split the text into parts that are outside the code blocks, and the code blocks are in the split parts as well? Or not?

        # For example, if the text is "Hello ```code``` world", then re.split(r'```(.*?)```', text) would split into ["Hello ", "code", " world"], so the code block is in the middle. So, the code blocks are in the split parts as the odd indices.

        # So, the code blocks are in the parts as the odd indices, and the non-code parts are the even indices.

        # So, in the loop, for each part, if it's a code block (i is odd), we leave it as is. Otherwise, process it for tags.

        # Wait, no. The split returns a list where the even indices are the non-code parts, and the odd indices are the code blocks. For example:

        # text = "part1 code part2"
        # split on code would give ["part1 ", "code", " part2"]

        # So, for i in range(len(parts)), if i is even, it's a non-code part, and if odd, it's a code block.

        # So, in the loop, for each part, if it's a code block (i is odd), we leave it as is. Otherwise, process it for tags.

        # So, in the loop, for each part, check if it's a code block or not.

        # But how to know? Because the split includes the code blocks as separate elements. So, the code blocks are in the parts as the odd indices.

        # So, in the loop, for each part, if i is odd, it's a code block, so we leave it as is. Otherwise, process it.

        # But in the code above, the parts are split into non-code parts and code blocks. So, the code blocks are in the parts as the odd indices.

        # Therefore, in the loop, for each part, if it's a code block (i is odd), we leave it as is. Otherwise, process it for tags.

        # But how to handle the code blocks in the modified text? Because the code blocks are in the parts as the odd indices.

        # So, during processing, for each part, if it's a code block, we leave it as is. Otherwise, process it for tags.

        # So, the modified_text is built by joining the processed parts.

        # Wait, but the original text is split into parts, and the code blocks are in the parts as the odd indices. So, during processing, the code blocks are left as is, and the non-code parts are processed for tags.

        # So, the modified_text would be the parts joined together, with the non-code parts processed.

        # But how to build the modified_text?

        # Let me think: the parts are split into non-code and code blocks. For each part, if it's a code block (i is odd), we leave it as is. Otherwise, process it for tags and replace the tags.

        # So, during the loop, for each part, if it's a code block, we add it to the modified_text as is. Otherwise, we process it and add the processed part.

        # So, the modified_text is built by iterating through the parts and appending the processed parts.

        # However, in the code above, the parts are split into non-code and code blocks. So, for example, the first part is non-code, then code block, then non-code, etc.

        # So, during the loop, for each part, if it's a code block, we add it as is. Otherwise, process it.

        # Therefore, the code would be:

        # modified_text = []
        # for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        #     if i % 2 == 1:  # code block
        #         modified_text.append(part)
        #     else:
        #         # process part for tags
        #         # find tags and replace if needed
        #         # then append the processed part
        #         modified_text.append(processed_part)
        # modified_text = ''.join(modified_text)

        # But how to handle the processing of the part for tags?

        # So, for each non-code part, find all tags, collect them, and replace them if a replacer is provided.

        # So, the code for processing a non-code part would be:

        # Find all tags in the part, collect them, then replace them with the replacer's result.

        # But how to do that? For example, using re.sub with a lambda function.

        # So, for a non-code part, if replacer is provided, replace each tag with the replacer's result.

        # So, the code for processing a non-code part would be:

        # if replacer:
        #     part = re.sub(r'#(\w+)', lambda m: replacer(m.group(1)), part)
        # Then, collect the tags from the original part before replacement.

        # Wait, but the tags are found in the original part, not the modified part. So, we need to find the tags in the original part, then replace them.

        # So, the steps for a non-code part are:

        # 1. Find all tags in the original part (before replacement).
        # 2. Add them to the tags set.
        # 3. If replacer is provided, replace each tag in the part with the replacer's result.

        # So, the code for processing a non-code part would be:

        # tag_matches = re.findall(r'#(\w+)', part)
        # tags.update(tag_matches)
        # if replacer:
        #     part = re.sub(r'#(\w+)', lambda m: replacer(m.group(1)), part)

        # Then, append the modified part to the modified_text.

        # So, putting this together:

        # modified_parts = []
        # for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        #     if i % 2 == 1:
        #         modified_parts.append(part)
        #     else:
        #         tag_matches = re.findall(r'#(\w+)', part)
        #         tags.update(tag_matches)
        #         if replacer:
        #             part = re.sub(r'#(\w+)', lambda m: replacer(m.group(1)), part)
        #         modified_parts.append(part)
        # modified_text = ''.join(modified_parts)

        # But this would split the text into code blocks and non-code parts, process the non-code parts for tags and replacements, and then join them back together.

        # However, the original text may have other structures, like links. The context mentions process_text_links, which might be used to process links before finding tags. But since the function is called find_tags, perhaps the links are processed first.

        # But without knowing the exact processing steps, this is challenging. However, given the context, perhaps the function uses process_text_links to process the text before finding tags.

        # But since the function is called find_tags, and the parameters are text and replacer, perhaps the process_text_links is called within the function to process the text first.

        # However, the code provided in the context includes process_text_links(text) as a function, but it's not clear how it's used here.

        # Alternatively, perhaps the function uses process_text_links to process the text, then finds tags in the processed text.

        # But again, this is speculative.

        # Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the code that splits the text into code blocks and non-code parts, processes the non-code parts for tags, collects them, and replaces them if a replacer is provided.

        # Now, the code for the function would be:

        # import re
        # from typing import Tuple, Set

        # def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set[str], str]:
        #     code_blocks = re.findall(r'```(.*?)```', text, re.DOTALL)
        #     parts = re.split(r'```(.*?)```', text, flags=re.DOTALL)
        #     tags = set()
        #     modified_text = []
        #     for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        #         if i % 2 == 1:
        #             modified_text.append(part)
        #         else:
        #             tag_matches = re.findall(r'#(\w+)', part)
        #             tags.update(tag_matches)
        #             if replacer:
        #                 part = re.sub(r'#(\w+)', lambda m: replacer(m.group(1)), part)
        #             modified_text.append(part)
        #     modified_text = ''.join(modified_text)
        #     return tags, modified_text

        # However, this code has several issues. For example, the regex for code blocks may not capture all cases, and the regex for tags may not be correct. Also, the code may not handle overlapping code blocks or other edge cases.

        # Additionally, the function returns a set of tags and the modified text. The tags are collected from the non-code parts, and replaced if a replacer is provided.

        # But the problem mentions that the function should ignore tags inside code blocks, which this code does by processing only non-code parts.

        # However, the regex for code blocks may not be correct. For example, if the code blocks are marked with different delimiters, like <!-- code -->, the regex would need to be adjusted.

        # Also, the regex for tags may not be correct. For example, if tags are not hashtags but something else.

        # Given the uncertainty, but based on the given information and the context, this is the best approach I can think of.

        # Now, considering the context, there's a function called test_tag(tag), which may be used to validate tags. So, perhaps the tags are filtered using test_tag.

        # So, the code should include a check to see if a tag is valid using test_tag.

        # So, the code would be:

        # tag_matches = re.findall(r'#(\w+)', part)
        # for tag in tag_matches:
        #     if test_tag(tag):
        #         tags.add(tag)

        # But since the function is called find_tags, and the test_tag is part of the context, it's possible that the tags are filtered using this function.

        # So, modifying the code:

        # tag_matches = re.findall(r'#(\w+)', part)
        # for tag in tag_matches:
        #     if test_tag(tag):
        #         tags.add(tag)

        # Also, the ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS variable may be used to filter out tags that contain illegal characters.

        # So, perhaps the code should check if the tag contains any illegal characters.

        # For example:

        # for tag in tag_matches:
        #     if not any(char in ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS for char in tag):
        #         if test_tag(tag):
        #             tags.add(tag)

        # But again, without knowing the exact implementation of ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS and test_tag, this is speculative.

        # Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with the code that finds hashtags in non-code parts, collects them, and replaces them if a replacer is provided.

        # Also, the function returns a set of tags and the modified text. The modified text includes the replaced tags.

        # Now, the code should also handle cases where the text is bytes, using decode_if_bytes and encode_if_text functions mentioned in the context. But since the function's parameter is text: str, perhaps the text is already decoded.

        # So, the code may not need to handle that.

        # Putting it all together, the code would be:

        # import re
        # from typing import Tuple, Set

        # def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set[str], str]:
        #     parts = re.split(r'```(.*?)```', text, flags=re.DOTALL)
        #     tags = set()
        #     modified_text = []
        #     for i, part in enumerate(parts):
        #         if i % 2 == 1:
        #             modified_text.append(part)
        #         else:
        #             # Find tags in this part
        #             tag_matches = re.findall(r'#(\w+)', part)
        #             # Filter tags using test_tag and ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS
        #             for tag in tag_matches:
        #                 if test_tag(tag) and all(char not in ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS for char in tag):
        #                     tags.add(tag)
        #             # Replace tags if replacer is provided
        #             if replacer:
        #                 part = re.sub(r'#(\w+)', lambda m: replacer(m.group(1)), part)
        #         modified_text.append(part)
        #     modified_text = ''.join(modified_text)
        #     return tags, modified_text

        # But this code has several issues. For example, the split may not handle all cases, and the regex for tags may not be correct. Also, the test_tag and ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS are not defined in the code, but they are part of the context.

        # However, since the user provided the context that includes these variables and functions, the code should use them.

        # So, the code should include calls to test_tag and check for illegal characters.

        # Also, the function may need to process the text using other functions like decode_if_bytes and encode_if_text, but since the parameter is text: str, perhaps these are already handled.

        # Given all this, the final code would be as follows.
