Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the 'values' method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do.

The docstring says it returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list. Hmm, so maybe the method is supposed to retrieve values associated with certain keys, but those keys are determined by the 'index' method. Wait, the 'index' method is mentioned in the context, which probably returns some kind of index or key. 

Looking at the context, there are several methods like __getitem__, get, items, keys, etc. The 'values' method is part of a class that seems to handle some kind of data structure, maybe a dictionary or a custom collection. The presence of methods like __getitem__ and __iter__ suggests it's a sequence or a collection.

The function signature is def values(self, *keys):. So it takes variable keys. The docstring says it returns the key filtered by self.index. Wait, maybe 'self.index' is a method that returns a key or a list of keys? Or perhaps it's using the index method to find the position and then retrieve values?

Wait, the docstring says "key filtered by self.index". Maybe the keys provided to the values method are filtered through the index method. Or perhaps the method is supposed to return the values corresponding to the keys that are present in the index. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'index' here refers to the index of the keys in some structure. For example, if the class has an index method that returns the position of a key, then the values method might be retrieving values based on those indices.

But the method is called 'values', which typically returns all values of a dictionary. However, the presence of *keys suggests that it's filtering the keys. So maybe the method is supposed to return the values for the given keys, but those keys are filtered through the index method. Or perhaps the keys are filtered by checking if they exist in the index.

Alternatively, maybe the 'index' here refers to the index of the elements in the data structure. For example, if the class is a list-like structure, then the index method could return the position of a key, and the values method would return the values at those positions.

Wait, looking at the context, there's a method called self.index(self, key) which is probably similar to the list index method. So maybe the 'values' method is supposed to return the values corresponding to the keys that are found using the index method. But how does that work with the *keys parameter?

Wait, the docstring says "Returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list." Maybe it's supposed to return the values of the keys that are present in the index. For example, if the keys provided are filtered through the index (like checking if they exist in the index), then collect their values.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'index' here refers to the index of the keys in the data structure. For example, if the keys are in a certain order, and the values method is returning the values at those indices.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about possible implementations.

If the 'values' method is supposed to return the values for the given keys, but those keys are filtered by the index. Maybe the index method is used to check if the key exists, and then collect the values. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are in the index. For example, if the index is a list of keys, then the values method would return the values of those keys.

Wait, the method is called 'values', which in a dictionary would return all values. But with *keys, maybe it's returning the values for the given keys. But the docstring says "key filtered by self.index". So perhaps the keys are filtered through the index method. For example, for each key in *keys, check if it's in the index, and if so, include its value.

Alternatively, maybe the index method returns a key, and the values method is using that key to get the value. But that doesn't fit with the *keys parameter.

Alternatively, maybe the 'index' here refers to the index of the elements in the data structure. For example, if the data is a list, and the keys are indices, then the values method would return the elements at those indices. But that would be similar to __getitem__.

But given that the method is called 'values', and the context includes methods like items, keys, etc., it's more likely that this is a dictionary-like structure. So the 'values' method might be returning the values of the keys provided, but filtered through some index.

Wait, looking at the context, there's a method called self._super_getitem_single(self, index), which might be used to get a single item by index. Also, there's a method called self._broken_record_error, which might be an error handler.

Another possibility is that the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are present in the index. For example, if the index is a list of keys, then the values method would return the values of those keys. But how does that interact with the *keys parameter?

Alternatively, maybe the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are in the index, and the *keys parameter is used to filter which keys to include. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the 'index' here refers to the index of the keys in the data structure. For example, if the keys are ordered, and the values method returns the values at those indices.

But without more context, it's a bit challenging. However, given that the method is called 'values', and the docstring says it returns the key filtered by self.index, perhaps the intended behavior is to return the values of the keys that are in the index. But how?

Wait, maybe the 'index' here refers to the index method, which returns the position of a key. So if the keys are provided, and the index method is used to find their positions, then the values method could be returning the values at those positions. But that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are present in the index. For example, if the index is a list of keys, then the values method would return the values of those keys. But how does the *keys parameter factor into this?

Alternatively, perhaps the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are passed to it, but those keys are filtered through the index. For example, for each key in *keys, check if it exists in the index, and if so, include its value.

But how to implement that? Let's think about code.

Assuming that the 'index' is a method that returns a key or a list of keys, perhaps the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are present in the index. But the *keys parameter is the keys to consider.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are in the index. For example, if the index is a list of keys, then the values method would return the values of those keys. But then the *keys parameter would be redundant.

Alternatively, maybe the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are passed to it, but those keys are filtered by the index. For example, for each key in *keys, check if it's in the index, and if so, include its value.

But how to implement that? Let's think.

If the index method returns a list of keys, then perhaps the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are in the intersection of *keys and the index. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'index' here refers to the index of the elements in the data structure. For example, if the data is a list, and the keys are indices, then the values method would return the elements at those indices. But that would be similar to __getitem__.

But given the presence of methods like __getitem__ and get, it's possible that this is a dictionary-like structure. So perhaps the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are passed to it, but those keys are filtered by the index method. For example, if the index method returns a key, then the values method would return the value of that key. But with *keys, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are in the index. For example, if the index is a list of keys, then the values method would return the values of those keys. But then the *keys parameter is not used. That doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Given the ambiguity, perhaps I should look for patterns in the existing methods. For example, the method self.value(self, key, default) suggests that there's a method to get a value for a key with a default. The __getitem__ method is also present, which is used to get items by key.

The docstring says "Returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list." Maybe the 'index' here refers to the index method, which returns the position of a key. So, if the keys are provided, and the index method is used to get their positions, then the values method would return the values at those positions. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are in the index. For example, if the index is a list of keys, then the values method would return the values of those keys. But again, the *keys parameter is unclear.

Assuming that the index method returns a list of keys, then:

def values(self, *keys):
    # Get the index keys
    index_keys = self.index()
    # Filter the provided keys to those in index_keys
    filtered_keys = [k for k in keys if k in index_keys]
    # Return the values of those keys
    return [self.get(k) for k in filtered_keys]

But that's just a guess. However, the docstring says "key filtered by self.index", which might mean that the keys are filtered by the index. But the method is called 'values', which usually returns all values. So perhaps the *keys parameter is used to specify which keys to include, and those keys are filtered by the index.

Alternatively, maybe the 'index' here refers to the index of the keys in the data structure. For example, if the data is a list, and the keys are indices, then the values method would return the elements at those indices. But again, that's not clear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the existing methods and see what's possible. For example, the method self._super_getitem_single is used to get a single item by index. Also, there's a method called self.data, which might be the underlying data structure.

Another possibility is that the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys that are in the index. For example, if the index is a list of keys, then the values method would return the values of those keys. But the *keys parameter is not used in this case.

Alternatively, maybe the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys provided, but the keys are filtered by the index method. For example, the index method could be used to validate or transform the keys before retrieving their values.

But without more context, it's challenging.

    # Filter the provided keys to those in index_keys
    filtered_keys = [k for k in keys if k in index_keys]
    # Return the values of those keys
    return [self.get(k) for k in filtered_keys]

But I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the 'index' method returns a key, and the values method returns the value of that key. But with *keys, it's unclear.

Also, there's a method called self._broken_record_error, which might be an error handler. The method self.value(self, key, default) suggests that there's a way to get a value for a key with a default.

Putting this together, perhaps the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys provided, but those keys are filtered by the index method. For example, the index method could be used to validate or transform the keys before retrieving their values.

But again, without more context, it's hard to say.

At this point, I think the best approach is to write code that returns the values of the keys provided, filtered by the index method. For example, if the index method returns a list of keys, then the values method would return the values of those keys. But since the method has *keys, perhaps it's supposed to return the values of the keys provided, but only if they are in the index.

So the code could be:

def values(self, *keys):
    index_keys = self.index()
    return [self.get(k) for k in keys if k in index_keys]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the index method is used to get the position of the key, and then the value is retrieved using that position. For example:

def values(self, *keys):
    return [self._super_getitem_single(self, self.index(k)) for k in keys]

But again, this is just a guess.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that the 'values' method is supposed to return the values of the keys provided, but those keys are filtered by the index method. So the code would filter the keys using the index and then retrieve their values.

But I'm not entirely confident. However, given the information, this seems like a plausible approach.
