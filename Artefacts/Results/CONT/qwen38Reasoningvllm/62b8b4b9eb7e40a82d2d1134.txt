Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function namesAndDescriptions based on the given signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, and there's a lot of context about other methods and attributes available.

First, the function's docstring says it returns the name and description of the current class attribute. The parameter 'all' is a boolean, defaulting to False. So, I need to figure out what this function is supposed to do.

Looking at the context, there are several methods mentioned like self.names(self, all), self.getDescriptionFor(self, name), and self.queryDescriptionFor(self, name, default). These suggest that the function might be iterating over attributes, getting their names and descriptions.

The names method probably returns the names of the attributes, and getDescriptionFor gets the description for a specific name. So, maybe namesAndDescriptions is combining these two pieces of information.

If all is False, perhaps it's returning a list of tuples with names and their descriptions, but only for certain attributes. If all is True, maybe it includes more or all attributes.

Wait, the function is part of a class, and there's a mention of self.__name__, self.__doc__, and other attributes. Maybe the function is gathering all the attributes of the class, including their names and descriptions.

So, the approach could be: get all the attribute names using self.names(all), then for each name, get the description using getDescriptionFor or queryDescriptionFor. Then return a list of tuples (name, description).

But I need to check the context again. The user mentioned self.namesAndDescriptions(self, all) is part of the class, so maybe the function is supposed to return the names and descriptions of the class's attributes. The 'all' parameter might control whether to include all attributes or just some.

Looking at the existing methods, self.names(self, all) could be used to get the names. Then, for each name, call getDescriptionFor or queryDescriptionFor. The queryDescriptionFor has a default, so maybe that's used when a description isn't found.

Putting this together, the function could iterate over the names obtained from self.names(all), then for each name, get the description using self.queryDescriptionFor(name, default=None). Then collect these as tuples.

Wait, the docstring says "the name and description of the current class attribute." So maybe it's for the attributes of the class, not the class itself. So the function is gathering all attributes' names and their descriptions.

So the code would be something like:

def namesAndDescriptions(self, all=False):
    """
    Returns the name and description of the current class attribute.
    """
    names = self.names(all)
    result = []
    for name in names:
        description = self.queryDescriptionFor(name)
        result.append((name, description))
    return result

But I need to check if there's a default value. The queryDescriptionFor method has a default parameter, so maybe if the description isn't found, it returns an empty string or something. So perhaps using self.queryDescriptionFor(name, default='').

Alternatively, maybe the getDescriptionFor method is used, which might have a different default. The context shows self.getDescriptionFor(self, name) and self.queryDescriptionFor(self, name, default). So perhaps queryDescriptionFor is the right one here, with a default.

So the code would use self.queryDescriptionFor(name, default='') to get the description for each name.

Another thing: the function is part of a class, and the context includes methods like self.__name__, self.__doc__, etc. But the function is about attributes, not the class itself. So the names are the attributes of the class.

Putting it all together, the code would look like:

def namesAndDescriptions(self, all=False):
    """
    Returns the name and description of the current class attribute.
    """
    names = self.names(all)
    return [(name, self.queryDescriptionFor(name, default='')) for name in names]

But I need to make sure that the 'all' parameter is passed correctly. The self.names(all) would use the 'all' parameter to determine whether to include all attributes or not.

So the final code would be as above. Let me check again. The user said not to include explanations, just the code. So the generated code should be the function with the docstring and the implementation using the mentioned methods.
