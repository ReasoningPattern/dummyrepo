Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function append_text_to_file based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it writes data from a text buffer to a file. The parameters are file_name, text_buffer, encoding, and overwrite. 

First, I should check if the file exists and whether we need to overwrite it. If overwrite is True, maybe we should truncate the file. But wait, the function is called append_text_to_file, so maybe the default is to append, but if overwrite is True, we should write from the start. Hmm, but the name is a bit conflicting. Let me check the parameters again. The overwrite parameter is a boolean, so perhaps when True, it overwrites the file, otherwise appends.

Wait, the function is named append_text_to_file, so maybe the default is to append, but if overwrite is True, then it should overwrite. But that's a bit confusing. Let me think. The function's purpose is to write the text buffer to the file. So if overwrite is True, we should write the text_buffer to the file, replacing its contents. If False, append to the end.

But how to handle that. So first, check if the file exists. If overwrite is True, then open the file in write mode ('w'), which truncates the file. If overwrite is False, open in append mode ('a'). But wait, the function is called append_text_to_file, so maybe the default is to append, and overwrite is an option to overwrite. So the function's behavior is: if overwrite is True, then write the text_buffer to the file (overwriting existing content), else append to the end.

But the function's name is a bit misleading. However, the user provided the function signature and docstring, so I should follow that. The docstring says "Writes the data in the text buffer to a file". So perhaps the function is supposed to write the text_buffer to the file, either overwriting or appending based on the overwrite flag.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if the file exists. If overwrite is True, we need to create or truncate it. If not, append.

But wait, the function might need to handle the encoding. The encoding parameter is provided, so we need to open the file with that encoding.

But also, the user mentioned that the function is part of a class, and there are other methods like self.append_binary_to_file, which suggests that this function might be part of a class that handles file operations.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so I need to write the function as a standalone function, but considering that it's part of a class. However, the function signature shows that it's a method of a class, since it has self as the first parameter? Wait, no. The function signature given is def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):, which suggests it's a standalone function, not a method of a class. But the context says that within the class, there are references to self.append_text_to_file, which implies that the function is a method of a class. So perhaps the function is part of a class, and the first parameter is self.

Wait, the user provided the function signature as def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):, but in the context, within the class, there's a reference to self.append_text_to_file. So that suggests that the function is a method of the class, and the first parameter is self. But the given function signature doesn't include self. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature, or maybe the function is a static method. But the user says to generate code based on the given function signature, so I should follow that.

Wait, the user's function signature is:

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    """
    Writes the data in the text buffer to a file
    """
    #

But in the context, the function is called as self.append_text_to_file, which implies that it's a method of a class. Therefore, the function should have 'self' as the first parameter. However, the given function signature doesn't include it. This is a bit conflicting. But the user says to generate code based on the given function signature, so I should stick to that. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature. Alternatively, maybe the function is a static method or a class method.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is a standalone function, not part of a class. However, the context mentions that within the class, there are references to self.append_text_to_file, which suggests that the function is a method of the class. Therefore, perhaps the function signature should include 'self' as the first parameter. But the user provided the function signature without it. This is a problem.

But the user says to generate code based on the given function signature. So I should proceed with the given parameters. However, the context mentions that the function is part of a class. So maybe the user intended for the function to be a method of the class, but the function signature is missing the 'self' parameter. But since the user provided the function signature as is, I should generate code that matches that, even if it's not a method. But that would be inconsistent with the context.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class, and the 'self' is implied. But in Python, the function signature must include 'self' if it's a method. Therefore, there's a discrepancy here. However, since the user provided the function signature as is, I'll proceed with that, assuming that it's a standalone function. But then, in the context, the function is called as self.append_text_to_file, which would imply that it's a method. This is confusing.

But perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature. To resolve this, perhaps the function is a method of the class, and the correct signature should include 'self' as the first parameter. But since the user provided the function signature without 'self', I need to generate code that matches that. However, the context mentions that the function is part of the class, so perhaps the function is a method, and the user's function signature is incomplete.

This is a problem. However, given the user's instruction to generate code based on the provided function signature, I'll proceed with the given parameters. Therefore, the function is a standalone function, not a method of a class. But the context mentions that within the class, there are references to self.append_text_to_file, which suggests that the function is a method. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is using a different approach, such as using a class with helper methods. But without more information, it's hard to say. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the function as a standalone function, but include the necessary code to handle the file operations.

So, the function needs to write the text_buffer to the file. The parameters are file_name, text_buffer, encoding, and overwrite. The encoding is specified, so we need to open the file with that encoding. The overwrite flag determines whether to overwrite or append.

So, the steps:

- Check if the file exists. If overwrite is True, open in 'w' mode (which truncates the file). If overwrite is False, open in 'a' mode (append).

But wait, the function is called append_text_to_file, which suggests that the default is to append. However, the overwrite parameter might be used to decide whether to overwrite. So, if overwrite is True, then we should write the text_buffer to the file, replacing its contents. Otherwise, append.

So, the code would be:

with open(file_name, 'w' if overwrite else 'a', encoding=encoding) as f:
    f.write(text_buffer)

But wait, what about the encoding? The open function in Python requires the encoding parameter. However, in some versions, it's not supported, but assuming that the code is using Python 3, which supports the encoding parameter.

But also, the user mentioned that the function is part of a class that uses codecs, os, logging, pysolbase. So perhaps the code should use codecs.open instead of the built-in open? Because the user imported codecs. But the function's parameters include encoding, so using the built-in open with encoding is acceptable.

But the user imported codecs, so maybe they want to use codecs.open. However, the standard way is to use open with encoding. But perhaps the code should use codecs.open. Let me think.

In Python, the codecs module provides functions for opening files with specific encodings. However, the built-in open function in Python 3 also supports the encoding parameter. So, perhaps the code can use open with encoding. However, the user imported codecs, so maybe they want to use that. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

But given that the user has imported codecs, perhaps they want to use codecs.open. However, the function's parameters include encoding, so using codecs.open would require passing the encoding. So, the code could be:

import codecs

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    """
    Writes the data in the text buffer to a file
    """
    mode = 'w' if overwrite else 'a'
    with codecs.open(file_name, mode, encoding=encoding) as f:
        f.write(text_buffer)

But wait, the codecs.open function is deprecated in Python 3. So perhaps using the built-in open is better. However, the user imported codecs, so maybe they want to use it. Alternatively, maybe the code should use the standard open function with encoding.

But the user's context mentions that there's a method called self.append_binary_to_file, which suggests that the code might be handling binary and text files differently. However, the current function is for text.

Another thing to consider: the function's name is append_text_to_file, but the overwrite parameter might override that. So, if overwrite is True, the file is overwritten, else appended.

But what about the text_buffer? It's a buffer of text. So, the code should write that text to the file.

Another thing to consider: the function may need to handle exceptions, but the docstring doesn't mention that. The user hasn't specified error handling, so perhaps it's not required.

Also, the user mentioned that within the class, there are methods like self.get_file_size, self.is_file_exist, etc. So, perhaps the function should check if the file exists and handle that. But the function's parameters include overwrite, which may handle that.

But the function's responsibility is to write the text buffer to the file, so the code should handle opening the file with the correct mode and encoding.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    """
    Writes the data in the text buffer to a file
    """
    mode = 'w' if overwrite else 'a'
    with open(file_name, mode, encoding=encoding) as f:
        f.write(text_buffer)

But the user imported codecs, so maybe they want to use that. However, using the built-in open is more standard. However, the user's context shows that there's a method self.append_binary_to_file, which might use codecs. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use the codecs module. So:

import codecs

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    """
    Writes the data in the text buffer to a file
    """
    mode = 'w' if overwrite else 'a'
    with codecs.open(file_name, mode, encoding=encoding) as f:
        f.write(text_buffer)

But the user's code may have other dependencies. Also, the function may need to handle cases where the file doesn't exist. However, the open function with 'w' mode will create the file if it doesn't exist. So, the code should handle that.

Another thing: the function's docstring says "Writes the data in the text buffer to a file". So, the text_buffer is a string that should be written to the file.

But what about newlines? The function may need to handle that, but the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's not required.

So, the final code would be as above. But since the user mentioned that the function is part of a class, and the code includes methods like self.get_file_size, etc., perhaps the function is part of a class. However, the given function signature doesn't include 'self' as the first parameter. Therefore, there's a discrepancy. But the user says to generate code based on the given function signature, so I'll proceed with the given parameters.

So, the code would be:

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    """
    Writes the data in the text buffer to a file
    """
    mode = 'w' if overwrite else 'a'
    with open(file_name, mode, encoding=encoding) as f:
        f.write(text_buffer)

But the user imported codecs, so maybe they want to use that. However, using the built-in open is more straightforward. But since the user imported codecs, perhaps they have a specific reason. However, without more context, it's safer to use the standard open function.

Another consideration: the function may need to handle cases where the file cannot be opened. But the user hasn't mentioned error handling, so perhaps it's not required.

So, the final code is as above.
