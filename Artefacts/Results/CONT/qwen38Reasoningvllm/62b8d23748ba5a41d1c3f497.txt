Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do. The docstring says it should remove and return the least frequently used (key, value) pair. 

Looking at the context, the class uses the collections module and has a cache. There's a __counter attribute, which probably keeps track of the frequency of each key. Also, there's a maxsize, which might be the maximum number of items allowed in the cache. 

So, the popitem method needs to find the item with the lowest frequency. But how is the frequency tracked? The __counter might be a dictionary where keys are the items and values are their frequencies. Wait, but in some cache implementations, like the OrderedDict, you track the usage order. However, here the focus is on frequency, not order. 

Wait, the problem mentions "least frequently used," which suggests that the cache is using a frequency-based eviction policy. So, when an item is accessed, its frequency increases. The popitem method should remove the one with the lowest frequency. 

But how to efficiently find the item with the minimum frequency? If the __counter is a regular dictionary, finding the minimum each time would be O(n), which might not be efficient. However, given the context, maybe the class is using a structure that allows for efficient retrieval of the minimum frequency item. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __counter is part of a priority queue or a heap. But since the code isn't provided, I have to make assumptions based on the given context. 

Looking at the existing methods: there's __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, and pop. The __counter is an attribute. The class also has a maxsize, which might be the maximum number of items allowed. 

In a typical LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache, when an item is accessed, its count is incremented. When evicting, the item with the lowest count is removed. However, if multiple items have the same count, perhaps the one that was least recently used is evicted. But the problem here specifies only frequency, not recency. 

But the function signature is popitem, which in Python's dict is used to remove and return an arbitrary item. However, in this case, it's supposed to be the least frequently used. 

So, the approach would be to iterate through all items in the cache, find the one with the minimum frequency, remove it, and return it. 

But how to track the items? The class probably has a way to access all the keys. Let's assume that the cache is stored in a dictionary, maybe called __cache or something similar. But the context doesn't mention that. Wait, the user mentioned that within the class, there's self.__counter. Maybe __counter is the cache itself? Or maybe it's a separate structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __counter is a dictionary that maps keys to their frequencies, and the actual cache is stored elsewhere. But without more context, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe the class is a custom cache that uses a combination of a dictionary for storage and a counter for frequencies. For example, the __cache could be a dictionary mapping keys to values, and __counter is a dictionary mapping keys to their frequencies. 

Assuming that, then to find the least frequently used item, we need to iterate through all keys in __cache, find the one with the minimum frequency in __counter, then remove it from both __cache and __counter. 

But how to handle ties? For example, if multiple items have the same minimum frequency. The problem says "least frequently used," but doesn't specify how to break ties. Maybe the one that was added first, or the one that was least recently used. However, since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can just pick the first one encountered. 

So, the steps for popitem would be:

1. Iterate through all keys in the cache to find the one with the minimum frequency.
2. Remove that key from the cache and the counter.
3. Return the (key, value) pair.

But how to efficiently find the minimum? If the cache is large, iterating each time is O(n), which could be slow. However, given the context, maybe the code is designed for simplicity rather than efficiency. 

So, the code would look something like:

def popitem(self):
    # Find the key with the minimum frequency
    min_freq = float('inf')
    min_key = None
    for key in self.__cache:
        freq = self.__counter[key]
        if freq < min_freq:
            min_freq = freq
            min_key = key
    # Remove the key from the cache and counter
    value = self.__cache.pop(min_key)
    del self.__counter[min_key]
    return (min_key, value)

But wait, the user mentioned that the class has a __counter attribute. However, the code in the context shows that the class has self.__counter, and methods like __setitem__, __getitem__, etc. 

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the full code, so I have to make assumptions. Also, the user mentioned that the class has a maxsize, which might be the maximum number of items allowed. However, in the popitem method, we are removing an item regardless of the maxsize, unless the cache is full. Wait, noâ€”the popitem is called when the cache is full, perhaps? Or is it called regardless? 

Wait, the function's docstring says it removes and returns the least frequently used item. So, it's possible that this method is used for eviction when the cache is full. But the presence of maxsize suggests that the cache has a maximum size. However, the popitem method is supposed to remove an item regardless of the size, perhaps. 

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the user's context shows that the class has a __counter, and the methods like __setitem__, __getitem__, etc. 

Another possibility is that the __counter is a dictionary that tracks the frequency of each key, and the actual cache is stored in another structure. For example, maybe the cache is an OrderedDict, and the __counter is a separate dictionary. 

But again, without more context, I have to proceed with the assumption that the cache is stored in a dictionary (maybe self.__cache), and the __counter tracks the frequencies. 

Alternatively, maybe the __counter is the cache itself. For example, in some implementations, the cache is a dictionary where the keys are the items, and the values are the frequencies. But that's unlikely because the value is the actual data. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __counter is a dictionary that maps keys to their frequencies, and the actual cache is stored in another attribute, like self.__data. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, I have to make an educated guess. 

Another approach: looking at the existing methods. The __setitem__ is called with key, value, and cache_setitem. Maybe the __setitem__ is handling the insertion into the cache and updating the frequency. Similarly, __getitem__ and __delitem__ would update the frequency. 

Assuming that the cache is stored in self.__cache (a dictionary), and the __counter is a dictionary that tracks the frequency of each key. 

So, in the popitem method, we need to find the key with the minimum frequency in __counter, remove it from __cache and __counter, and return the (key, value) pair. 

But how to handle the case where the cache is empty? Well, the method would raise an error, but the problem doesn't mention that. 

Putting this all together, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    # Find the key with the minimum frequency
    min_key = None
    min_freq = float('inf')
    for key in self.__counter:
        if self.__counter[key] < min_freq:
            min_freq = self.__counter[key]
            min_key = key
    # Remove the key from the cache and counter
    value = self.__cache.pop(min_key)
    del self.__counter[min_key]
    return (min_key, value)

But wait, the __counter might not be a dictionary. Maybe it's a list or another structure. However, given the name, it's likely a dictionary. 

Another thing to consider: the __counter might be a Counter from the collections module. But the user mentioned that the imported packages include collections.cache, which might be a typo. Maybe it's collections and cache? Or maybe it's a custom module. 

But regardless, the code should work with the __counter being a dictionary-like structure. 

Another possible issue: if multiple keys have the same minimum frequency, this code will pick the first one encountered. That's acceptable as per the problem's docstring. 

So, the code above should work. However, the user's context mentions that the class has a maxsize. Maybe the popitem is called when the cache is full, but the problem doesn't specify that. 

In any case, the code should focus on finding the least frequently used item based on the __counter. 

Another thing: the __counter might not have all the keys if some have been deleted. But assuming that the __counter is maintained correctly by other methods, this code should work. 

Therefore, the final code for popitem would be as written above.
