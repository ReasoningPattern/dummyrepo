Okay, I need to create a Python function called paging that takes a response list and a max_results integer, then returns a generator that splits the response into pages. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should iterate over the response in chunks of max_results. So, for each page, I'll take a slice of the list. The start index is page number multiplied by max_results, and the end index is start plus max_results. But since Python slicing is exclusive on the upper bound, I'll use start + max_results as the end.

Wait, but how do I handle the generator? I can use a loop that goes from 0 to len(response) in steps of max_results. For each step, yield the slice. But I need to make sure that the last page doesn't go out of bounds. For example, if the total length isn't a multiple of max_results, the last slice should just take whatever is left.

So the steps would be: calculate the total number of items, then loop through each page. For each page number i, the start is i * max_results, and the end is start + max_results. But if end exceeds the length, just take up to the end of the list.

Wait, but in Python, list slicing handles that automatically. So response[start:end] will just take up to the end of the list if start is beyond. So maybe I can just do:

for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
    yield response[i:i+max_results]

Yes, that should work. But wait, what if max_results is zero? Oh, but the function's args say max_results is an int, but maybe it's up to the user to handle that. The problem statement doesn't mention handling invalid inputs, so perhaps we don't need to handle that case.

So the code would be a generator function that loops through the indices in steps of max_results, and yields each slice. That's straightforward.

Let me test with an example. Suppose response is [1,2,3,4,5], max_results is 2. Then the pages would be [1,2], [3,4], [5]. The loop would run for i=0, 2, 4. At i=4, the slice is [5], which is correct.

So the code would be:

def paging(response, max_results):
    """
    Return every response with the length of max_results
    Args:
    response (list): WAPI response.
    max_results (int): Maximum number of objects to be returned in one page.
    Returns:
        Generator object with WAPI response split page by page.
    """
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i+max_results]

Wait, but the docstring says "Return every response with the length of max_results". Maybe that's a typo and they meant "Return responses in pages of max_results length". Anyway, the code seems correct.

I should make sure that the function is a generator, which it is because of the yield statements. The function returns the generator object. So that's all. No other imports are needed since it's using built-in functions. The user mentioned that within the file, there are no imports, so the code should be self-contained.

Yes, this should work.
