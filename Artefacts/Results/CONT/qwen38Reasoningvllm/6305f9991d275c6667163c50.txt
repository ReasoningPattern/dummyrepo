Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function set_cut_chars based on the given signature and docstring. They mentioned not to include any explanations, just the code in Python markdown format.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it sets the bytes used to delimit slice points. The arguments are 'before' and 'after', both bytes. The function returns None.

Looking at the context provided, there are several attributes mentioned like self.DEFAULT_CUT_BEFORE and self.DEFAULT_CUT_AFTER. Also, there's a mention of self._cutter and self.split_parts. So, the function probably stores the before and after bytes into instance variables, maybe self.cut_before and self.cut_after. 

The function might also need to validate the inputs. Since the parameters are bytes, perhaps checking if they are of type bytes. But the user didn't specify validation, so maybe just assign them directly.

Wait, the context shows that in the __init__ method, there's self.DEFAULT_CUT_BEFORE and self.DEFAULT_CUT_AFTER. So maybe the set_cut_chars function is allowing the user to set these delimiters, possibly overriding the defaults.

So the code would assign the before and after parameters to instance variables. Maybe something like self.cut_before = before and self.cut_after = after. But I need to check if there are any other steps. For example, maybe the _cutter object needs to be updated, or the parts are recalculated. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention any other actions, just setting the delimiters.

Also, the function is part of a class, and there's a split_parts method that uses these cut characters. So setting the cut chars would prepare the cutter for splitting.

So the code would be straightforward: assign the parameters to instance variables. Let me make sure there's no other logic. The user didn't mention any, so I'll stick to that.

Now, writing the function:

def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
    self.cut_before = before
    self.cut_after = after

But wait, the context mentions self.DEFAULT_CUT_BEFORE and self.DEFAULT_CUT_AFTER. Maybe the function should set these as defaults if not provided? But the parameters are required. The function's parameters are before and after, so they are required. So the code is just assigning them.

I think that's it. The code is simple. Let me check the context again. The function is called in self.set_cut_chars(self,before,after), so the parameters are passed correctly. The code should just store them.
