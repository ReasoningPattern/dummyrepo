Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do.

The docstring says that popitem removes the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key-value tuple. So, this is similar to the behavior of a dictionary's popitem, which in Python 3.7+ maintains insertion order. But since the user mentioned imported packages like collections.cache, maybe this is part of a custom cache implementation.

Looking at the context, the class has an __init__ method with maxsize and getsizeof, and other methods like pop, __setitem__, __order, __delitem__. The __order attribute is probably tracking the insertion order. So, the popitem method needs to remove the first inserted item.

In a typical ordered dictionary, the first inserted item is at the beginning of the order list. So, the method should find the first key in __order, remove it from the dictionary and the order list, then return the key-value pair.

Wait, but how is the order stored? If __order is a list, then the first element is the first inserted. So, popitem would take the first element from __order, delete it from the dict, and return it.

But I need to make sure that the key is present. Wait, the problem says "Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key", so the key must exist. But maybe the method should raise an error if the cache is empty? Or maybe it's assumed that the cache isn't empty when popitem is called.

Looking at the context, the class has a pop method, which might be similar to dict.pop. So, perhaps popitem is intended to remove the first inserted item, regardless of whether it's present. But the docstring says "Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key", implying that the key exists.

So, the steps for popitem would be:

1. Get the first key from __order.
2. Remove that key from the dictionary.
3. Remove the key from __order.
4. Return the key and value as a tuple.

But how is __order structured? Let's assume that __order is a list that maintains the insertion order. So, the first element is the first inserted key.

So, in code:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
    key = self.__order[0]
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    self.__order.pop(0)
    return (key, value)

Wait, but in Python, deleting from a list at index 0 is O(n) time. If the cache is large, this could be inefficient. However, given the context, maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, if __order is a deque, popping from the left is O(1). But the context doesn't mention deque. So, assuming __order is a list.

But the user's context shows that the class has __order as an attribute. So, the code should access self.__order.

Also, the __delitem__ method is present, which handles deletion. So, when we do del self[key], it would call __delitem__.

But in the code above, when we do del self[key], it would trigger the __delitem__ method, which might have some logic (like updating the order or size).

Wait, but if __order is a list, and we remove the first element, then the order is maintained. However, when we delete the key from the dictionary, the __delitem__ method might also need to update the order. But in the code above, after deleting the key, we manually pop from __order. That might be redundant. Alternatively, maybe the __delitem__ method is responsible for removing the key from __order. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the __order is maintained in such a way that when a key is deleted, it's removed from the order list. But that's more complex.

But given the context, the user's code may have __order as a list, and the popitem method needs to remove the first element. So, the code would be as I wrote before.

But let me check the context again. The user mentioned that within the class, there's self.__order. So, the code should access that.

Another thing: the __setitem__ method has a parameter cache_setitem, which might be a helper function. But that's probably internal.

So, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
    key = self.__order[0]
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    self.__order.pop(0)
    return (key, value)

But wait, what if the key is not present? Well, since the key is the first inserted, and assuming that the cache is not empty, the key should be present. However, if the cache is empty, we raise an error.

But the docstring doesn't mention raising an error. However, in Python's dict.popitem(), if the dictionary is empty, it raises KeyError. So, the code should do the same.

So, the code above is correct.

But perhaps the __order is a list that's maintained in a way that when items are added, they are appended, and when deleted, they are removed. However, the code for __setitem__ and __delitem__ would need to manage that. But the popitem method is responsible for removing the first inserted item, which is the first element of __order.

Therefore, the code should be as written.
