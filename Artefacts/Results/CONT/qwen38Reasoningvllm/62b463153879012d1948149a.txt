Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the function _group_files_by_xml_filename based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to group files by xmls and return a dictionary. 

First, I should understand what the parameters are. The source is probably the directory or zip file to explore. xmls is a list of XML filenames, and files is a list of file paths. The goal is to group these files by the XMLs.

Looking at the context, there are other functions like explore_source, _explore_folder, _explore_zipfile, and select_filenames_by_prefix. Maybe the function uses these to find files related to each XML.

The docstring mentions grouping files by xmls. So for each XML in xmls, find corresponding files. Maybe each XML has associated files, and we need to map them.

Wait, the function is part of a class, but the code isn't shown. But the parameters are source, xmls, files. So perhaps the function processes the files in the source, grouping them under each XML.

I need to think about how to group. Maybe for each XML in xmls, find all files that match a certain pattern related to that XML. For example, if the XML is "document1.xml", maybe the files are "document1.xml", "document1-biblio.xml", etc. But how to determine that?

Looking at other functions, like select_filenames_by_prefix and match_file_by_prefix. Maybe the function uses a prefix to match files. For example, each XML has a prefix, and files with that prefix are grouped under it.

Wait, the function _eval_file is mentioned. Maybe that's used to evaluate if a file belongs to a particular XML. But without seeing the code, I have to infer.

Alternatively, perhaps the function groups files by their XML filename. For example, if xmls is a list of XML filenames, and files is a list of all files, then group the files so that each XML's files are collected.

But how to determine which files belong to which XML? Maybe each XML has associated files, like the XML itself and other related files. So for each XML in xmls, collect all files that are related to it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to group the files into a dictionary where the keys are the XML filenames, and the values are lists of files associated with each XML. But how to determine the association?

Perhaps the XML files are in the source, and the files are other files that are related. For example, in a ZIP file, each XML might have corresponding files like .biblio, .xref, etc. So the function needs to find all files in the source that are related to each XML in xmls.

But without more context, I need to make assumptions. Let's think about the existing functions. The _explore_folder and _explore_zipfile functions probably collect all files in a source. The select_filenames_by_prefix function selects files with a certain prefix. Maybe the XML filenames have a prefix, and the files are those with the same prefix.

Wait, the function match_file_by_prefix is mentioned. That function probably checks if a file path matches a prefix. So maybe for each XML in xmls, we find all files in the source that match the prefix of that XML.

So the approach would be: for each xml in xmls, determine its prefix (maybe the base name without extension), then collect all files in the source that match that prefix. Then group those files under the xml in the dictionary.

But how to get the prefix from the XML filename? For example, if the XML is "report.xml", the prefix could be "report". Then, files like "report.xml", "report-biblio.xml", etc., would be grouped under "report".

So the steps would be:

1. For each xml in xmls, extract the prefix (e.g., remove .xml extension).
2. Use select_filenames_by_prefix to find all files in the source that match this prefix.
3. Group these files under the original xml name in the dictionary.

Wait, but the function's parameters are source, xmls, and files. So maybe the files are already filtered, and the function groups them by the xmls.

Alternatively, maybe the files are all files in the source, and xmls is a list of XML filenames. The function groups the files such that each XML's files are collected. But how to determine which files belong to which XML?

Another approach: For each file in files, determine which XML it belongs to. Then group the files by XML.

But how to determine that? Maybe the XML filename is part of the file's name. For example, if a file is "data.xml", it belongs to the XML "data.xml". But that's trivial. Maybe the files are related to the XML in some way, like being part of a set.

Alternatively, perhaps the XMLs are the main files, and the files are other files that are associated with them. For example, in a ZIP file, each XML might have a corresponding .biblio file. So the function groups the .biblio files under their corresponding XML.

But again, without more context, it's challenging. Let's look at the existing functions. The _explore_zipfile and _explore_folder functions probably return a list of file paths. The select_filenames_by_prefix function selects files with a given prefix. The match_file_by_prefix function checks if a file matches a prefix.

So perhaps the function _group_files_by_xml_filename is supposed to group the files (from the source) by their XML filenames. For each XML in xmls, find all files in the source that match the prefix of that XML. Then, create a dictionary where each key is the XML filename, and the value is the list of matching files.

So, the code would:

- Initialize an empty dictionary.
- For each xml in xmls:
   - Get the prefix by removing the .xml extension.
   - Use select_filenames_by_prefix to find all files in the source that match this prefix.
   - Add the XML as a key and the list of files as the value.
- Return the dictionary.

But wait, the parameters are source, xmls, files. So maybe the files are already the list of files in the source, and xmls is the list of XML filenames. So the function groups the files into a dictionary where each key is an XML filename, and the value is the list of files that match the prefix of that XML.

So the code would be:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    """
    Groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format.
    """
    grouped = {}
    for xml in xmls:
        prefix = os.path.splitext(xml)[0]
        matched_files = select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files)
        grouped[xml] = matched_files
    return grouped

But wait, the function select_filenames_by_prefix is mentioned in the context. So the code would use that function to get the files matching the prefix.

But what if the source is a zip file? The _explore_zipfile function would have already processed the files. So the files parameter is the list of files in the source.

So the code would loop through each XML in xmls, extract the prefix, then select files from the files list that match that prefix, then group them.

But maybe the files are not all in the source. Wait, the parameters are source, xmls, files. So perhaps the files are already filtered, and the function groups them by the XMLs.

Another possibility: the function is part of a process where the source is explored, and xmls are the XML files found. Then, for each XML, find all files that are related (like those with the same prefix) in the source.

But the code would need to process the source to get the files. However, the parameters include 'files', which suggests that the files are already available.

So the code would use select_filenames_by_prefix for each XML's prefix to get the files.

But how to handle cases where a file matches multiple prefixes? Well, perhaps each file is associated with exactly one XML.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to group all files into the XMLs they belong to. For example, if a file's name starts with the same prefix as an XML, it's grouped under that XML.

But I think the code would look something like the example I wrote earlier. So the code would loop through each XML in xmls, get the prefix, select files with that prefix, and group them.

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct functions. Since select_filenames_by_prefix is mentioned, that's probably the function to use.

So the code would be:

import os
from select_filenames_by_prefix import select_filenames_by_prefix

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    """
    Groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format.
    """
    grouped = {}
    for xml in xmls:
        prefix = os.path.splitext(xml)[0]
        matched_files = select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files)
        grouped[xml] = matched_files
    return grouped

But wait, the parameters are source, xmls, files. The source might be needed to process the files, but if files is already a list of file paths, then maybe the source isn't needed here. However, the function's name suggests that it's grouping files from the source, so perhaps the files are obtained from exploring the source. But the parameters include files, so maybe the function is called after the files have been collected.

In any case, based on the given information, the code would group the files by the XMLs using their prefixes. So the code would look like that.
