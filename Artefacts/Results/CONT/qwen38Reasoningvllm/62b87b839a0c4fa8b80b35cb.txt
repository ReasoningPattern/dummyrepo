Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function _get_err_indices based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it finds all error indexes corresponding to coord_name. 

Looking at the context, the function is part of a class. The class has attributes like coords, dim, field_names, scale, and _parsed_error_names. Also, there's a method _parse_error_names which might be related. 

The function _get_err_indices takes coord_name as an argument. So, probably, it needs to find the indices in some error-related data structure that correspond to the given coordinate name.

Let me think about possible data structures. The coords attribute might be a list or a dictionary of coordinate names. The error indexes could be stored in _parsed_error_names, which is a list. Maybe each entry in _parsed_error_names corresponds to a coordinate, and we need to find the indices where the coordinate name matches coord_name.

Wait, the _parse_error_names method is mentioned. Maybe that method parses the error names and stores them in _parsed_error_names. So, _get_err_indices might be looking through _parsed_error_names to find entries that match coord_name.

Alternatively, maybe the error indexes are stored in a way that each coordinate has associated error indices. For example, if coords is a list of coordinate names, then for each coordinate, there are error indices. So, the function would iterate over the coords and find the index where the name matches coord_name, then return those error indices.

But how are the error indices stored? Perhaps in self._parsed_error_names, which could be a list where each element corresponds to a coordinate's error indices. For example, if coords is ['x', 'y'], then _parsed_error_names might be a list of lists, where each sublist contains the error indices for that coordinate.

So, the function could loop through the coords, check if the name matches coord_name, and collect the corresponding error indices from _parsed_error_names.

Wait, but the function is called _get_err_indices, which suggests it returns the indices. So maybe it's returning the indices of the errors that are associated with the given coordinate name.

Alternatively, perhaps the error indices are stored in a dictionary where the keys are coordinate names, and the values are lists of indices. Then, the function would look up coord_name in that dictionary and return the list.

But looking at the context, there's a method _parse_error_names which is called with field_names. Maybe the error names are parsed into _parsed_error_names, which could be a list of error names. Then, the function needs to find which of those error names correspond to the given coordinate.

Alternatively, maybe the error indices are determined based on the coordinate names. For example, if the coordinate names are in self.coords, and each coordinate has a set of error indices, then the function would find the indices for the given coordinate.

Another angle: the function is part of a class that handles some data structure with coordinates and fields. The _get_err_indices might be used to find the error indices related to a specific coordinate, which could be necessary for processing errors in that coordinate.

Let me think about possible code structure. The function needs to return all error indexes for coord_name. Let's assume that self._parsed_error_names is a list where each element is a list of error indices for each coordinate. For example, if there are two coordinates, then _parsed_error_names could be [[0,1], [2,3]], and coord_name would be one of the coordinate names.

So, the function would iterate over the coordinates, check if the name matches coord_name, and then collect the corresponding error indices.

But how to map the coordinate names to their error indices? Maybe self.coords is a list of coordinate names, and self._parsed_error_names is a list of error indices for each coordinate. So, for each i in range(len(self.coords)), if self.coords[i] == coord_name, then return self._parsed_error_names[i].

Wait, but the function is called _get_err_indices, which might return a list of indices. So, perhaps it's returning the indices from _parsed_error_names where the coordinate name matches.

Alternatively, maybe the error indices are stored in a dictionary, and the function retrieves them based on the coordinate name.

But without more context, I need to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the assumption that self.coords is a list of coordinate names, and self._parsed_error_names is a list where each element corresponds to the error indices for that coordinate. So, for example, if coords is ['x', 'y'], then _parsed_error_names could be [[0, 1], [2, 3]], and the function would return the appropriate sublist when coord_name is 'x' or 'y'.

So the code could be something like:

def _get_err_indices(self, coord_name):
    """
    Find all error indexes corresponding to coord_name.
    """
    for i, name in enumerate(self.coords):
        if name == coord_name:
            return self._parsed_error_names[i]
    return []

But wait, what if there are multiple coordinates with the same name? Or maybe the coords are unique. Assuming that each coordinate name is unique, this code would work.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return all error indices that are associated with the given coordinate name, which could be in a different structure. For example, if the error indices are stored in a dictionary where keys are coordinate names, then it would be:

return self._parsed_error_names.get(coord_name, [])

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, looking at the context, there's a method _parse_error_names which is called with field_names. Maybe the _parsed_error_names is a list of error names, and the function is supposed to find the indices of those error names that correspond to the given coordinate.

Alternatively, perhaps the error indices are determined by the field_names and the coordinate names. For example, each field has errors associated with it, and the function is finding the indices of errors for a particular coordinate.

Another possibility: the function is part of a class that handles error handling for coordinates. The _get_err_indices could be checking for errors in the coordinate's data. For example, if the coordinate has certain error indices stored, and the function returns them.

But given the lack of specific information, I'll proceed with the first approach where coords is a list of coordinate names, and _parsed_error_names is a list of error indices for each coordinate. So the function loops through the coords to find the matching name and returns the corresponding error indices.

So the code would be:

def _get_err_indices(self, coord_name):
    """
    Find all error indexes corresponding to coord_name.
    """
    for i, name in enumerate(self.coords):
        if name == coord_name:
            return self._parsed_error_names[i]
    return []

But maybe the function is supposed to return all error indices for all coordinates that match the given name. However, if the coords are unique, then there would be only one match. Alternatively, if there are multiple coordinates with the same name, it would return all their error indices.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the indices of the errors that are related to the coordinate. For example, if the errors are stored in a list, and each error has a coordinate associated with it, then the function would collect all indices where the coordinate matches coord_name.

But again, without more context, it's challenging. However, given the method names and attributes, the first approach seems plausible.

Another thought: the _parse_error_names method might parse the error names into _parsed_error_names, which could be a list of error names. Then, the _get_err_indices could be finding the indices of those error names that correspond to the given coordinate. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the error indices are stored in a dictionary where the keys are coordinate names, and the values are lists of error indices. So, the function would return self._parsed_error_names.get(coord_name, []).

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. However, given that the function is called _get_err_indices, and the context includes _parsed_error_names, I'll assume that _parsed_error_names is a list where each element corresponds to a coordinate's error indices, and coords is a list of coordinate names. Therefore, the function would find the index in coords that matches coord_name and return the corresponding error indices from _parsed_error_names.

So the code would be as follows.
