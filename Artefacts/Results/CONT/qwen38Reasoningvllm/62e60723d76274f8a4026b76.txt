Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the from_ticks method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The function is part of a class, probably a Time class, and it's called from_ticks. The parameters are ticks (an integer representing nanoseconds since midnight) and an optional timezone (tz). The return type is Time, and it should raise a ValueError if ticks are out of bounds (0 <= ticks < 86400000000000).

First, I need to validate the ticks. The ticks must be between 0 and 86400000000000 (which is 24*60*60*1e9 = 86400000000000). So I'll check if ticks is less than 0 or greater than or equal to that maximum value. If so, raise ValueError.

Next, I need to convert the ticks into a time object. Since the ticks are nanoseconds since midnight, I can calculate the hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds. Let's think about how to break down the ticks.

There are 86400000000000 nanoseconds in a day. So, to get the hours, I can divide ticks by the number of nanoseconds in an hour. Wait, let's compute:

- 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds = 3600 * 1e9 = 3600000000000 nanoseconds.
- So, ticks divided by 3600000000000 gives the hours, but since it's nanoseconds, maybe better to compute step by step.

Alternatively, compute total seconds first. Let's see:

ticks is in nanoseconds. So total_seconds = ticks / 1e9. But since ticks can be up to 86400000000000, that's 86400 seconds, which is 24 hours.

So, total_seconds = ticks // 1e9, and nanoseconds = ticks % 1e9.

Wait, but in Python, dividing integers with // and % can be tricky with negative numbers, but since ticks is validated to be non-negative, that's okay.

So:

seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000
nanoseconds = ticks % 1_000_000_000

Then, break down seconds into hours, minutes, seconds.

hours = seconds // 3600
remaining_seconds = seconds % 3600
minutes = remaining_seconds // 60
seconds = remaining_seconds % 60

So, we have hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds.

But wait, the ticks are since midnight, so the date part is not considered here. The Time class probably represents a time of day, not a date. So the from_ticks method would create a Time object with the time components derived from the ticks, and the timezone if provided.

But how does the Time class handle timezone? The tz parameter is a datetime.tzinfo object. So, perhaps the Time object has a tzinfo attribute, and when creating it, we need to set that.

But the __new__ method of the class is mentioned in the context. The __new__ method is called with parameters like hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo. So, perhaps the from_ticks method needs to create an instance using __new__ with these parameters.

So, the steps would be:

1. Validate ticks.
2. Compute hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds.
3. Create a new Time instance using __new__ with these values and the tzinfo.

But wait, the __new__ method in the context is defined as:

self.__new__(cls,hour,minute,second,nanosecond,tzinfo)

So, the parameters are hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo.

So, after calculating hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, we can pass them to __new__.

But wait, the __new__ method might also need to handle the timezone. However, the tz parameter is optional. So, if tz is provided, it's passed as the tzinfo argument. Otherwise, maybe it's None.

But the Time class might have a default timezone, or it might require the tzinfo to be set. The docstring says that tz is optional, so the method should handle that.

So, putting it all together:

In the from_ticks method:

- Check if ticks is within the valid range. If not, raise ValueError.
- Compute seconds and nanoseconds.
- Compute hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds.
- Then, call the __new__ method of the class with these values and the tzinfo.

Wait, but the __new__ method's parameters are (cls, hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo). So, the parameters are in that order.

So, the code would be something like:

def from_ticks(cls, ticks, tz=None):
    if ticks < 0 or ticks >= 86400000000000:
        raise ValueError("ticks out of bounds")
    seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000
    nanoseconds = ticks % 1_000_000_000
    hours = seconds // 3600
    remaining_seconds = seconds % 3600
    minutes = remaining_seconds // 60
    seconds = remaining_seconds % 60
    return cls.__new__(cls, hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, tz)

But wait, the __new__ method might have other parameters. Also, the context shows that there's a __new__ method that takes hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo. So that's correct.

But need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. Also, the tz parameter is passed as the tzinfo argument.

But what about the case where the tz is None? The __new__ method might expect a tzinfo, but if it's None, perhaps it's allowed. The docstring says that tz is optional, so the method should handle that.

But also, the Time class might have a default timezone, but the method allows passing tz.

Another thing to consider: the ticks are nanoseconds since midnight, so the calculation of hours, minutes, etc., is correct.

But wait, what if the ticks are exactly 86400000000000? The condition is ticks < 86400000000000, so that's invalid. So the check is if ticks >= 86400000000000, raise error.

Now, the code for the method.

But also, the context mentions that the class has a __new__ method that takes hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo. So, the code should call that.

So, the code would be:

def from_ticks(cls, ticks, tz=None):
    """
    Create a time from ticks (nanoseconds since midnight).

    :param ticks: nanoseconds since midnight
    :type ticks: int
    :param tz: optional timezone
    :type tz: datetime.tzinfo

    :rtype: Time

    :raises ValueError: if ticks is out of bounds
        (0 <= ticks < 86400000000000)
    """
    if ticks < 0 or ticks >= 86400000000000:
        raise ValueError("ticks out of bounds")
    seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000
    nanoseconds = ticks % 1_000_000_000
    hours = seconds // 3600
    remaining_seconds = seconds % 3600
    minutes = remaining_seconds // 60
    seconds = remaining_seconds % 60
    return cls.__new__(cls, hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, tz)

Wait, but the __new__ method's parameters are (cls, hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo). So the code is correct.

But what about the case where the nanoseconds is zero? Well, the code handles that.

But also, the __new__ method might have other logic, like normalizing the values. For example, if the nanoseconds is >= 1e9, but since we mod by 1e9, it's already in the range 0-999,999,999.

So, this code should work.

Now, check if the code uses the correct imports. The context says that datetime is imported, so using datetime.tzinfo is okay.

But the method is part of a class, so the 'cls' is the class itself.

So, the code should be as written above.
