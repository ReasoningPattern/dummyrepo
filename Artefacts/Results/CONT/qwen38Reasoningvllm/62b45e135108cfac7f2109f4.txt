Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_valid, takes a self and identifier as parameters. The docstring says to return True if the identifier is valid, and in the base implementation, always return True. 

Wait, the user mentioned not to include any explanations or markdown, just the code in python markdown format. So I need to make sure I only output the code.

The original code has the function defined with a docstring. The base implementation returns True. So the code should be straightforward. Let me check the context. The imported packages, within file, and within class are mentioned, but there's no specific info. So maybe the function is part of a class, hence the 'self' parameter.

So the code would be:

def is_valid(self, identifier):
    """
    Return True if identifier is valid. In this base implementation, always return True.  (D)
    """
    return True

Wait, but the user provided the function signature and docstring, so maybe they want the code to include that. The original code snippet shows the function with the docstring, and the user's example shows the same. So the generated code should have the docstring as given and the return statement.

I need to make sure that the code is correctly formatted. Also, the user said to output only the code, no explanations. So just the function definition with the docstring and the return statement. Alright, that's it.
