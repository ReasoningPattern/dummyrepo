Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_repo_archive based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function needs to do.

The function's purpose is to download a .tar.gz archive from a given URL and extract it to a specified destination path. Then, it should return the path where the archive was extracted. The docstring mentions that the archive contains 'desc' files for each package, but maybe that's just context and not directly relevant to the code.

First, I need to handle downloading the file. The user mentioned using the requests package, so I'll use that. I'll send a GET request to the provided URL. Then, check if the response is successful. If not, maybe raise an exception or handle the error. But the function's return type is Path, so perhaps it's expected to handle errors gracefully, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe just proceed assuming the URL is valid.

Once the file is downloaded, I need to save it to a temporary location. Wait, but the destination_path is where the archive should be extracted. Wait, maybe the function downloads the archive to the destination_path and then extracts it there? Or maybe the archive is downloaded to a temporary file first, then extracted to destination_path?

The function's docstring says the destination_path is where to extract the archive. So perhaps the steps are: download the .tar.gz file, save it to a temporary file, then extract it into destination_path. But maybe the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted, so the archive itself is downloaded to that directory first?

Alternatively, maybe the function downloads the archive to the destination_path, then extracts it there. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, download to a temporary file, then extract to destination_path.

But the function's return value is the destination_path. So perhaps the extraction is done into that path, and the function returns that path.

So steps:

1. Download the .tar.gz from the URL using requests.
2. Save the downloaded content to a temporary file (maybe in the destination_path directory? Or a temporary location?).
3. Extract the .tar.gz archive into the destination_path.
4. Return the destination_path.

But how to handle the extraction? Python's standard library has tarfile module for handling tar archives. So I can use that.

So code outline:

- Use requests.get(url) to download the content.
- Check response status code. If not 200, maybe raise an exception.
- Then, create a temporary file (maybe in the destination_path directory?), but perhaps the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted. Wait, the destination_path is the path where to extract the archive. So perhaps the archive is first saved to a temporary file, then extracted into destination_path.

But maybe the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted. So the steps would be:

- Download the .tar.gz file to a temporary location (like a temporary file in the destination_path directory? Or a separate location?).
- Then extract the tar.gz into destination_path.

Alternatively, maybe the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted, so the archive is first saved to that directory, then extracted. But that would leave the .tar.gz file in the destination_path. Alternatively, maybe the archive is downloaded to a temporary file, then extracted into destination_path, and then the temporary file is deleted.

But the problem statement doesn't mention cleaning up, so perhaps it's acceptable to leave the .tar.gz file in the destination_path.

But let's think about the code.

First, download the file. Let's say we save it as a temporary file. For example, using a context manager to write the content to a file.

But perhaps the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted. So the code would:

- Download the .tar.gz file to a temporary file (maybe in the same directory as destination_path? Or in a temporary directory?).

Wait, maybe the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted. So the steps are:

1. Download the .tar.gz file from the URL.
2. Save it to a temporary file (maybe in the destination_path directory? Or a temporary location?).
3. Extract the tar.gz into the destination_path.
4. Return destination_path.

But how to handle the temporary file? Let's say we save the downloaded content to a temporary file in the destination_path directory. For example, create a temporary file in destination_path, then extract the tar.gz into that directory.

Alternatively, maybe the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted, so the code would:

- Download the .tar.gz to a temporary file (like a file named 'archive.tar.gz' in the destination_path directory).
- Then extract that file into the destination_path.

But perhaps the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted, so the code would first download the archive, then extract it into that directory.

So code steps:

- Use requests to get the content.
- Check if the response is successful.
- Write the content to a temporary file (maybe in the destination_path directory? Or a temporary directory?).
- Then use tarfile to open the .tar.gz file and extract its contents into destination_path.

But how to handle the file path. For example, if the destination_path is a directory, then the code can create a temporary file in that directory, then extract the archive into that directory.

But perhaps the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted. So the code would:

- Download the .tar.gz file to a temporary location (maybe a temporary file in the same directory as destination_path? Or in a temporary directory?).
- Then extract the archive into destination_path.

But maybe the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted. So the code can first download the .tar.gz file to a temporary file, then extract it into destination_path.

But how to handle the temporary file? Let's say we save the downloaded content to a temporary file, then extract it.

So code steps:

import requests
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    # Download the file
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad status codes

    # Create a temporary file in the destination path
    # Maybe the archive is saved as 'archive.tar.gz' in the destination_path
    archive_path = destination_path / 'archive.tar.gz'
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)

    # Extract the archive
    with tarfile.open(archive_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)

    # Return the destination path
    return destination_path

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the path where the archive is extracted to. So if the extraction is done into destination_path, then return that path.

But what if the destination_path doesn't exist? The function may need to create it. So perhaps the code should ensure that the destination_path exists. So adding:

destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

But the function's parameters say that destination_path is the path where to extract. So maybe it's the user's responsibility to ensure that the directory exists. But perhaps the function should create it if it doesn't exist. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe it's better to assume that the destination_path exists. But to be safe, perhaps the code should create it.

So modifying the code:

destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

Then proceed.

But the code as written would save the archive as 'archive.tar.gz' in the destination_path directory, then extract it into that same directory. So the extraction would extract the contents of the .tar.gz into the destination_path.

But perhaps the .tar.gz file is supposed to be extracted into the destination_path. So the code is correct.

But what if the URL is not a .tar.gz? Well, the function's docstring says that the URL is for a .tar.gz archive, so perhaps we can assume that.

But the code should handle the case where the URL is not a .tar.gz. However, the problem statement says that the function is given a .tar.gz archive, so maybe we don't need to handle that.

So putting it all together, the code would:

- Ensure the destination_path exists.
- Download the file to archive_path (destination_path / 'archive.tar.gz').
- Extract the archive into destination_path.

But perhaps the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted, so the code should extract the archive into that directory.

But the code as written does that.

So the code would be:

import requests
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    """
    Given an url and a destination path, retrieve and extract .tar.gz archive which contains 'desc' file for each package

    Args:
        url: url of the .tar.gz archive to download
        destination_path: the path on disk where to extract archive
    Returns:
        path where the archive is extracted to
    """
    destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    archive_path = destination_path / 'archive.tar.gz'
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    with tarfile.open(archive_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    return destination_path

But wait, the function's return is the destination_path. So that's correct.

But what if the archive is not a .tar.gz? Well, the function's docstring says it's a .tar.gz, so the code uses 'r:gz' mode for tarfile.open.

But the code may need to handle cases where the archive is not properly formed, but the problem statement doesn't mention error handling beyond that.

So this code should fulfill the requirements.

Now, check if all the necessary imports are present. The user mentioned that the imported packages include requests, so the code uses that. Also, Path is from pathlib.

So the code should be correct.
