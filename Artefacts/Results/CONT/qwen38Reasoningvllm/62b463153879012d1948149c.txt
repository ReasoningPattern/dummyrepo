Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function select_filenames_by_prefix based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it should return all files in the files list that match the given prefix. 

So the function takes a prefix and a list of files. The files are probably file paths, maybe from a directory or a zip file. The task is to check each file's name (or path) to see if it starts with the given prefix. 

Wait, the context mentions other functions like match_file_by_prefix and _eval_file. Maybe the files are paths, and the prefix is a string that the file path should start with. So the function needs to iterate over each file in the files list and check if it starts with the prefix.

But how exactly to check? The prefix could be a string, so for each file in files, we can use the startswith method. But maybe the prefix is case-sensitive? The problem doesn't specify, but I'll assume it's case-sensitive unless told otherwise.

So the code would be something like: return [file for file in files if file.startswith(prefix)]. But wait, the function is called select_filenames_by_prefix, so maybe it's supposed to return the matching filenames. But the files parameter is a list of file paths. So the code is straightforward.

Wait, but the context includes other functions like _explore_folder and _explore_zipfile. Maybe the files list contains paths that are either in a folder or a zipfile. But the function select_filenames_by_prefix is supposed to filter the files list based on the prefix. So regardless of where the files come from, the function just checks the prefix against each file's path.

So the code would be a list comprehension that filters the files list. Let me make sure there's no other logic. The docstring says "return all files that match the given prefix". So the function is simple.

But maybe the prefix is a directory prefix, and the files are full paths. For example, if the prefix is 'data/', then files that start with 'data/' would be selected. So the startswith method is correct here.

So the code would be:

def select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files):
    """
    For each file in files, return all files that match the given prefix
    """
    return [file for file in files if file.startswith(prefix)]

Wait, but the user mentioned that the function is part of a larger codebase with other functions like match_file_by_prefix and _eval_file. Maybe there's some existing logic there that this function relies on. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, so I shouldn't include any other logic unless specified.

So the code should just filter the files list using the startswith method. That's the simplest implementation. I think that's what's expected here. Let me make sure there's no edge cases. For example, if the prefix is empty, but the docstring doesn't mention that. The function should return all files if the prefix is empty, but that's up to the implementation. Since the docstring says "match the given prefix", the startswith is correct.

So the final code is as above.
