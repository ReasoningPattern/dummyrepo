Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function try_retrieve_webfinger_document based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to retrieve a webfinger document as per RFC7033. The docstring says it doesn't raise exceptions if it fails, so I need to handle errors silently.

The imported packages include requests, which is likely used for making HTTP requests. Also, there are other functions like fetch_document mentioned in the context. Maybe the function uses fetch_document internally.

Looking at the parameters: handle is a string, and the return is an optional string. So the function should return the document content if successful, else None.

Steps to take:
1. Construct the webfinger URL. The standard URL for webfinger is https://<handle>/.well-known/webfinger. So for a handle like 'user@example.com', the URL would be 'https://user@example.com/.well-known/webfinger'.

Wait, but sometimes the handle might not include the domain. For example, if the handle is 'user', maybe the function needs to determine the domain. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that. Maybe the handle is already a valid email-like string, so we can directly use it.

So the URL would be f"https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger".

But wait, the handle might not be a valid domain. For example, if the handle is 'alice', then the URL would be 'https://alice/.well-known/webfinger', which might not be correct. However, the function's responsibility is to try retrieving it, so perhaps it's up to the caller to ensure the handle is correct. The function just tries to fetch it.

Next, using the requests library to make a GET request. The function should handle possible errors like network issues, invalid URLs, etc., without raising exceptions. So I need to use try-except blocks.

Also, the context mentions functions like fetch_document, which might be a helper function. But since the user hasn't provided its implementation, I'll have to assume that the function uses requests directly.

So, the code outline would be:

- Construct the URL.
- Use requests.get with appropriate parameters.
- Handle exceptions (like connection errors, timeouts, etc.) by catching them and returning None.
- Check the response status code. If it's 200 OK, return the content. Else, return None.

But wait, the function might need to set a User-Agent header, as mentioned in the context (USER_AGENT is within the file). So the code should include that in the headers.

Also, the context mentions a function called fetch_document, which is used in the try_retrieve_webfinger_document. So perhaps the code calls fetch_document with the constructed URL and other parameters.

Looking at the context, the function fetch_document is defined with parameters (url, host, path, timeout, raise_ssl_errors, extra_headers). Wait, but the URL for webfinger is constructed as https://handle/.well-known/webfinger. So the host would be the handle's domain part. Wait, but how to split the handle into host and path?

Alternatively, maybe the handle is treated as the host. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the host is 'example.com', and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'. But how to parse the handle into host and path?

This complicates things. The function might need to parse the handle into a domain and user part. However, the problem statement doesn't specify that. The user's handle could be a simple string, and the function is supposed to construct the URL as https://handle/.well-known/webfinger.

But perhaps the handle is expected to be a valid email address, so splitting into user and domain. For example, handle 'user@example.com' would have host 'example.com' and path '/.well-known/webfinger'.

But how to split the handle into user and domain? Using the 're' module as mentioned in the imported packages. Maybe using a regex to split on '@'.

So, the code would first check if the handle contains '@'. If it does, split into user and domain. Otherwise, treat the entire handle as the domain.

Wait, but the webfinger URL is supposed to be for a specific handle. The standard is that the handle is the subject of the webfinger, which can be an email address or a URI. For example, the handle could be 'https://example.com/user' or 'user@example.com'.

So, the URL for webfinger is constructed as https://<subject>/ .well-known/webfinger. But the subject can be a URI or an email. So if the handle is an email, the URL would be https://user@example.com/.well-known/webfinger. However, that's not a valid URL because the domain part is 'user@example.com', which isn't a valid domain. So perhaps the handle is expected to be a domain, and the user part is part of the URL.

Wait, maybe the handle is the subject, and the URL is constructed as https://<subject>/ .well-known/webfinger. But that would require that the subject is a valid domain. For example, if the handle is 'example.com', then the URL is 'https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger'.

But if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the URL would be 'https://user@example.com/.well-known/webfinger', which is not a valid URL. So perhaps the function is intended to take a domain, not an email address. Or maybe the handle is the full URL, like 'https://example.com/user'.

This is a bit ambiguous. However, given the context, perhaps the function is supposed to construct the URL as 'https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger', assuming that the handle is a valid domain. But that might not be correct. However, since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with that approach.

So, the code would construct the URL as f"https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger".

Then, using the fetch_document function, which is mentioned in the context. The parameters for fetch_document are (url, host, path, timeout, raise_ssl_errors, extra_headers). Wait, but the URL is already constructed as 'https://handle/.well-known/webfinger'. So the host would be the domain part of the handle, and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'.

But how to extract the host from the handle? For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', the host is 'example.com'. If the handle is 'example.com', the host is 'example.com'. If the handle is 'https://example.com/user', then the host is 'example.com' and the path is '/user/.well-known/webfinger'? Or maybe the handle is supposed to be the subject, and the URL is constructed as 'https://<subject>/ .well-known/webfinger'.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the function is supposed to use the handle as the host part. For example, if the handle is 'example.com', then the URL is 'https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger'. If the handle is 'user@example.com', then the URL is 'https://user@example.com/.well-known/webfinger', which is not a valid URL. But perhaps the function is designed to handle that, even though it's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the handle is supposed to be a domain, and the function is supposed to construct the URL as 'https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger'.

Given the ambiguity, but based on the context that the function uses fetch_document, which requires host and path parameters, perhaps the code should split the handle into host and path. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the handle is the full URL, and the function uses the host part. For example, if the handle is 'https://example.com/user', then the host is 'example.com', and the path is '/user/.well-known/webfinger'.

But without more information, it's hard to say. However, given that the function is called try_retrieve_webfinger_document and the context includes fetch_document, which is used in the same file, perhaps the code calls fetch_document with the URL, host, and path.

Wait, looking at the context, the function try_retrieve_webfinger_document is listed as using fetch_document. So perhaps the code is:

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    url = f"https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger"
    # Assuming fetch_document is a helper function that handles the request
    # and returns the content or None on failure
    return fetch_document(url, handle, "/.well-known/webfinger", timeout=10, raise_ssl_errors=False, extra_headers={"User-Agent": USER_AGENT})

But I need to check the parameters of fetch_document. The context says fetch_document has parameters (url, host, path, timeout, raise_ssl_errors, extra_headers). So the URL is constructed as 'https://handle/.well-known/webfinger', but the host is the domain part of the handle. Wait, but if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the host would be 'example.com', and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'.

But how to split the handle into host and path? For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the host is 'example.com', and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'. But the URL would be 'https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger'.

Alternatively, maybe the handle is the full URL, and the host is extracted from it. But again, without more context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the handle is treated as the host, and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'. So the URL is 'https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger'.

But then, the fetch_document function's parameters would need the host and path. So the code would call fetch_document with the URL, but maybe the host is the handle, and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'.

But this is unclear. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should use the handle as the host, and construct the URL as 'https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger', and pass the host and path to fetch_document.

Alternatively, maybe the handle is the subject, and the URL is constructed as 'https://{subject}/.well-known/webfinger', and the host is the subject's domain part.

But again, without knowing how to parse the handle into host and path, it's difficult. Given that the user hasn't provided the implementation of fetch_document, perhaps the code should call fetch_document with the URL, host, and path, assuming that the handle is the host.

Alternatively, maybe the function constructs the URL as 'https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger', and then calls fetch_document with the URL, but that would require that fetch_document can handle the URL directly. However, the parameters of fetch_document include host and path, which suggests that the URL is split into those components.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the function should use the handle as the host, and the path as '/.well-known/webfinger', and the URL is 'https://{host}{path}'.

So, the code would:

- Split the handle into host and path if necessary. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the handle is the full URL, and the host is extracted from it. For example, if the handle is 'https://example.com/user', then the host is 'example.com', and the path is '/user/.well-known/webfinger'.

But again, without knowing how to parse the handle, it's hard to proceed. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the handle is a domain, and the URL is 'https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger', and call fetch_document with the host as the handle and the path as '/.well-known/webfinger'.

So the code would look like:

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    url = f"https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger"
    try:
        return fetch_document(url, handle, "/.well-known/webfinger", timeout=10, raise_ssl_errors=False, extra_headers={"User-Agent": USER_AGENT})
    except Exception:
        return None

But I need to make sure that the parameters match. The fetch_document function's parameters are (url, host, path, timeout, raise_ssl_errors, extra_headers). So the code passes the URL, host (handle), path, etc.

However, if the URL is already constructed as 'https://{handle}/.well-known/webfinger', then passing the host as handle and path as '/.well-known/webfinger' would be redundant. But perhaps the fetch_document function is designed to take the URL, host, and path separately for some reason.

Alternatively, maybe the URL is constructed as 'https://{host}{path}', so the code splits the handle into host and path. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the host is 'example.com', and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'. But how to split the handle into host and path?

This requires parsing the handle. For example, using the 're' module to split on '@' and then extract the domain part.

So, code to split handle into host and path:

import re

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    # Split handle into user and domain if it contains '@'
    if '@' in handle:
        user, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        host = domain
        path = '/.well-known/webfinger'
    else:
        host = handle
        path = '/.well-known/webfinger'
    
    url = f"https://{host}{path}"
    try:
        return fetch_document(url, host, path, timeout=10, raise_ssl_errors=False, extra_headers={"User-Agent": USER_AGENT})
    except Exception:
        return None

But this assumes that the handle can be split into user and domain. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', the host becomes 'example.com', and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'. The URL would be 'https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger'.

This seems more accurate, as the webfinger URL is for the domain part of the handle. So the code splits the handle into user and domain, uses the domain as the host, and constructs the URL accordingly.

But what if the handle doesn't contain '@'? Then the host is the handle itself, and the path is '/.well-known/webfinger'.

This seems reasonable. So the code would split the handle into host and path, then call fetch_document with the constructed URL, host, and path.

But the fetch_document function's parameters are (url, host, path, ...). So passing the URL, host, and path. However, the URL is already constructed as 'https://{host}{path}', so passing the URL and host/path separately might be redundant. But perhaps the fetch_document function uses the host and path for some internal logic, like DNS resolution or handling different schemes.

In any case, the code would need to construct the URL, and call fetch_document with the appropriate parameters.

Also, the function should handle exceptions, so wrapping the call in a try-except block to catch any exceptions and return None.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of logging, so maybe adding a log message if the request fails. But the docstring says it doesn't raise, so logging might be part of the error handling.

But since the user hasn't provided the implementation of fetch_document, I'll proceed with the code that calls fetch_document with the constructed URL, host, and path.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import re
from typing import Optional

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    if '@' in handle:
        user, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        host = domain
        path = '/.well-known/webfinger'
    else:
        host = handle
        path = '/.well-known/webfinger'
    
    url = f"https://{host}{path}"
    try:
        return fetch_document(url, host, path, timeout=10, raise_ssl_errors=False, extra_headers={"User-Agent": USER_AGENT})
    except Exception:
        return None

But wait, the function is supposed to return the document content. The fetch_document function is expected to return the content or None on failure. So the code returns the result of fetch_document.

But the user hasn't provided the implementation of fetch_document, so I'm assuming that it returns the content as a string or None.

Also, the context mentions that the function uses the logger, so maybe adding a log message if the request fails. But the docstring says it doesn't raise, so perhaps logging is done internally.

In conclusion, the generated code would split the handle into host and path, construct the URL, call fetch_document with the parameters, and return the result or None on failure.
