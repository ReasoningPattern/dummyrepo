Okay, I need to create a Python function called is_local that checks if a given host is considered localhost. The docstring says that localhost includes the local IP, username, local domain name, 'localhost', and '127.0.0.1'. So the function should return True if the host matches any of these.

First, I should consider how to get the local hostname and IP. The socket module is imported, so I can use socket functions. Let me think: socket.gethostname() gives the local hostname. Then, maybe I need to get the local IP address. But wait, the local IP could vary depending on the network interfaces. However, the problem says that the localhost includes the local IP, so perhaps I should check if the given host is equal to the local hostname or the local IP.

Wait, but how do I get the local IP? Maybe using socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())? That would get the IP address associated with the local hostname. But that might not be reliable if there are multiple IPs. However, the problem says "local IP", so maybe that's sufficient.

Also, the function needs to check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. So the steps could be:

1. Check if the host is exactly 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. If yes, return True.
2. Otherwise, get the local hostname and compare. But wait, the local hostname might be something like 'my-computer' and the host could be that. So if the host is equal to the local hostname, return True.
3. Also, check if the host is equal to the local IP address. So get the local IP using socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) and compare.

Wait, but what about the local domain name? The docstring mentions that the localhost includes the local domain name. So maybe the local hostname could be part of a domain, like 'myhost.example.com'. But how to check if the given host is the local domain name? Maybe the local hostname is the same as the host, or the host is part of the local domain. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should check if the host is in the list of local hosts. But how to determine that. Maybe the approach is to check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or matches the local hostname. But what about the local domain name? For example, if the local domain is 'example.com', then the local hostname might be 'myhost', and the host could be 'myhost.example.com'. But how to check that?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified. The docstring says that the localhost includes the local IP, username, local domain name, 'localhost', and '127.0.0.1'. Wait, username? That doesn't make sense. Maybe that's a typo. Perhaps it's the local hostname, not username. Assuming that, perhaps the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or matches the local hostname.

But how to get the local hostname. Let me think. Using socket.gethostname() gives the local hostname. For example, if the machine's hostname is 'myhost', then socket.gethostname() returns 'myhost'. So if the given host is 'myhost', then it's considered local.

So the function could do:

- Check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' → return True.
- Else, get the local hostname and check if host equals that.
- Also, get the local IP address (using socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())) and check if host equals that.

Wait, but what if the host is the local domain name? Like, if the local hostname is 'myhost' and the domain is 'example.com', then the local domain name would be 'example.com'. But how to check if the host is the local domain name. Maybe the function should check if the host is the same as the local domain name. But how to get that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the local hostname is considered as part of the localhost. So the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or matches the local hostname.

But then, what about the local domain name? For example, if the local hostname is 'myhost' and the domain is 'example.com', then the full hostname is 'myhost.example.com'. But how to check if the given host is the local domain name. Maybe the function should check if the host is the same as the local domain name. But how to get that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified and the local domain name is not required to be checked. Perhaps the original docstring has a mistake, and the intended check is for the local hostname, local IP, 'localhost', and '127.0.0.1'.

So, the function would:

- Check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' → return True.
- Else, get the local hostname and check if host equals that.
- Also, get the local IP address and check if host equals that.

But wait, the local IP could be different from the local hostname. For example, if the machine has multiple IPs, but the local hostname is resolved to one of them. However, the problem says that the localhost includes the local IP. So perhaps the function should check if the host is equal to the local IP.

But how to get the local IP. Using socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) gives the IP address associated with the local hostname. But that might not be the same as the local IP if there are multiple interfaces. However, for the purpose of this function, perhaps that's sufficient.

So the code would be:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    """
    Checks if the host is the localhost,
    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Args:
        host: The hostname or ip

    Returns:
        True if the host is the localhost else False
    """
    if host in ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']:
        return True
    try:
        local_hostname = socket.gethostname()
        if host == local_hostname:
            return True
        local_ip = socket.gethostbyname(local_hostname)
        if host == local_ip:
            return True
    except:
        pass
    return False

Wait, but what about the local domain name? The docstring mentions that. How to check that. For example, if the local domain is 'example.com', then the local hostname might be 'myhost', and the domain name is 'example.com'. So if the host is 'example.com', should that return True? But how to get the local domain name.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the local domain name is part of the hostname. For example, if the hostname is 'myhost.example.com', then checking if the host is 'myhost.example.com' would return True. But how to get that.

But the problem says that the localhost includes the local domain name. So perhaps the function should check if the host is equal to the local domain name. But how to get that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using 'local domain name' to refer to the local hostname. Maybe the original docstring has a mistake. Given that, perhaps the function should check for the local hostname, local IP, 'localhost', and '127.0.0.1'.

So the code above would handle that. But what about the case where the host is the local domain name. For example, if the local domain is 'example.com', and the host is 'example.com', should that return True? The docstring says that the localhost includes the local domain name. So perhaps the function should check if the host is the local domain name.

But how to get the local domain name. Maybe using socket.gethostbyaddr() or something else. But that might be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the local domain name is the same as the local hostname. So the code above would cover that.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should check for 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', the local hostname, and the local IP. So the code I wrote earlier would do that.

Another thing: the function should return True if the host is any of those. So the code checks if host is in the list, then checks if it's equal to the local hostname or local IP.

But what about case sensitivity? For example, if the host is 'LOCALHOST', but the function checks for 'localhost' exactly. So the function should compare case-insensitively? The docstring doesn't specify, but perhaps it's better to compare case-insensitively. However, the problem says that the host is given as a hostname or IP. Hostnames are case-insensitive in some contexts, but IP addresses are case-insensitive. So perhaps the function should compare case-insensitively for the hostnames.

But the problem says that the host is passed as a parameter. For example, if the host is 'localhost' or 'Localhost', should it return True? The docstring says that the localhost includes 'localhost', so perhaps the function should check case-insensitively. However, the code as written would not do that. So perhaps the code should convert the host to lowercase before comparing.

But the problem says that the host is the hostname or ip. For example, '127.0.0.1' is case-insensitive, but hostnames are case-insensitive in some systems. So maybe the function should compare in a case-insensitive way.

But the original code as written would not do that. So perhaps the code should be adjusted to handle case-insensitivity.

But the problem's docstring says that the localhost includes 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1'. So perhaps the function should check if the host is exactly 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', but that's not the case. For example, if the host is 'LOCALHOST', it's not considered. But maybe the function should be case-insensitive.

This is getting complicated. However, the original code as written would not handle case-insensitivity. But perhaps the problem expects that the host is passed as a string that matches exactly. For example, the function is supposed to check if the host is one of the specified values, regardless of case. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code should check exactly as given.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the host is compared in a case-insensitive way. For example, checking if host.lower() is in the list.

But given that, perhaps the code should be modified to handle that.

But the problem's docstring says that the host includes 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1', so perhaps the code should check if host is exactly those strings. However, in practice, hostnames are case-insensitive. For example, 'localhost' and 'LOCALHOST' are considered the same. But the code as written would return False for 'LOCALHOST'.

But the problem's docstring may not require that. So perhaps the code should check exactly as given.

In any case, the code I wrote earlier would handle the cases of 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1' exactly. Then, check if the host is the local hostname or local IP.

But what about the local domain name? The docstring mentions that. How to handle that. For example, if the local domain is 'example.com', then the host 'example.com' should return True. But how to get that.

Maybe the local domain name can be obtained via socket.gethostbyname_ex(socket.gethostname())[2], which gives the list of aliases and the domain. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's mention of local domain name is a mistake, and it's supposed to be the local hostname. Given that, perhaps the code as written is sufficient.

So, the final code would be:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    """
    Checks if the host is the localhost,
    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Args:
        host: The hostname or ip

    Returns:
        True if the host is the localhost else False
    """
    if host in ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']:
        return True
    try:
        local_hostname = socket.gethostname()
        if host == local_hostname:
            return True
        local_ip = socket.gethostbyname(local_hostname)
        if host == local_ip:
            return True
    except:
        pass
    return False

But wait, what about the username? The docstring says that the localhost includes the username. That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo for 'local hostname' or 'local domain name'. So perhaps the code is correct as written.

Another thing: the function may raise exceptions, like if socket.gethostname() fails. So the code uses a try-except block to catch any exceptions and return False in that case.

So this should handle most cases. The function returns True if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', the local hostname, or the local IP. Otherwise, returns False.
