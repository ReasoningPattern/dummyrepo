Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called gaussian that calculates a Gaussian centered at u=0.2 with sigma=0.1. The function signature is given, and the docstring is provided. They also mentioned to use numpy as np.

First, I need to recall the formula for a Gaussian function. The standard Gaussian is (1/(sigma*sqrt(2π))) * e^(-(x-u)^2/(2σ²)). So here, u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1. 

Wait, the function is supposed to be centered at u=0.2. So the mean of the Gaussian is 0.2. The sigma is 0.1, which is the standard deviation. So the formula should use those values.

So the function will take x as input, which I assume is a numpy array, and return the computed Gaussian values.

I need to make sure to import numpy as np. But the user said that the imported packages are numpy as np, so I don't need to include the import statement in the code. The code should just use np.

So putting it all together, the function will compute the exponent part first: -(x - 0.2)**2 divided by (2*(0.1)**2). Then multiply by the normalization factor 1/(0.1 * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)).

Wait, the normalization factor is 1/(sigma * sqrt(2π)), right? So with sigma being 0.1, that's 1/(0.1 * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)).

So the code inside the function would be:

return (1/(0.1 * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))) * np.exp( - (x - 0.2)**2 / (2 * (0.1)**2) )

But I should check if the exponent is correctly calculated. Let me double-check the formula. The exponent is -(x - u)^2/(2σ²). Yes. So with u=0.2 and σ=0.1, that's correct.

So the code should be:

def gaussian(x):
    """
    Calculate Gaussian centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1.
    """
    return (1/(0.1 * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))) * np.exp( - (x - 0.2)**2 / (2 * (0.1)**2) )

Wait, but maybe the user wants the function to handle arrays, but since numpy's exp and operations handle arrays, this should work.

I think that's all. The code should be straightforward. Let me make sure there are no typos. The docstring is there, and the function uses np correctly. Yes.
