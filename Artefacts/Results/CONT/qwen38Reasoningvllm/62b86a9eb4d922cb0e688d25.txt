Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function _get_resource_name_regex based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it returns the regular expressions used to validate the name of Krake resources. From the context, there are variables like _resource_name_pattern and _resource_name_regex mentioned. Also, there's a function _validate_resource_name which probably uses a regex.

So, the function _get_resource_name_regex should return a regex pattern. Looking at the context, maybe the pattern is already defined as _resource_name_pattern or _resource_name_regex. But since the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, it's likely that it returns the regex pattern.

Wait, the context shows that _resource_name_regex is mentioned as part of the variables. So perhaps the function returns that variable. But the function is called _get_resource_name_regex, which suggests it returns the regex. So maybe the code is simply returning the _resource_name_regex variable.

But I need to check if there's any other information. The context also mentions that _resource_name_pattern and _resource_name_regex are present. Maybe the function returns the compiled regex pattern. For example, if _resource_name_pattern is a regex string, then _resource_name_regex could be the compiled version using re.compile.

So the function might look like this:

import re

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return _resource_name_regex

But wait, the context says that _resource_name_regex is already defined. So the function is just returning that variable. However, the user hasn't provided the actual regex pattern. But since the task is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the regex is defined elsewhere, and this function just returns it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to create the regex pattern. But without knowing the exact pattern, I have to assume that the regex is already defined as _resource_name_regex. Therefore, the function simply returns that variable.

So the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return _resource_name_regex

But I need to make sure that the function is correctly returning the regex. Also, considering that in the context, there's a variable _resource_name_pattern, maybe the function returns that. But the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which suggests it returns the regex, not the pattern. So perhaps _resource_name_regex is the compiled regex, and the function returns that.

Therefore, the code would be as above. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual regex pattern, I can't write the exact pattern. But the function is supposed to return the regex, so the code would just return the variable.

Wait, but the user might expect that the function defines the regex. However, the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which implies it's retrieving an existing regex. So the code would just return the variable.

So the final code is as written.
