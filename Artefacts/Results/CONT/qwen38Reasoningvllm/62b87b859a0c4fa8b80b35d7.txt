Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the to_csv method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The docstring says that this method converts a graph's points to CSV. The separator is optional, defaulting to a comma. The header is an optional parameter that, if provided, becomes the first line of the output. The method mentions that for each point, its coordinate is converted to a string separated by the separator, then each part of its value. Also, there's a deprecation warning indicating that this method is not used anymore and suggests using lena.output.ToCSV instead.

First, I need to handle the deprecation warning. The docstring mentions that it's deprecated since version 0.5 of Lena. So, in the code, I should issue a warning when this method is called. Using the warnings module, I can raise a DeprecationWarning.

Next, the method needs to process the points. The Graph class has points, which are likely stored in a list or similar structure. Each point has coordinates and values. The coordinates are converted to strings separated by the separator, then each part of the value. Wait, the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So, for each point, we take the coordinate parts, join them with the separator, then the value parts, also joined with the separator? Or maybe the coordinate is converted to a string, then the value parts are added?

Wait, the exact wording is: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So, perhaps the coordinate is split into parts (like x, y, z) and joined with the separator, then the value parts (maybe the actual data values) are also joined with the separator. But how are the values structured? For example, if a point has coordinates (x, y) and a value (a, b), then the CSV line would be x,y,a,b?

But the exact implementation depends on the structure of the points. Since the method is part of a Graph class, I need to access the points attribute. Let's assume that each point is an object with a 'coords' attribute (a list of coordinates) and a 'value' attribute (a list of values). So, for each point, we take coords, convert each to string, join with separator, then take value, convert each to string, join with separator, and combine them?

Wait, the docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinate parts are joined with the separator, then the value parts are joined with the separator. So the entire line for a point would be coordinate_str + separator + value_str?

But how are the coordinates and values structured? For example, if a point has coordinates [1, 2] and value [3, 4], then the line would be "1,2,3,4"?

Alternatively, maybe the coordinate is converted to a string (like "1,2") and the value is converted to a string (like "3,4"), then combined with the separator. But that would be "1,2,3,4" if the separator is comma. But that's the same as joining both parts with the separator.

Wait, perhaps the coordinate is split into parts, each part is converted to a string, then joined with the separator. Then the value is split into parts, each converted to string, joined with the separator. Then the coordinate string and value string are combined with the separator. So for example, if coordinate is [1, 2], value is [3, 4], then the line would be "1,2,3,4".

But how to handle the value? If the value is a single value, like 5, then it would be converted to "5". So the line would be "1,2,5".

So the steps are:

1. For each point, process its coordinates: convert each coordinate to string, join with separator.
2. Process the value: convert each part of the value to string, join with separator.
3. Combine the coordinate string and value string with the separator.

Wait, but the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinate is converted to a string (like "x1,x2,x3") and the value is converted to a string (like "v1,v2,v3"), then combined with the separator. So the entire line is "x1,x2,x3,v1,v2,v3".

But how to get the value parts? If the value is a single value, like 5, then it's just "5". If it's a list, like [5, 6], then "5,6".

So, for each point, we need to:

- Take the coordinates, convert each to string, join with separator.
- Take the value, convert each element to string, join with separator.
- Combine these two strings with the separator.

But how to access the coordinates and value? Assuming that each point has a 'coords' attribute (a list) and a 'value' attribute (a list or a single value). For example, if the point is an object with coords and value attributes.

So, in code:

for point in self.points:
    coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coords)
    value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
    line = coord_str + separator + value_str

But wait, the docstring says that the header is added if provided. So the header is a single string, and a new line is added automatically. So if header is not None, the first line is the header, then each point's line.

So the code would generate a list of lines. The first line is the header (if provided), then each point's line.

But how to handle the header? For example, if header is "x,y,value", then the first line is "x,y,value", then each point's line is "1,2,3".

But the docstring says that the header is the first string of the output, with a new line added automatically. So the header is a single string, and then the lines are added.

So the code would start by creating a list of lines. If header is not None, add it to the list. Then for each point, generate the line as described.

But what if the points have varying numbers of coordinates or values? The code would generate lines with the same number of elements, but perhaps the user is expected to handle that.

Now, considering the deprecation warning. The method is deprecated, so we should issue a warning when it's called. Using warnings.warn with the deprecation message.

Putting it all together:

Import warnings.

In the method:

warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated, use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)

Then, process the points.

But how to get the points? The method is part of a class that has a 'points' attribute. So self.points.

But the code may need to handle the context, but the docstring doesn't mention that. The method's parameters are separator and header.

So the code would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated, use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coords)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(coord_str + separator + value_str)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

Wait, but the docstring says that the header is added as a new line. So if header is provided, it's the first line, then the points. So the code above does that.

But what if the points are not in the self.points attribute? The docstring mentions that the method is part of a Graph class, which has points. So assuming that self.points is a list of points, each with coords and value attributes.

But maybe the points are stored in self._points? The context shows that within the class, there's self._points. So perhaps the actual points are in self._points. Let me check the context provided.

In the context, within the class, there's self._points. So maybe the points are stored in self._points. So the code should iterate over self._points.

So modifying the code:

for point in self._points:

But the original code in the context shows that the method is called as self.to_csv, and in the context, there's self.points. Wait, the context shows:

Within class: self.points ; self._points ; etc.

So perhaps the points are accessed via self.points, but the _points is a private variable. Maybe the code should use self.points, which is a property that returns self._points.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'll assume that self.points is the correct attribute. However, the context shows that self._points is present. So maybe the code should use self._points.

But the user's code may have self.points as a public attribute. However, given the context, perhaps the points are stored in self._points. So the code should iterate over self._points.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, I'll proceed with self.points, but perhaps the correct attribute is self._points. However, the method's docstring says "convert graph's points to CSV", so the points are stored in self.points.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use self._points. Let me check the context again.

In the context, within the class, there's:

self.points ; self._points ; self.scale ; self.fill(self,value) ; self.points(self) ; etc.

So the points are accessed via self.points, which is a method? Wait, the context shows self.points as a method? Or is it an attribute?

Wait, in the context, the lines are:

Within class: self._update ; self.request(self) ; self._cur_context ; self._context ; self._update(self) ; self.__init__(self,points,context,scale,sort) ; self.points ; self.scale(self,other) ; self.scale ; self.fill(self,value) ; self.points(self) ; self.__repr__(self) ; self._scale ; self._rescale_value ; self.__eq__(self,other) ; self.reset(self) ; self._sort ; self.to_csv(self,separator,header) ; self._init_context ; self._points ; self.dim ; 

So self.points is a method (since it's listed as self.points(self)), and self._points is an attribute. So perhaps the points are stored in self._points, and self.points is a method that returns them. But that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the points are stored in self._points, and the method self.points() returns them. But without knowing the exact implementation, it's hard to say. However, given that the method is called to_csv, and the points are part of the graph, the code should iterate over the points.

Assuming that the points are stored in self._points, then the code would use self._points.

But perhaps the code should use self.points, which is a method. For example, if self.points() returns the list of points.

But in the context, self.points is listed as a method. So perhaps the code should call self.points() to get the points.

But that's a bit ambiguous. However, given that the method is part of the Graph class, and the points are stored in self._points, perhaps the code should iterate over self._points.

But to make it safe, perhaps the code should use self.points(), assuming that it's a method that returns the points.

Alternatively, maybe the points are stored in self._points, and the code should use that.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to use self._points, as it's a private attribute. So the code would be:

for point in self._points:

But I'm not 100% sure. However, given that the user provided the context, and in the context, self._points is present, I'll proceed with that.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

import warnings

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated, use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self._points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coords)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(coord_str + separator + value_str)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

But wait, the docstring says that the header is added as a new line. So if the header is provided, it's the first line. Then each point's line is added. So the code appends the header first, then the point lines.

But what if the points are empty? The code would return the header line, but that's handled.

Another thing: the separator is used to join the coordinate parts and the value parts. So for example, if the separator is a tab, then the coordinates and values are joined with tabs.

But what if the value is a single value? For example, if point.value is a single number, then value_str would be str(point.value), so the line would be coord_str + separator + value_str.

Yes.

But what if the value is a list? Like, if the point has a value that's a list, then each element is converted to a string and joined with the separator.

Yes.

Now, the code also needs to handle the case where the header is None. In that case, the lines are just the point lines.

But the code starts with lines = [], then appends the header if provided, then appends each point line. So if header is None, the lines are just the point lines.

But the code returns '\n'.join(lines), which would join all lines with newlines.

But what about the header line? If the header is provided, it's added as the first line, then the point lines. So the code is correct.

Now, the deprecation warning: the docstring says that the method is deprecated since 0.5 in Lena 0.5. So the warning message should mention that.

The code uses warnings.warn with the message.

Now, the code should be written in Python, and the user said to output only the code in python markdown format.

So the final code would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.

    Convert graph's points to CSV.

    *separator* delimits values, the default is comma.

    *header*, if not ``None``, is the first string of the output
    (new line is added automatically).

    Since a graph can be multidimensional,
    for each point first its coordinate is converted to string
    (separated by *separator*), then each part of its value.

    To convert :class:`Graph` to CSV inside a Lena sequence,
    use :class:`lena.output.ToCSV`.
    """
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated, use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self._points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coords)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(coord_str + separator + value_str)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

Wait, but the import warnings is inside the method? That's not allowed. Oh, right, the import should be at the top of the file. But the user said that the imported packages include warnings, so the code can assume that warnings is imported.

But in the code, the method is part of a class, and the import is inside the method. That's invalid. So the code should import warnings at the top of the file, but since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should include the import inside the method? No, that's not allowed. So the correct approach is to have the import at the top.

But the user's context includes "Imported Packages: warnings operator functools re copy lena", so the code can assume that warnings is already imported.

So the code should not have the import inside the method. So the code should be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.

    for point in self._points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coords)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(coord_str + separator + value_str)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

But wait, the code uses self._points. However, in the context, the class has self._points as an attribute. So the code should access that.

But what if the points are stored in self.points? The context shows that self.points is a method. For example, in the context, there's self.points(self), which suggests that it's a method. So perhaps the code should call self.points() to get the points.

But that's unclear. However, given the ambiguity, and the presence of self._points in the context, the code uses self._points.

Another thing: the docstring says that the header is added automatically with a new line. So if the header is provided, it's added as the first line. The code does that.

Another possible issue: what if the points have varying numbers of coordinates or values? The code would generate lines with varying lengths, but that's up to the user's data.

Another thing: the code returns a string with all lines joined by newlines. So when the method is called, it returns the CSV string.

So the final code should be as above.
