Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_config_manager and it's a method of a class. The docstring says it gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions using cls._get_service() with ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER. So the function probably calls _get_service on the class with that service name.

Looking at the context, there are other methods like self._get_service(cls, name), which suggests that _get_service is a method that takes a class and a name. Wait, but in the function signature, the method is defined as def ansible_config_manager(cls):, which implies that it's a class method. But the context shows that within the class, there's self._get_service(cls, name). Hmm, maybe there's some confusion here.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to be a class method. So, the function ansible_config_manager is a class method that calls _get_service on the class, passing the service name ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER. But the parameters need to be correct. Let me think.

The function signature is def ansible_config_manager(cls):, which suggests that cls is the class itself. But in the context, the methods are called as self._get_service(cls, name), which implies that _get_service is an instance method that takes cls as an argument. Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe the _get_service is a class method?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to be an instance method, but the signature is given as a class method. Or maybe there's a mistake in the function signature. But the user provided the function signature as def ansible_config_manager(cls):, so I have to work with that.

The docstring says it gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So the code should call cls._get_service with the service name ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER. But how is _get_service structured? If _get_service is a method that takes a name, then the code would be something like cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER).

But wait, in the context, the methods are called as self._get_service(cls, name). Wait, that's confusing. Let me check the context again. The context shows that within the class, there's self._get_service(cls, name). So perhaps _get_service is an instance method that takes cls and name as parameters. But that would mean that the method is called with cls as the first argument, which is the instance. Wait, maybe the _get_service is a class method. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe the function ansible_config_manager is supposed to call self._get_service with the service name. But the function signature is def ansible_config_manager(cls):, which is a class method. So perhaps the code is:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER)

But wait, the docstring says "in cls._get_service()", which might mean that the method is called on cls, passing the service name. So the code would be cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER). But the function is a class method, so cls is the class, not an instance. So if _get_service is a class method, then it would be called as cls._get_service(...). But if _get_service is an instance method, then perhaps the function is supposed to be an instance method, but the signature is given as a class method. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to be an instance method, but the user provided the signature as a class method. But the user says to generate code based on the given function signature. So I have to follow that.

So the function is a class method, and it calls cls._get_service with the service name. So the code would be:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER)

But wait, the docstring says "via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service()", which might mean that the service name is ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER. So the code would call _get_service with that name.

So the generated code would be as above. Also, the user mentioned that the function is part of a class, and there are other methods like setup, plugins_manager, etc. So the function is part of a class, and the _get_service is a method of that class.

Therefore, the code should be as written. Also, the user said not to include any explanations, just the code. So the final code is:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER)

But wait, maybe the function is supposed to be an instance method. But the function signature is given as def ansible_config_manager(cls):, which is a class method. So the code should be as above. Also, the user mentioned that in the context, the methods are called as self._get_service(cls, name), which might imply that _get_service is an instance method that takes cls as an argument. But that would be odd. Maybe there's a mistake in the context. But given the information, the code should be as written.
