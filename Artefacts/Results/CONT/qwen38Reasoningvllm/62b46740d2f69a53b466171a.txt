Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the pretty method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the docstring says.

The docstring mentions that the method returns a pretty formatted representation of self. It gives an example where obj is either a string quoted or represented as repr. Then it constructs a string with indentation and the class name, along with debug details and the obj.

Wait, the example code in the docstring seems to be part of the return statement. Let me parse that. The return line is: return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})". But where does debug_details come from? The docstring mentions "debug_details" as part of the f-string. Maybe that's a variable that's determined based on the debug parameter.

Looking at the parameters, the method has indent and debug. So perhaps when debug is True, debug_details includes some additional information. For example, maybe if debug is True, it appends something like ", debug=True" or similar. But the original code in the docstring shows debug_details as part of the f-string. Wait, the user's docstring shows:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But in the docstring, the example code is:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Ah, so the debug_details is a variable that's part of the formatting. But how is it determined? The original code in the docstring seems to have a typo or missing part. Wait, maybe the user intended that debug_details is a string that is added when debug is True. For example, maybe if debug is True, then debug_details is something like ", debug=True", else it's empty.

But the original code in the docstring shows that the return line uses debug_details. So perhaps the code should include logic to determine debug_details based on the debug parameter.

Wait, the user's docstring is a bit unclear. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The user provided the function signature and the docstring. The docstring says:

Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Wait, the docstring seems to have some code examples. So the actual code for the method would first compute obj, then construct the return string with indent, class name, debug_details, and obj.

But the problem is that the docstring's code is not properly formatted. Let me parse it again.

The docstring says:

Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the code inside the method would first compute obj as either a quoted string or repr, then construct the return string with the class name, debug_details, and obj.

But where does debug_details come from? The user's code in the docstring uses debug_details as a variable. So perhaps the code should generate debug_details based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is something like ", debug=True", else it's empty.

But the original code in the docstring doesn't show how debug_details is determined. However, looking at the parameters, the method has a debug parameter. So perhaps the code should include logic to generate debug_details.

Wait, maybe the user intended that debug_details is a string that is added when debug is True. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is ", debug=True", else it's empty. But the original code in the docstring shows that the return line uses debug_details. So the code must generate that string.

But the user's docstring doesn't explain how debug_details is determined. However, looking at the context provided, the user mentioned that within the class, there's a self.FALSE attribute. Maybe that's a clue. Also, the method is part of a class that has attributes like self.dual, self.sort_order, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that includes some debug information when debug is True. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is something like ", debug=True", else it's empty. But how to determine that.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that is generated based on the debug parameter. For example:

debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""

But the original code in the docstring shows that the return line uses debug_details. So the code must include that logic.

Putting it all together, the code for the pretty method would:

1. Compute obj as either a quoted string or repr of self.obj.
2. Determine debug_details based on the debug parameter.
3. Return the formatted string with indent, class name, debug_details, and obj.

So the code would look like:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return " " * indent + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But wait, the original docstring's return line is:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the code should include the debug_details variable. Also, the original code in the docstring shows that the obj is computed as either a quoted string or repr.

But the user's docstring may have a typo. For example, the line "return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})" seems to be part of the docstring, not the actual code. So the actual code would have to compute obj and debug_details.

So the correct code would be as I wrote above.

But let me check again. The user's docstring says:

Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the code inside the method would first compute obj, then construct the return string. So the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return " " * indent + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But the user's docstring may have a typo in the return line. For example, maybe the debug_details is part of the f-string. So the code should include that.

Another possibility is that debug_details is a variable that's part of the class, but the user's context shows that self.FALSE is an attribute. But without more info, it's hard to say. However, based on the given information, the code should generate debug_details based on the debug parameter.

So the final code would be as above. Now, the user also mentioned that the method is part of a class with certain attributes, but that's probably not needed for the pretty method.

So the generated code should be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    """
    Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
    """
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return " " * indent + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But wait, the user's docstring includes the code as part of the docstring. So the actual code should not include that. The docstring is just the description. So the code should have the obj computation and debug_details.

So the code is as above. Now, the user's context says that the method is part of a class with certain attributes, but that's probably not relevant here.

So the final code is as written.
