Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_from_content method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The docstring says it validates that the YAML spec content has all required fields. If mandatory data is missing, it should raise an IRValidatorException. It also returns a dictionary loaded from the YAML file.

First, I need to import the necessary modules. The context mentions that the imported packages are os, jsonschema, six, and infrared. So I'll make sure those are imported. Wait, but the user didn't specify if these are already imported in the file. But since the context says "Imported Packages" includes them, I can assume they are available.

The method is part of a class, as there's a reference to self.validate_from_file and self.validate_from_content. So the method is an instance method of a class.

The function takes spec_content as a parameter. The goal is to load this YAML content into a dictionary and validate it against some schema. But the schema isn't provided here. However, the method is supposed to check for required fields. So perhaps the schema is defined elsewhere, maybe in the class or another part of the code.

Wait, the function is called validate_from_content, which suggests that it's validating the content of a spec file. The method might be using jsonschema to validate the content against a schema. But since the schema isn't provided, maybe the method is using a predefined schema within the class.

But the user hasn't provided the schema details. However, the function's purpose is to check for required fields. So perhaps the code will load the YAML content into a dictionary, then check if all required fields are present.

But how to handle the validation? The function needs to raise IRValidatorException if any required fields are missing. So maybe the code will first load the YAML content into a dictionary, then check for the presence of required fields.

Wait, but the function is part of a class, and there's a mention of self.validate_from_file. Maybe the validate_from_content is a helper method that's called when the spec_content is provided directly, rather than reading from a file.

So, the steps for the code would be:

1. Load the spec_content from YAML into a dictionary. But wait, the parameter is called spec_content, which is the content of the spec file. So perhaps the spec_content is already a string, and we need to parse it into a dictionary. So using yaml.safe_load on spec_content.

But the context mentions that the method is called with spec_content, which is the content of the spec file. So maybe the code will parse that content into a dictionary.

But then, the method needs to validate that all required fields are present. So perhaps the required fields are defined in a schema, and the code checks against that schema.

But since the schema isn't provided, maybe the code is using a predefined schema in the class. Alternatively, maybe the required fields are determined by the class's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is using the jsonschema library to validate the content against a schema. For example, the code could have a schema attribute in the class, and then use jsonschema.validate to check.

But since the user hasn't provided the schema, maybe the code is supposed to check for certain required keys. However, without knowing the exact required fields, it's hard to code that. But perhaps the function is supposed to load the YAML content into a dictionary and return it, but also check for required fields. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the spec_content is not None and that it's a valid YAML. But the docstring says it's about validating that the spec has all required fields.

Hmm. Since the user hasn't provided the schema, perhaps the code is supposed to use a predefined schema. But since the user hasn't given that, maybe the code is supposed to check for the presence of certain keys. But without knowing which keys, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a schema attribute, and the code uses that. For example:

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    # Load the YAML content into a dict
    spec_dict = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    # Validate against the schema
    jsonschema.validate(instance=spec_dict, schema=cls.schema)
    return spec_dict

But then, the schema would need to be defined in the class. However, the user hasn't provided that. But the function's purpose is to validate that the spec has all required fields, so maybe the code is using jsonschema to validate against a schema.

But since the user hasn't provided the schema, perhaps the code is supposed to check for the presence of certain required fields. For example, maybe the required fields are defined in the class, like a list of required keys.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check that the spec_content is not None and that it's a valid YAML. But the docstring says it's about validating that the spec has all required fields.

Wait, the function's docstring says it raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So the code needs to check that all required fields are present in the spec_content.

But without knowing which fields are required, how can the code do that? Maybe the required fields are defined in the class as a class variable, like cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS.

So, the code could:

- Load the spec_content into a dictionary.
- Check that all required fields are present in the dictionary.
- If any are missing, raise the exception.
- Return the dictionary.

But the user hasn't specified the required fields, so perhaps the code is supposed to use a schema from jsonschema.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to use the infrared library's validation. But without more context, it's hard to say.

But given the context, the code should probably use jsonschema to validate the content against a schema. So, assuming that the class has a schema attribute, the code would be:

import yaml
import jsonschema
from infrared import IRValidatorException

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    """
    validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

    :param spec_content: content of spec file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
    """
    if spec_content is None:
        # Maybe raise an error? Or assume it's handled elsewhere?
        # But the function's parameters allow spec_content to be None.
        # So perhaps the code expects it to be provided.
        # But the function's docstring says it's the content of the spec file.
        # So maybe spec_content is not None here.
        # However, the code should handle cases where it's None.
        # But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps we proceed.
        pass

    # Load the YAML content into a dictionary
    try:
        spec_dict = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        # Handle YAML parsing error
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")

    # Validate against the schema
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=spec_dict, schema=cls.schema)
    except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Validation error: {e}")

    return spec_dict

But the user's context says that the method is part of a class, and there's a reference to self.validate_from_file and self.validate_from_content. So perhaps the method is part of a class that has a schema attribute.

But the user hasn't provided the schema, so the code uses cls.schema. However, the function is called as a class method? Or an instance method?

Wait, the function is defined as def validate_from_content(cls, ...), which suggests that it's a class method. But in Python, if you use @classmethod, then cls is the class. However, the user's code shows that within the class, they call self.validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file) and self.validate_from_content(cls, file_content). So perhaps the method is an instance method, but the first parameter is cls, which would imply that it's a class method. But that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the context. Let me recheck:

Within file: Within class: self.validate_from_file(cls,yaml_file) ; self.validate_from_content(cls,file_content) ;

So, inside the class, the methods are called with cls as the first argument. That suggests that these are class methods. So the function signature should have @classmethod, and the first parameter is cls.

But the user's function signature is def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):, which is correct for a class method.

So the code should be a class method. But the user's code may not have the @classmethod decorator. However, in Python, if the first parameter is cls, it's typically a class method. But the user's code may not have the decorator. However, the user's code may be using the class as the first parameter, so the code should be written as a class method.

But the user's code may not have the @classmethod decorator. However, the function signature is written with cls as the first parameter, which is typical for class methods.

So the code would be:

import yaml
import jsonschema
from infrared import IRValidatorException

class SomeClass:
    schema = ...  # Assume schema is defined somewhere

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            # Maybe raise an error? Or assume it's handled elsewhere?
            # But the function's parameters allow spec_content to be None.
            # So perhaps the code expects it to be provided.
            # However, the function's docstring says it's the content of the spec file.
            # So maybe spec_content is not None here.
            # But to be safe, perhaps raise an error if it's None.
            raise ValueError("spec_content cannot be None")

        # Load the YAML content into a dictionary
        try:
            spec_dict = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")

        # Validate against the schema
        try:
            jsonschema.validate(instance=spec_dict, schema=cls.schema)
        except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Validation error: {e}")

        return spec_dict

But the user's context says that the method is part of a class, and the code is supposed to be generated. However, the user hasn't provided the schema, so the code uses cls.schema, which is assumed to be defined in the class.

But the user's code may not have the schema, but the function is supposed to validate the required fields. So perhaps the code is supposed to check for certain required keys. For example, maybe the required fields are defined in the class as a list.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to check that the spec_content is not empty and that it's a valid YAML. But the docstring says it's about required fields.

Given that the user hasn't provided the schema, but the function is supposed to validate required fields, the code should probably use jsonschema to validate against a schema. So the code would use the cls.schema.

But since the user hasn't provided the schema, the code will use that assumption.

So the final code would be as above, with the class method, loading the YAML, validating against the schema, and raising the exception if needed.

But the user's code may not have the @classmethod decorator. However, the function signature has cls as the first parameter, which is typical for a class method. So the code should include the @classmethod decorator.

But the user's code may have the method as an instance method, but the first parameter is cls. That's conflicting. However, given the context, it's more likely that it's a class method.

So the code should be written with @classmethod.

But the user's code may not have that. However, the function signature is given as def validate_from_content(cls, ...), which is correct for a class method.

So the generated code should include the @classmethod decorator.

But the user's code may not have it, but the function signature is as given.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

import yaml
import jsonschema
from infrared import IRValidatorException

class SomeClass:
    schema = ...  # Assume schema is defined somewhere

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            raise ValueError("spec_content cannot be None")

        try:
            spec_dict = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")

        try:
            jsonschema.validate(instance=spec_dict, schema=cls.schema)
        except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Validation error: {e}")

        return spec_dict

But the user's code may not have the schema, but the function is supposed to validate the required fields. However, without the schema, the code can't validate. So the code assumes that the class has a schema attribute.

But the user's context says that the method is part of a class, and the code is to be generated. So the code will use the schema from the class.

So the final code is as above.
