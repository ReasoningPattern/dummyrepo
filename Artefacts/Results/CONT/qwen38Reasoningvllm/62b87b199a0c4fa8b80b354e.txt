Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function is_fill_request_seq(seq) based on the given docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it checks whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and returns a boolean. 

First, I should figure out what FillRequestSeq is. Since it's mentioned in the context with other functions like is_fill_compute_seq and is_fill_request_el, maybe FillRequestSeq is a class or a type that the function is checking against. The function's purpose is to determine if the input sequence 'seq' can be converted into an instance of FillRequestSeq.

So, the function needs to validate the sequence. But how? Maybe it checks if the sequence meets certain criteria. For example, maybe it's a list of specific elements, or it has a particular structure. Since there's no detailed docstring, I have to make some assumptions.

Looking at the context, there are other functions like is_source(seq), which might be related to checking sequences for a source. Maybe FillRequestSeq has similar validation rules. But without more info, I'll have to make educated guesses.

Perhaps the function is_fill_request_seq(seq) checks if the sequence is of the correct type and structure. For example, maybe it's a list of integers or a specific object. Alternatively, it might check if the sequence can be converted using some method or class constructor.

Since the user hasn't provided specific details, I'll assume that FillRequestSeq is a class that can be instantiated from a sequence. So the function might check if the sequence is valid for that class. But how to implement that?

Wait, maybe the function is part of a larger system where FillRequestSeq is a data structure. For example, maybe it's a list of elements that must be of a certain type. Let's say FillRequestSeq requires a list of elements that are instances of some class, like FillRequestEl. Then, the function would check each element in the sequence.

Alternatively, maybe FillRequestSeq is a class that has a class method to create from a sequence. So the function could attempt to create an instance of FillRequestSeq from the sequence and catch any exceptions. But that's a bit more involved.

Another approach: maybe the function checks if the sequence is not empty and meets certain conditions. For example, if the sequence is a list and all elements are of a certain type.

But since the user hasn't provided specifics, I need to make a general implementation. Let me think of a possible structure. Let's say FillRequestSeq is a class that requires the sequence to be a list of elements that are validated by is_fill_request_el. So the function could check each element in the sequence using is_fill_request_el.

Wait, looking at the context, there's a function called is_fill_request_el(obj). So maybe FillRequestSeq is a sequence of elements that are validated by is_fill_request_el. So the function is_fill_request_seq(seq) would check if each element in the sequence is valid according to is_fill_request_el.

So the code could iterate through each element in the sequence and check if they pass is_fill_request_el. If all do, return True; else, False.

But how to handle the sequence itself? For example, maybe the sequence needs to be a list, or a tuple, or some other type. Let's assume that the sequence must be an iterable, and each element must pass is_fill_request_el.

So the code would first check if the input is a sequence (like a list, tuple, etc.), then iterate through each element, applying is_fill_request_el. If all elements are valid, return True; else, False.

But the function's name is is_fill_request_seq, so maybe it's checking if the sequence can be converted into a FillRequestSeq object. So perhaps FillRequestSeq is a class that takes a sequence in its constructor. So the function could try to create an instance of FillRequestSeq with the given sequence and see if it's possible.

But without knowing the actual implementation of FillRequestSeq, it's hard to say. However, given the context, perhaps the function is part of a validation system where each element is checked individually.

Alternatively, maybe FillRequestSeq is a specific type, like a list of integers, and the function checks if the sequence is of that type.

But given the lack of information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function checks each element in the sequence using is_fill_request_el. So the code would look something like:

def is_fill_request_seq(seq):
    """
    Check whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and bool is returned.
    """
    if not isinstance(seq, (list, tuple)):
        return False
    for element in seq:
        if not is_fill_request_el(element):
            return False
    return True

But wait, the user mentioned that within the file, there are functions like is_fill_compute_el and is_fill_request_el. So maybe FillRequestSeq is a sequence of elements that are validated by is_fill_request_el. Therefore, the function is_fill_request_seq would check if the sequence is valid by checking each element.

But maybe the function is more about checking the sequence's structure rather than individual elements. For example, maybe the sequence must have a certain length or format.

Alternatively, maybe FillRequestSeq is a class that has a method to validate the sequence. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Another possibility: the function is checking if the sequence can be converted into a FillRequestSeq object. So, perhaps FillRequestSeq is a class that can be initialized with a sequence. So the function would try to create an instance and catch any exceptions. But that's more complex.

But given that the user hasn't provided specifics, I think the best approach is to assume that the function checks if the sequence is a valid list (or tuple) where each element is validated by is_fill_request_el. So the code would check the type of the sequence and each element.

But the function's name is is_fill_request_seq, so maybe it's checking if the sequence itself meets certain criteria, not necessarily the elements. For example, maybe the sequence must be non-empty, or have a certain structure.

Alternatively, maybe FillRequestSeq is a specific type, like a list of integers, and the function checks if the sequence is of that type. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

In the absence of specific information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function checks if the sequence is a list (or tuple) and each element is validated by is_fill_request_el. So the code would look like:

def is_fill_request_seq(seq):
    """
    Check whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and bool is returned.
    """
    if not isinstance(seq, (list, tuple)):
        return False
    for element in seq:
        if not is_fill_request_el(element):
            return False
    return True

But wait, the user mentioned that within the class, there are other functions. However, the code is for a function outside of a class. So the code should be standalone.

Another thought: maybe FillRequestSeq is a class that requires the sequence to be of a certain type. For example, maybe it's a list of strings. So the function checks if the sequence is a list and all elements are strings. But again, without knowing, it's a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is checking if the sequence is a valid FillRequestSeq instance. So, perhaps FillRequestSeq is a class that has a class method to validate the sequence. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Given the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to implement a function that checks if the sequence is a list or tuple and each element passes is_fill_request_el. That seems plausible given the context of other functions like is_fill_request_el.

So the code would be as I wrote earlier. Now, I need to make sure that the code is written in Python, and that it's formatted correctly. Also, the user said not to include any explanations, just the code in Python markdown format.

So the final code would be:

def is_fill_request_seq(seq):
    """
    Check whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and bool is returned.
    """
    if not isinstance(seq, (list, tuple)):
        return False
    for element in seq:
        if not is_fill_request_el(element):
            return False
    return True

But wait, the user mentioned that within the file, there are other functions like is_fill_compute_el, is_fill_compute_seq, etc. So perhaps the function is_fill_request_seq is part of a validation system where each element is checked with is_fill_request_el. So the code above makes sense.

I think that's the best approach given the information.
