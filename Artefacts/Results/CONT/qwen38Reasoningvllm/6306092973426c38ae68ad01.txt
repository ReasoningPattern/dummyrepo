Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate Python code for the get_deprecated_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring mentions that it should return a dictionary with options that deprecate others, using self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs(). 

First, I need to understand what the method is supposed to do. The key part is identifying deprecated arguments. The docstring says options from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs(), so I should probably call that method to get the specs.

Looking at the context, there are several other methods mentioned, like validate_arg_deprecation and validate_arg_sources. But the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, so I have to rely on the docstring and the function signature.

The method is part of a class, and the self parameter refers to the instance. The function needs to return a dictionary. So, the steps might be:

1. Iterate over the option specs using self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs().
2. For each option spec, check if it's deprecated.
3. Collect those options into a dictionary.

But how exactly to determine if an option is deprecated? The docstring doesn't specify, but maybe the spec_helper has a way to indicate deprecated options. Perhaps each option spec has a 'deprecated' flag or a method to check deprecation.

Assuming that the iterate_option_specs() returns a list of option specifications, and each has a 'deprecated' attribute, the code could filter those. Alternatively, maybe the deprecation is determined by some other logic, like if an option is marked as deprecated in the spec.

So, the code might look like:

def get_deprecated_args(self):
    """
    Returning dict with options which deprecate others. options from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs()
    """
    deprecated_args = {}
    for spec in self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs():
        if spec.get('deprecated'):
            deprecated_args[spec['name']] = spec['deprecation_message']
    return deprecated_args

But I'm not sure about the exact structure of the specs. Maybe the spec_helper has a method to get deprecated options directly. Alternatively, the method could be using the validate_arg_deprecation method mentioned in the context. However, since the user hasn't provided that method's code, I should stick to the docstring.

Another possibility is that the method is supposed to collect options that have been deprecated, meaning they are no longer recommended and might be removed. So, the code would iterate through the specs and collect those marked as deprecated.

I think the safest approach is to iterate through the specs and check for a 'deprecated' key. So the code would be as above. But since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, maybe the specs are objects with attributes. For example, if each spec has a 'deprecated' attribute, then:

for spec in self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs():
    if spec.deprecated:
        deprecated_args[spec.name] = spec.deprecation_message

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. However, given the information, the code should call iterate_option_specs and filter the specs that are deprecated, then return them as a dictionary. The keys could be the option names, and the values could be the deprecation messages or some other relevant info.

So the final code would be something like that. I'll proceed with that.
