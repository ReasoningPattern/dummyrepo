Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the dict_insert function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that dict_insert is used to insert a value into a nested key of a dictionary. The example shows that the keys are provided as a chain, like 'key1.key2' split into parts. So the function takes the initial dictionary, the value, and then a series of keys that form the path to the nested location.

Wait, the parameters are key and *keys. So the first key is 'key', and then the rest are in *keys. So the keys are passed as separate arguments. For example, if the keys are 'key1', 'key2', then the function is called with key='key1' and keys=('key2',). Or maybe the example in the docstring splits 'key1.key2' into parts, so maybe the function expects the keys to be passed as a single string split into parts. Wait, the example shows dict_insert({}, 'val', 'key1.key2'.split('.')), which would split into ['key1', 'key2'], so the function is called with key='key1' and keys=('key2',). Wait, but the parameters are key and *keys. So the first key is key, then the rest are in keys. So the function should process the keys as a chain.

So the function needs to traverse the dictionary using the keys provided. If any of the intermediate keys don't exist, they should be created as empty dictionaries. Then, the final key is assigned the value.

So the steps would be:

1. Start with the input dictionary.
2. For each key in the chain (key followed by keys), check if the current dictionary has the key. If not, create an empty dictionary for it.
3. Proceed to the next level of the dictionary.
4. After processing all keys except the last one, assign the value to the last key.

Wait, the function's parameters are key and *keys. So the first key is 'key', and then the rest are in keys. So the keys are key, keys[0], keys[1], etc. So the chain is key, keys[0], keys[1], ... ?

Wait, the example given in the docstring is dict_insert({}, 'val', 'key1.key2'.split('.')), which splits into ['key1', 'key2']. So in that case, the function is called with key='key1' and keys=('key2',). So the keys are key followed by the rest. So the chain is key, keys[0], keys[1], etc. So the function needs to process all the keys in the order given.

So the code should process the keys as a list, starting with the first key, then the keys from the *keys argument.

So the code would need to take the keys as a list. Let me think: the parameters are key and *keys. So the keys are [key] + list(keys). Wait, no. Wait, the parameters are key and *keys. So if the user calls dict_insert(dic, val, 'a', 'b', 'c'), then key is 'a', and keys is ('b', 'c'). So the chain is 'a', 'b', 'c'.

So the code should process the keys as a list: keys_chain = [key] + list(keys). Wait, no. Wait, the parameters are key and *keys. So the first key is key, and the rest are in keys. So the keys_chain is [key] + list(keys). So for example, if the user passes key='key1' and keys=('key2',), then keys_chain is ['key1', 'key2'].

So the code needs to process each key in keys_chain, except the last one, to create the nested dictionaries, and then assign the value to the last key.

So the code can be structured as follows:

def dict_insert(dic, val, key, *keys):
    # process the keys
    keys_chain = [key] + list(keys)
    current = dic
    for k in keys_chain[:-1]:
        if k not in current:
            current[k] = {}
        current = current[k]
    current[keys_chain[-1]] = val
    return dic

Wait, but the function is supposed to modify the original dictionary. So the function returns the modified dictionary. So the code would need to traverse through the keys, creating dictionaries as needed, and then assign the value.

But wait, in the example given, the function is called with the keys split from 'key1.key2', so the keys_chain is ['key1', 'key2'], and the value is inserted into dic['key1']['key2'].

So the code above would do that. Let me test this logic.

Let's say dic is empty. keys_chain is ['key1', 'key2']. The loop runs for keys_chain[:-1], which is ['key1']. So for k in ['key1'], check if it's in current (which is dic). If not, create it as empty dict. Then current becomes current[k], which is the new dict. Then, assign current[keys_chain[-1]] = val. So that would set dic['key1']['key2'] = val.

Yes, that seems correct.

But what if there are more keys? Like, if keys_chain is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then the loop runs for 'a' and 'b', creating the necessary dicts, then assign to 'c'.

So the code seems correct.

But wait, the function's parameters are key and *keys. So the keys_chain is [key] + list(keys). So the code would take the first key as the first element, then the rest from *keys.

But in the example given in the docstring, the keys are passed as a split list. So the function is called with key='key1' and keys=('key2',). So the keys_chain is ['key1', 'key2'].

Yes.

So the code should be:

def dict_insert(dic, val, key, *keys):
    keys_chain = [key] + list(keys)
    current = dic
    for k in keys_chain[:-1]:
        if k not in current:
            current[k] = {}
        current = current[k]
    current[keys_chain[-1]] = val
    return dic

Wait, but the function's parameters are key and *keys. So the keys are passed as key, and then the rest as *keys. So the code is correct.

But what if the keys_chain is empty? Well, the function's parameters require at least one key. Because the parameters are key and *keys. So the minimum is key is provided. So keys_chain will have at least one element.

But what if the keys_chain has only one element? Then, the loop for k in keys_chain[:-1] would be for nothing. So the code would assign current[keys_chain[-1]] = val. Which is correct.

So this code should handle all cases.

Now, the function is supposed to modify the original dictionary. So the code returns the modified dictionary. So the code is correct.

But wait, the function's docstring says that the parameters are key and *keys. So the first key is key, and the rest are in keys. So the code is correct.

Now, the user mentioned that the function is part of a file that imports infrared. But I don't think that affects the code. The code is straightforward.

So the code should be as written above. Let me check the parameters again.

The parameters are:

def dict_insert(dic, val, key, *keys):

So the first key is key, then the rest are in keys. So the code is correct.

So the code is as written.
