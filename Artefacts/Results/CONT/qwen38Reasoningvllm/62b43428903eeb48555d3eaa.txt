Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the formatmany method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The docstring says it converts SQL using self._converter.convert_many. So the method likely delegates the work to the _converter's convert_many method. 

Looking at the parameters: sql is of type AnyStr, which could be a string or bytes. many_params is a union of Iterable of Dict or Iterable of Sequence. The return type is a tuple of AnyStr and a list of either Dict or Sequence.

So the method should take the SQL string and the many_params, then apply the converter. But wait, the _converter might have a method called convert_many. Let me check the context.

In the context, there's a mention of self._create_converter(self), which suggests that _converter is an attribute created by that method. So perhaps _converter has a convert_many method that handles the parameter substitution.

The format method is also mentioned, which takes sql and params. Maybe formatmany is similar but handles multiple parameters. 

The parameters for formatmany are many_params, which can be either a list of dictionaries (for named parameters) or a list of sequences (for positional parameters). The return type is a tuple where the first element is the formatted SQL string, and the second is a list of the parameters used, either as dicts or sequences.

So the code for formatmany would probably call self._converter.convert_many with sql and many_params. But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. 

Wait, the convert_many method might expect the parameters in a specific format. For example, if the converter is designed to handle multiple sets of parameters, maybe it's expecting a list of parameter sets. 

So the method would be something like:

def formatmany(self, sql, many_params):
    return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But I need to check the types. The return type is a tuple of AnyStr and a list of either Dict or Sequence. The convert_many method might return a tuple where the second element is the list of parameters. 

But perhaps the _converter's convert_many method returns the formatted SQL and the processed parameters. So the formatmany method would just call that and return the result.

But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly handled. For example, if the converter expects the parameters to be in a certain format, maybe the many_params are already in the correct structure.

Also, the method's parameters are annotated with Union[Iterable[Dict[...]], Iterable[Sequence[...]]], so the code should accept both types.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def formatmany(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many
    """
    return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But wait, the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many", so the method is just a wrapper around that. So the code is straightforward. 

I should also check if there are any other methods or attributes that need to be considered. For example, the _in_regex and expand_tuples might be related, but since the docstring says to use _converter.convert_many, perhaps those are handled elsewhere.

So the final code is as above. I need to make sure that the return type matches. The convert_many method's return type is assumed to be a tuple of the formatted SQL and the list of parameters. 

Therefore, the generated code should be the method that calls self._converter.convert_many with the given parameters and returns the result.
