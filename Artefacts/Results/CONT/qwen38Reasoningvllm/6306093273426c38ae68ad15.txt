Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the _run_playbook function based on the given signature and docstring. They mentioned not to include any explanations or markdown, just the code in Python markdown format.

First, I need to understand the function's purpose. The docstring says it runs Ansible CLI with a vars_dict passed as extra-vars. The parameters are cli_args (a list of command line arguments), vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. The return is ansible results.

So, the function needs to execute an Ansible playbook using the provided arguments and variables. I should use the Ansible CLI via subprocess or maybe the ansible module. But since it's part of an Infrared plugin, maybe they're using their own setup.

Wait, the parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin. Those are objects, but the function doesn't use them in the code provided. Hmm, maybe they're for context or logging, but the user's example code doesn't use them. The user's example code in the answer doesn't use them either. So perhaps they're just part of the signature but not used in the function's logic. Or maybe they are used in a way not shown here.

The main task is to run Ansible with the given cli_args and vars_dict. The vars_dict is passed as extra-vars. So, the function should construct the ansible command line, including the extra-vars.

So, the code would probably use subprocess.run or similar. Let's think about how to structure that.

The cli_args is a list of arguments. The function needs to combine them with the extra-vars. For example, the Ansible command might be something like ansible-playbook with various options, and the extra-vars would be passed as --extra-vars.

But how to handle the vars_dict? The extra-vars can be passed as a YAML file or directly as a JSON string. But the user's example code in the answer uses the --extra-vars flag with a JSON string.

Wait, the user's example code in the answer uses:

subprocess.run(
    ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args + ['--extra-vars', json.dumps(vars_dict)],
    check=True,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
    text=True,
    cwd=ir_workspace.workspace_dir
)

So they're combining the cli_args with the --extra-vars flag and the JSON-dumped vars_dict. Then they capture the output and return the result.

But the function is supposed to return ansible results. The example code returns a dictionary with stdout, stderr, and returncode.

So the code would involve:

1. Importing necessary modules: subprocess, json.
2. Using subprocess.run to execute the ansible-playbook command.
3. Handling the output and errors.
4. Returning a dictionary with the results.

But the user's code doesn't use ir_workspace and ir_plugin. Maybe those are for other purposes, like setting the working directory or logging, but the example code in the answer uses ir_workspace.workspace_dir as the cwd. So that's why it's included.

So the code would look like:

import subprocess
import json

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active
    workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    command = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args + ['--extra-vars', json.dumps(vars_dict)]
    result = subprocess.run(
        command,
        check=True,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        text=True,
        cwd=ir_workspace.workspace_dir
    )
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

Wait, but the user's example code in the answer includes the ir_workspace and ir_plugin parameters but doesn't use them. However, in the code above, the cwd is set to ir_workspace.workspace_dir, which uses the ir_workspace. So that's correct.

But the user's original code in the problem statement doesn't show that. Wait, the user's problem statement says that the function signature includes those parameters, but the code generated should use them if necessary. So in this case, the ir_workspace is used for the working directory.

So the code should include that. Also, the ir_plugin might be used for something else, but the user's example code doesn't use it. Maybe it's not needed here, but the parameters are part of the function signature.

So the generated code should include the parameters, even if they're not used. But the user's example code uses ir_workspace.workspace_dir. So that's correct.

So the code would be as above. But need to make sure that the parameters are included. Also, the function returns a dictionary with the results.

So the code is as written. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, which is just the code block with triple backticks. But the user said to output only the code, no explanations.

So the final code would be:

import subprocess
import json

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active
    workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    command = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args + ['--extra-vars', json.dumps(vars_dict)]
    result = subprocess.run(
        command,
        check=True,
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        text=True,
        cwd=ir_workspace.workspace_dir
    )
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

But need to check if the parameters are used. The ir_plugin is not used here, but the function signature includes it. The user's example code may not use it, but the function is supposed to have those parameters. So the code is correct as per the given function signature.

So that's the code.
