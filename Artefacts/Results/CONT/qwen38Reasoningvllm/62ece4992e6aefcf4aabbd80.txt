Okay, I need to create a Python function called remove_ending_os_sep that takes an input_list. The function should process each string in the list to remove trailing OS separator characters. Let me think about the steps.

First, the docstring says if the input is None, return an empty list. So I should check if input_list is None and handle that case.

Next, the function needs to iterate over each string in the list. For each string, check if its length is greater than one. Because if the string is just a single character, maybe it's a single separator, but the problem says to check the last character. Wait, the docstring says "if the last character is the pathname separator." So even if the string is length 1, if it's the separator, maybe we should remove it? But the condition says "length greater than one" before checking the last character. So maybe the code should first check if the string's length is more than one, then check the last character.

Wait, the docstring says: "Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator." So the condition is that the string's length is greater than one AND the last character is the separator. So for example, if a string is "path/", then we check if len is >1 (yes), then check if last char is os.sep. If so, remove it. But if the string is just "/", then len is 1, so we don't process it. Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to remove trailing separators even if the string is just a single separator? The docstring isn't clear. But according to the given condition, the code should only check strings with length >1. So for example, "path/" becomes "path", but "/" would remain as is.

So the steps are: for each string in the input list, if the string's length is greater than 1 and the last character is os.sep, then remove the last character. Otherwise, leave it as is.

So the code would:

- Check if input_list is None, return empty list.
- Else, iterate over each item in input_list.
- For each item, check if len(item) > 1 and item[-1] == os.sep. If so, strip the last character. Else, leave it.
- Collect all processed strings into a new list, which is returned.

Wait, but what if the string is empty? Like an empty string. Then len is 0, so it's skipped. But maybe the function should handle that? The problem says "string list", so maybe the input list contains strings, but perhaps empty strings are allowed. But according to the docstring, the function is supposed to remove trailing separators. So for an empty string, nothing to do.

So code steps:

Import os.

Handle the None case.

For each string in the list:

if len(s) > 1 and s ends with os.sep, then s[:-1], else s.

So the code would be:

import os

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    result = []
    for s in input_list:
        if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(os.sep):
            result.append(s[:-1])
        else:
            result.append(s)
    return result

Wait, but the docstring says "pathname separator". The os.sep is the separator for the current platform. So for example, on Windows, it's '\', on Unix, it's '/'. So the code uses os.sep correctly.

Testing some examples:

If input_list is ["path/", "file.txt", "/"], then the first string is "path/", len is 5, ends with os.sep (assuming os.sep is '/'), so becomes "path". The second string doesn't end with separator. The third string is "/", len is 1, so left as is.

So the function would return ["path", "file.txt", "/"].

Another example: ["home/user/", "data/"] would become ["home/user", "data"].

But what if the string is "home/user//"? Then the last character is '/', so it would be stripped to "home/user/"? Wait, no. Wait, the code checks if the last character is os.sep. So if the string is "home/user//", then the last character is '/', so it would be stripped to "home/user/" (since the last character is '/', so s[:-1] would be "home/user/". Wait, no: "home/user//" has length 8 (assuming the string is "home/user//"), then s[:-1] would be "home/user/" (the last character is the second '/'). So the code would remove only the last occurrence of the separator if it's at the end. So if there are multiple separators at the end, it removes just one. Wait, but the code checks if the last character is the separator. So if the string ends with multiple separators, like "path///", then the code would check if the last character is '/', which it is, so it would remove one, resulting in "path//". But the function is supposed to remove trailing separators. So perhaps the code should remove all trailing separators. But according to the docstring, the function is supposed to remove trailing os separator characters. So maybe the code should remove all trailing separators, not just one.

Wait, the docstring says: "remove trailing os seperator characters." So for example, if the string is "path//", it should become "path". But the current code would only remove one. So perhaps the code should check for any trailing separators and remove them all.

Wait, the original problem says: "Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator." So the code is checking if the last character is the separator. So for a string like "path//", the code would check the last character (which is '/'), so it would remove it, resulting in "path/". Then, the new string is "path/", which again ends with '/', so the code would process it again. But in the current code, each string is processed once. So the code as written would only remove one trailing separator. But the problem says to remove trailing separators. So perhaps the code should remove all trailing separators.

But according to the docstring, the function is supposed to remove trailing os separators. So perhaps the code should remove all trailing separators. But the way the docstring is written, it's unclear. Let me re-read the docstring.

The docstring says: "Iterate over a string list and remove trailing os seperator characters. Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname seperator."

So the code is checking for the last character. So for example, if the string is "path//", the code would check if the last character is os.sep (yes), so it would remove it, resulting in "path/". But then, the new string is "path/", which again ends with os.sep. However, the code only processes each string once. So the code as written would only remove one trailing separator. But the function's purpose is to remove trailing separators. So perhaps the code should remove all trailing separators. But how?

Wait, maybe the code should check if the string ends with os.sep, and if so, strip it. But in the code, the check is done once per string. So for example, if the string is "path//", the code would check once, and remove one separator, resulting in "path/". But the code would not process it again. So the code as written would only remove one separator. However, the function's purpose is to remove trailing separators. So perhaps the code should remove all trailing separators. How to do that?

For example, for a string like "path//", the code should return "path". So the code needs to remove all trailing separators. So perhaps the code should check if the string ends with os.sep, and if so, strip it, and repeat until the string no longer ends with os.sep. But that would require a loop for each string.

But the original docstring says: "Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator." So perhaps the code is only supposed to remove one trailing separator. But that's not clear. However, the user's example in the docstring may not cover that. Let me think again.

The user's function is supposed to remove trailing os separator characters. So for example, if the string is "path/", it becomes "path". If it's "path//", it becomes "path/". But according to the code as written, it would only remove one. But maybe the function is supposed to remove all trailing separators. So the code should process the string until there are no more trailing separators.

But how to do that? For example, for a string s, we can check if it ends with os.sep, and if so, strip it, and repeat. But how to do that in code.

An alternative approach is to use a loop for each string. For example:

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    result = []
    for s in input_list:
        while len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(os.sep):
            s = s[:-1]
        result.append(s)
    return result

This way, for each string, we keep removing the last character as long as it's the separator and the length is more than one. So for "path//", it would become "path/". Then, since the new string ends with '/', but len is 5 (assuming "path/" is 5 characters?), wait, "path/" is 5 characters. Then, the loop checks again: len is 5>1, ends with '/', so remove again, resulting in "path". Now, len is 4, ends with '/', so check again. Wait, no. Wait, after the first removal, the string is "path/", which ends with '/'. So the loop would check again. So for "path//", the code would remove the last '/' to get "path/", then check again, and remove the last '/' to get "path". So the code would remove all trailing separators.

But according to the original docstring, the code is supposed to check if the string's length is greater than one and if the last character is the separator. So the original code as written only checks once. But the user's docstring says "remove trailing os separator characters", which implies removing all of them.

So there's a contradiction between the docstring's description and the code's logic. But the user provided the docstring, so perhaps the code should follow the docstring's description.

The docstring says: "Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator." So the code is supposed to check once. So the original code that checks once is correct according to the docstring. However, the function's purpose is to remove trailing separators, which may require removing all of them. But the docstring says that each string is tested once. So perhaps the code should only remove one trailing separator.

But this is ambiguous. However, given that the user provided the docstring, the code should follow that. So the code should check once per string. So the original code that checks once is correct.

But let me check the original code again. The user's function is supposed to remove trailing separators. So for example, if the string is "path//", the code would remove one separator, resulting in "path/". But the user may expect it to remove all. But the docstring says that each string is tested once. So perhaps the code should only remove one.

But the user's example in the docstring isn't clear. However, given the information, I should code according to the docstring.

So the code would be:

import os

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    result = []
    for s in input_list:
        if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(os.sep):
            result.append(s[:-1])
        else:
            result.append(s)
    return result

But wait, the code uses s.endswith(os.sep). But os.sep is a single character. So for example, if the string ends with os.sep, then s.endswith(os.sep) returns True. So that's correct.

So this code should handle the cases as per the docstring. So the code is as written.
