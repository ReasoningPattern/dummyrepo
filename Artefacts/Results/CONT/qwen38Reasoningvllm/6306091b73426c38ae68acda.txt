Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called plugins_manager and takes a cls parameter. The docstring says it gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service().

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions using cls._get_service() with ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. So, the function probably calls _get_service on the class with that service name and returns the result.

Looking at the context, there are other methods like setup, register_service, etc. But the main thing here is to implement plugins_manager. The user mentioned not to include any explanations, just the code.

So, the code should be a method inside a class. The function is defined as def plugins_manager(cls):. Wait, but in Python, instance methods usually take self as the first parameter. However, the function signature here uses cls, which suggests it's a class method or perhaps a static method. But the context shows that within the class, self._get_service is called. Wait, the context says "Within class: self._get_service(cls,name)"â€”maybe the function is part of a class, and the plugins_manager is an instance method. But the parameter is cls, which is a bit confusing. Maybe it's a class method?

Wait, the original function signature is def plugins_manager(cls):, which is a class method. But in the context, when they call self.plugins_manager(cls), that suggests that it's an instance method. Hmm, maybe there's a mix here. Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to be a class method, but the context shows it's being called as an instance method. This might be a mistake, but I need to follow the given signature.

The docstring says to get the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So, the code would be something like returning cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER). But wait, the _get_service method might take the service name as an argument. So, the function would call cls._get_service with the service name ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER.

But wait, the function is called plugins_manager, and it's supposed to be a method. So, perhaps the correct code is:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But I need to check if ServiceName is an enum or a module. The context mentions imported packages os, sys, infrared. Maybe ServiceName is part of the infrared module? Or perhaps it's a class or enum defined elsewhere. Since the user hasn't provided that info, I'll assume that ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER is a valid attribute.

Also, the function is part of a class, and the context shows that other methods like setup, register_service, etc., are present. So, the plugins_manager is likely a method of that class.

Wait, but the function signature is def plugins_manager(cls):, which is a class method. But in the context, when they call self.plugins_manager(cls), that would be an instance method. So perhaps there's a confusion here. However, the user provided the function signature as def plugins_manager(cls):, so I should stick to that.

Therefore, the code would be as simple as returning the result of cls._get_service with the service name ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. So the code is:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName is correctly referenced. If ServiceName is a module or a class, maybe it's imported. Since the context includes 'imported Packages: os sys infrared', perhaps ServiceName is part of infrared. But the user hasn't specified, so I'll assume it's available.

So the final code is as above. I need to output only the code in Python markdown format, without any explanations.
