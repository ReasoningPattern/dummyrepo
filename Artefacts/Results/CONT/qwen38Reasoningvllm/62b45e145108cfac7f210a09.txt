Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function check_digests_present_and_used based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it checks that all digests in the manifest that are needed are present and used. If not, it should return error() from the class. So the function needs to verify two things: first, that all required digests are present in the manifest files, and second, that they are actually used somewhere. If any are missing or not used, it should trigger an error.

Looking at the context, there are several attributes available. For example, self.digest_regex is a method that probably returns a regex pattern for matching digests. Also, self.manifest_files is a list of manifest files, and digests_used is a list of digests that are considered used. The function needs to check against these.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Extract all digests from the manifest_files. This might involve reading each manifest file and using self.digest_regex to find all digest entries. But wait, the exact method of extracting digests isn't specified. Maybe the manifest_files are already parsed, and the digests are stored in some structure. However, the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So perhaps manifest_files is a list of files, and the digests present in those files need to be collected.

Wait, the function is part of a class, and in the context, there's a self.manifest_files attribute. So maybe manifest_files is a list of paths or objects representing the manifest files. But how to get the digests from them? The self.digest_regex method might be used to find digest patterns in the files. So perhaps the function first collects all digests present in the manifest_files using the regex.

But the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So maybe the digests_used is a list of digests that are required to be present and used. Wait, the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So the 'needed' digests are those in digests_used. So the function needs to check that each digest in digests_used is present in the manifest_files and also used (maybe in some other part of the system? Or perhaps 'used' means that they are referenced in the manifest? Or maybe 'used' refers to being part of the content paths or something else?)

Alternatively, perhaps 'digests_used' is the list of digests that are actually used in the system, and the function checks that all digests that are needed (maybe those in the manifest) are present in the manifest and also in digests_used. Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the docstring.

The docstring says: "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class." So the 'needed' digests are those that are in the manifest. Wait, maybe the 'needed' digests are those that are required by the system, and the function checks that they are present in the manifest and also used (i.e., present in the digests_used list). Or perhaps the 'needed' digests are those that are in the digests_used list, and the function checks that they are present in the manifest.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that all digests that are present in the manifest are also used (i.e., present in digests_used), and that all digests that are needed (from some other source) are present in the manifest. But the exact logic isn't clear. However, given the parameters, the function has manifest_files and digests_used. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files, and also that all digests in the manifest_files are accounted for in digests_used. Or maybe it's checking that the digests_used are a subset of the digests present in the manifest_files.

But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So the 'needed' digests are those that are in the manifest. Wait, maybe the 'needed' digests are those that are required by the system, and the function checks that they are present in the manifest and also used (i.e., present in digests_used). But without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check that all digests that are present in the manifest are used (i.e., in digests_used), and that all digests that are needed (from some other source) are present in the manifest. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.

Given the parameters, perhaps the function is supposed to collect all digests from the manifest_files, then check that each digest in digests_used is present in the manifest, and also that all digests in the manifest are present in digests_used. But that would be checking for a bi-directional relationship. However, the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So maybe the 'needed' digests are those in digests_used, and the function checks that they are present in the manifest and used (i.e., present in the manifest). Or perhaps 'used' refers to being part of the content paths or something else.

Alternatively, maybe 'used' refers to being referenced in the manifest. For example, if a digest is present in the manifest but not used (i.e., not referenced in any content path), then it's an error. But again, without more context, it's challenging.

Looking at the context, there are methods like check_content_paths_map_to_versions and check_content_path, which might relate to content paths and their versions. Also, there's a self.digest_algorithm and self.digest_regex, which might be used to parse digests from the manifest files.

So perhaps the approach is:

1. Collect all digests present in the manifest_files. This could be done by iterating over each manifest file, using self.digest_regex to find all digest entries. For example, using re.findall with the regex pattern to extract all digest values.

2. Check that all digests in digests_used are present in the collected digests from the manifest. If any are missing, raise an error.

3. Also, check that all digests present in the manifest are accounted for in digests_used. Or perhaps that the digests_used are a subset of the manifest digests. But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So maybe the 'needed' digests are those in digests_used, and the function checks that they are present in the manifest (i.e., present in the collected digests) and used (i.e., present in the manifest). Wait, that seems redundant. Maybe 'used' refers to being part of the content paths or something else.

Alternatively, maybe 'used' means that the digest is actually used in the content paths. For example, if a digest is present in the manifest but not referenced in any content path, it's considered not used. So the function needs to check that all digests in the manifest are used (i.e., present in content paths) and that all needed digests (from some source) are present in the manifest.

But given the parameters, the function has digests_used, which might be the list of digests that are considered used. So perhaps the function checks that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest, and that all digests in the manifest are present in digests_used. But that would imply that the two lists are equal. However, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the function checks that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest, and that all digests in the manifest are used (i.e., present in digests_used). That would mean that the two lists are the same.

But without more context, it's hard to be certain. However, given the parameters, the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files. So the steps would be:

- For each manifest file, extract all digests using self.digest_regex.

- Collect all these digests into a set.

- Check that each digest in digests_used is present in this set. If any are missing, raise an error.

But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So maybe the 'needed' digests are those in digests_used, and the function checks that they are present in the manifest (i.e., present in the collected digests) and also used (i.e., present in the manifest). That seems redundant, but perhaps 'used' refers to being part of the content paths. However, without more information, it's challenging.

Alternatively, maybe 'used' refers to being part of the digests_used list. So the function checks that all digests in the manifest are in digests_used, and that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest. But again, this would imply that the two sets are equal.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function needs to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files. So the steps are:

1. Parse all manifest_files to collect all digests.

2. For each digest in digests_used, check if it exists in the collected digests. If any are missing, raise an error.

But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So maybe 'needed' refers to the digests in the manifest, and the function checks that they are used (i.e., present in digests_used). So the function checks that all digests present in the manifest are in digests_used. That would mean that the collected digests from the manifest are a subset of digests_used.

But again, without more context, it's hard to be certain. However, given the parameters, the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used, so perhaps the function is supposed to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files. That would make sense if digests_used is a list of required digests that must be present in the manifest.

So the code would:

- Iterate over each manifest file.

- For each file, extract all digests using self.digest_regex.

- Collect all these digests into a set.

- For each digest in digests_used, check if it is in the collected set. If not, raise an error.

But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So maybe 'needed' refers to the digests in the manifest, and the function checks that they are used (i.e., present in digests_used). So the function would check that all digests in the manifest are in digests_used. That would mean that the collected digests from the manifest are a subset of digests_used.

But then, what about the 'present' part? If the digests are in the manifest, they are present. So the function would check that they are used (i.e., in digests_used). So the code would collect all digests from the manifest, then check that each of them is in digests_used. If any are not, raise an error.

But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So the 'needed' digests are those in the manifest. So the function checks that they are present (which they are, since they're in the manifest) and used (i.e., present in digests_used). So the function is checking that all digests in the manifest are in digests_used.

But that seems a bit odd. Maybe the 'needed' digests are those that are required by the system, and the function checks that they are present in the manifest and used (i.e., present in the manifest). But that again is redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps 'used' refers to being part of the content paths. For example, if a digest is in the manifest but not referenced in any content path, it's considered not used. So the function would need to check that all digests in the manifest are used (i.e., present in content paths), and that all needed digests (from some source) are present in the manifest.

But without knowing how to access the content paths, it's hard to implement that. However, looking at the context, there are methods like check_content_paths_map_to_versions and check_content_path, which might be related. But since the function is supposed to return error(), perhaps it's checking that the digests in the manifest are used in the content paths.

But again, without more context, it's challenging. Given the parameters, I'll proceed with the initial approach: collect all digests from the manifest_files, and check that each digest in digests_used is present in the collected digests.

So the code would:

- Use self.digest_regex to extract digests from each manifest file.

- Collect all digests into a set.

- For each digest in digests_used, check if it's in the set. If not, raise an error.

But the function's name is check_digests_present_and_used, which suggests that both presence in the manifest and usage (perhaps in content paths) are checked. However, without knowing how to check usage, perhaps the 'used' refers to being present in the manifest. But that would be redundant.

Alternatively, maybe 'used' refers to being present in the digests_used list, which is passed as a parameter. So the function checks that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest. That would make sense if digests_used is a list of required digests that must be present in the manifest.

So the code would:

- For each manifest file, extract all digests using self.digest_regex.

- Collect all these digests into a set.

- For each digest in digests_used, check if it is in the set. If any are missing, raise an error.

That seems plausible. So the code would look like:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    """
    Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class.
    """
    # Collect all digests from manifest_files
    manifest_digests = set()
    for manifest in manifest_files:
        # Assuming manifest is a file path or object that can be processed
        # Use self.digest_regex to find all digests in the manifest
        # For example, using re.findall
        # But need to read the manifest content
        # However, the exact method of processing the manifest is unclear
        # Assuming that self.digest_regex returns a regex pattern, and we can find all matches
        # So perhaps:
        # digest_matches = re.findall(self.digest_regex(), manifest_content)
        # But how to get manifest_content?
        # Since the context includes self.manifest_files, perhaps each manifest is a file path
        # So we need to read each file and extract digests
        # However, without knowing the exact method to read the files, this is speculative
        # Assuming that the manifest_files are file paths, and we can read them
        # But since the code is to be generated, perhaps the actual implementation is to process each manifest file
        # For the purpose of this code, perhaps the following:
        # Read the manifest file content
        # Then apply the regex to find all digests
        # However, since the code is to be generated, perhaps the actual code would be:
        # But since the user hasn't provided the exact method to process the manifest, I'll have to make assumptions
        # Assuming that the digest_regex returns a regex pattern, and that we can use it to find all matches in the manifest content
        # So, for each manifest file, read its content, apply the regex, and collect the digests
        # For example:
        with open(manifest, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        digest_matches = re.findall(self.digest_regex(), content)
        manifest_digests.update(digest_matches)
    # Now check that all digests_used are present in manifest_digests
    for digest in digests_used:
        if digest not in manifest_digests:
            self.error("Digest not found in manifest")
            return
    # Also, maybe check that all digests in manifest are used (i.e., in digests_used)
    # But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used."
    # So perhaps the 'needed' digests are those in the manifest, and they must be used (i.e., present in digests_used)
    # So check that all manifest_digests are in digests_used
    for digest in manifest_digests:
        if digest not in digests_used:
            self.error("Digest not used")
            return
    # If all checks pass
    return

But wait, the function is supposed to return error() in the class. So if any check fails, it should call self.error(). Also, the function may not return anything, but the docstring says to return error(). So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error if any condition is not met.

But the exact implementation depends on how the error is raised. For example, the function may call self.error() and return, or it may raise an exception. However, the context shows that self.error is a method, so it's likely that the function should call self.error() with an appropriate code.

But the docstring says to return error(), which might mean that the function should call self.error() and return. So the code would check the conditions, and if any fail, call self.error().

But the code above would check both that digests_used are present in the manifest and that all manifest digests are in digests_used. That would ensure that the two sets are equal. However, this might not be the intended behavior. For example, if the manifest has more digests than digests_used, it would trigger an error.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest. So the code would check that each digest in digests_used is in the manifest_digests. If any are missing, call self.error().

But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So the 'needed' digests are those in the manifest, and they must be present and used. So the 'used' part might refer to being in digests_used. So the function would check that all digests in the manifest are in digests_used. That would mean that the manifest_digests is a subset of digests_used.

But again, without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given the parameters, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function needs to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest, and that all digests in the manifest are used (i.e., present in digests_used). This would mean that the two sets are equal.

So the code would:

- Collect all digests from the manifest_files into a set.

- Check that all digests_used are in the manifest_digests.

- Check that all manifest_digests are in digests_used.

If either check fails, call self.error().

But how to collect the digests from the manifest_files? Assuming that each manifest file is a string that contains digest entries, and self.digest_regex is a regex pattern that matches those digests.

So the code would use re.findall to extract all matches from each manifest file.

But in Python, the regex would need to be compiled. However, the context shows that self.digest_regex is a method, which may return the regex pattern. So perhaps:

import re

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    """
    Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class.
    """
    # Collect all digests from manifest_files
    manifest_digests = set()
    for manifest in manifest_files:
        # Read the manifest content
        # Assuming that manifest is a file path
        with open(manifest, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        # Find all digests using self.digest_regex
        # Assuming self.digest_regex returns a regex pattern
        pattern = self.digest_regex()
        digest_matches = re.findall(pattern, content)
        manifest_digests.update(digest_matches)
    # Check that all digests_used are present in manifest_digests
    for digest in digests_used:
        if digest not in manifest_digests:
            self.error("Digest not found in manifest")
            return
    # Check that all manifest_digests are in digests_used
    for digest in manifest_digests:
        if digest not in digests_used:
            self.error("Digest not used")
            return
    # If all checks passed
    return

But this code assumes that manifest_files is a list of file paths, and that self.digest_regex returns a regex pattern. Also, it assumes that the error is raised by calling self.error() with a message.

However, the function's docstring says to return error(), which might mean that the function should return an error object, but in the context, self.error is a method that probably logs an error and raises an exception.

But the exact implementation details are not clear. However, the code above seems to fit the given parameters and the docstring's intent.

Another consideration: the function is part of a class, and the context includes attributes like self.manifest_files, which might be a list of manifest files. But the function's parameter is manifest_files, which might be the same as self.manifest_files. However, the function's parameter is passed, so it's not necessarily the same as the instance variable.

In any case, the code would need to process the manifest_files parameter.

Another possible issue is that the digests_used could be a list of strings, and the manifest_digests are also strings. So comparing them directly would work.

So the final code would be as above, with the two checks.
