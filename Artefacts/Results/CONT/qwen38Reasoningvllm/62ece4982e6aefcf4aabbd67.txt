Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function vertex3tuple based on the given signature and docstring. Let me read the requirements carefully.

The function takes a list of vertices and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain three points: the current vertex and the two adjacent ones. But if the indices are out of bounds, I should wrap around, using 0 for the first element if needed.

Wait, the docstring says if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. Wait, does that mean if the index is negative or beyond the list length, we use 0? Or maybe for the next and previous indices? Let me think.

For example, if the vertices list has 3 elements, then for the last vertex (index 2), the next index would be 3, which is out of bounds. So according to the docstring, that should be treated as 0. Wait, but 0 is the first element. Wait, maybe the indices are modulo the length of the vertices list. Or maybe when accessing the next or previous elements, if the index is out of bounds, use 0. Wait, the docstring says "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". So, for example, if the index is -1 (which is out of bounds for a list starting at 0), then use 0. Or if the index is equal to the length of the list, like len(vertices), then also use 0?

Wait, maybe the intention is that for each vertex at index i, the previous is i-1, and next is i+1. But if i-1 is less than 0, use 0. If i+1 is equal to len(vertices), then use 0 as well? Or maybe wrap around? Wait, the docstring says "take the value of index as 0" when out of bounds. So, for example, if the index is -1, use 0. If the index is len(vertices), also use 0. So, for the first vertex (index 0), the previous would be -1, which becomes 0. So the previous is 0, current is 0, next is 1. Wait, but that would make the first vertex's tuple (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1])? That seems odd. Or maybe the intention is that for the first vertex, the previous is the last vertex, and for the last vertex, the next is the first. But the docstring says to take the index as 0 if out of bounds. So maybe the code should handle indices by taking modulo len(vertices) to wrap around? But the docstring says to take the index as 0. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring. Let me re-read the docstring.

The docstring says: "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". So, for example, if the index is -1 (which is out of bounds for a list starting at 0), then use 0. Similarly, if the index is len(vertices), which is also out of bounds, use 0. So, for each vertex i, the previous index is i-1, but if that's negative, use 0. The next index is i+1, but if that's equal to len(vertices), use 0. So, for example, if the vertices list has 3 elements, then for i=2 (last element), next index is 3, which is out of bounds, so use 0. So the three points would be vertices[2], vertices[0], vertices[0]? Wait, no. Wait, the current vertex is i, previous is i-1 (if in bounds, else 0), next is i+1 (if in bounds, else 0). So for i=2, previous is 1, next is 3 (out of bounds, so 0). So the tuple would be (vertices[2], vertices[1], vertices[0])? Wait, no. Wait, the function is supposed to get 3 points for each vertex: the vertex and the two points on both sides. So for each vertex, the three points are the previous, current, and next. But if the previous is out of bounds, use 0. Wait, maybe the code should be:

for each vertex in vertices, create a tuple of (prev, current, next), where prev is i-1 if i-1 >=0 else 0, and next is i+1 if i+1 < len(vertices) else 0. Wait, but the docstring says "take the value of index as 0" when out of bounds. So for example, if the index is out of bounds, use 0. So for the previous index, if i-1 is negative, use 0. For the next index, if i+1 is equal to len(vertices), use 0. So for a list of 3 elements, for i=0, previous is -1 (out of bounds) → 0, next is 1. So the tuple would be (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1])? Wait, no. Wait, the three points are the vertex and the two adjacent points. So for each vertex i, the three points are the previous (i-1), current (i), and next (i+1). But if the previous is out of bounds, use 0. Similarly for next. So for i=0, previous is -1 → 0, next is 1. So the three points are vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1]? Or is the current vertex the middle one? Wait, the function's docstring says "Get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon. This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So for each vertex, the three points are the previous, current, and next. So for each vertex i, the three points are vertices[prev], vertices[i], vertices[next]. But prev and next are adjusted to be within 0 to len(vertices)-1, using 0 if out of bounds.

Wait, but how to handle when the index is out of bounds. For example, if the list has 3 elements, and i=0, then prev is i-1 = -1 → 0. next is i+1 = 1. So the three points are vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1]. But that would be (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1])? Or is the current vertex the middle one? Wait, the function's name is vertex3tuple, and the docstring says "get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon. This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So for each vertex, the three points are the vertex itself and the two adjacent vertices. But if the vertex is the first one, the previous is the last one. Similarly, if it's the last one, the next is the first. But according to the docstring, if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. Wait, that's confusing. Because if the index is out of bounds, like for i=0, the previous is -1, which is out of bounds. So according to the docstring, we take the index as 0. So the previous would be 0. So for the first vertex, the three points would be vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1]? That seems incorrect. Because the previous should be the last vertex. But according to the docstring's instruction, when the index is out of bounds, take the index as 0. So maybe the user intended that for the previous and next indices, if they are out of bounds, use 0. But that would make the first vertex's previous be 0, which is the same as the current vertex. That would create a tuple (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1]). But that's not correct for a polygon. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring. Maybe they meant to wrap around, so that for the first vertex, the previous is the last one, and for the last vertex, the next is the first. But the docstring says to take the index as 0 when out of bounds. So maybe the code should handle the indices as follows: for each vertex i, the previous index is (i-1) if i-1 >=0 else 0. The next index is (i+1) if i+1 < len(vertices) else 0. So for example, if the list has 3 elements, for i=0: prev is 0 (since i-1 is -1, which is out of bounds → 0), next is 1. So the three points are vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1]. For i=1: prev is 0, next is 2. So (vertices[0], vertices[1], vertices[2]). For i=2: prev is 1, next is 0. So (vertices[1], vertices[2], vertices[0]). That would make sense for a polygon, as each vertex is connected to the next and previous. But the first vertex's previous is 0 (same as current), which seems odd. But according to the docstring, that's what is required.

So the code needs to generate for each vertex i, a tuple of (vertices[prev], vertices[i], vertices[next]), where prev is i-1 if i-1 >=0 else 0, and next is i+1 if i+1 < len(vertices) else 0.

Wait, but the docstring says "take the value of index as 0" when out of bounds. So for example, if the index is out of bounds, use 0. So for i=0, prev is -1 → 0. For i=2 in a list of 3 elements, next is 3 → 0. So the code would be:

prev_index = i - 1 if i - 1 >= 0 else 0
next_index = i + 1 if i + 1 < len(vertices) else 0

But wait, for i=0, prev_index is 0. For i=2, next_index is 0. So the three points would be vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1] for i=0. But that seems like the first vertex's previous is itself. Which might not be correct. However, according to the docstring, that's what is required.

So the code would loop through each vertex in the input list, and for each, calculate the previous and next indices as described, then create a tuple of (vertices[prev_index], vertices[i], vertices[next_index]).

But wait, the function's return is a list where the elements of vertices are represented by tuple. Wait, the docstring says "A list where the elements of vertices represented by tuple". Wait, maybe the function returns a list of tuples, each tuple containing three points. So for each vertex in vertices, create a tuple of three elements: the previous, current, and next. So the code would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    result = []
    n = len(vertices)
    for i in range(n):
        prev_index = i - 1 if i - 1 >= 0 else 0
        next_index = i + 1 if i + 1 < n else 0
        result.append( (vertices[prev_index], vertices[i], vertices[next_index]) )
    return result

Wait, but what if the vertices list is empty? Well, the function may not handle that, but the problem doesn't specify. Assuming that vertices is a non-empty list.

Wait, but the docstring says "vertices to be converted" — perhaps it's expected that vertices is a list of points, like a list of tuples or lists. The code would take each vertex, and for each, get the previous and next as per the rules.

But let me test with an example. Suppose vertices is [A, B, C]. Then:

For i=0: prev_index is 0 (since i-1 is -1 → 0), next_index is 1. So tuple is (A, A, B).

For i=1: prev is 0, next is 2 → (A, B, C).

For i=2: prev is 1, next is 0 → (B, C, A).

So the result is [(A,A,B), (A,B,C), (B,C,A)].

But if the user intended that for the first vertex, the previous is the last one (C), then the code would be different. But according to the docstring, when the index is out of bounds, use 0. So in that case, for i=0, prev_index is 0, which is the same as current. So the code as written would do that.

But maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring. For example, maybe they meant to wrap around, so that for i=0, prev is n-1, and for i=n-1, next is 0. But according to the docstring, that's not the case. The docstring says to take the index as 0 when out of bounds. So the code should follow that.

Therefore, the code would be as written above.

Now, the code needs to be written. Also, the user said to not include any explanation, just the code. So the code should be in Python, with the function definition, and the code inside.

So the code would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    """
    Get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon.
    This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex
    If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0
    Args:
        vertices: vertices to be converted

    Returns:
        A list where the elements of vertices represented by tuple
    """
    result = []
    n = len(vertices)
    for i in range(n):
        prev_index = i - 1 if i - 1 >= 0 else 0
        next_index = i + 1 if i + 1 < n else 0
        result.append( (vertices[prev_index], vertices[i], vertices[next_index]) )
    return result

Wait, but the docstring says "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". So for example, if the index is out of bounds, use 0. So for i=0, prev_index is -1 → 0. For i=2 in a list of length 3, next_index is 3 → 0. So the code above handles that.

Yes, this should be correct.
