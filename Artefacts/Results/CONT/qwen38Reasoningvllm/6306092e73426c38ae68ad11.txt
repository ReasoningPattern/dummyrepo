Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate Python code for the merge_extra_vars function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to extend vars_dict with extra_vars. 

First, I need to understand the parameters. vars_dict is the dictionary to merge into, and extra_vars is a list of extra variables. The docstring mentions that extra_vars is a list, so I should handle that.

Wait, the function's purpose is to merge extra-vars into vars_dict. But how exactly? Are the extra_vars supposed to be key-value pairs? Or maybe each item in the list is a dictionary? The docstring isn't very detailed. But since the function is named merge_extra_vars, perhaps extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and we need to merge them into vars_dict.

Wait, maybe the extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs. For example, if extra_vars is a list like [{'key1': 'value1'}, {'key2': 'value2'}], then we need to merge those into vars_dict. Or maybe extra_vars is a list of strings, each representing a key-value pair in a specific format?

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and we need to update vars_dict with each of them. So for each item in extra_vars, we do vars_dict.update(item). But the function's parameters say extra_vars is a list, so perhaps that's the case.

Wait, the function's parameters are vars_dict (a dictionary) and extra_vars (a list). So the function should take the list of extra variables and merge them into vars_dict. But how are the extra_vars structured? If each element in the list is a dictionary, then merging would be to update vars_dict with each of those dictionaries. But if the extra_vars are key-value pairs, maybe they are in a list of tuples or something else.

But the docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". The term "extend" here might mean adding the extra variables to the existing ones. So perhaps the extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, and we need to add them to vars_dict. For example, if extra_vars is [{'key1': 'value1'}, {'key2': 'value2'}], then we loop through each dict in the list and update vars_dict.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a list of strings, each in the format "key=value", and we need to parse them and add to vars_dict. But the docstring doesn't specify that. The original function's name is merge_extra_vars, which might be part of a larger system, perhaps related to Ansible's extra_vars, where extra_vars are typically a list of dictionaries or key-value pairs.

But since the user hasn't provided more details, I need to make an assumption. Let's assume that extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary contains key-value pairs to merge into vars_dict. So the function would iterate over each dictionary in extra_vars and update vars_dict with those key-value pairs.

Wait, but the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. So the function would take the existing vars_dict and merge the extra_vars into it. So the code would be something like:

if extra_vars is not None:
    for item in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(item)

But wait, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then that's correct. However, if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs (like tuples), then we need to loop through them and add each key-value pair to vars_dict.

But the docstring says "extra-vars" which is a list. In Ansible, extra_vars is typically a dictionary, but maybe in this context, it's a list of dictionaries. Alternatively, perhaps the extra_vars is a list of strings, each representing a key-value pair, and we need to parse them.

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the user provided the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". The parameter extra_vars is a list. So perhaps the function is meant to take a list of key-value pairs (like a list of tuples) and add them to vars_dict.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and we need to merge them into vars_dict. For example, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then for each dict in the list, we update vars_dict with that dict.

But the function's name is merge_extra_vars, which suggests that it's merging the extra variables into the existing vars_dict. So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for item in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(item)
    return vars_dict

Wait, but in Python, dictionaries are mutable, so modifying them in-place would change the original. However, the function might need to return the merged dictionary. But the function's docstring doesn't specify whether to return it or not. The original function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars, and the function is supposed to extend vars_dict. So perhaps the function modifies vars_dict in-place and returns it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to create a new dictionary. But the docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which implies modifying the existing one.

But the user's code example shows that within the class, they call self.merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars). So the function is part of a class, and perhaps it's intended to modify the vars_dict in-place.

But the user's code example shows that the function is part of a class, but the code isn't provided. So I need to focus on the function's parameters and docstring.

Another possibility: the extra_vars is a list of strings, each in the format "key=value", and the function needs to parse each string into a key-value pair and add them to vars_dict. For example, if extra_vars is ["key1=value1", "key2=value2"], then we split each string into key and value and add to vars_dict.

But again, without more context, it's hard to say. However, the function's name and parameters suggest that extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and the function is merging them into vars_dict. So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for item in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(item)
    return vars_dict

But wait, the function's docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". If extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then this code would work. However, if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs (like a list of tuples), then the code would need to loop through each pair and add them. For example:

for key, value in extra_vars:
    vars_dict[key] = value

But the docstring says "extra-vars" is a list, but doesn't specify the structure. Given that the function is part of a class that's using infrared, perhaps it's related to Ansible's extra_vars, which is typically a dictionary. However, in some contexts, extra_vars might be a list of dictionaries.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, and the function is supposed to add them to vars_dict. For example, if extra_vars is a list like ["key1=value1", "key2=value2"], then split each string into key and value and add to vars_dict.

But again, without more context, it's challenging. However, the user's code example shows that within the class, they call self.merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars). So perhaps the function is intended to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict, and the extra_vars is a list of dictionaries.

Another possibility is that the extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and the function merges them into vars_dict. So the code would be as I wrote earlier.

But the user's function signature has extra_vars as a list. So the code would need to handle that. So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for item in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(item)
    return vars_dict

But wait, the function's docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". If extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then this code would work. However, if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs (like a list of tuples), then the code would need to loop through each pair and add them. For example:

for key, value in extra_vars:
    vars_dict[key] = value

But the docstring doesn't specify the structure of extra_vars. However, given that the function is named merge_extra_vars and the parameter is a list, perhaps the intended structure is that each element in the list is a dictionary. Therefore, the code would be as above.

Another thing to consider: the function may need to handle cases where extra_vars is not provided. So setting extra_vars to an empty list if None.

So the final code would be as written above. Also, the function returns vars_dict, which is modified in-place. But the user's code example shows that the function is called with vars_dict and extra_vars, and it's part of a class. So the function is likely modifying the vars_dict in-place and returning it.

Thus, the generated code would be the function as written.
