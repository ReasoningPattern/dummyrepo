Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the ansible_playbook function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is supposed to wrap the 'ansible-playbook' CLI. The parameters include ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, and optional ones like verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args. The docstring explains each parameter.

First, I should import the necessary modules. The context mentions imported packages like tempfile, re, datetime, sys, json, distutils, os, errno, main, infrared, and ansible. So I'll need to import these. But since the user said not to include explanations, I'll just include the imports as needed.

Next, the function needs to construct the command to run ansible-playbook. The playbook_path is given, and we need to handle the extra_vars and ansible_args. Also, the verbose parameter affects the verbosity level. 

The function should probably use the ansible module's API or subprocess to run the playbook. Since the context mentions _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, etc., maybe the ansible_playbook function prepares the arguments and calls that function.

Wait, the context shows that _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin. So perhaps the ansible_playbook function constructs the cli_args and vars_dict, then calls _run_playbook.

So, the steps would be:

1. Construct the command line arguments for ansible-playbook.
2. Handle the extra_vars and ansible_args parameters.
3. Pass the constructed arguments to _run_playbook.

Let me think about how to structure the code.

First, the function will need to build the command. The base command is 'ansible-playbook', then the playbook path. Then, add any ansible_args, which are passed directly. Also, handle verbose, which translates to -v, -vv, etc. The verbose parameter can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the verbosity levels.

So, for verbose, if it's provided, we need to add the appropriate number of 'v' flags. For example, verbose=2 would add '-vv'.

Then, extra_vars is a dictionary that needs to be converted into --extra-vars key=value pairs. Also, the ansible_args is a dict of arguments to pass directly to ansible-playbook.

So, the code would:

- Initialize the cli_args list with 'ansible-playbook' and the playbook_path.
- Add the verbose flags based on the verbose parameter.
- Add the extra_vars as --extra-vars entries.
- Add the ansible_args as their own arguments.

Wait, but the ansible_args are supposed to be passed directly to ansible-playbook. So for example, if ansible_args has 'check=True', that would be passed as --check. But how to handle that? Maybe the ansible_args are converted into command-line arguments. But since the user might pass any valid ansible-playbook argument, we need to pass them as-is.

But how to handle the conversion from the dict to the command-line arguments. For example, if ansible_args is {'check': True}, then the command line would include --check.

But in Python, the way to handle this is to iterate over the keys and values of the ansible_args dict and add them as --key=value or --key if the value is None. Wait, but the user might pass arguments that are boolean flags, like check, which would be --check without a value. So perhaps the code should check if the value is None, and if so, add --key, else --key=value.

But the problem is that the ansible_args could have any keys, and the user expects them to be passed as command-line arguments. So the code would need to process each key-value pair in ansible_args and add them to the cli_args list as appropriate.

But how to handle that in code. For example:

for key, value in ansible_args.items():
    if value is None:
        cli_args.append(f'--{key}')
    else:
        cli_args.append(f'--{key}={value}')

But maybe the user expects that the ansible_args are passed as-is, so perhaps the code should just pass them as command-line arguments. However, the exact way to handle this depends on how the ansible-playbook command expects them. For example, some arguments are flags (like --check) and others are options with values (like --extra-vars).

But since the user is passing a dict, perhaps the code should process each key-value pair and add them as --key=value, or --key if the value is None. But this might not cover all cases, but given the function's parameters, this seems like a reasonable approach.

So, putting this together:

The cli_args list starts with 'ansible-playbook' and the playbook_path.

Then, handle verbose:

if verbose is not None:
    for _ in range(verbose):
        cli_args.append('-v')

Then, handle extra_vars. The extra_vars is a dict, so we need to convert it into --extra-vars key=value pairs. So:

if extra_vars:
    for key, value in extra_vars.items():
        cli_args.append(f'--extra-vars={key}={value}')

Then, handle ansible_args. For each key in ansible_args, add --key=value or --key if value is None.

Wait, but the ansible_args is supposed to be "dict of ansible-playbook arguments to plumb down directly to Ansible." So perhaps the code should pass them as-is, but how? For example, if the ansible_args is {'check': True}, then the command line would have --check. But if it's {'some_arg': 'value'}, then --some_arg=value.

So the code would loop through the ansible_args and add each as --key=value or --key if the value is None.

But how to handle cases where the key is a flag (like check) that doesn't take a value. So, for example, if the value is None, then it's --key, else --key=value.

So in code:

if ansible_args:
    for key, value in ansible_args.items():
        if value is None:
            cli_args.append(f'--{key}')
        else:
            cli_args.append(f'--{key}={value}')

But wait, some arguments might require multiple flags, like --vault-id, which can take multiple values. But perhaps the function is designed to handle that, and the user is expected to pass the correct structure in ansible_args.

Once the cli_args is built, then the function calls _run_playbook with cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin.

Wait, the _run_playbook function is called with cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin. But where does vars_dict come from? The vars_dict might be the extra_vars, or maybe it's a combination of other variables. But according to the function signature, the extra_vars is passed as a dict, and perhaps that's the vars_dict. Or maybe the vars_dict is a combination of other variables, but the function's parameters don't mention that. 

Looking back at the function signature, the parameters are: ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose, extra_vars, ansible_args. The _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin. So perhaps the vars_dict is the extra_vars. Or maybe it's a different variable. But since the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, maybe the vars_dict is the extra_vars. Or perhaps the vars_dict is a combination of other variables, but the function's parameters don't mention that. 

But given that the function is called ansible_playbook, and the _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, etc., perhaps the vars_dict is the extra_vars. Or maybe it's the combination of other variables. However, since the function's parameters include extra_vars, maybe the vars_dict is the extra_vars. 

But without more context, perhaps the code for _run_playbook is not needed here. The task is to generate the ansible_playbook function. So the code for ansible_playbook would construct cli_args and then call _run_playbook with cli_args, vars_dict (maybe extra_vars?), and the other parameters.

But the function signature of _run_playbook is not given. However, the context shows that _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin. So perhaps the vars_dict is the extra_vars. Or maybe it's a different variable. 

But since the function is supposed to pass extra_vars to Ansible as extra-vars, maybe the vars_dict is the extra_vars. So in the code, when calling _run_playbook, the vars_dict is the extra_vars.

But I'm not sure. However, the user's code example in the context shows that _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin. So perhaps the vars_dict is the extra_vars. 

Alternatively, maybe the vars_dict is a combination of other variables, but given the information, I'll proceed with the assumption that vars_dict is the extra_vars. 

So, putting it all together, the code would:

- Build cli_args as discussed.
- Call _run_playbook with cli_args, extra_vars (as vars_dict), ir_workspace, ir_plugin.

But wait, the function's parameters have extra_vars as a parameter. So in the code, the extra_vars is passed as the vars_dict to _run_playbook. 

But the function's parameters have extra_vars as a dict, which is passed to Ansible as extra-vars. So the code would pass that as the vars_dict.

So the code would be:

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None,
                     extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    """
    Wraps the 'ansible-playbook' CLI.
    ...
    """
    cli_args = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    if verbose is not None:
        for _ in range(verbose):
            cli_args.append('-v')
    if extra_vars:
        for key, value in extra_vars.items():
            cli_args.append(f'--extra-vars={key}={value}')
    if ansible_args:
        for key, value in ansible_args.items():
            if value is None:
                cli_args.append(f'--{key}')
            else:
                cli_args.append(f'--{key}={value}')
    # Now call _run_playbook with cli_args, extra_vars, ir_workspace, ir_plugin
    return _run_playbook(cli_args, extra_vars, ir_workspace, ir_plugin)

Wait, but the _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin. So in this case, vars_dict would be extra_vars. So the code would pass extra_vars as the second argument.

But maybe the vars_dict is a different variable. However, given the information, this seems like the correct approach.

But wait, the function's docstring says that extra_vars is passed to Ansible as extra-vars. So the --extra-vars is handled in the cli_args. So in the code above, the extra_vars are added as --extra-vars key=value. So the code is correct.

But in the code above, the cli_args includes the --extra-vars entries, so when _run_playbook is called, perhaps the vars_dict is not needed. But the context shows that _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, etc. So maybe the vars_dict is for other variables, but the function's parameters don't mention that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the vars_dict is a combination of other variables, but given the information, the code should proceed as per the parameters.

But since the user's code example shows that _run_playbook is called with cli_args, vars_dict, etc., and the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, perhaps the vars_dict is the extra_vars. 

But in the code above, the extra_vars are already added to cli_args as --extra-vars. So perhaps the vars_dict is not needed. But the context shows that the _run_playbook is called with vars_dict. So maybe the vars_dict is for other variables, but the function's parameters don't mention that. 

This is a bit confusing, but given the information, I'll proceed with the code as written, assuming that the vars_dict is the extra_vars. 

Another thing to consider: the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are passed to _run_playbook. So the code would include them as arguments.

But the function's parameters are ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, etc. So the code would pass them as arguments to _run_playbook.

So the final code would be as written above.

But wait, the function's parameters have extra_vars and ansible_args. The code adds the --extra-vars entries to cli_args, and then passes extra_vars as the vars_dict to _run_playbook. But that might be redundant. However, perhaps the _run_playbook function expects the vars_dict to be passed separately, even though it's already in cli_args. But without knowing the implementation of _run_playbook, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe the vars_dict is not needed, and the code should not pass it. But the context shows that it's part of the call. 

In any case, the user's task is to generate the code for the ansible_playbook function, based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code should construct the cli_args as discussed and call _run_playbook with the appropriate parameters.

Another thing to consider: the function may need to handle the ir_workspace and ir_plugin. For example, maybe the ir_workspace is used to determine the working directory, or to get some variables. But the code as written doesn't use them. However, the function's parameters include them, so they are passed to _run_playbook. 

In conclusion, the code should build the cli_args, handle verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args, then call _run_playbook with cli_args, extra_vars, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin.

Now, considering the imports. The context mentions that the imported packages include 'infrared' and 'ansible'. So the code may need to import those. However, the user's code may already have those imported. But the function's code doesn't need to import them, as they are already imported in the file.

So the final code would be as follows.
