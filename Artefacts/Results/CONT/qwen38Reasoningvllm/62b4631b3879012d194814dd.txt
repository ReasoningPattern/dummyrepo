Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function fix_namespace_prefix_w. The function's purpose is to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=" in the given content. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes 'content' as input. The task is straightforward: replace all occurrences of "w:st=" with "w-st=". But wait, maybe there's more to it? The docstring says to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=", so I should use the string's replace method or a regular expression.

Wait, using the replace method would be simple. For example, content.replace("w:st=", "w-st="). But maybe there are cases where "w:st=" is part of a larger string, and we need to ensure we're not matching substrings. However, the problem statement doesn't mention any such complexities. The example given in the docstring is straightforward.

Alternatively, using regular expressions might be overkill here. Since the replacement is exact, the replace method should suffice. Let me check if there's any reason to use re. For instance, if the replacement needed to be case-insensitive or if there were patterns, but the problem says to replace exactly "w:st=".

So the code would be as simple as returning the content with the replacement. Let me write that.

Wait, the function is supposed to modify the content. So the code would be:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    """
    Replace "w:st=" in content with "w-st=".
    """
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

But wait, the user mentioned imported packages like logging, re, copy. But in this case, we don't need any of them. The replace method is a built-in string method. So the code is simple.

I should make sure that the function is correctly named and that the docstring is properly included. Also, the function doesn't have any parameters other than 'content', which is correct.

Yes, that's all. The code should be as simple as that.
