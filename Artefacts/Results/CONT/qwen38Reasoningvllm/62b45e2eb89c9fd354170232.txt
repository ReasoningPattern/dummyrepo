Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the next_version function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how version numbers typically increment. The function is supposed to take a version string and return the next version following the existing pattern.

First, I should consider the format of the version. Common versioning schemes include semantic versioning (like 1.2.3), which has major, minor, and patch numbers. There's also the possibility of having more parts, like 1.2.3-alpha.1, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume a simple semantic versioning format.

The function needs to parse the version string into its components. For semantic versioning, the parts are separated by dots. So I can split the version string on '.' to get the major, minor, and patch numbers. But I should also check if there's a prerelease tag, like in 1.0.0-alpha.1. However, since the docstring mentions "existing pattern," maybe the input is a simple version without prerelease tags. But to be safe, perhaps I should handle both cases.

Wait, the problem says "following existing pattern," but the context doesn't specify. Since the user hasn't provided examples, I need to make an assumption. Let's proceed with the standard semantic versioning, assuming the version is in the format major.minor.patch. If there's a prerelease part, maybe it's handled differently, but perhaps the function is supposed to increment the patch version and reset the prerelease part if present.

Alternatively, maybe the version is a single number, like "1.2.3" and the next version would be "1.2.4". Or maybe it's a simple increment of the last part. Let me think of possible cases.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Split the version string into parts. For example, "1.2.3" becomes ["1", "2", "3"].
2. Check if there's a prerelease part. For example, "1.2.3-alpha.1" would split into ["1", "2", "3", "alpha.1"].
3. Increment the last part that is a number. If the last part is not a number, maybe it's a prerelease, so increment the patch version and reset the prerelease part.

But without knowing the exact pattern, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given that the function is called next_version, it's likely that the version is in a format where the last part is a number that can be incremented.

So, perhaps the function should split the version into parts, find the last numeric part, increment it, and then reassemble the version string.

But how to handle cases where the version has multiple parts, like "1.2.3.4"?

Alternatively, maybe the version is in the format of major.minor.patch, and the next version is major.minor.patch+1. For example, "1.2.3" becomes "1.2.4".

Another possibility is that the version is a single integer, like "1", and the next version is "2".

But since the function is called next_version, it's more likely to handle semantic versioning. Let me proceed with that approach.

So, the plan is:

- Split the version string into parts using the dot as a separator.
- The last part is the patch version. Increment it by 1.
- If the patch version is something like "alpha", then maybe it's a prerelease, and we need to handle that differently. But perhaps the function is intended to increment the patch version, regardless of prerelease.

Wait, but the problem says "following existing pattern". If the existing pattern is semantic versioning, then the next version would be incrementing the patch version. However, if the version is "1.2.3", the next is "1.2.4". If it's "1.2.3-alpha", then the next could be "1.2.4-alpha" or "1.2.3-alpha.1", depending on the pattern.

But without more context, I'll assume that the version is in the format of major.minor.patch, and the next version is major.minor.patch+1.

So, the steps for the code:

1. Split the version string into parts.
2. Check if the last part is a number. If yes, increment it.
3. If the last part is not a number, maybe it's a prerelease, so increment the patch version and append the prerelease part.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to increment the last numeric part, regardless of other parts. For example, "1.2.3-alpha.1" would become "1.2.4-alpha.1".

But how to parse that? Let's think of splitting on the last dot. For example, split the version into two parts: the main version and the prerelease. For example, "1.2.3-alpha.1" would split into "1.2.3" and "alpha.1". Then, increment the main version's last part, and reattach the prerelease.

But again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's challenging. However, given the function's name and the context, perhaps the intended approach is to increment the last numeric part of the version.

So, the code could be:

- Split the version into parts using the dot as a separator.
- Check if the last part is a number. If yes, increment it.
- If not, then maybe it's a prerelease, and we need to increment the previous numeric part.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to increment the last part regardless of whether it's a number. But that's not safe. For example, "1.2.3-alpha" would become "1.2.4-alpha".

But how to handle that? Let's proceed with the following approach:

Split the version into parts. The last part is the one to increment. If it's a number, increment it. If not, perhaps it's a prerelease, and we need to increment the previous numeric part and reset the prerelease.

But this is getting complicated. Let's look for existing implementations. For example, in semantic versioning, the next version after 1.2.3 is 1.2.4. If there's a prerelease, like 1.2.3-alpha, the next version would be 1.2.4-alpha. However, if the prerelease is part of the version, like 1.2.3-alpha.1, the next version would be 1.2.4-alpha.1.

So, the code could split the version into the main part and the prerelease part. The main part is the part before the last dot, and the prerelease is the part after. Then, increment the main part's last number, and reattach the prerelease.

But how to split that? Let's think of the version as having a main part and an optional prerelease part. The main part is the part before the last dot, and the prerelease is the part after. For example, "1.2.3-alpha.1" would split into "1.2.3" and "alpha.1".

So, the code could:

- Split the version into parts using the dot as a separator.
- Check if the last part contains a hyphen. If so, split into main and prerelease.
- Increment the main part's last number.
- Combine the main part with the prerelease if it exists.

But how to split the main part and the prerelease? For example, "1.2.3-alpha.1" would have the main part as "1.2.3" and the prerelease as "alpha.1".

So, the code could split the version into two parts: the main version and the prerelease. Then, increment the main version's last part, and reattach the prerelease.

But how to handle cases where the version doesn't have a prerelease? For example, "1.2.3" would have no prerelease.

So, the steps:

1. Split the version into parts using the dot as a separator.
2. Check if the last part contains a hyphen. If yes, split into main and prerelease.
3. Increment the main version's last part.
4. Combine the main version with the prerelease if it exists.

But how to split the main and prerelease? For example, in "1.2.3-alpha.1", the main is "1.2.3", and the prerelease is "alpha.1". So, the split is on the first hyphen.

Wait, the prerelease part can contain hyphens, like "alpha.beta.gamma". So, the main part is everything before the first hyphen, and the prerelease is everything after.

So, the code could split the version into two parts: main and prerelease, by splitting on the first hyphen.

But if there's no hyphen, then the prerelease is None.

So, the code:

version_parts = version.split('-')
main_version = version_parts[0]
prerelease = version_parts[1] if len(version_parts) > 1 else None

Then, split the main_version into its components.

But the main_version could be in the format of major.minor.patch. So, split that into parts again.

So:

main_parts = main_version.split('.')

Then, increment the last part of main_parts.

But how to increment it? For example, if it's a string, convert to integer, add 1, then convert back to string.

But what if the last part is not a number? Like "1.2.3-alpha" (but that would have been split into main_version "1.2.3" and prerelease "alpha").

So, in that case, the main_parts would be ["1", "2", "3"], and incrementing the last part to 4, resulting in "1.2.4".

So, the code for the main version:

main_parts = main_version.split('.')
last_part = main_parts[-1]
if last_part.isdigit():
    new_last_part = str(int(last_part) + 1)
else:
    # handle cases where the last part is not a number, maybe it's a prerelease?
    # but in this case, the main version is supposed to be numeric, so this shouldn't happen
    # so perhaps raise an error or assume it's a number
    new_last_part = last_part

Wait, but in the main version, the parts are supposed to be numeric. So, the main_parts should all be numbers. So, the last part is a number, and we can increment it.

So, the code would be:

main_parts = main_version.split('.')
last_part = main_parts[-1]
new_last_part = str(int(last_part) + 1)
new_main_version = '.'.join(main_parts[:-1] + [new_last_part])

Then, if there's a prerelease, combine it with the new_main_version.

So, the final version is new_main_version + ('-' + prerelease) if prerelease exists.

Putting it all together:

def next_version(version):
    version_parts = version.split('-')
    main_version = version_parts[0]
    prerelease = version_parts[1] if len(version_parts) > 1 else None

    main_parts = main_version.split('.')
    last_part = main_parts[-1]
    new_last_part = str(int(last_part) + 1)
    new_main_version = '.'.join(main_parts[:-1] + [new_last_part])

    if prerelease:
        return f"{new_main_version}-{prerelease}"
    else:
        return new_main_version

But wait, what if the version is something like "1.2.3.4"? Then, splitting on '.' gives ["1", "2", "3", "4"], and incrementing the last part to 5, resulting in "1.2.3.5".

Yes, that would work.

Testing some cases:

Case 1: "1.2.3" → "1.2.4"

Case 2: "1.2.3-alpha" → "1.2.4-alpha"

Case 3: "1.2.3-alpha.1" → "1.2.4-alpha.1"

Case 4: "1.2.3.4" → "1.2.3.5"

Case 5: "1.2.3.4.5" → "1.2.3.4.6"

Case 6: "1.2.3.4-alpha" → "1.2.3.5-alpha"

This seems to handle the cases.

But what about versions with more than three parts? Like "1.2.3.4.5.6"? The code would increment the last part regardless of how many parts there are.

But the function's docstring says "following existing pattern", so the code assumes that the version is in a format where the last part is a number that can be incremented.

But what if the version is something like "1.2.3.4-alpha.1"? Then, the main_version is "1.2.3.4", and the prerelease is "alpha.1". The code would increment the main_version's last part to 5, resulting in "1.2.3.5-alpha.1".

Yes.

But what if the version is "1.2.3.4.5-alpha.1"? Then, main_version is "1.2.3.4.5", and the prerelease is "alpha.1". Incrementing the last part of the main_version to 6, resulting in "1.2.3.4.6-alpha.1".

Yes.

So, this code should handle those cases.

Now, considering the context given: the user mentioned imported packages like re, sys, pyfs, fs, namaste. But the code doesn't need to use them, as the function can be implemented with standard string operations.

So, the code would be as above.

But I need to make sure that the function is named next_version and has the given docstring.

So, the final code would be:

def next_version(version):
    """
    Given next version identifier following existing pattern
    """
    version_parts = version.split('-')
    main_version = version_parts[0]
    prerelease = version_parts[1] if len(version_parts) > 1 else None

    main_parts = main_version.split('.')
    last_part = main_parts[-1]
    new_last_part = str(int(last_part) + 1)
    new_main_version = '.'.join(main_parts[:-1] + [new_last_part])

    if prerelease:
        return f"{new_main_version}-{prerelease}"
    else:
        return new_main_version

But wait, what if the version is "1.2.3.4.5.6.7"? The code would split into main_parts as ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"], increment the last part to 8, and return "1.2.3.4.5.6.8".

Yes.

Another edge case: version is "0.0.0" → returns "0.0.1".

Another edge case: version is "1.0.0" → "1.0.1".

What if the version is "1.0.0.0"? → "1.0.0.1".

Yes.

But what if the version is "1.0.0.0.0"? → "1.0.0.0.1".

Yes.

So, this code should handle all those cases.

But what about versions with leading zeros? Like "1.00.00"? The code would increment the last part, so "1.00.01".

But that's acceptable as per the function's requirement.

So, the code seems correct.
