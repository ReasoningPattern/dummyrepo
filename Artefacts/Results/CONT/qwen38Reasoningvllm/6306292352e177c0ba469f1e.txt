Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function process_text_links based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to process links in text, adding attributes and linkifying textual links. The context mentions importing urllib, re, and bleach. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function needs to find links in the text. Regular expressions are probably needed here. The re module is available, so I'll use that. Maybe look for URLs using a regex pattern. But what's a good pattern for URLs? Something like http:// or https://, followed by domain and path.

Then, for each link found, I need to add some attributes. Maybe attributes like target="_blank" or rel="noopener"? Also, linkifying means converting the text into HTML anchor tags. So, replacing the URL with <a href="...">text</a>.

Wait, but the docstring says "adding some attributes" — perhaps the function is supposed to modify the links in some way, maybe sanitize them using bleach? The bleach module is imported, so maybe it's used to clean the HTML.

But the function's purpose is to process links in text. So perhaps the steps are: find all URLs in the text, wrap them in anchor tags with certain attributes, and then maybe sanitize the resulting HTML.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Use re.findall to find all URLs in the text. The regex pattern could be something like r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\(\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+'

2. For each URL found, create an anchor tag with the href attribute set to the URL. Maybe add attributes like target="_blank" and rel="noopener" for security.

3. Replace the original URL in the text with the generated anchor tag.

But wait, the original text might have the URL as part of the text, like "Check this link: https://example.com". So the regex should find the URL and replace it with the anchor tag.

However, using re.sub with a function to replace each match. So, the code could be:

import re
import urllib.parse
import bleach

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    def replace_link(match):
        url = match.group(0)
        # Sanitize the URL?
        # Maybe use bleach to clean the URL?
        # Or just wrap it in an anchor tag
        # Add attributes like target and rel
        return f'<a href="{urllib.parse.quote(url)}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{url}</a>'
    
    # Regex pattern for URLs
    url_pattern = re.compile(r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\(\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+')
    processed_text = url_pattern.sub(replace_link, text)
    # Maybe sanitize the processed text with bleach?
    # But bleach is for cleaning HTML, maybe not necessary here
    # Or perhaps the function is supposed to return the processed text with links
    return processed_text

Wait, but the user mentioned importing urllib, re, and bleach. So maybe the bleach is used to sanitize the HTML. But in the current code, we're not using bleach. Maybe the function is supposed to sanitize the text after processing links. Or maybe the links are being sanitized.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the text, process the links, and then sanitize the entire text with bleach. But the docstring says "adding some attributes and linkifying textual links", so maybe the main task is to create the links, and bleach is used for other sanitization.

But the code as written would replace all URLs with anchor tags. However, the regex might not be perfect. For example, it might not handle all possible URLs correctly. Also, using urllib.parse.quote on the URL to encode it properly.

Wait, but in the replace_link function, the URL is being quoted. That's probably a good idea to handle special characters in the URL.

But maybe the bleach is used to clean the text. For example, if the text has other HTML tags, but the function is supposed to process links. However, the function's purpose is to process links, so perhaps the bleach isn't needed here. Unless the function is supposed to sanitize the entire text, but the docstring isn't clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger system where bleach is used to clean the HTML after linkification. But without more context, it's hard to say. The user's context says that the packages are imported, so perhaps the code should use bleach in some way.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to sanitize the text, but the main task is to process the links. So perhaps the code uses bleach to clean the text after replacing the links. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the text, process the links into HTML, and then sanitize the entire text with bleach. For example, if the text has other HTML tags that need to be cleaned.

But the docstring says "processing links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links." So the main task is to convert textual links into HTML anchors with attributes. The bleach might be used for other sanitization, but perhaps not in this function.

In that case, the code would be as I outlined before. However, the user's context says that the packages are imported, so the code should include those imports. But the function's code would need to use them.

Wait, the user's context says: "Imported Packages: typing urllib re bleach" — so the code should import those. But the function is part of a file where those are already imported. So the code doesn't need to include the import statements, just use them.

So, the code would use re for regex, urllib for parsing URLs, and bleach for sanitizing.

But in the code I wrote earlier, I didn't use bleach. Maybe the function is supposed to sanitize the text after processing links. For example, if the text has other HTML tags, but the function is supposed to process links and then clean the text.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to process the text, replace links, and then sanitize the entire text with bleach. But that's not clear. Let me think again.

The function's purpose is to process links in text. So, the main action is to find URLs and convert them into anchor tags. The bleach might be used to sanitize the resulting HTML, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the text, process the links into HTML, and then use bleach to clean the HTML. For example, if the text has other HTML tags that need to be sanitized.

But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the user's context says that the packages are imported, so perhaps the code should use bleach. Maybe the function is supposed to sanitize the text after processing links. For example, if the text has other HTML tags, but the function is supposed to process links and then clean the text.

But the function's docstring doesn't mention sanitizing. So maybe the code doesn't need to use bleach. But the user's context says that the packages are imported, so perhaps the code should include bleach in some way.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use bleach to clean the text before processing links. But that's not clear.

In the absence of more information, perhaps the code should focus on processing the links into HTML anchors with attributes, using re and urllib. The bleach might not be needed here. However, the user's context includes it, so maybe it's part of the solution.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take the text, process the links into HTML, and then use bleach to clean the resulting HTML. For example, if the text has other HTML tags that need to be sanitized.

But the function's name is process_text_links, so perhaps the main task is to process the links. Let me proceed with the code that uses re and urllib to replace URLs with anchor tags, and maybe use bleach to sanitize the entire text.

But how? Let's think: after replacing the URLs with anchor tags, the text may contain HTML. So, maybe we need to sanitize it with bleach. For example, if the text has other HTML tags that should be removed.

So, the code could be:

import re
import urllib.parse
import bleach

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    def replace_link(match):
        url = match.group(0)
        # Sanitize the URL?
        # Maybe use bleach to clean the URL?
        # Or just wrap it in an anchor tag
        # Add attributes like target and rel
        return f'<a href="{urllib.parse.quote(url)}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{url}</a>'
    
    # Regex pattern for URLs
    url_pattern = re.compile(r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\(\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+')
    processed_text = url_pattern.sub(replace_link, text)
    # Sanitize the processed text with bleach
    # Maybe allow only certain tags and attributes
    # For example, allow anchor tags with href, target, and rel
    # But bleach's clean function can be used here
    # However, the default bleach settings may not allow anchor tags
    # So we need to configure bleach to allow them
    # But this is getting complicated
    # Maybe the function is supposed to return the processed text with links
    # So the bleach is not used here
    return processed_text

But in this case, the bleach isn't used. However, the user's context says that the packages are imported, so perhaps the code should use bleach. Maybe the function is supposed to sanitize the text after processing links. For example, if the text has other HTML tags that need to be cleaned.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to process the text, replace links, and then sanitize the entire text with bleach. For example:

processed_text = bleach.clean(processed_text, tags=['a'], attributes={'a': ['href', 'target', 'rel']}, protocols=['http', 'https'])

But this would allow anchor tags with those attributes. However, the function's purpose is to process links, so maybe this is necessary.

So, integrating that into the code:

import re
import urllib.parse
import bleach

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    def replace_link(match):
        url = match.group(0)
        # Sanitize the URL?
        # Maybe use bleach to clean the URL?
        # Or just wrap it in an anchor tag
        # Add attributes like target and rel
        return f'<a href="{urllib.parse.quote(url)}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{url}</a>'
    
    # Regex pattern for URLs
    url_pattern = re.compile(r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\(\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+')
    processed_text = url_pattern.sub(replace_link, text)
    # Sanitize the processed text with bleach
    # Allow anchor tags with href, target, and rel
    # And allow http and https protocols
    processed_text = bleach.clean(processed_text, tags=['a'], attributes={'a': ['href', 'target', 'rel']}, protocols=['http', 'https'])
    return processed_text

This way, the function processes the links into anchor tags with attributes, then sanitizes the entire text with bleach to ensure only allowed tags and attributes are present.

But the docstring doesn't mention sanitizing, so maybe this is overcomplicating. However, given that bleach is imported, it's possible that the code is supposed to use it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to sanitize the URLs before linking. For example, using bleach to clean the URL. But that's not typical.

In any case, the user's main request is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says to add attributes and linkify textual links. So the main task is to find URLs and replace them with anchor tags with attributes.

So the code should focus on that. The bleach may or may not be used, but given that it's imported, perhaps it's part of the solution. However, without more context, it's safer to focus on the main task.

So, the final code would use re to find URLs, replace them with anchor tags, and maybe use urllib to encode the URL. The bleach may not be used here unless required.

But the user's context says that the packages are imported, so the code should use them. However, the function's purpose is to process links, not to sanitize. So perhaps the code doesn't need to use bleach.

In that case, the code would be as follows:

import re
import urllib.parse

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    def replace_link(match):
        url = match.group(0)
        return f'<a href="{urllib.parse.quote(url)}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{url}</a>'
    
    url_pattern = re.compile(r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\(\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+')
    return url_pattern.sub(replace_link, text)

But the user's context says that bleach is imported. However, the function's code may not need to use it. Unless the function is supposed to sanitize the text after processing links. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code that uses re and urllib to process the links, and include the bleach import as per the context, even if it's not used. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to include explanations. So the code should use the imported packages as needed.

Wait, the user's context says that the packages are imported, but the code should not include the import statements. The code is to be generated within the file, so the imports are already present. So the code can use the modules.

In that case, the code would use re, urllib, and bleach. But how?

Maybe the function is supposed to use bleach to clean the text. For example, if the text has other HTML tags that need to be removed. But the function's purpose is to process links, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, the function could be part of a larger system where bleach is used for sanitization. But without more context, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code that uses re and urllib to process the links into anchor tags, and include the bleach import as per the context, even if it's not used. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code should focus on that.

Thus, the final code would be as follows, using re and urllib to find and replace links, adding attributes like target and rel.
