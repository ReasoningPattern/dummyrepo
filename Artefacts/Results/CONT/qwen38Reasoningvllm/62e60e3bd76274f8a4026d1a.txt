Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the from_raw_values method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do.

The method is part of a class, probably called Bookmarks, since the docstring mentions creating a Bookmarks object. The function takes a list of raw bookmark string values. So the goal is to process these strings and create a Bookmarks instance.

First, I should consider how the raw values are structured. Maybe each string represents a bookmark with some fields, like title, URL, etc. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's say each raw value is a string that can be split into parts. For example, maybe each bookmark is a line with title and URL separated by a comma.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided specifics. Hmm. Since the original code isn't given, I need to make reasonable assumptions. Let's assume that each raw value is a string that needs to be parsed into a bookmark object. Maybe the Bookmarks class has a method to parse each string, or perhaps the from_raw_values method processes the list into a list of bookmarks.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class is a collection of bookmarks, and from_raw_values initializes it from a list of strings. For example, each string could be a JSON string representing a bookmark, or a tuple split by a delimiter.

Since the user hasn't provided details, I'll have to create a plausible implementation. Let's assume that each raw value is a string that can be split into parts. For example, if each bookmark is represented as "title,url", then splitting by commas would give the components.

But how does the Bookmarks class store these? Maybe it's a list of bookmark objects. So the from_raw_values method would process each string in the values list, split it into parts, and create a bookmark object for each, then collect them into a Bookmarks instance.

Wait, but the method is a class method (since it's using cls). So perhaps the Bookmarks class has an __init__ method that takes a list of bookmarks, and from_raw_values creates that list from the raw values.

So the steps would be:

1. Iterate over each value in the values list.
2. Parse each value into a bookmark (maybe split into parts).
3. Create a bookmark object (maybe using another class or a dictionary).
4. Collect all bookmarks into a list.
5. Return a new Bookmarks instance with that list.

But without knowing the exact structure, I need to make assumptions. Let's say that each raw value is a string like "Title,URL", and the Bookmarks class has an __init__ that takes a list of such bookmarks. So the from_raw_values method would split each string into parts and create a list of tuples or objects.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class is a list itself, and from_raw_values initializes it by processing the raw values.

Let me draft some code. For example:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    """
    Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
    """
    bookmarks = []
    for value in values:
        # Assuming each value is split by comma into title and URL
        parts = value.split(',')
        if len(parts) == 2:
            title, url = parts
            bookmarks.append({'title': title, 'url': url})
    return cls(bookmarks)

But then the Bookmarks class would need to accept a list of bookmarks in its __init__. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition. Since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps the Bookmarks class is a list-like structure, and from_raw_values creates it.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class has a method to parse each raw value. But again, without more info, I have to make assumptions.

Another approach: Maybe the Bookmarks class is a list of Bookmark objects, and from_raw_values creates a list of Bookmark instances from the raw strings. So, if there's a Bookmark class, each raw value is parsed into a Bookmark instance.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the Bookmarks class is a list, and from_raw_values returns a list of parsed bookmarks.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class is a dataclass or a custom class that can be initialized with a list of raw values.

Wait, the function is a class method, so it's likely that the Bookmarks class has an __init__ that takes a list of bookmarks. So the from_raw_values method would process the raw values into a list of bookmarks and then call the __init__.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, I need to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the example where each raw value is split into title and URL, and the Bookmarks class is initialized with a list of dictionaries.

So the code would be:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    """
    Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
    """
    bookmarks = []
    for value in values:
        title, url = value.split(',')
        bookmarks.append({'title': title, 'url': url})
    return cls(bookmarks)

But the user might expect that the Bookmarks class has an __init__ that takes a list of bookmarks. So the code would work if the class is defined as:

class Bookmarks:
    def __init__(self, bookmarks):
        self.bookmarks = bookmarks

But since the user hasn't provided that, I have to assume that the class is structured in a way that this method works.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class is a list itself, and from_raw_values returns a list. But the method is a class method, so it's more likely to return an instance of the class.

Another possibility: The raw values are JSON strings, and each is parsed into a dictionary. So:

import json

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    """
    Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
    """
    bookmarks = [json.loads(value) for value in values]
    return cls(bookmarks)

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values." So the method should process the list of strings into a Bookmarks instance.

Assuming that each raw value is a string that can be split into parts, and the Bookmarks class is initialized with a list of those parsed parts. So the code would split each string and collect them.

So the final code would be something like:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    """
    Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
    """
    bookmarks = []
    for value in values:
        title, url = value.split(',')
        bookmarks.append({'title': title, 'url': url})
    return cls(bookmarks)

But perhaps the Bookmarks class expects a different structure. However, given the lack of information, this seems like a reasonable approach. The user might have a specific structure in mind, but without more details, this is a plausible implementation.
