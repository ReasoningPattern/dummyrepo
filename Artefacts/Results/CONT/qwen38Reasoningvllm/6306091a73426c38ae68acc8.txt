Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called list_of_file_names, and it takes settings_dirs and spec_option as parameters. The docstring mentions creating and returning a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it's related to creating an IniType complex type using cli.ListOfFileNames(). So maybe the function is supposed to process some directories and a specification option to generate a list of file names, which are then used to create this IniType object.

Looking at the imported packages: os, pytest, infrared. The os module is for interacting with the operating system, like file operations. The other packages might be for testing or specific functionalities, but the main thing here is os.

The function parameters are settings_dirs, which is probably a list of directory paths, and spec_option, which might be a string or some option that determines how files are selected. The goal is to create a list of file names based on these directories and the spec option, then return an IniType object from cli.ListOfFileNames().

Wait, the docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So maybe the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with some arguments, and those arguments are derived from settings_dirs and spec_option. But how?

Perhaps the function is supposed to collect all files in the settings_dirs that match a certain pattern based on spec_option. For example, if spec_option is a file extension, it would collect all files with that extension in the directories provided.

But the exact logic isn't specified. The user hasn't provided detailed requirements beyond the docstring. However, since the function is supposed to return an IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(), maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names and then pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames() to create the IniType object.

So the steps would be:

1. Process the settings_dirs and spec_option to get a list of file names.
2. Pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames() to create the IniType object.
3. Return that object.

But how to process the directories and spec_option? Since the user hasn't provided specifics, maybe the function is supposed to collect all files in the given directories, perhaps with a specific pattern. For example, if spec_option is a pattern like '*.ini', then collect all .ini files in the settings_dirs.

Alternatively, maybe the spec_option is a parameter that determines the type of files to include, and the function is supposed to gather all files in the directories that match that spec.

But without more details, I have to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the function is supposed to collect all files in the settings_dirs (which is a list of directories) that match a certain pattern based on spec_option. For example, if spec_option is 'config', then look for config files.

Alternatively, maybe the spec_option is a string that's part of the filename, or a specific extension.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to generate a list of file names by combining the directories and the spec_option. For example, if settings_dirs is a list of directories, and spec_option is a filename, then the full path would be os.path.join(dir, spec_option) for each dir in settings_dirs.

But that's just a guess. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I need to make an educated guess based on the given information.

Another approach: the function's name is list_of_file_names, so it's supposed to return a list of file names. But the docstring says it's supposed to create and return an IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So perhaps the function is supposed to generate a list of file names, then pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames() to create the IniType object.

So the code would look something like:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    # process to get list of file names
    file_names = [...]  # logic here
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(file_names)

But how to get the file_names? Let's think. If settings_dirs is a list of directories, and spec_option is a pattern, then maybe we can use os.listdir() to get files in each directory and filter based on the spec_option.

For example:

import os

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    file_names = []
    for dir in settings_dirs:
        if os.path.isdir(dir):
            for filename in os.listdir(dir):
                if spec_option in filename:
                    file_names.append(os.path.join(dir, filename))
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(file_names)

But this is just one possibility. However, the user hasn't provided specifics, so this is an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the spec_option is a specific extension, like '.ini', and we need to collect all files with that extension.

But again, without more info, it's hard to say. However, given that the function is supposed to return an IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(), the code would need to call that function with the appropriate arguments.

Another possibility is that the spec_option is a parameter that determines the type of files to include, and the function is supposed to collect all files in the settings_dirs that match that spec.

But since the user hasn't provided detailed specs, I'll have to proceed with the most straightforward approach. Let's assume that the function is supposed to collect all files in the directories provided in settings_dirs, and the spec_option is a pattern that the filenames must match. Then, the code would process each directory, list the files, filter them based on the spec_option, and then pass the resulting list to cli.ListOfFileNames().

So the code would be:

import os

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    file_names = []
    for dir in settings_dirs:
        if os.path.isdir(dir):
            for filename in os.listdir(dir):
                if spec_option in filename:
                    file_names.append(os.path.join(dir, filename))
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(file_names)

But wait, the user mentioned that the function is supposed to create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So the cli module must have a class or function named ListOfFileNames. Assuming that cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes a list of file names and returns an IniType object.

But the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of cli.ListOfFileNames, so we can't know for sure. However, the code would need to call that function with the list of file names.

Another thing to consider: the function parameters. The settings_dirs is probably a list of directory paths, and spec_option is a string that's used to filter the files. So the code would process each directory in settings_dirs, collect the files that match the spec_option, and then pass them to cli.ListOfFileNames().

So putting it all together, the code would be as above. But the user also mentioned that the imported packages are os, pytest, infrared. So the code would need to import os, but the other packages might not be necessary here.

Wait, the user says "Imported Packages: os pytest infrared" â€” so the code should import these. However, the function's code may not need all of them. For example, os is needed for directory operations, pytest and infrared might be for testing or other functionalities, but in the function's code, perhaps only os is used.

So the code would start with importing os, but the user's code may have already imported these packages. However, the function's code may not need to import them again. But since the user says "Within file: " and "Within class: ", perhaps the code is part of a class, but the user hasn't specified that.

In any case, the code would need to use os.path functions. So the code would be:

import os

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    file_names = []
    for dir in settings_dirs:
        if os.path.isdir(dir):
            for filename in os.listdir(dir):
                if spec_option in filename:
                    file_names.append(os.path.join(dir, filename))
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(file_names)

But the user's docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames(), which is probably a function that takes the list of file names and returns the IniType object.

But the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of cli.ListOfFileNames, so we can't know for sure. However, the code would need to call that function with the list of file names.

Another possible approach: maybe the spec_option is a parameter that determines the type of files to include, and the function is supposed to collect all files in the directories that match the spec_option. For example, if spec_option is 'config', then collect all config files.

But again, without more info, this is just a guess.

In conclusion, the generated code would process the directories and spec_option to collect file names, then call cli.ListOfFileNames with that list.
