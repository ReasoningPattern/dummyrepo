Okay, I need to create a Python function called os_is_mac that checks if the operating system is macOS. The function should return True if it's macOS, else False. The user mentioned using the os module, so I should look into that.

Hmm, how do I check the OS in Python? Oh right, the os module has a function called uname() which returns system information. On macOS, the uname system name is 'Darwin'. So maybe I can check the system name from uname.

Wait, but sometimes people might use different methods. Like, maybe checking the platform module? But the user specified to use the os module. So stick with os.

So the steps would be: import os, then call os.uname().sysname. Then check if that string is 'Darwin'. If yes, return True, else False.

Wait, but what about other systems? For example, Linux also uses 'Linux' as the sysname. So this check should specifically look for 'Darwin' to identify macOS.

So the code would be something like:

import os

def os_is_mac():
    return os.uname().sysname == 'Darwin'

Wait, but what if the os module doesn't have uname? Wait, os.uname() is available on Unix-like systems. But on Windows, os.uname() would raise an AttributeError. But the function is supposed to check for macOS, which isn't Windows. So maybe the function is only intended to run on Unix-like systems. But the user might call this function on Windows, which could cause an error. However, the problem says to check if the OS is macOS, so perhaps the function is designed to be used in an environment where it's expected to be on a Unix-like system. Alternatively, maybe we should handle that case.

But the user's docstring says to return False if it's not macOS. So on Windows, the function would raise an error. But maybe the user expects that the function is only called on systems where it's relevant. Alternatively, maybe we should handle it by catching the exception. But the problem doesn't mention handling that. The user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which doesn't mention error handling. So perhaps the code should just check os.uname().sysname == 'Darwin'.

So the code would be:

import os

def os_is_mac():
    """
    Checks if the os is macOS

    :return: bool, True if macOS, otherwise False.
    """
    return os.uname().sysname == 'Darwin'

Wait, but the user's code has the function inside a class? No, the context says "Within class: " which is empty. So the function is at the top level.

But the user's code has the function definition, and the imported packages are os. So the code should import os, then define the function.

So the code is as above. Let me test this. On a macOS system, os.uname().sysname should be 'Darwin'. So the function returns True. On other systems, like Linux, it returns False. On Windows, it would raise an error, but the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that. So the code is correct as per the given instructions.
