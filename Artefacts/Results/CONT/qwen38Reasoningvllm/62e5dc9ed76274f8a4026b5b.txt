Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called deprecated that takes a message. The decorator should issue a deprecation warning when a function is called. Let me think about how to do this.

First, I remember that Python's warnings module can be used to generate warnings. The deprecation_warn function is mentioned in the context, so maybe that's the one to use. The deprecation_warn function probably takes a message and a stack level. The stack_level is important to ensure the warning points to the correct location, like the caller of the deprecated function.

So, the decorator should wrap the original function. When the function is called, it should first trigger the warning. Then, it should proceed to call the original function. But how to handle the stack level? The stack_level parameter in deprecation_warn might need to be set to 2 or 3 to skip the decorator and the function itself. Wait, the stack_level in warnings.warn is the number of stack frames to go up. So if the decorator is one level, maybe stack_level=2 would point to the actual call site.

Wait, the deprecation_warn function in the context has parameters (message, stack_level). So when using it, I need to pass the message and the stack_level. So in the decorator, when applying the warning, I should call deprecation_warn with the provided message and the appropriate stack_level.

So the steps are:

1. Create a decorator function that takes the original function.
2. When the decorated function is called, trigger the deprecation warning using deprecation_warn with the given message and stack_level.
3. Then, call the original function and return its result.

But how to determine the stack_level? The stack_level should be set so that the warning points to the caller of the deprecated function. For example, if the decorator is applied to a function, then when that function is called, the warning should be issued with stack_level=2, because the first frame is the decorator, then the function itself, and then the caller. Wait, maybe stack_level=2 would make the warning point to the caller. Let me think: when you call a decorated function, the stack is:

- The caller (the one who called the decorated function)
- The decorated function (the one being called)
- The decorator's wrapper function (the one that's executing the warning)

So, to get the stack_level to point to the caller, we need to set stack_level=2. Because the first frame is the caller, then the decorated function, then the wrapper. Wait, maybe stack_level=2 would make the warning show the caller's line. So when using deprecation_warn, passing stack_level=2 would be correct.

So, in the decorator, when we call deprecation_warn, we need to pass the message and stack_level=2. But wait, the deprecation_warn function is defined elsewhere, so the decorator will use that function.

Putting this together, the decorator would look like this:

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            deprecation_warn(message, stack_level=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the function signature of deprecated is given as def deprecated(message):, which returns a decorator. So the code above is correct.

But wait, the context mentions that there's a function called deprecation_warn(message, stack_level). So the code should import that function. However, the user mentioned that the imported packages include warnings, sys, functools, tracemalloc, asyncio. But the deprecation_warn is within the file, so it's available.

So the code for the deprecated decorator would be as above. Also, need to make sure that the decorator is properly applied. For example, when someone uses @deprecated("message"), it should wrap the function.

Another thing to consider: the original function's __name__ and other attributes might be lost. To preserve them, maybe use functools.wraps. But the context includes functools as an imported package, so we can use that.

So modifying the code:

from functools import wraps

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            deprecation_warn(message, stack_level=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But the user's code might not have the 'from functools import wraps' line, but since the context says that 'functools' is imported, perhaps it's available. However, the user's code may not have that import. Wait, the context says "Imported Packages: warnings sys functools tracemalloc asyncio", so the code has access to functools. So the code can use wraps.

But the user's code may not have the import statement. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring, and the context. So the code should include the necessary imports? Wait, the user says "Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the code generated needs to be self-contained. However, the context says that the imported packages are already available. So perhaps the code doesn't need to include the import statements for those modules. But the code may need to use the deprecation_warn function, which is defined in the same file.

So the code for the deprecated function would be as follows, using the deprecation_warn function from the same file.

So the final code would be:

def deprecated(message):
    """
    Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            deprecation_warn(message, stack_level=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the docstring is provided, so the code should include that. The user's function signature includes the docstring. So the code should have the docstring as given.

But the user's code may need to use the stack_level parameter correctly. Let me check the stack_level again. The stack_level in the deprecation_warn function is probably set to 2 to avoid pointing to the decorator itself. For example, when the decorated function is called, the stack frames are:

1. The caller of the decorated function
2. The decorated function
3. The wrapper function (the one in the decorator)

So, when issuing the warning, the stack_level should be 2 to point to the caller. Therefore, passing stack_level=2 is correct.

So the code should be as above. Also, the function uses deprecation_warn, which is defined elsewhere in the same file. So the code is correct.
