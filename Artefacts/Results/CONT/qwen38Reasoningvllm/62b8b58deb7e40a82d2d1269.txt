Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function 'directlyProvidedBy(object)' based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it returns the interfaces directly provided by the given object, and the value is an IDeclaration. From the context, there are several other functions like 'providedBy' and 'directlyProvides' mentioned. Also, the imported packages include 'zope.interface', which suggests that this is related to Zope's interface system.

In Zope's interface system, objects can provide interfaces. The 'providedBy' function typically returns all interfaces provided by an object, including those inherited from base classes. But 'directlyProvidedBy' should return only the interfaces directly provided by the object, not through inheritance.

Looking at the context, there's a function called 'directlyProvides(object)' which might be related. Also, there's a mention of 'ObjectSpecification' and 'providedBy(ob)'. Maybe the 'directlyProvidedBy' function is similar to 'providedBy' but only includes directly provided interfaces.

In Zope's code, the 'providedBy' function checks the object's __provides__ attribute, which is a list of interfaces. However, for classes, it might also check the class's __dict__ for 'provides' or similar attributes. Wait, perhaps the function needs to look at the object's __class__ and check the interfaces it directly implements.

Alternatively, considering the functions like 'classImplements' and 'classProvides', which are part of the Zope interface implementation. The 'directlyProvidedBy' might be using the 'providedBy' function but filtering out inherited interfaces.

Wait, the context shows that 'directlyProvidedBy' is already in the list of functions. So maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces directly provided by the object, which could be found by checking the object's __provides__ attribute, or by looking into the class's __dict__ for 'provides' or similar.

But how to implement this? Let me think. In Zope, when an object provides an interface, it's usually through the 'provides' attribute. For example, when you use 'provides' in a class, it adds the interface to the class's __provides__ attribute. So for an instance, the provided interfaces might be found by checking the instance's __class__ and then the __provides__ attribute.

Wait, perhaps the function 'directlyProvidedBy' is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly provided by the object's class, not inherited. So for a class, it would check the interfaces specified in the class's 'provides' or similar, and for an instance, it would check the interfaces provided by the class it's an instance of.

Alternatively, maybe the function is using the 'providedBy' function but with some modification. Wait, the 'providedBy' function in Zope returns all interfaces provided by the object, including those from base classes. So 'directlyProvidedBy' would need to return only those interfaces that are directly provided by the object's class, not inherited.

So, perhaps the code for 'directlyProvidedBy' is similar to 'providedBy', but it filters out the interfaces that are inherited. How is that done? Maybe by checking the object's class and looking at the interfaces that are directly specified there.

Looking at the context, there's a function called 'implementedBy(cls)' which returns the interfaces implemented by the class. So maybe 'directlyProvidedBy' is using that. For an object, the class is obtained via 'object.__class__', and then 'implementedBy' is called on that class. But wait, 'implementedBy' returns the interfaces implemented by the class, which would include those directly provided and inherited. So that's not exactly what we need.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'directlyProvidedBy' function is using the 'providedBy' function but with a check to exclude inherited interfaces. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is using the 'providedBy' function but only considering the interfaces that are directly provided by the object's class. For example, for an instance, the directly provided interfaces would be those specified in the class's 'provides' attribute, not those from parent classes.

Wait, in Zope's code, the 'providedBy' function for an instance would check the instance's __class__ and then look for interfaces provided by that class. But if the class inherits from another class that provides an interface, then that interface would be included. So to get only the directly provided interfaces, perhaps we need to look at the class's __dict__ for 'provides' or similar, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the function 'directlyProvidedBy' is implemented by checking the object's __class__ and then using the 'implementedBy' function on that class, but only considering the interfaces that are directly implemented by the class, not inherited. But how to do that?

Looking at the context, there's a function called 'classImplementsOnly(cls)' which might return the interfaces directly implemented by the class. So perhaps 'directlyProvidedBy' is using that. For example, for an object, get its class, then call 'classImplementsOnly' on that class, which returns the directly implemented interfaces.

So putting it all together, the 'directlyProvidedBy' function would take an object, get its class, then call 'classImplementsOnly' on that class, and return the result. But wait, the function signature says it returns an IDeclaration, which is a zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration. So perhaps the function is returning the interfaces as a declaration.

Alternatively, maybe the function is using the 'providedBy' function but with a modification. Let me think about the code structure.

In Zope's code, the 'providedBy' function is implemented by checking the object's __provides__ attribute, which is a list of interfaces. For classes, it might check the class's __dict__ for 'provides' or similar. However, for directly provided interfaces, perhaps we need to look at the interfaces that are explicitly declared in the class, not inherited.

So, for the function 'directlyProvidedBy', the code could be:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    from zope.interface import InterfaceClass
    if isinstance(object, InterfaceClass):
        return InterfaceClass
    else:
        # Get the class of the object
        cls = object.__class__
        # Get the interfaces directly provided by the class
        return classImplementsOnly(cls)

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the function is using the 'providedBy' function but filtering out the inherited interfaces. However, without seeing the actual implementation, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is using the 'providedBy' function but with a check to only include interfaces that are directly provided by the object's class. For example:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    from zope.interface import providedBy
    return providedBy(object).direct

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the function is implemented by checking the object's __class__ and then using the 'implementedBy' function on that class. For example:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    from zope.interface import implementedBy
    return implementedBy(object.__class__)

But again, this is just a guess. Given the context, there's a function called 'implementedBy(cls)' which returns the interfaces implemented by the class. So perhaps 'directlyProvidedBy' is using that.

But the function signature says it returns an IDeclaration. So perhaps the code is:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    from zope.interface import implementedBy
    return implementedBy(object.__class__)

But I'm not entirely certain. However, given the context and the function names, this seems plausible. So the code would import 'implementedBy' from 'zope.interface' and return it applied to the object's class.
