Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called cachedmethod that uses a cache. The function signature is given as def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None): and it returns a decorator. The docstring mentions that it returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.

First, I should understand what the parameters mean. The 'cache' parameter is probably a dictionary or some caching structure. The 'key' parameter defaults to hashkey, which I assume is a function that generates a key based on the method's arguments. The 'lock' parameter is optional, maybe for thread safety.

The decorator needs to check if the result is already in the cache. If it is, return it. If not, compute it, store it in the cache, and then return it. But since it's a method, the arguments would include 'self' and the arguments passed to the method.

Wait, the decorator is for a method, so when the method is called, the arguments include 'self' and the parameters. The key function should generate a unique key based on these arguments. The default key is hashkey, which I need to define. Maybe hashkey is a function that takes the arguments and returns a hashable type, like a tuple of the arguments excluding 'self'?

So, the decorator will take a method, and when it's called, it will generate a key using the key function, check the cache, and if not present, compute the result and store it.

Also, there's a lock parameter. If provided, the decorator should acquire the lock before accessing the cache to prevent race conditions. But how to handle that? Maybe using a context manager or try-except blocks.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The cachedmethod function takes cache, key (default hashkey), and lock (default None).
2. It returns a decorator that takes a method.
3. The decorator will create a wrapper function that, when called, generates a key using the key function and the method's arguments.
4. Check if the key exists in the cache. If yes, return the cached value.
5. If not, compute the result by calling the method, store it in the cache, and return it.
6. If a lock is provided, acquire it before accessing the cache to ensure thread safety.

Wait, but how to handle the arguments? The key function needs to generate a unique key based on the method's arguments. For example, if the method is called with args and kwargs, the key should be based on those. But since it's a method, the first argument is 'self', which is part of the instance. However, the key should probably exclude 'self' because the same method can be called on different instances with different 'self' values. So the key should be based on the arguments passed to the method, not including 'self'.

So the key function should take the arguments (excluding 'self') and generate a hashable key. The default hashkey function might be something like converting the arguments into a tuple, maybe using the __dict__ of the method's arguments, but I need to think about how to get the arguments.

Wait, when the method is called, the arguments are passed as *args and **kwargs. So the key function should generate a key based on these arguments. But how to capture them? The key function would be called with the method's arguments. Wait, the key function is passed to the decorator, so when the decorator is applied, the key function is used to generate the key for the method's call.

So the key function should take the arguments (args and kwargs) and return a hashable key. For example, the default hashkey could be a function that takes the arguments and returns a tuple of the positional and keyword arguments. But how to get those arguments? The key function would be called with the method's arguments. Wait, maybe the key function is called with the method's arguments as parameters. For example, when the method is called, the key function is called with the arguments (excluding 'self') to generate the key.

Alternatively, perhaps the key function is called with the method's arguments, and the decorator uses that to generate the key. So the key function would take the arguments (args and kwargs) and return a hashable value.

But how to pass those arguments to the key function? Let me think. The decorator's wrapper function would be called with the method's arguments. So when the method is called, the wrapper function is called with the same arguments as the method. So the key function would need to generate a key based on those arguments. For example, the key function could take the arguments (args and kwargs) and return a tuple of the arguments, or some hashable representation.

So, the key function is supposed to generate a unique key for the method's arguments. The default key is hashkey, which I need to define. Let me assume that hashkey is a function that takes the method's arguments (excluding 'self) and returns a tuple of the arguments. For example, for a method that takes parameters a and b, the key would be (a, b).

But how to get the arguments? The wrapper function would have access to the arguments. So when the method is called, the wrapper function is called with the same arguments as the method. So the key function would be called with those arguments. Wait, perhaps the key function is called with the arguments (args and kwargs) of the method call. So the key function would take those arguments and generate a key.

But how to pass those arguments to the key function? Let me think. The key function is a parameter to the cachedmethod decorator. So when the decorator is created, it uses the key function. When the method is called, the wrapper function will generate the key by calling the key function with the arguments of the method call.

Wait, perhaps the key function is called with the method's arguments (excluding 'self') as parameters. So for example, if the method is called as obj.method(a, b), then the key function is called with a and b. But how to capture those arguments?

Alternatively, the key function could be called with the arguments as a tuple. So the key function would take the arguments (args and kwargs) and return a hashable key. For example, the default hashkey could be something like:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

But how to get args and kwargs in the wrapper function? The wrapper function would be called with the same arguments as the method. So the wrapper function would have access to the arguments. So perhaps the key function is called with the arguments (args and kwargs) of the method call.

Wait, the key function is passed to the decorator. So when the decorator is created, the key function is stored. Then, when the method is called, the wrapper function uses that key function to generate the key based on the arguments.

So the wrapper function would need to generate the key based on the method's arguments. Let me think about how to do that. For example, the wrapper function would be called with the same arguments as the method. So the wrapper function can generate the key by passing the arguments to the key function.

But how to pass the arguments? For example, if the method is called with args and kwargs, then the key function should be called with those args and kwargs. But the key function's parameters need to be defined. Wait, the key function is supposed to take the arguments of the method call. So perhaps the key function is called with the arguments as a tuple and a dictionary of keyword arguments. Or maybe the key function is called with the method's arguments as a single parameter, like a tuple of all arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is called with the method's arguments as a single parameter, which is a tuple of all positional arguments and a dictionary of keyword arguments. For example, the key function could be:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

But how to get args and kwargs in the wrapper function? The wrapper function is called with the same arguments as the method. So when the method is called, the wrapper function is called with the arguments. So the wrapper function can pass those arguments to the key function.

Wait, but the key function is a function that is passed to the decorator. So the key function is called with the arguments of the method call. So the key function's parameters would be the arguments of the method call. But how to pass them? For example, if the method is called with args and kwargs, then the key function is called with those args and kwargs.

But how to capture those in the wrapper function. Let me think. The wrapper function would be called with the same arguments as the method. So for example, if the method is defined as def method(self, a, b), then when it's called as obj.method(1, 2), the wrapper function would be called with self, 1, 2. So the args would be (1, 2), and kwargs would be empty. But how to extract those from the wrapper function's parameters?

Alternatively, maybe the key function is called with the arguments (excluding self) as a tuple. So the wrapper function would generate a key by passing the arguments (excluding self) to the key function.

Wait, perhaps the key function is called with the arguments (args and kwargs) of the method call, excluding the 'self' parameter. So for example, if the method is called with args (a, b) and kwargs, then the key function is called with those args and kwargs.

But how to get those in the wrapper function. Let me think. The wrapper function is called with the same arguments as the method. So the wrapper function can extract the arguments as follows:

def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # generate key based on args and kwargs
    key = key_func(args, kwargs)
    # check cache
    ...

But then the key function would need to take args and kwargs as parameters. So the default key function, hashkey, would need to accept those parameters. So perhaps the hashkey function is defined as:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

But then, when the method is called, the key is generated using this function. However, the problem is that the key function may need to handle different types of arguments. For example, if the method has default parameters, or if the arguments are mutable.

But perhaps the key function is supposed to generate a unique key based on the arguments. So the default hashkey function would take the args and kwargs and return a tuple that can be used as a key in the cache.

But how to handle the 'self' parameter? Since the method is called with 'self' as the first argument, but the key should be based on the other arguments. So in the wrapper function, when generating the key, we should exclude 'self' from the arguments. So the args passed to the key function would be the arguments after 'self'.

So, in the wrapper function, when the method is called, the arguments are self, *args, **kwargs. So the key function should be called with args and kwargs. Therefore, in the wrapper function, we can generate the key by calling key_func(args, kwargs).

But then, the key function needs to be able to process args and kwargs. So the default hashkey function would take args and kwargs and return a hashable key. For example, the default hashkey could be:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

But this would generate a tuple of the positional arguments and a sorted tuple of the keyword arguments. This would ensure that different orderings of the same arguments (e.g., a=1, b=2 vs b=2, a=1) are treated as the same key.

Now, considering the lock. If a lock is provided, the decorator should acquire it before accessing the cache to prevent race conditions. So, when checking the cache and storing the result, the lock should be acquired.

Putting this all together, the decorator would look something like this:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            # Generate key
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            # Acquire lock if provided
            if lock:
                lock.acquire()
                try:
                    # Check cache
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    # Compute result
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    # Store in cache
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
                finally:
                    lock.release()
            else:
                # No lock, just check and store
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the lock is passed to the cachedmethod function. So the lock could be a threading.Lock or similar. However, the lock is part of the decorator's parameters. So when the decorator is created, it has access to the lock. But when the wrapper is called, it needs to acquire the lock. However, if the lock is None, then no locking is done.

But there's a problem here: the lock is a separate object. If the lock is provided, the decorator should use it. However, the lock may not be a context manager, so we need to handle it properly. Alternatively, using a context manager would be better.

Another approach: when the lock is provided, use a context manager to acquire it. So:

if lock:
    with lock:
        if key_val in cache:
            return cache[key_val]
        result = method(...)
        cache[key_val] = result
        return result

But this would require that the lock is a context manager. However, in Python, a Lock object from threading is a context manager. So using 'with lock:' would acquire the lock and release it upon exit.

So modifying the code:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

This seems better. But what about the key function? The default key is hashkey. So I need to define hashkey. But the user hasn't provided it. Wait, the function signature says key=hashkey, which implies that hashkey is a predefined function. So perhaps in the code, hashkey is a function that takes args and kwargs and returns a hashable key. But since the user hasn't provided it, I need to define it as part of the code.

Wait, the user's code is supposed to generate the cachedmethod function. So the hashkey function is probably part of the code. But in the problem statement, the user hasn't provided it. So maybe the hashkey is a helper function that is defined elsewhere, or perhaps it's a function that takes the method's arguments and returns a tuple of the arguments. For example:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the code should include it. However, the problem says that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring, and not include any explanations. So perhaps the hashkey is a predefined function, and the code should use it. But since it's not defined here, maybe the code should include it.

Wait, the problem says that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature includes key=hashkey, which suggests that hashkey is a function that is available in the scope. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the code should include a default implementation for hashkey.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should assume that hashkey is a predefined function. However, in the code, the key parameter defaults to hashkey, which may not be defined. Therefore, the code should include a definition for hashkey.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the code should include the hashkey function as part of the cachedmethod function.

Alternatively, maybe the hashkey is a function that takes the method's arguments and returns a key. For example, the default key function could be something like:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

But how to include that in the code. Since the user hasn't provided it, but the function signature uses it, perhaps the code should include it as part of the cachedmethod function.

But the problem says that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the code should include the hashkey function as part of the cachedmethod function.

But the user's code is supposed to be generated as the cachedmethod function. So perhaps the code should include the hashkey function inside the cachedmethod function.

Alternatively, the hashkey is a helper function that is not part of the cachedmethod function. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the code should assume that it's available elsewhere.

But the user's instruction says that the code should be generated based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should include the hashkey function as part of the cachedmethod function.

But the problem says to generate the code for the cachedmethod function. So the code for cachedmethod would need to include the hashkey function as part of its implementation.

Alternatively, maybe the hashkey is a function that is passed as a parameter. But the function signature says key=hashkey, which suggests that it's a default value.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again.

The user's code is supposed to generate the cachedmethod function. The function signature is def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. The docstring says it returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.

So the code for cachedmethod needs to include the key function. Since the default is hashkey, but the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the code should include a default implementation for hashkey.

But the user's code is supposed to be generated based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code should include the hashkey function as part of the cachedmethod function.

Wait, but the function signature says key=hashkey, which implies that hashkey is a function that is available in the scope. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the code should include it as a helper function inside the cachedmethod function.

So, inside the cachedmethod function, define the hashkey function as the default key function. But how?

Alternatively, the code could have the hashkey function as a nested function inside cachedmethod. For example:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def hashkey(args, kwargs):
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))
    # rest of the code

But then the default key would be hashkey, which is defined inside cachedmethod. However, the function signature says key=hashkey, which would refer to the hashkey function outside of cachedmethod. This seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the hashkey is a function that is defined elsewhere, and the code just uses it. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the code should include it.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code should include the hashkey function as part of the cachedmethod function.

So, the code would include the hashkey function as the default key function. Let me adjust the code accordingly.

Putting it all together, the code would look like this:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def hashkey(args, kwargs):
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the key parameter is set to hashkey, which is now defined inside cachedmethod. So the default value for key is the hashkey function defined inside cachedmethod. That should work.

But the function signature says key=hashkey, which would normally refer to a function defined outside. However, in this case, the hashkey is defined inside cachedmethod, so it's okay.

But the user's function signature may have a different intention. For example, maybe the key is a function that is passed to the decorator, and the default is a predefined hashkey function. But since the user hasn't provided it, the code must include it.

So the final code would include the hashkey function as part of the cachedmethod function.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code should include the hashkey function as the default key function.

Therefore, the code would be as above.

Another thing to consider: the cache is a dictionary-like object that supports the 'in' operator and assignment. So the code assumes that the cache is a dictionary or a similar structure.

Also, the lock is a context manager, like a threading.Lock, which can be used with 'with' statement.

So the final code would look like this:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def hashkey(args, kwargs):
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the hashkey function is defined inside cachedmethod, but the default key parameter is set to hashkey. However, in Python, the default value for a parameter is evaluated once when the function is defined. So if hashkey is not defined at the time cachedmethod is defined, this would cause an error. Therefore, the code should define hashkey inside cachedmethod, and set the default key to hashkey.

But in Python, the default value for the key parameter is evaluated when the function is defined. So if hashkey is not defined at that time, it would raise a NameError. Therefore, the code should define hashkey inside cachedmethod, and set the default key to hashkey.

But how? The function signature is def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. If hashkey is defined inside cachedmethod, then when the function is defined, hashkey would not be available yet. So this would cause an error.

Ah, this is a problem. The default value for key is hashkey, but if hashkey is defined inside cachedmethod, then when cachedmethod is defined, hashkey is not yet defined. Therefore, this would raise a NameError.

To fix this, the hashkey function should be defined outside of cachedmethod, or the default key should be set to a lambda or another way.

Alternatively, the code can define hashkey inside cachedmethod and set the default key to a lambda that calls hashkey. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, the code can define hashkey as a nested function inside cachedmethod, and then set the default key to hashkey. But this would require that hashkey is defined before the key parameter is set.

So, perhaps the code should be written as:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=None, lock=None):
    def hashkey(args, kwargs):
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))
    if key is None:
        key = hashkey
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

This way, the key parameter defaults to hashkey, which is defined inside cachedmethod. But the initial code has key=hashkey, which would require hashkey to be defined at the time cachedmethod is defined. So by changing the default key to None and then setting it to hashkey if it's None, we can avoid the NameError.

But the original function signature has key=hashkey. So perhaps the user intended for hashkey to be a predefined function. However, since it's not provided, the code must include it.

So the final code would have the hashkey function defined inside cachedmethod, and the key parameter is set to hashkey if not provided.

But the original function signature says key=hashkey, which may not be correct. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature, and the code should have key=None as the default, and then set it to hashkey.

But given the user's instruction, the code must match the given function signature. So the function signature is def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):.

But this would cause a NameError because hashkey is not defined when cachedmethod is defined. Therefore, the code must include the hashkey function inside cachedmethod, and somehow make it available as the default key.

To resolve this, the code can define hashkey inside cachedmethod and then set the default key to hashkey. However, in Python, the default value for the key parameter is evaluated once when the function is defined. So if hashkey is defined inside cachedmethod, then when cachedmethod is defined, hashkey is not yet defined, leading to an error.

To avoid this, the code can use a lambda or a nested function to set the default key. For example:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=None, lock=None):
    def hashkey(args, kwargs):
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))
    if key is None:
        key = hashkey
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But this changes the function signature from key=hashkey to key=None. However, the user's function signature says key=hashkey, which is not possible unless hashkey is defined elsewhere.

Given the constraints, perhaps the user intended for hashkey to be a predefined function. So the code should assume that hashkey is available, and the default key is hashkey. However, since it's not provided, the code must include it.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code must include the hashkey function as part of the cachedmethod function.

But this leads to the NameError problem. To resolve this, perhaps the code should define hashkey inside cachedmethod and use it as the default key.

But how to do that without causing a NameError. One way is to use a lambda to capture the hashkey function.

Alternatively, the code can be written as:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def hashkey(args, kwargs):
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))
    # Now, the default key is hashkey, which is defined
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But this would cause a NameError when cachedmethod is defined because hashkey is not yet defined. To fix this, the code can define hashkey before the key parameter is set. But how?

The solution is to define hashkey before the key parameter is set. So:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def hashkey(args, kwargs):
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))
    # Now, hashkey is defined, so the default key is hashkey
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But this would still cause a NameError because when the function cachedmethod is defined, the hashkey function is not yet defined. Because the hashkey function is defined inside cachedmethod, and the key parameter is set to hashkey, which is not yet defined at the time of the function's definition.

This is a problem. To resolve this, the code must define hashkey before the key parameter is set. But in Python, the function's default parameters are evaluated at the time the function is defined, not when it's called. So if hashkey is not defined at the time cachedmethod is defined, it will raise a NameError.

Therefore, the code must define hashkey before the key parameter is set. One way to do this is to define hashkey outside of cachedmethod, or to use a lambda to capture it.

But since the user hasn't provided hashkey, the code must include it. So the code can define hashkey inside cachedmethod, and then use it as the default key.

But how to do that without causing a NameError? The only way is to define hashkey before the key parameter is set. So the code can be written as:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def hashkey(args, kwargs):
        return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))
    # Now, hashkey is defined, so the default key is hashkey
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But this will still raise a NameError because when cachedmethod is defined, hashkey is not yet defined. Because the hashkey function is defined inside cachedmethod, and the key parameter is set to hashkey, which is not yet defined when the function is being defined.

To resolve this, the hashkey function must be defined before the key parameter is set. So the code must define hashkey outside of cachedmethod. But since the user hasn't provided it, the code must include it.

So the code can be written as:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

This way, the hashkey function is defined outside of cachedmethod, and the key parameter defaults to it. This avoids the NameError.

But the user's function signature says key=hashkey, which is now satisfied because hashkey is defined outside.

So this should work.

Therefore, the final code would include the hashkey function outside of cachedmethod, and the cachedmethod function uses it as the default key.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function signature includes key=hashkey, which implies that hashkey is a predefined function. So the code should include the hashkey function as part of the generated code.

Thus, the final code would be:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, tuple(sorted(kwargs.items())))

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But the user's function signature says the cachedmethod function has parameters (cache, key=hashkey, lock=None). So the code includes the hashkey function and the cachedmethod function.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code should include the hashkey function as part of the generated code.

Thus, the final code is as above.

However, the user's instruction says to generate the code for the cachedmethod function, not including the hashkey function. But since the function signature uses hashkey, it must be defined.

Therefore, the code must include both functions.

But the user's problem statement says that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature includes key=hashkey, so the code must include hashkey.

Thus, the final code is as above.
