Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the protocol_handlers function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, and there's a lot of other methods and attributes mentioned in the context. 

First, I need to understand what the protocol_handlers function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns different forms of Bolt protocol handlers based on the protocol_version. So, the function probably checks the protocol_version and returns the appropriate handler.

Looking at the imports, there's logging, collections, time, abc, asyncio, api, neo4j. Maybe the handlers are classes from neo4j or other modules. But since the user didn't specify, I'll have to make assumptions.

The function is a class method (cls) and takes an optional protocol_version. So, maybe it's using a dictionary or a conditional to select the handler. For example, if protocol_version is None, maybe it defaults to a certain handler. If it's a specific version like 1.0 or 3.0, it returns different classes.

I should check if the function is supposed to return a class or an instance. Since it's a class method, perhaps it's returning a class, or maybe an instance of a handler. But the docstring says "different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned", so maybe it's returning a class or a specific handler based on the version.

Looking at the context, there are methods like get_handshake, hello, etc., which might be part of the Bolt protocol. So the handlers could be different classes for different protocol versions.

I need to structure the function to check the protocol_version and return the appropriate handler. For example:

If protocol_version is None, maybe return a default handler. If it's 'v1', return BoltV1Handler, etc. But since the actual handlers aren't specified, I'll have to use placeholders or use the existing attributes from the class.

Wait, the context mentions self.PROTOCOL_VERSION, which might be an attribute of the class. So maybe the function uses that attribute if protocol_version is not provided.

But the function's parameter is protocol_version, which could be None. So the function might use that parameter or the class's PROTOCOL_VERSION attribute if the parameter is None.

So, the code could look like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is None:
        protocol_version = cls.PROTOCOL_VERSION
    # then determine which handler to return based on protocol_version
    # maybe using a dictionary mapping versions to handler classes
    handlers = {
        'v1': BoltV1Handler,
        'v3': BoltV3Handler,
        # etc.
    }
    return handlers.get(protocol_version, DefaultHandler)

But since the user hasn't provided specific handler classes, I need to make assumptions. Also, the function is a class method, so it's called as cls.protocol_handlers(...).

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of handlers or some structure. But the docstring says "different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned", which suggests returning a specific handler class or instance.

Another thing: the context includes methods like get_handshake, hello, etc., which are part of the Bolt protocol. So perhaps the handlers are classes that implement these methods. But without knowing the exact structure, I'll have to create a generic implementation.

So, putting it all together, the function would check the protocol_version, and return the appropriate handler. Since the user didn't specify the exact versions or handlers, I'll use a simple conditional and return a class or a placeholder.

Wait, the function is part of a class, and the context includes methods like self.get_handshake, which might be part of the handler. So maybe the protocol_handlers function returns a class that has these methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the function returns a list of handlers based on the version. But the docstring says "different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned", which could mean returning a specific handler class.

So, here's a possible implementation:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        protocol_version = cls.PROTOCOL_VERSION
    # Example: return different handlers based on protocol version
    if protocol_version == 'v1':
        from .handlers import BoltV1Handler
        return BoltV1Handler
    elif protocol_version == 'v3':
        from .handlers import BoltV3Handler
        return BoltV3Handler
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")

But since the user hasn't provided the actual handler classes, I need to use placeholders. Also, the function is a class method, so it's called on the class, not an instance.

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a list of handlers or some structure. But given the context, the most straightforward approach is to return a specific handler class based on the version.

Another consideration: the function might be part of a class that has attributes like UNPACKER_CLS, HYDRATION_HANDLER_CLS, etc., which could be used in the handler. So the protocol_handlers function might use those attributes to construct the handler.

But without more information, it's hard to know. So I'll proceed with a basic implementation that checks the protocol_version and returns a handler class, using the class's PROTOCOL_VERSION attribute if none is provided.

So the final code would look something like that. Now, I need to make sure that the code is in Python markdown format and only the code is outputted, no explanations.
