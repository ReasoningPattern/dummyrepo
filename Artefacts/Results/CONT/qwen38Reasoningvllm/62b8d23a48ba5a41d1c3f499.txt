Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method should do.

The docstring says it should remove and return the least recently used (LRU) key-value pair. So this is part of an LRU cache implementation. The user mentioned that the class uses the collections module and has methods like __init__, pop, popitem, __update, etc. 

In an LRU cache, the popitem method typically removes the least recently used item. For a standard LRU cache, when you pop an item, it's the one that hasn't been used for the longest time. But how is this implemented?

Looking at the context, the class has attributes like __order, which might be a list or some structure that keeps track of the order of usage. The __update method might be used to adjust the order when items are accessed. 

In the __init__ method, maxsize and getsizeof are parameters. So the cache has a maximum size, and maybe it evicts items when the size is exceeded. 

The popitem method needs to remove the LRU item. If the cache is empty, it should probably raise an error, like KeyError. Otherwise, it should find the least recently used item, remove it, and return it.

Assuming that __order is a list that keeps track of the order of insertion and access, with the least recently used at the front or the end. For example, in some implementations, the most recently used items are at the end of a list, and the LRU is at the beginning. So when you pop, you take from the beginning.

But how does the __order get maintained? The __update method might move an item to the end when it's accessed. So when an item is accessed (like through __getitem__ or __setitem__), it's moved to the end of the order list. 

So for popitem, we need to remove the first element of the order list (assuming LRU is first). Then, we need to remove that key from the cache's internal storage (maybe a dictionary). 

Wait, the class has a __setitem__ method that uses cache_setitem. Maybe the cache uses a dictionary to store the values. So the __order list contains the keys in the order of usage, and the dictionary holds the key-value pairs.

So the steps for popitem would be:

1. Check if the cache is empty. If yes, raise KeyError.
2. Get the LRU key from the __order list (maybe the first element).
3. Remove that key from the dictionary.
4. Remove the key from __order.
5. Return the (key, value) pair.

But how is the __order maintained? Let's think about the __update method. When an item is accessed (like in __getitem__ or __setitem__), the __update method is called to move the key to the end of the order list. So, for example, when a key is accessed, it's moved to the end, making it the most recently used. 

So, in popitem, the LRU is the first element of the order list. So, we pop that element, remove it from the dictionary, and return it.

But how to handle the order list? Let's say __order is a list. So, for example:

self.__order = [key1, key2, key3]

key1 is the LRU. So, popitem would take key1, remove it from the dictionary, and return (key1, value).

But how to handle the order list when the cache is full? Wait, the popitem is called when the cache is full, but maybe not necessarily. The popitem could be called even when the cache isn't full, but in that case, it's just removing an item.

Wait, the standard LRU cache's popitem removes the least recently used item, regardless of the size. So, even if the cache isn't full, popitem would remove the LRU item.

So, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
    """
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
    key = self.__order.pop(0)  # Assuming LRU is at the front
    value = self.__dict__[key]  # Assuming values are stored in a dictionary
    del self.__dict__[key]
    return (key, value)

Wait, but how is the internal storage structured? The class has __setitem__ and __getitem__, which might be using a dictionary. So perhaps the cache uses a dictionary to store the values, and __order is a list of keys in order of usage.

But in the context, there's a mention of self.__init__(self, maxsize, getsizeof). So maybe the class is a subclass of dict or something similar. However, the user mentioned that the class has methods like __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, etc., which suggests that it's a custom dictionary-like class.

So, assuming that the cache uses a dictionary to store the values, and __order is a list of keys in the order of usage (LRU at front, MRU at end). 

But when an item is accessed (like via __getitem__), the __update method is called, which moves the key to the end of the order list. Similarly, when an item is added (via __setitem__), the __update method is called. 

So, for popitem, we need to remove the first element of __order, delete it from the dictionary, and return it.

But how to handle the dictionary? Let's assume that the cache's values are stored in a dictionary, perhaps self.__dict__ or another attribute. However, in Python, using __dict__ is not standard for such classes. Maybe the class has a separate attribute, like self._cache, which is a dictionary.

But given the context, the user hasn't provided the full code, so I have to make assumptions. Let's assume that the cache's values are stored in a dictionary called self._cache, and the __order is a list of keys.

So, modifying the code:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
    """
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
    key = self.__order.pop(0)
    value = self._cache[key]
    del self._cache[key]
    return (key, value)

But how to handle the order list? Also, when the cache is full, maybe after popping, we need to check if the size is below maxsize. But the popitem is supposed to remove the LRU item regardless of the size. So, the code above would work.

But the user's context includes a method called self.pop, which might be related. However, the problem is to generate the popitem method.

Another thing to consider: the __order list might be maintained in such a way that when an item is accessed, it's moved to the end. So, for example, when you access a key, you call __update, which moves it to the end of the list. 

So, in the popitem method, the first element of __order is the LRU. So, popping that element and removing it from the cache.

But what if the __order list is empty? Then, raise KeyError.

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
    """
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
    key = self.__order.pop(0)
    value = self._cache[key]
    del self._cache[key]
    return (key, value)

But how is the _cache stored? Maybe the class uses a dictionary, perhaps self.__dict__? Or maybe it's a separate attribute. Since the user's context shows that __setitem__ is called with cache_setitem, perhaps the actual storage is in a different structure. But without more information, I have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a dictionary called self._cache, and __order is a list of keys. So, the code above would work.

Another thing: when the cache is full, and you add a new item, you might need to evict the LRU item. But the popitem method is called to explicitly remove the LRU item, regardless of the cache's current size.

So, the code for popitem would be as above.

But the user's context includes that the class has a __init__ method with maxsize and getsizeof. So, perhaps the class is an LRU cache that evicts items when the size exceeds maxsize. However, the popitem method is for removing the LRU item, which could be part of that eviction process.

But regardless, the popitem method's responsibility is to remove and return the LRU item.

So, putting it all together, the code would be as follows.
