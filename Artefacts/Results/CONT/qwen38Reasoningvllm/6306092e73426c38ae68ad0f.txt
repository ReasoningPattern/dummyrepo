Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function get_nested_custom_and_control_args based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function splits input arguments into control_args and nested_args. Control arguments control IR behavior and aren't put into the spec yml. Nested arguments are for Ansible playbooks and are included in the spec yml. Custom arguments are custom Ansible variables that replace normal nested usage.

So the function takes a list of args and returns two dictionaries: control_args and nested_args. But how to differentiate between them?

Looking at the context, there are several methods mentioned like self.resolve_custom_types, self.generate_answers_file, self.validate_min_max_args, etc. These might be related to processing the arguments. Also, there's mention of deprecated args, validation functions, and merging duplicated args.

Hmm. Maybe the function needs to iterate through the args, check each argument's type or name to determine if it's a control argument, nested, or custom. But how?

Wait, the function is part of a class. The methods like self._iterate_received_arguments might be used here. Also, there's a method called self.resolve_custom_types which could help in distinguishing custom arguments.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Iterate over each argument in args.
2. For each argument, determine if it's a control argument, nested, or custom.
3. Separate them into control_args and nested_args dictionaries.
4. Custom arguments might be handled differently, perhaps by checking if they are in a certain category or have a specific prefix.

But how to implement this without knowing the exact structure of args? Maybe the args are passed as a list of key-value pairs. The function needs to split them into the two categories.

Wait, the function returns a tuple of two dicts. So perhaps the control_args are those that are not nested or custom, and nested_args are those that are part of the spec. But how to determine that?

Alternatively, maybe the function uses some existing methods. For example, self._iterate_received_arguments could be used to process the args. Also, the resolve_custom_types method might be used to identify custom arguments.

Another thought: the function might check for certain argument names that are known to be control arguments. For example, arguments like --control-option would be in control_args. But without knowing the exact argument names, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the spec_dict or the spec_helper to determine which arguments are nested. But since the function is part of a class that has access to spec_dict and other attributes, perhaps it uses that information.

Wait, the function's name is get_nested_custom_and_control_args. So maybe it's splitting the args into three categories: nested, custom, and control. But the return is two dicts: control_args and nested_args. Wait, the docstring says that custom arguments are custom ansible variables to be used instead of normal nested usage. So maybe custom arguments are a subset of nested arguments? Or are they separate?

The docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage. So perhaps the function needs to separate the args into control, nested, and custom, but the return is only control and nested. Maybe custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but with a different handling.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and custom args are a separate category that's not part of the return. But the docstring says that the return is (control_args, nested_args), so perhaps custom args are part of nested_args but marked as custom.

But the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, so I need to make assumptions based on the context.

Looking at the context, there's a method called self._iterate_received_arguments which might process the args. Also, there's self.resolve_custom_types, which could be used to identify custom arguments.

Maybe the function does the following:

- Iterate over each argument in args.
- For each argument, check if it's a control argument (maybe by checking against a list of known control arguments).
- If it's not a control argument, check if it's a custom argument (using resolve_custom_types).
- If it's a custom argument, add it to nested_args with a specific key or mark it as custom.
- Otherwise, add it to nested_args as a regular nested argument.

But without knowing the exact structure of args, it's hard to code this. However, the function is supposed to return two dictionaries. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Perhaps the function uses the self._iterate_received_arguments method to process the args. Then, for each argument, it checks if it's a control argument. If not, it checks if it's a custom argument. If it's a custom argument, it's added to nested_args with a specific key. Otherwise, it's added as a regular nested argument.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the self.resolve_custom_types method to separate custom arguments from others. Then, the control arguments are those that are not in the nested or custom categories.

But I need to write code that fits the function signature. Let me try to draft the code.

The function is part of a class, so it has access to self. The args are a list of arguments, perhaps in the form of key-value pairs. The function needs to split them into control and nested.

Maybe the code looks like this:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        # Determine if it's a control argument
        if arg is a control argument:
            control_args[arg.name] = arg.value
        else:
            # Check if it's a custom argument
            if self.resolve_custom_types(arg):
                # Handle custom argument
                nested_args[arg.name] = arg.value
            else:
                # Regular nested argument
                nested_args[arg.name] = arg.value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is very vague. How to determine if an argument is a control argument? Maybe there's a list of control argument names. For example, arguments that start with '--control-' or have a specific prefix.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the spec_dict to determine which arguments are nested. But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to code.

Another approach: the function may separate the arguments into control and nested by checking if they are in the spec. For example, control arguments are not part of the spec, while nested arguments are. But again, without knowing the spec structure, this is unclear.

Alternatively, the function may use the self._get_conditionally_required_args or other validation methods to determine which arguments are control.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested based on certain criteria, such as the presence of certain keys or prefixes.

Given the lack of specific information, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the args are a list of dictionaries or objects with 'name' and 'value' attributes. The function iterates through each argument, checks if it's a control argument (maybe by checking against a predefined list), and separates them.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual structure of args, I'll have to proceed with a generic approach. Perhaps the function uses the self._iterate_received_arguments method to process the args, and then separates them into control and nested.

Alternatively, the function could be using the self.get_deprecated_args method to identify deprecated arguments, which might be control arguments.

Given the uncertainty, I'll draft a code that uses the self._iterate_received_arguments method to process the args, and then separates them into control and nested based on some criteria. For example, control arguments might be those that are not in the nested or custom categories.

But since the user wants only the code, and not explanations, I'll proceed to write the code based on the function signature and the context provided.

Perhaps the code uses the self._iterate_received_arguments method to get the arguments, and then separates them. Also, the resolve_custom_types method might be used to identify custom arguments.

Here's a possible implementation:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in self._iterate_received_arguments(args):
        if self.resolve_custom_types(arg):
            # Custom arguments are part of nested_args
            nested_args[arg.name] = arg.value
        else:
            # Check if it's a control argument
            if arg.name.startswith('--control-'):
                control_args[arg.name] = arg.value
            else:
                nested_args[arg.name] = arg.value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just a guess. The actual implementation might vary. However, based on the given information, this seems like a plausible approach. The code iterates through the arguments, checks if they are custom, and if not, checks if they are control arguments by their name. Control arguments are added to control_args, others to nested_args.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the spec_dict to determine which arguments are nested. But without knowing that, this is hard.

In any case, the code needs to return two dictionaries. The exact logic depends on the internal structure of the class and the args. But given the context, I'll proceed with the code above.
