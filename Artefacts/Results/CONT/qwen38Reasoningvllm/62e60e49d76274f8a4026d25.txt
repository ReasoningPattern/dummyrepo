Okay, I need to create a Python function called unit_of_work that returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function unit_of_work takes two optional parameters: metadata and timeout. The goal is to return a decorator that can be used to wrap other functions, and this decorator should have attributes for metadata and timeout.

Wait, decorators in Python are usually functions that take a function and return a new function. But here, the decorator itself needs to have attributes. So maybe the decorator is a function that returns another function, and that returned function has the metadata and timeout as attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps the decorator is a class instance. But the problem says to return a decorator, which is typically a function. Hmm.

Let me think. Let's say the unit_of_work function returns a decorator function. This decorator function will have the metadata and timeout as attributes. Wait, but when you return a decorator, it's a function. So maybe the decorator function is designed to accept a target function, and then when the decorator is applied, it wraps the target function and stores the metadata and timeout.

Wait, but the metadata and timeout are parameters to the unit_of_work function. So when you call unit_of_work with certain parameters, it returns a decorator that, when applied to a function, will have those parameters as attributes.

Wait, perhaps the decorator is a function that takes the target function and returns a wrapped function. The decorator itself can have attributes. Wait, but in Python, functions are objects and can have attributes. So maybe the decorator function is created with the metadata and timeout, and then when it's applied to a function, it wraps that function and stores the metadata and timeout as attributes of the decorator.

Wait, maybe the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a wrapped function. The decorator function itself can have attributes. For example:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # do something
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        wrapper.metadata = metadata
        wrapper.timeout = timeout
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But in this case, the decorator function (decorator) is returned by unit_of_work. When you use @unit_of_work(...), it applies the decorator to the function. The wrapper function has the metadata and timeout as attributes.

Wait, but the docstring says the decorator has metadata and timeout attributes. So the decorator itself (the function returned by unit_of_work) would have those attributes? Or the wrapped function?

Wait, the docstring says "Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes." So the decorator (the function returned by unit_of_work) has those attributes. Wait, but that's not possible because the decorator is a function. Unless the decorator is a class instance. Wait, maybe the decorator is a class that has metadata and timeout as attributes. But the problem says to return a decorator, which is typically a function.

Alternatively, perhaps the decorator function is designed to have those attributes. For example, when you call unit_of_work with metadata and timeout, it returns a decorator function that has those parameters as attributes. Then, when you apply that decorator to a function, the decorator's attributes are stored.

Wait, maybe the decorator function (the one returned by unit_of_work) has metadata and timeout as attributes. Let me think. Let's say:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # ... 
        return wrapper
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator

But in this case, the decorator function (decorator) has metadata and timeout as attributes. Then, when you use @unit_of_work(...), the decorator is applied to the function, and the decorator function has those attributes. But the wrapped function (wrapper) may not have them. But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes. So maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the decorator is a class. For example:

class Decorator:
    def __init__(self, metadata, timeout):
        self.metadata = metadata
        self.timeout = timeout

    def __call__(self, func):
        # wrap func
        return wrapped

But the problem says to return a decorator, which is a function. So perhaps the unit_of_work function returns a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes.

So, putting it all together:

The unit_of_work function takes metadata and timeout. It returns a decorator function. This decorator function, when called with a function, returns a wrapper function. The decorator function itself has metadata and timeout as attributes.

Wait, but how to set those attributes on the decorator function. Let me think. Let's say:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # maybe do something here
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    # Now, set the attributes on the decorator function
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator

But in this case, the decorator function (decorator) has metadata and timeout as attributes. Then, when you use @unit_of_work(...), the decorator is applied to the function, and the decorator's attributes are set. But the wrapper function (the one returned by the decorator) doesn't have those attributes. But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes, so this seems correct.

But perhaps the user wants the wrapped function to have those attributes. But the docstring says the decorator has them. So maybe the answer is as above.

So the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator

But wait, the docstring says the decorator has metadata and timeout attributes. So the decorator function (the one returned by unit_of_work) has those attributes. So this code would do that.

But when you use the decorator, for example:

@unit_of_work(metadata="test", timeout=10)
def my_function():
    pass

Then, the decorator function (the one returned by unit_of_work) has metadata and timeout attributes. The wrapper function (returned by the decorator) doesn't. But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes, which refers to the decorator function itself.

So this code should satisfy the requirement.

But maybe the user wants the wrapped function to have those attributes. But according to the docstring, it's the decorator that has them. So the code above is correct.

So the final code would be as written.
