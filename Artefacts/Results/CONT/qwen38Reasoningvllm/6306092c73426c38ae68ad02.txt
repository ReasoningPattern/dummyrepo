Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function validate_arg_deprecation based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function's purpose is to validate and print deprecated arguments. The parameters are cli_args and answer_file_args, both dictionaries. The docstring mentions that it's part of a class, as there are references to self in the context. 

Looking at the context, there are several methods mentioned, like get_deprecated_args, which might be related. The function probably checks for deprecated arguments in both cli_args and answer_file_args, then logs or prints them. 

First, I should check if the method uses any of the imported packages. The imports include string, os, collections, six, infrared. Maybe using collections for handling dictionaries or os for logging? Not sure yet.

The function needs to process both cli_args and answer_file_args. Maybe it combines them or checks each separately. The method get_deprecated_args is mentioned in the context, so perhaps that's a helper method that returns a list of deprecated arguments. 

So, the steps could be:
1. Get the deprecated arguments from both cli_args and answer_file_args.
2. Validate them (maybe check if they are present and log a warning).
3. Print or log the deprecated arguments.

Wait, the function's name is validate_arg_deprecation, so it's about validating that deprecated arguments are not used. But the docstring says it "validates and prints the deprecated arguments." Maybe it's checking for deprecated args and informing the user.

So, perhaps the function first retrieves all deprecated arguments using self.get_deprecated_args(). Then, for each deprecated argument, it checks if it's present in cli_args or answer_file_args. If found, it logs a warning or message.

But how to implement that. Let me think about the code structure.

The function would start by getting the deprecated arguments. Then iterate through each key in cli_args and answer_file_args, check if they are in the deprecated list. For each found, print a message.

Wait, but maybe the deprecated arguments are those that are no longer supported. So the function should check if any of the arguments in cli_args or answer_file_args are deprecated and handle them accordingly.

So code steps:

- Call self.get_deprecated_args() to get a list of deprecated argument names.
- For each argument in cli_args and answer_file_args, check if it's in the deprecated list.
- If found, log a warning or message indicating that the argument is deprecated.

But how to handle the merging of cli_args and answer_file_args? Because some arguments might be present in both. The context mentions self._merge_duplicated_cli_args, which might be a method to merge them. However, in this function, maybe we need to check both dictionaries separately.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check for deprecated arguments in both sources and report them.

So, code outline:

def validate_arg_deprecation(self, cli_args, answer_file_args):
    deprecated_args = self.get_deprecated_args()
    for arg in cli_args:
        if arg in deprecated_args:
            # log deprecation warning
    for arg in answer_file_args:
        if arg in deprecated_args:
            # log deprecation warning

But maybe the function should check for both cli and answer file args. Also, perhaps the deprecated_args is a set for faster lookups.

Also, the function might need to use the LOG variable mentioned in the context, which is probably a logger instance. So, using LOG.warning or similar.

So, the code could be:

def validate_arg_deprecation(self, cli_args, answer_file_args):
    deprecated_args = self.get_deprecated_args()
    for arg in set(cli_args.keys()) | set(answer_file_args.keys()):
        if arg in deprecated_args:
            LOG.warning(f"Deprecated argument '{arg}' is used. It will be removed in a future version.")

But wait, the function's name is validate_arg_deprecation, which might imply that it's checking for the presence of deprecated arguments and ensuring they are not used. However, the docstring says it "validates and prints the deprecated arguments," which might mean that it's reporting them rather than preventing their use.

Another possibility is that the function is part of a validation process where deprecated arguments are checked, and if found, they are considered invalid. But the docstring says "prints," so it's more about reporting.

Also, the context mentions methods like self.validate_min_max_args, validate_choices_args, etc., which are part of argument validation. So this function is another validation step.

Putting it all together, the code would:

- Retrieve the list of deprecated arguments.
- Check each argument in cli_args and answer_file_args.
- For each deprecated argument found, log a warning.

So the code would look something like:

def validate_arg_deprecation(self, cli_args, answer_file_args):
    deprecated_args = self.get_deprecated_args()
    for arg in cli_args:
        if arg in deprecated_args:
            LOG.warning(f"Deprecated argument '{arg}' is used. It will be removed in a future version.")
    for arg in answer_file_args:
        if arg in deprecated_args:
            LOG.warning(f"Deprecated argument '{arg}' is used. It will be removed in a future version.")

But maybe the function should check for duplicates or combine the two dictionaries. Also, the context mentions self._merge_duplicated_cli_args, which might be used to merge cli_args and answer_file_args. However, the function's parameters are cli_args and answer_file_args, so perhaps they are separate.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check for any occurrence of deprecated arguments in either source.

Another thing: the function might need to handle cases where the same argument is present in both cli_args and answer_file_args. But the code above would check both, leading to duplicate warnings. To avoid that, perhaps using a set to combine the keys.

So:

def validate_arg_deprecation(self, cli_args, answer_file_args):
    deprecated_args = self.get_deprecated_args()
    all_args = set(cli_args.keys()) | set(answer_file_args.keys())
    for arg in all_args:
        if arg in deprecated_args:
            LOG.warning(f"Deprecated argument '{arg}' is used. It will be removed in a future version.")

This way, each deprecated argument is checked once, regardless of which source it comes from.

But the function's name is validate_arg_deprecation, which might imply that it's validating that deprecated arguments are not present. However, the docstring says it's supposed to "validate and print the deprecated arguments," which suggests that it's reporting them rather than preventing their use.

So the code would be as above. Also, the LOG variable is mentioned in the context, so assuming it's a logger instance.

Now, considering the imports: the code uses 'string', 'os', 'collections', 'six', 'infrared'. However, the LOG might be from the infrared package or another module. But since the user hasn't provided the exact imports, I'll assume LOG is a logger instance available in the class.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def validate_arg_deprecation(self, cli_args, answer_file_args):
    """
    Validates and prints the deprecated arguments.

    :param cli_args: the dict of arguments from cli
    :param answer_file_args:  the dict of arguments from files
    """
    deprecated_args = self.get_deprecated_args()
    all_args = set(cli_args.keys()) | set(answer_file_args.keys())
    for arg in all_args:
        if arg in deprecated_args:
            LOG.warning(f"Deprecated argument '{arg}' is used. It will be removed in a future version.")

But wait, the function is part of a class, and the context mentions methods like self.get_deprecated_args(), which is likely a method that returns the list of deprecated arguments. So the code should call that method.

Yes, that's correct. Also, using set for combining keys to avoid duplicates.

So the final code would be as above. I need to make sure that the code is in Python markdown format, which is triple backticks with python as the language. But the user said to output only the code generated in python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in ```python and ```.

But the user said to output only the code, no explanations. So the code is as written above.
