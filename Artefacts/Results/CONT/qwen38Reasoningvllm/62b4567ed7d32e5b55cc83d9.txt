Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the deep_merge_nodes function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to merge nodes, handling duplicate keys and returning the merged result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one should remain.

First, I need to understand what a MappingNode is. Since the context mentions using ruamel, I'm assuming that MappingNode refers to the dict-like structure provided by ruamel.yaml. So, the function probably deals with merging dictionaries recursively.

The docstring says to merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys. So, if two nodes have the same key, their values should be merged. But if the values are not MappingNodes (like strings, numbers, etc.), the last one should take precedence.

So, the approach would be to iterate through the nodes, and for each key, check if it's already present. If it is, merge the values. But how to handle merging? For example, if both values are dicts, we need to merge them recursively. If one is a dict and the other isn't, the dict should take precedence? Or maybe if the existing value is a dict, we merge into it, otherwise, we replace it with the new value. Wait, the docstring says if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, if a key exists and the existing value is not a MappingNode, then the new value replaces it. But if the existing value is a MappingNode, then we need to merge the new value into it.

So the steps would be:

1. Initialize a result dictionary.
2. Iterate through each node in the nodes list.
3. For each key-value pair in the node:
   a. If the key is already in the result:
      i. If the existing value is a MappingNode and the new value is also a MappingNode, merge them recursively.
      ii. Else, if the existing value is not a MappingNode, replace it with the new value (since the last one remains).
      iii. If the new value is a MappingNode and the existing is not, replace the existing with the new value.
   b. Else, add the key-value pair to the result.
4. Return the merged dictionary.

But how to check if a value is a MappingNode? Using isinstance(value, ruamel.yaml.MappingNode). Wait, but in ruamel.yaml, the loaded nodes might be of type dict, or maybe the MappingNode is a specific class. So perhaps the code should check if the value is an instance of a MappingNode, or if it's a dict. Alternatively, maybe the nodes are already in a format that can be handled as dicts.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle merging of dictionaries, treating them as nodes. So, for each node in nodes, which are presumably dictionaries, we need to merge them.

Wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that the nodes are nested structures. So, the merging should be done recursively.

So, the code structure would be something like:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in merged:
                if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([merged[key], value])
                else:
                    merged[key] = value
            else:
                merged[key] = value
    return merged

Wait, but the function is supposed to take nodes as input. But the nodes could be a list of dictionaries, or perhaps each node is a MappingNode. Also, the docstring says "any node values corresponding to duplicate keys", so perhaps the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and the function merges them.

But the original function signature is def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):, so nodes is probably a list of dictionaries. However, the context mentions that the code is using ruamel, so maybe the nodes are instances of ruamel's nodes. But the code example I wrote above uses standard dicts.

But the user's code context includes 'ruamel' as an imported package, so perhaps the nodes are ruamel's nodes. However, the code for merging would need to handle those nodes. But maybe the function is supposed to work with standard dictionaries, and the ruamel is just part of the project's context.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes, which are either dicts or other structures, and for each key, merge the values. The key point is that when merging, if the existing value is a dict and the new value is a dict, merge them recursively. Otherwise, the last value wins.

But the original code example I thought of would work for standard dicts. However, the user's code context includes 'ruamel' as an imported package, so perhaps the nodes are of type ruamel.yaml.nodes.MappingNode. In that case, the code would need to check if the value is a MappingNode and handle it accordingly.

But the user's code is supposed to be generated based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains."

So, the function is supposed to merge nodes, which are probably instances of a MappingNode (like from ruamel.yaml). So, the code would need to check if the value is a MappingNode. However, the code may not need to handle the ruamel nodes specifically, but rather treat them as dictionaries. Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to work with any structure that can be merged, and the 'MappingNode' is part of the docstring's context.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, I need to make assumptions. The code I wrote earlier would work for standard dictionaries. But perhaps the function is supposed to handle ruamel nodes. However, without more information, it's safer to assume that the nodes are standard dictionaries.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the context includes 'ruamel' as an imported package. So perhaps the nodes are instances of ruamel's nodes, and the function needs to merge them. However, the code would need to handle those nodes. For example, in ruamel.yaml, the nodes can be of type MappingNode, and when you load a YAML file, you get those nodes. So, perhaps the function is supposed to merge these nodes.

But how to merge them? The code would need to check if the value is a MappingNode, and if so, merge them recursively. However, the code would need to handle the case where the existing value is a MappingNode and the new value is also a MappingNode. Otherwise, the last value wins.

So, the code could be structured as follows:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in merged:
                if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([merged[key], value])
                else:
                    merged[key] = value
            else:
                merged[key] = value
    return merged

But this code assumes that the nodes are dictionaries. However, if the nodes are ruamel's MappingNodes, then perhaps the code should handle them as such. However, the code would need to check if the value is a MappingNode. But the code above uses isinstance(value, dict), which may not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the code should check if the value is an instance of a MappingNode.

But since the user hasn't provided specific details, perhaps the code should be written for standard dictionaries, as that's the most common case. However, the docstring mentions "MappingNode", so maybe the code should handle that. But without knowing the exact type, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes, which are dictionaries, and the code should handle merging them recursively. So the code I wrote earlier would work.

But the user's code context includes 'logger', 'load_configuration', 'include_configuration', etc. So maybe the function is part of a configuration loader that uses ruamel.yaml to parse YAML files, and the nodes are the parsed YAML nodes. In that case, the code would need to handle ruamel's nodes.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, the user's function signature is given, and the docstring says to merge node values. So, perhaps the code is supposed to merge a list of dictionaries, and the 'node' in the function refers to each dictionary in the list.

In that case, the code I wrote earlier would be correct. However, the user's code context includes 'ruamel', so maybe the nodes are of type ruamel.yaml.nodes.MappingNode, and the code should handle them. But how?

In that case, perhaps the code should check if the value is a MappingNode, and if so, merge them. However, the code would need to handle the merging of the nodes. For example, in ruamel.yaml, the MappingNode has a 'data' attribute that contains the actual dictionary. So, perhaps the code should check if the value is a MappingNode, and if so, merge their data.

But this is getting complicated. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the standard dictionary approach, as it's the most straightforward.

So, the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in merged:
                if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([merged[key], value])
                else:
                    merged[key] = value
            else:
                merged[key] = value
    return merged

But wait, the function is supposed to take 'nodes' as input. If nodes is a list of dictionaries, then this code would work. However, the function's name is 'deep_merge_nodes', which suggests that the nodes are nested. But the code above merges the nodes in the list, and for each node, it iterates through its key-value pairs.

But the code as written would merge all nodes in the list, and for each key, if it exists in the merged dictionary, it merges the values. However, the code uses [merged[key], value] as the list for deep_merge_nodes, which would pass two dictionaries to the function. But the function is designed to take a list of nodes, so this would be correct.

But wait, the function is called with 'nodes' as a list, and in the recursive call, we pass [merged[key], value], which is a list of two dictionaries. So, the function would merge them recursively.

This seems correct. However, the initial code may not handle the case where a node is not a dictionary. But according to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, the code assumes that the nodes are dictionaries, and the values are either dictionaries or other types.

So, this code should work. However, the user's context includes 'ruamel' as an imported package, so perhaps the nodes are instances of ruamel's MappingNode. In that case, the code would need to handle those nodes. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to adjust.

But given the information, the code I wrote should be acceptable. So, the final code would be as above.
