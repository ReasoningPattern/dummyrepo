Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _convert_non_cli_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what this method is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the method casts arguments to correct types by modifying the values_dict parameter. By default, all values are strings. The parameters are parser_name (the command name) and values_dict (a dictionary of arguments). 

Looking at the context provided, there are several other methods mentioned, like resolve_custom_types, validate_min_max_args, etc. But the main task here is to convert non-CLI arguments to their correct types. 

So, the method needs to iterate through the values_dict and convert each value to the appropriate type. But how do I know which type each argument should be? The context mentions methods like resolve_custom_types, which might be responsible for handling custom types. Maybe this method uses that?

Wait, the method is called _convert_non_cli_args, which suggests it's handling arguments that aren't from the CLI. But the parameters are parser_name and values_dict. The values_dict is a dictionary of arguments. So perhaps this method is part of a larger argument parsing system where some arguments come from CLI and others from other sources (like config files or environment variables), and this method converts those non-CLI arguments to their correct types.

But how to implement this? The method needs to process each key-value pair in values_dict. For each key, determine the expected type and cast the value accordingly. But how does it know the expected types? Maybe the spec_dict or some other structure holds the type information. However, the given context doesn't mention spec_dict directly here. 

Wait, looking back at the context, there's a mention of self.resolve_custom_types, which might be a method that handles custom types. So perhaps this method uses resolve_custom_types to handle any custom type conversions. Also, there's a method called create_complex_argumet_type, which might be related to creating complex argument types.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to handle basic type conversions like integers, booleans, etc., and then use resolve_custom_types for more complex types. 

But since the user hasn't provided the actual spec or type information, I need to make assumptions. Let me think of a standard approach. For example, if the values_dict has keys that correspond to arguments with specific types, the method could check each value and convert it if necessary.

For example, if an argument is supposed to be an integer, the method would convert the string value to an integer. Similarly for booleans, floats, etc. But how to determine which arguments need conversion? Perhaps the spec_dict (not mentioned here) contains the type information. However, since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the method is designed to handle basic types and rely on other methods for custom types.

Alternatively, maybe the method is part of a system where the types are determined by the parser's specifications, and this method is called after parsing to apply those conversions.

But given the lack of specific information, I'll proceed with a basic approach. Let's assume that the values_dict contains keys that need to be converted to their respective types. For each key in values_dict, we can check if the value is a string and convert it to the appropriate type based on some criteria. However, without knowing the exact types, this is tricky.

Wait, the method is called _convert_non_cli_args, which might imply that it's handling arguments that are not from the CLI, such as those from answer files or environment variables. These might have different type expectations. 

Another possibility is that the method is part of a system where arguments are parsed, and this method is responsible for converting them to their correct types, possibly using a spec_dict that defines the expected types for each argument. But again, without that data, it's hard to code.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to call another method, like resolve_custom_types, which handles the actual conversion. For example, the method might iterate through the values_dict and for each key, call resolve_custom_types to convert the value.

Looking at the context, there's a mention of self.resolve_custom_types. So maybe this method uses that. Let me check the context again. The context shows that self.resolve_custom_types is called in several places, like in the __init__ method and others. So perhaps the _convert_non_cli_args method is supposed to call resolve_custom_types on the values_dict.

Wait, the method's parameters include parser_name and values_dict. The resolve_custom_types method might take the arguments and convert them. So perhaps the _convert_non_cli_args method is a wrapper that calls resolve_custom_types with the values_dict.

But how? Let me think. If resolve_custom_types is a method that takes arguments and converts them, maybe the _convert_non_cli_args method is passing the values_dict to it. However, the exact parameters of resolve_custom_types are not given. 

Alternatively, maybe the _convert_non_cli_args method is responsible for converting the values_dict by checking each key and applying the necessary type conversions. For example, if an argument is supposed to be an integer, convert the string to an integer. But again, without knowing the expected types, this is challenging.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to write a method that iterates through the values_dict, and for each key, attempts to convert the value to a specific type based on some criteria. However, since the user hasn't provided the exact type information, I'll have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to call another method, like self.resolve_custom_types, which handles the actual conversion. So the code might look like:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    # Assuming resolve_custom_types is a method that handles the conversion
    self.resolve_custom_types(values_dict)

But that's a very simplistic approach. However, the user might expect that the method uses the resolve_custom_types method. Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to handle basic conversions.

Another possibility is that the method is part of a system where the types are determined by the parser's specifications, and this method is called after parsing to apply those conversions. For example, if the parser has options with type specifications, this method would convert the values accordingly.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to code. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to write a method that iterates through the values_dict and attempts to convert each value to a specific type, using the parser_name to determine which conversion rules to apply. However, since the parser_name is a command name, maybe it's used to select the appropriate conversion logic.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to handle the conversion of values that are not from the CLI, such as those from answer files. In that case, the method might check if the value is a string and convert it to the appropriate type based on some predefined rules.

Given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with writing a method that uses the resolve_custom_types method, as that's mentioned in the context. So the code would be:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    self.resolve_custom_types(values_dict)

But I need to make sure that the resolve_custom_types method is called with the correct parameters. However, the exact parameters of resolve_custom_types are not given. If resolve_custom_types is a method that takes the values_dict and applies the necessary conversions, then this code would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the method needs to process the values_dict in some way, like checking each key and converting the value. For example:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    for key, value in values_dict.items():
        # Determine the type based on some logic
        # For example, if the key is 'port', convert to integer
        if key == 'port':
            values_dict[key] = int(value)
        # Add more type conversions as needed

But without knowing the specific keys or types, this is just a guess. Given that the user hasn't provided more details, the safest bet is to assume that the method uses another method like resolve_custom_types to handle the conversions. Therefore, the code would be as follows.
