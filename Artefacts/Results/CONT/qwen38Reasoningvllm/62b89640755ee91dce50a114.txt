Okay, I need to create a Python function called tzname_in_python2 that takes a namefunc as an argument. The docstring says it's about changing Unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python 2, strings are by default ASCII, and Unicode is handled differently. The function probably needs to ensure that the output is a bytestring instead of a Unicode string. So, maybe the namefunc returns a Unicode string, and we need to encode it to bytes.

But how to check if we're in Python 2 or 3? Oh right, the six library has functions for that. Like six.PY2. So maybe the function uses that to determine which version it's running in.

Wait, the function is supposed to work in Python 2. So the goal is to make sure that the output is a bytestring. So, if the namefunc returns a Unicode string, we need to encode it. But what encoding? Probably 'utf-8' or something similar.

So the steps would be: call namefunc, get the result. If we're in Python 2, encode it to bytes. Otherwise, return it as is. But wait, in Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, so maybe the function is for compatibility, ensuring that even in Python 3, it returns bytes? Or maybe the namefunc is supposed to return a bytestring in Python 2, but in Python 3, it's handled differently.

Wait, the docstring says "Change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2". So the function is for Python 2, where Unicode strings are different from bytestrings. So, if the namefunc returns a Unicode string, we need to convert it to a bytestring. But how?

In Python 2, if you have a Unicode string, you can encode it to bytes using encode('utf-8') or similar. So the function would check if it's Python 2, and if so, encode the result of namefunc. Otherwise, return it as is.

But how to handle the return value? Let me think. The function tzname_in_python2 is probably a decorator or a wrapper around a function that returns a timezone name. For example, maybe it's used to wrap a function that returns a Unicode string, and in Python 2, that needs to be converted to a bytestring.

So the code would look something like this:

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = namefunc(*args, **kwargs)
        if six.PY2:
            return result.encode('utf-8')
        return result
    return wrapper

But wait, what if the namefunc returns a bytestring in Python 2? Then encoding again would cause an error. But the docstring says it's changing Unicode output into bytestrings. So perhaps the namefunc is expected to return a Unicode string in Python 2, and the function converts it to bytes.

But how to handle cases where the result is already a bytestring? Maybe the function should check if it's a Unicode string. But in Python 2, checking isinstance(result, unicode) would be necessary. However, using six's utilities might help.

Alternatively, using six.text_type to get the Unicode string, and then encode if in Python 2.

Wait, maybe the function is intended to ensure that the output is a bytestring in Python 2, regardless of what namefunc returns. So, if in Python 2, encode to bytes, else return as is.

But how to handle cases where the result is already a bytestring in Python 2? For example, if namefunc returns a bytestring, encoding it again would cause an error. But perhaps the function is designed to only be used when namefunc returns a Unicode string in Python 2.

Alternatively, maybe the function is used in a context where the namefunc returns a Unicode string in Python 2, and the wrapper converts it to bytes. So, the code would check if it's Python 2, and if so, encode the result to bytes. Otherwise, return it as is.

So the code would be:

import six

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    """
    Change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2
    """
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = namefunc(*args, **kwargs)
        if six.PY2:
            return result.encode('utf-8')
        return result
    return wrapper

But wait, in Python 2, the encode method is for strings. So if result is a Unicode string, encoding to 'utf-8' gives a bytestring. If it's already a bytestring, encoding would raise an error. But perhaps the function is designed to be used with namefunc that returns Unicode strings in Python 2, so this is safe.

But how to handle cases where the result is not a string? Well, maybe the function is intended for specific use cases where the result is a string.

So the code would be as above. Also, the user mentioned that the imported packages are datetime, functools, six. So the code uses six.PY2.

So the final code would be:

import six

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    """
    Change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2
    """
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = namefunc(*args, **kwargs)
        if six.PY2:
            return result.encode('utf-8')
        return result
    return wrapper

But the user said to not include any explanation, just the code. Also, the code should be in Python markdown format. So the code is as written above.
