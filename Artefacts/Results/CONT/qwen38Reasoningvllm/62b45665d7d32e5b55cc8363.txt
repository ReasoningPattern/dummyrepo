Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the make_parsers function based on the given function signature and docstring. They mentioned not to include any explanations, just the code in Python markdown format.

First, I need to understand what the make_parsers function is supposed to do. The docstring says it builds a parser and its subparsers and returns them as a tuple. So, the function should create an argparse.ArgumentParser instance and add subparsers to it.

Looking at the context, there are some imported packages: collections, argparse, borgmatic. Also, there are references to SUBPARSER_ALIASES, parse_subparser_arguments, and other functions like parse_arguments. But since the user hasn't provided the full code, I'll have to make assumptions based on typical argparse usage.

The function needs to create the main parser and subparsers. Typically, you create the main parser, then add subparsers with add_subparsers(). Then, for each subparser, you might define their own arguments. The SUBPARSER_ALIASES might be a dictionary mapping subparser names to their aliases. So, perhaps the function iterates over the keys in SUBPARSER_ALIASES to create subparsers.

Wait, the user mentioned that within the file, there's a variable called SUBPARSER_ALIASES. So maybe the make_parsers function uses that to create subparsers. Also, there's a function parse_subparser_arguments which takes unparsed arguments and subparsers. But since make_parsers is supposed to build the parser and subparsers, maybe it's setting up the structure.

So, the code for make_parsers would start by creating the main parser. Then, add subparsers. Then, for each subparser in SUBPARSER_ALIASES, create a subparser with the given name and possibly aliases. Then, maybe call parse_subparser_arguments to process them. But the function is supposed to return the parser and subparsers as a tuple.

Wait, the function is called make_parsers, so maybe it's creating the main parser and the subparsers. Let me think about the standard argparse setup.

The code would look something like:

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    # Then, for each subparser in SUBPARSER_ALIASES, create them
    for name, aliases in SUBPARSER_ALIASES.items():
        subparser = subparsers.add_parser(name)
        # Maybe set aliases here?
        # But argparse's add_parser has a help parameter, but aliases might be handled differently
        # Alternatively, maybe the aliases are used to create multiple subparsers with different names
        # But the exact implementation depends on the context
    return parser, subparsers

But the user mentioned that there's a function parse_subparser_arguments which takes unparsed_arguments and subparsers. So maybe make_parsers is setting up the subparsers, and then parse_subparser_arguments is used later to process them. However, the make_parsers function's job is just to create the parser and subparsers.

But the user's context also mentions that within the file, there's a variable SUBPARSER_ALIASES. So perhaps the code uses that variable to create the subparsers. For example, if SUBPARSER_ALIASES is a dictionary where keys are the subparser names and values are their aliases, then the code would loop through those.

But how to handle aliases in argparse? Typically, you can set the aliases using the add_parser method's aliases parameter. Wait, no, argparse doesn't have a direct way to set aliases for subparsers. Instead, you might have to create multiple subparsers with different names but the same underlying action. Alternatively, maybe the aliases are used to map command names to subparsers.

Alternatively, maybe the SUBPARSER_ALIASES is a dictionary where each key is the subparser name, and the value is a list of aliases. Then, for each subparser, you add it with the name and then set the aliases. But I'm not sure. Since the user hasn't provided the full code, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Assuming that SUBPARSER_ALIASES is a dictionary mapping subparser names to their aliases, the code might look like:

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    for name, aliases in SUBPARSER_ALIASES.items():
        subparser = subparsers.add_parser(name)
        # Maybe set aliases here? But argparse doesn't support that directly
        # So perhaps the aliases are handled elsewhere
    return parser, subparsers

But the user also mentioned that there's a function parse_subparser_arguments which takes unparsed_arguments and subparsers. So maybe the make_parsers function is just setting up the structure, and parse_subparser_arguments is used later to process the arguments.

But the user's instruction is to generate code for make_parsers. So the code should create the main parser and subparsers, possibly using SUBPARSER_ALIASES to create the subparsers.

Another possibility is that the SUBPARSER_ALIASES is a list of subparser names, and for each name, a subparser is added. So:

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    for name in SUBPARSER_ALIASES:
        subparsers.add_parser(name)
    return parser, subparsers

But without knowing the exact structure of SUBPARSER_ALIASES, it's hard to say. However, the user mentioned that parse_subparser_arguments is a function that takes unparsed_arguments and subparsers. So maybe the make_parsers function is creating the subparsers, and then parse_subparser_arguments is used to process them.

But the user wants the make_parsers function to return the parser and subparsers. So the code would be:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    # Assuming SUBPARSER_ALIASES is a list of subparser names
    for name in SUBPARSER_ALIASES:
        subparsers.add_parser(name)
    return parser, subparsers

But the user mentioned that the imported packages include collections, argparse, borgmatic. So perhaps the code uses some of those. However, the make_parsers function is likely to use argparse.

But the user's context says that within the file, there's a variable SUBPARSER_ALIASES. So the code would use that variable.

Putting it all together, the code would create the main parser, add subparsers, and for each entry in SUBPARSER_ALIASES, add a subparser. Then return the parser and subparsers.

So the final code would be:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    for name in SUBPARSER_ALIASES:
        subparsers.add_parser(name)
    return parser, subparsers

But the user also mentioned that there's a function parse_subparser_arguments which takes unparsed_arguments and subparsers. So maybe the make_parsers function is part of a larger setup where after creating the subparsers, they are processed by parse_subparser_arguments. However, the make_parsers function's job is just to build the parser and subparsers, so the code above should suffice.

Another thing to consider: maybe the subparsers are created with specific arguments. For example, each subparser might have a help message or other options. But without more information, it's hard to include that. The user's docstring doesn't mention any specific arguments, so the code should just create the basic structure.

So the final code is as above. But the user mentioned that the function is part of a file that has other functions and variables. So the code should not include any extra imports beyond what's already mentioned. The user's context says that the imported packages are collections, argparse, borgmatic. So the code should use those if needed, but in this case, argparse is already imported.

Therefore, the generated code should be as follows.
