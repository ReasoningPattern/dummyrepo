Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function is_file_exist based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function's purpose is to check if a file exists. The docstring says it checks whether file_name is an existing file. So the main task is to implement this check.

Looking at the imported packages: os is one of them. So I should use os.path.exists() or os.path.isfile() perhaps. Wait, the function needs to check if it's a file, not just a path. So os.path.isfile() would be more appropriate because it ensures that the path is a file, not a directory.

Wait, but maybe the function should check if the file exists regardless of being a file or directory? But the docstring says "existing file", so probably it's intended to check if it's a regular file.

So the steps would be: import os, then check os.path.isfile(file_name). But wait, the function is part of a class, as seen in the context. The context shows methods like self.get_file_size, self.append_binary_to_file, etc. So the function is part of a class, but the code for is_file_exist is standalone here.

Wait, the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the context includes other methods. But the code for is_file_exist needs to be written. So the function is part of a class, but the code should be written as a method.

Wait, the function is defined as def is_file_exist(file_name):, but in the context, it's mentioned as self.is_file_exist(file_name). So it's a method of a class. Therefore, the code should be part of a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition, so perhaps the function is part of a class, but the code should be written as a method.

But the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should be the method inside a class. However, the user hasn't specified the class name. But in the context, there's a mention of "Within class: self.get_file_size..." so perhaps the class is named something like FileHandler or similar. But since the user hasn't provided the class name, maybe the function is part of a class, but the code should be written as a method.

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class. However, the code generated should be the method. But the user hasn't provided the class name. So perhaps the function is part of a class, but the code should be written as a method. However, since the user hasn't provided the class name, maybe the code is written as a standalone function. But the context shows that it's part of a class, as there are other methods like self.get_file_size.

Hmm, but the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature. The function signature is given as def is_file_exist(file_name):, so perhaps it's a standalone function. However, in the context, it's part of a class. But without knowing the class name, maybe the code is written as a method. But the user hasn't provided the class name. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class, but the code should be written as a method. However, the user hasn't provided the class name. So maybe the code is written as a standalone function. But the context shows that it's part of a class. But perhaps the user just wants the function implementation, regardless of the class.

Alternatively, maybe the code should use the os module. So the function would check if the file exists. So the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, the context mentions imported packages: codecs, os, logging, pysolbase. So os is already imported. So the code can use os.path.isfile.

But the function is part of a class. So perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class. But since the class name isn't given, maybe the code is written as a standalone function. However, the context shows that it's part of a class. For example, self.is_file_exist(file_name) suggests that it's a method of a class. Therefore, the code should be written as a method inside a class.

But the user hasn't provided the class name. So perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class, but the class name is not specified. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is written as a standalone function. But the context suggests it's part of a class.

This is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function signature provided, the code would be a standalone function. But in the context, it's part of a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class name. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function. But the user's context shows that it's part of a class. But without knowing the class name, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class, and the function is a method. But since the class name is not given, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class with a placeholder name. However, the user hasn't specified that. So perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

But the user's context shows that other methods are part of a class, like self.get_file_size, etc. So the function is part of a class. Therefore, the code should be written as a method inside a class. But since the class name is not given, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class with a placeholder name. However, the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

But the function is called via self.is_file_exist, which implies it's a method. Therefore, the code should be written as a method inside a class. However, without the class name, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class, but the class name is not specified. But the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

But given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to write the function as a standalone function using os.path.isfile. However, the user's context shows that it's part of a class. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class. But since the class name is not given, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class with a placeholder name. But the user hasn't provided that.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class, and the class is named something like FileHandler. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is given as def is_file_exist(file_name):, so the code is a function. But in the context, it's part of a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class name. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

So, the code would be:

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    import os
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, the imported packages include os, so the code can assume that os is already imported. Therefore, the code can use os.path.isfile without importing again.

So the code would be:

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But the user's context mentions that the function is part of a class. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class. However, since the class name is not given, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class. For example:

class SomeClass:
    def is_file_exist(self, file_name):
        """
        Check whether file_name is an existing file.
        """
        return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But the user hasn't provided the class name. However, the function signature given is def is_file_exist(file_name):, which suggests that it's a standalone function, not a method. But the context shows that it's a method (self.is_file_exist). Therefore, there's a contradiction here.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is given as a standalone function. However, in the context, it's part of a class. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class, but the class name is not specified. However, the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, the code should be written as a method inside a class, but the class name is not given. But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, so the code should be written as a method.

But without knowing the class name, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class with a placeholder name. However, the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

But given the context, the function is part of a class. Therefore, the code should be written as a method. However, since the class name is not given, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class with a placeholder name, like FileHandler.

But the user hasn't specified that. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function. But the context shows that it's part of a class. Therefore, there's a conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class, and the class is named something like FileOperations. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

But the user's context shows that the function is part of a class. Therefore, the code should be written as a method. However, without the class name, perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class with a placeholder name. But the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function.

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to write the function as a standalone function using os.path.isfile, as that's the most straightforward implementation based on the function signature and docstring.
