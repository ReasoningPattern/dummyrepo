Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the validate_hierarchy method based on the given function signature and docstring. The key points are to not include any explanations, just the code in Python markdown format.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it validates the storage root hierarchy and returns the number of objects checked and how many were valid. The parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings, which are all boolean flags.

Looking at the context provided, there are several attributes and methods mentioned. For example, self.root, self.root_fs, self.object_paths, self.validate_extensions_dir, etc. These might be used within the function. The function might need to traverse the directory structure, check each object's validity, verify digests if required, and count the results.

I should start by initializing num_objects and good_objects to 0. Then, perhaps iterate over the object paths. For each object, check if it exists in the root_fs. If validate_objects is True, perform checks like existence and possibly digest validation. If check_digests is True, verify the digest. Also, handle any errors during traversal, logging them if necessary.

Wait, the context mentions self.traversal_error, which might be a method to log errors. Also, self.log is a logging instance. So, during validation, if an error occurs, we might call self.traversal_error with an error code, and if show_warnings is True, log warnings.

The function needs to return a tuple (num_objects, good_objects). So, after processing all objects, return those counts.

I need to make sure to use the attributes like self.root_fs to access the file system, self.object_paths to get the list of objects to check. Also, self.validate_extensions_dir might be called to validate extensions, but that's part of the context, not sure if it's directly used here.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize counters.
2. Iterate over each object path in self.object_paths.
3. For each path, check if it exists in root_fs.
4. If validate_objects is True, check if the object is valid (maybe by checking if it's a file, etc.).
5. If check_digests is True, verify the digest against expected values.
6. If any error occurs during these checks, log it using traversal_error and possibly show warnings.
7. Increment num_objects for each checked object.
8. If the object is valid, increment good_objects.
9. Return the counts.

But how exactly to check the object's validity? Maybe using self.validate method? Wait, the context has self.validate method which takes similar parameters. But the validate_hierarchy is supposed to validate the hierarchy, so maybe it's a higher-level check.

Alternatively, perhaps for each object path, check if it's present in the root_fs. If validate_objects is True, maybe check if it's a file or directory as per the disposition. Also, check digests if required.

Also, the function might need to handle the case where the root_fs is not initialized, so maybe call self.open_root_fs first? But the context shows self.open_root_fs is a method, so perhaps it's already handled elsewhere.

Putting this together, here's a possible code structure:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for path in self.object_paths:
        try:
            # Check if the object exists
            if not self.root_fs.exists(path):
                if show_warnings:
                    self.log.warning(f"Object {path} not found")
                continue
            # Validate object if required
            if validate_objects:
                # Perform validation checks, maybe check if it's a file or directory
                # Assuming self.validate is a method that checks validity
                if self.validate(path, validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings, lang='en'):
                    good_objects += 1
            else:
                good_objects += 1
            num_objects += 1
        except Exception as e:
            self.traversal_error(code=1)
            if show_warnings:
                self.log.warning(f"Error validating {path}: {str(e)}")
    return num_objects, good_objects

Wait, but the validate method is part of the context. The user's context shows self.validate is a method that takes validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings, show_errors, and lang. So maybe the validate_hierarchy uses self.validate for individual object checks.

But the function's docstring says it validates the hierarchy, which might involve checking the structure, not just individual objects. However, given the parameters, perhaps it's designed to check each object in the hierarchy.

Also, the function might need to check the root structure first, like self.check_root_structure, which is mentioned in the context. So maybe call that first?

But the user's context shows that self.check_root_structure is called within the file, perhaps as part of initialization. However, the validate_hierarchy is a method that might need to perform its own checks.

Alternatively, maybe the validate_hierarchy method is part of a larger validation process that includes checking the root structure, extensions, etc.

But given the information, I need to write code that fits the function signature and uses the attributes mentioned.

Another thing: the function returns num_objects and good_objects. So, the code must track these counts.

Putting all together, the code would:

- Iterate over object paths.
- For each, check existence.
- Validate if needed.
- Check digests if required.
- Count accordingly.

But without knowing the exact implementation of validate, it's a bit tricky. However, based on the parameters, perhaps the validate method is used here.

So, the code would look something like this, using the self.validate method, and handling errors.

But the user might expect that the validate_hierarchy method directly checks the hierarchy without relying on self.validate. However, given the context, it's possible that self.validate is part of the process.

Alternatively, maybe the validate_hierarchy is a higher-level function that calls other methods like validate_extensions_dir, check_root_structure, etc.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, I'll proceed with the most logical approach based on the given information.

So, the code would:

- Initialize counters.
- Loop through object paths.
- For each path, check existence.
- If validate_objects is True, perform checks (maybe using self.validate).
- If check_digests is True, check digests.
- Handle errors and warnings.
- Update counters.

Now, translating this into code, considering the attributes and methods available.

Also, the function might need to use self.root_fs to access the file system, and self.object_paths to get the list of paths to check.

So, the code would be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for path in self.object_paths:
        try:
            if not self.root_fs.exists(path):
                if show_warnings:
                    self.log.warning(f"Object {path} not found")
                continue
            if validate_objects:
                # Assume self.validate checks the object's validity
                # Maybe call self.validate with appropriate parameters
                # But the validate method has more parameters, so need to adjust
                # For example, self.validate(path, validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings, lang='en')
                # But the exact parameters might vary
                # Alternatively, perform checks manually
                # For example, check if it's a file or directory based on disposition
                # But without knowing the exact implementation, it's hard to say
                # So, perhaps assume that self.validate is called here
                # But since the user hasn't provided the validate method's code, I'll have to make assumptions
                # Maybe the validate method returns True if valid, False otherwise
                if self.validate(path, validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings, lang='en'):
                    good_objects += 1
            else:
                good_objects += 1
            num_objects += 1
        except Exception as e:
            self.traversal_error(code=1)
            if show_warnings:
                self.log.warning(f"Error validating {path}: {str(e)}")
    return num_objects, good_objects

But the validate method's parameters include show_errors, which isn't in the current function's parameters. However, the current function has show_warnings. Maybe the show_errors is handled differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the validate method is called with show_errors=False, and warnings are handled via show_warnings.

This is getting a bit complicated, but given the constraints, this seems like a plausible approach.

Another thing: the function might need to check the root structure first, so maybe call self.check_root_structure before proceeding. But the context shows that self.check_root_structure is called within the file, perhaps as part of initialization. However, the validate_hierarchy method might need to ensure the root structure is valid before proceeding.

So, adding a call to self.check_root_structure at the beginning:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    self.check_root_structure()
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # ... rest of the code ...

But the user's context shows that self.check_root_structure is called within the file, possibly in the class's methods. However, including it here might be necessary.

Putting it all together, the code would include calling check_root_structure, then proceed with validating each object.

Another consideration: the function might need to validate extensions, so perhaps call self.validate_extensions_dir.

But again, without more information, it's hard to say. However, based on the given context, the code should use the available methods and attributes.

So, the final code would look something like this, incorporating the above points.
