Okay, I need to create a Python function called strip_root that takes a path and a root, and removes the root from the path. If it fails, it should throw an exception. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should check if the path starts with the root. But wait, maybe the root is a directory, so I need to ensure that the path is under the root. For example, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs/file.txt', then stripping the root would give 'docs/file.txt'. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', then stripping would give 'user/docs'? Wait, no. Wait, the root is probably a directory, so the path should be a subpath of the root. So maybe the function checks if the path starts with the root, and if so, returns the remaining part. Otherwise, raises an exception.

Wait, but how to handle cases where the root is a prefix of the path. For example, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user', then stripping the root would give 'user'. But if the path is '/home/user/docs', then stripping the root would give 'user/docs'.

So the function should check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then return the substring after the root. Otherwise, raise an exception.

But what about if the root is not a prefix? Like, if the path is '/home/user' and the root is '/user'? Then the path doesn't start with the root, so it should raise an error.

So the steps are:

1. Check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception.
2. If it does, return the substring after the root.

But wait, what about if the root is a directory and the path is exactly the root? Like, path is '/home' and root is '/home'. Then stripping would return an empty string. But maybe that's acceptable.

But how to handle cases where the root is not a prefix. For example, path is '/home/user' and root is '/home/user/docs'. Then the path doesn't start with the root, so it's an error.

So the code would be something like:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is not a directory? Like, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user', then the code works. But what if the root is a file? Like, root is '/home/user.txt' and the path is '/home/user.txt/docs'? Then the path starts with the root, but that's not correct. But according to the problem statement, maybe the root is supposed to be a directory. However, the function's responsibility is just to remove the root from the path, regardless of whether it's a directory or not. So the function's logic is simply to check if the path starts with the root. If yes, return the rest. Else, raise an error.

But maybe there's a case where the root is a prefix but not the entire beginning. Like, if the path is '/home/user' and the root is '/home', then it's correct. But if the root is '/home/user', then the path would start with the root, and return empty string.

But the problem says "remove root from path". So the function is supposed to take the path and remove the root part. So the code as above would work.

But what about if the root is not a prefix? For example, path is '/home/user' and root is '/user'? Then the path does not start with the root, so it raises an error.

So the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what about if the root is an empty string? Well, the problem probably assumes that root is a valid path. But the function may need to handle that. However, the problem says "If fails, throw exception", so perhaps the function is supposed to handle cases where the root is not a prefix.

But according to the given function signature, the parameters are path and root. So the code above should work.

Testing some cases:

Case 1: path = '/home/user', root = '/home' → returns 'user'

Case 2: path = '/home/user/docs', root = '/home' → returns 'user/docs'

Case 3: path = '/home', root = '/home' → returns ''

Case 4: path = '/home/user', root = '/user' → raises error.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the code is as written above. Now, the user said to output only the code in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, the problem says "If fails, throw exception". The current code raises a ValueError. But maybe the problem expects a specific exception type? The docstring says "throw exception" but doesn't specify. So using ValueError is acceptable.

So that's the code.
