To solve this problem, we need to generate a Python method that removes and returns the least frequently used item from an OrderedDict. The method should be implemented in a class that uses the cache module's OrderedDict as its base.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: The task is to implement a `popitem` method that removes and returns the least frequently used `(key, value)` pair. This means we need to track the frequency of each item and remove the one with the lowest count.

2. **Use OrderedDict**: The class is likely using the OrderedDict from the collections module, which provides a way to maintain insertion order. We can leverage the existing methods and attributes of OrderedDict for our implementation.

3. **Track Frequencies**: We need to maintain a counter to track how frequently each item is accessed. This counter will be stored as an instance variable, `self.__counter`.

4. **Find the Least Frequently Used Item**: To find the least frequently used item, we will iterate through the counter and find the key with the smallest value. This key will be removed from both the counter and the OrderedDict.

5. **Remove the Item**: Once the key is identified, it will be removed from the counter and the OrderedDict. The item will be set to `None` to indicate its removal.

6. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that the method handles the case where the OrderedDict is empty by raising a `KeyError`.

### Solution Code

```python
def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("OrderedDict is empty")
    # Find the key with the smallest count
    min_key = min(self.__counter, key=lambda k: self.__counter[k])
    # Remove the key from the counter
    del self.__counter[min_key]
    # Remove the item from the OrderedDict
    self.__setitem__(min_key, None)
    # Remove the item from the ordered dict
    self.popitem()
```

### Explanation
- **Finding the Least Frequently Used Item**: The method uses `min` with a custom key function to find the key with the smallest count in the `self.__counter` dictionary.
- **Updating the Counter**: The identified key is removed from `self.__counter` to ensure it is not considered in future operations.
- **Removing the Item**: The item is set to `None` using `self.__setitem__` to mark its removal. Then, `self.popitem()` is called to remove the item from the OrderedDict, which also maintains the insertion order.

This approach ensures that the least frequently used item is efficiently identified and removed while maintaining the order of the remaining items.
