To solve this problem, we need to create a function that inserts a given value into a nested key within a dictionary. The function should traverse the dictionary using a series of keys provided as arguments and insert the value at the deepest level of the nested structure.

### Approach
The function `dict_insert` is designed to handle nested key insertions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Parameters**: The function takes four parameters: the dictionary `dic`, the value `val` to be inserted, the primary key `key`, and a variable number of additional keys `*keys`.
2. **Key Path Construction**: The primary key and additional keys are combined into a single string using the dot `.` as a separator. This string is then split into individual parts to form the key path.
3. **Traversal and Insertion**: Starting from the initial dictionary, the function traverses each part of the key path. For each part, if it exists in the current level, the function moves to the next part. If it does not exist, the function inserts the value at the current part and stops further traversal for that branch.

### Solution Code
```python
def dict_insert(dic, val, key, *keys):
    current = dic
    key_path = (key + '.' + '.'.join(keys)).split('.')
    for part in key_path:
        if part not in current:
            current[part] = val
        else:
            current = current[part]
```

### Explanation
- **Key Path Construction**: The key path is constructed by joining the primary key and additional keys with dots. For example, if the primary key is 'a' and additional keys are ['b', 'c'], the key path becomes 'a.b.c'.
- **Traversal**: The function starts at the initial dictionary and checks each part of the key path. If a part does not exist in the current level, it is created with the given value. If it exists, the function moves to the next part of the key path.
- **Insertion**: The value is inserted at the deepest level of the nested structure, ensuring that all ancestor keys are created if they do not already exist.

This approach ensures that the value is correctly inserted into the nested structure, with all necessary ancestor keys created as needed.
