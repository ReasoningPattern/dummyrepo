To calculate the integral of a function given its values at specified edges using the trapezoidal rule, we approximate the area under the curve by summing the areas of trapezoids formed between consecutive points.

```python
def integral(bins, edges):
    """
    Calculate the integral using the trapezoidal rule.
    """
    total_area = 0.0
    for i in range(len(edges) - 1):
        width = edges[i+1] - edges[i]
        height = (bins[i] + bins[i+1]) / 2
        total_area += width * height
    return total_area
```
