To solve this problem, we need to create a function that converts a given number of nanoseconds into a formatted datetime string. The function should also handle time zones, converting the nanoseconds into a datetime that is either naive (local time) or aware (specific time zone).

### Approach
1. **Convert Nanoseconds to Seconds**: Since 1 second is equal to 1,000,000,000 nanoseconds, we first convert the given nanoseconds into seconds by dividing by 1e9.
2. **Create a Datetime Object**: Depending on whether a time zone is provided, we create a datetime object. If no time zone is specified, we create a naive datetime in the local time zone. If a time zone is provided, we create a datetime in UTC and then convert it to the specified time zone.
3. **Format the Datetime String**: The resulting datetime object is formatted into a string using the fixed format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.

### Solution Code
```python
import time
from datetime import datetime, timezone
import pytz

def hydrate_time(nanoseconds, tz=None):
    secs = nanoseconds / 1e9
    if tz is None:
        dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(secs)
    else:
        dt = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(secs).astimezone(tz)
    return dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
```

### Explanation
- **Conversion of Nanoseconds to Seconds**: The function starts by converting the input nanoseconds into seconds, which simplifies the subsequent datetime conversion.
- **Handling Time Zones**: If a time zone is provided, the function first creates a datetime object in UTC using `datetime.utcfromtimestamp()`, then converts it to the specified time zone using `astimezone()`. If no time zone is provided, it creates a naive datetime object directly from the timestamp.
- **Formatting the Datetime String**: The formatted string ensures that the datetime is represented in a fixed format, making it easy to read and consistent across different contexts.

This approach ensures that the function handles both naive and aware datetimes correctly, providing a reliable conversion from nanoseconds to a human-readable datetime string.
