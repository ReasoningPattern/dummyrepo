To solve this problem, we need to generate a function that identifies all classes within a given list that do not have any subclasses. This involves checking each class to determine if it has any immediate or inherited subclasses. If a class does not have any subclasses, it should be included in the result list.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to identify all base classes within a given list of classes that do not have any subclasses. This means we need to check each class to see if it has any subclasses, either directly or indirectly.
2. **Intuition**: In object-oriented programming, a base class can have multiple subclasses. Therefore, for each class in the given list, we need to determine if it has any subclasses. If a class does not have any subclasses, it is considered a base class and should be included in the result.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: We will use the `inspect` module, specifically the `getsubclasses()` function, to check for the presence of any subclasses. This function returns a list of all subclasses of a given class, including any that are nested within other classes.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity of this approach is O(n * m), where n is the number of classes and m is the average number of subclasses per class. This is because for each class, we potentially check all its subclasses.

### Solution Code
```python
import inspect

def minimalBases(classes):
    minimal_bases = []
    for cls in classes:
        if not inspect.getsubclasses(cls):
            minimal_bases.append(cls)
    return minimal_bases
```

### Explanation
- **Importing the Module**: We import the `inspect` module to utilize its `getsubclasses()` function, which helps us identify all subclasses of a given class.
- **Loop Through Classes**: For each class in the input list, we check if it has any subclasses using `inspect.getsubclasses(cls)`.
- **Check for Subclasses**: If `getsubclasses(cls)` returns an empty list, it means the class does not have any subclasses, and thus it is a base class. We add such classes to our result list.
- **Return Result**: Finally, we return the list of base classes that do not have any subclasses.

This approach efficiently identifies all base classes by leveraging the `inspect` module, ensuring that we accurately determine the presence of subclasses for each class in the input list.
