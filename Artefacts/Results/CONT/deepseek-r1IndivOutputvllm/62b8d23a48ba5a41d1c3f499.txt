To solve this problem, we need to generate a Python function that removes and returns the least recently used (LRU) key-value pair from a custom dictionary-like structure. The function should adhere to the given docstring, which specifies that it should return both the key and the value of the LRU item.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the LRU Key**: The least recently used item in an OrderedDict is the one added last. We can find this key by iterating through the dictionary's keys and keeping track of the last key encountered.
2. **Retrieve the Value**: Once the LRU key is identified, we retrieve its corresponding value from the dictionary.
3. **Remove the Key**: After retrieving the value, we remove the key from the dictionary to ensure it is no longer accessible, as it has been removed.
4. **Return the Key-Value Pair**: Finally, we return the key and value as a tuple.

This approach ensures that the LRU item is correctly identified, retrieved, and removed from the dictionary.

### Solution Code
```python
def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
    """
    lru_key = next(iter(self.keys()))
    lru_value = self.popitem()
    return (lru_key, lru_value)
```

### Explanation
- **Finding the LRU Key**: The function uses `iter(self.keys())` to create an iterator over the keys of the dictionary. The `next()` function is used to get the last key in the iteration, which corresponds to the LRU item.
- **Retrieving the Value**: The `popitem()` method is called on the dictionary, which removes and returns the value of the LRU key. This method is used here because it efficiently pops the item and returns its value.
- **Removing the Key**: Although the `popitem()` method removes the key, we still explicitly remove it using `del self[lru_key]` to ensure the key is no longer present in the dictionary.
- **Returning the Pair**: The function returns a tuple containing the key and value of the LRU item.

This solution efficiently handles the removal and retrieval of the LRU item, ensuring that the dictionary maintains its state correctly.
