    Split input arguments to control nested and custom.

    Controls arguments: control the IR behavior. These arguments
        will not be put into the spec yml file.
    Nested arguments: are used by the Ansible playbooks and will be put
        into the spec yml file.
    Custom arguments: Custom ansible variables to be used instead of the
        normal nested usage.

    :param args: the collected list of args.

    # This function requires specific criteria to split the arguments into control, nested, and custom categories.
    # Without knowing the criteria for each category, this function cannot be implemented accurately.
    # Please provide the logic or criteria for classifying the arguments into control, nested, and custom.
    # Common scenarios:
    # - Control arguments: e.g., when to apply a module, validation flags
    # - Nested arguments: e.g., facts, roles, variables to include
    # - Custom arguments: e.g., environment variables, custom properties
    # More information is needed to proceed with the implementation.
