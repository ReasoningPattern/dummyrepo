Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given docstring. The function should remove and return the least recently used (LRU) item. Hmm, this makes me think that the class is probably implementing an LRU cache. So, the popitem method here is part of such a class.

First, I should consider what data structures are appropriate here. Typically, an LRU cache uses a combination of a dictionary and a doubly linked list to track the order of items. The dictionary holds the keys and references to the nodes in the linked list, which maintains the order of access. The least recently used item would be at the end of the linked list.

Wait, but the popitem method here is supposed to remove the LRU item, so maybe the class has a doubly linked list structure. The head of the list might point to the most recently used, and the tail to the least recently used. Alternatively, it could be the other way around. Let me think: when you access an item, you move it to the head (most recently used), so the tail is the LRU. So when you popitem, you remove the one at the tail.

But the code needs to be written in the context of the class. Since the user hasn't provided the entire class structure, I have to assume the necessary attributes. Typically, such a class would have a head and tail pointer for the linked list, and a dictionary mapping keys to nodes. Each node would have a key, value, prev, and next pointers.

So, in the popitem method, to get the LRU item, we'd go to the tail's prev node (since the tail is a dummy node sometimes used as a placeholder). Wait, maybe the actual tail is the LRU. Let me think of a standard LRU implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps the linked list is ordered such that the head is the most recently used, and the tail is the least. So when you pop, you remove from the tail. But in some implementations, the tail is a dummy node, so the actual last node is tail.prev. So when you pop, you get that node's key and value, then remove it from the list and the dictionary.

Assuming that the class has a __init__ method that sets up the head and tail, and a linked list. The popitem method would then need to:

1. Check if the structure is empty. But maybe the method can assume there's at least one item. Or it might need to handle that. The docstring doesn't mention raising an error, so perhaps it's supposed to work when there are items.

But the standard popitem in a dictionary (for popitem() in Python's dict, it's arbitrary, but in this case, it's LRU). So the code must work with the existing data structures.

The steps would be:

- Access the tail's previous node (the actual LRU node)
- Remove that node from the linked list (adjusting the next and prev pointers of adjacent nodes)
- Remove the key from the dictionary
- Return the key-value pair.

So, in code:

class might have:

self.cache (the dict), self.head, self.tail, and each node has prev and next.

Wait, perhaps the nodes are stored in the dictionary. Alternatively, the nodes are part of a linked list, and the dict maps keys to nodes.

So in the popitem method:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.tail.prev.key
    value = self.tail.prev.value
    # remove the node from the linked list
    self._remove_node(self.tail.prev)
    # remove from the dictionary
    del self.cache[key]
    return (key, value)

But how is the linked list managed? The _remove_node function would handle the prev and next pointers.

Alternatively, maybe the code is simpler, like if the class uses an ordered dictionary, but the problem requires implementing the LRU manually.

Alternatively, perhaps the class is using a list to track order, but that would be inefficient. The standard approach is the linked list with a dict.

But without knowing the exact class structure, I need to make assumptions. Let me think of a minimal case. Let's say the class has a 'head' and 'tail' as dummy nodes, and a 'cache' dictionary. Each node has 'prev' and 'next' pointers. The LRU is the node before the tail.

So the popitem method would do:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.tail.prev.key
    value = self.tail.prev.value
    self._remove_node(self.tail.prev)
    del self.cache[key]
    return (key, value)

But then the _remove_node method would adjust the links. However, the user's code shouldn't have an underscored method unless it's part of the class. Maybe the code is supposed to be self-contained without helper functions, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a list or deque, but that might not track LRU properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the class uses a list where the first element is the oldest. But inserting and moving elements around would be O(n), which is not efficient but possible for small cases.

Alternatively, the code might be using an OrderedDict, but the problem is to write the popitem method. However, in Python's collections.OrderedDict, popitem can take a last argument, but the default is to pop the last item (LRU if you reposition items on access). So maybe the class is a subclass of OrderedDict, but the user wants to implement the LRU manually?

Alternatively, the code is part of a class that's supposed to be an LRU cache, and the popitem is removing the LRU. So the code would have to track the order of insertion or access.

Hmm. Since I can't see the class's other methods, I have to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the standard linked list approach.

The code for popitem would need to access the tail's previous node. Let's assume that the class has a tail node, and the last node is before the tail. So:

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.capacity = ...  # but maybe not needed here
        self.cache = {}
        self.head = DLinkedNode()
        self.tail = DLinkedNode()
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head

    class DLinkedNode:
        def __init__(self, key=0, value=0):
            self.key = key
            self.value = value
            self.prev = None
            self.next = None

Then, the popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    res = self.tail.prev.key, self.tail.prev.value
    self._remove_node(self.tail.prev)
    del self.cache[res[0]]
    return res

But in the user's question, the method is called popitem and the code must be written without other context. Since the user wants only the code for the popitem method, perhaps the code is part of a class that has a 'head' and 'tail' and a 'cache' dictionary, and a helper method to remove nodes.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a list to track the order, but that's less efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is using a dictionary and a list where the list is kept in order, with the first element being the oldest. Each time an item is accessed, it's moved to the end. Then, when popping, you remove the first element. But inserting and moving would be O(n), but for the code's sake, maybe it's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a deque. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class where the least recently used is the first element in a list. But without more context, I have to proceed with the linked list approach.

Assuming that the class has a 'tail' node, and the LRU is at the tail's previous node. The code would then:

- Get the key and value from that node.
- Remove the node from the linked list.
- Remove from the cache.

But how to code that without the helper function?

Alternatively, in the popitem method:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.tail.prev.key
    val = self.tail.prev.value
    # Remove from linked list
    prev_node = self.tail.prev.prev
    next_node = self.tail.prev.next
    prev_node.next = next_node
    next_node.prev = prev_node
    # Remove from cache
    del self.cache[key]
    return (key, val)

This way, without a helper function, but directly manipulating the nodes. But this requires that the tail's previous node is the one to remove, and that the tail has a prev, etc.

This code would work if the linked list is properly set up. So, the popitem method is written this way.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that uses a list to track the order of keys, and the list's first element is the LRU. So:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.order[0]
    value = self.cache[key]
    del self.cache[key]
    del self.order[0]
    return (key, value)

But that's only if the order is maintained in a list where the first is LRU, but then you have to manage the list when items are accessed, which the popitem doesn't handle. But the problem says the method is to remove the least recently used, so this approach might not be sufficient unless other methods are maintaining the order.

Since the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring, and not to include explanations, I'll proceed with the linked list approach's code as the most plausible.

So the code would look something like:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.tail.prev.key
    val = self.tail.prev.value
    n = self.tail.prev
    n.prev.next = self.tail
    self.tail.prev = n.prev
    del self.cache[key]
    return (key, val)

But I need to ensure that the code correctly adjusts the linked list pointers. The node to remove is n = tail.prev. Its previous node is n.prev, and next is tail. So setting n.prev's next to tail, and tail's prev to n.prev.

Yes, that should work. So the code would be as above. But in Python, the node would have to have prev and next attributes. So assuming the class's nodes are properly structured, this code should work.

Another possible way is:

def popitem(self):
    node = self.tail.prev
    key = node.key
    val = node.value
    node.prev.next = self.tail
    self.tail.prev = node.prev
    del self.cache[key]
    return (key, val)

That's a bit more concise. So that's probably better.

Therefore, the code for the popitem method would be:

def popitem(self):
    node = self.tail.prev
    key = node.key
    val = node.value
    node.prev.next = self.tail
    self.tail.prev = node.prev
    del self.cache[key]
    return (key, val)

This assumes that the class has a tail and a cache, and the nodes have prev and next pointers. It removes the node from the linked list and the cache, then returns the key-value pair.
