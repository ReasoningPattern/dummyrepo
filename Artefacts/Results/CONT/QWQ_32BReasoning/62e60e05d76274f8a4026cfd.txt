Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'index' and it takes 'self' and 'key' as parameters. The docstring says it returns the key as an integer. 

Wait, the function is part of a class since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The task is to convert the key to an integer and return it. But what if the key isn't already an integer? Like, maybe it's a string that can be converted. But the docstring doesn't mention handling errors, so maybe we just assume the key can be converted.

Hmm, the function's purpose is to return the key as an int. So the code inside should probably be something like return int(key). But wait, the parameter is named 'key'â€”is there a chance that this is part of a dictionary, like getting the index of a key? Or maybe the key is an object that has an __int__ method?

No, the docstring is straightforward: "Returns the key in the form of int." So the simplest approach is to cast the key to an integer. So the function body would be just returning int(key). 

Wait, but maybe the key is supposed to be an index, like in a list? Like, if the class has some collection and the key is a string representation, then converting it to int to use as an index. But the function's responsibility is just to return the key as an int. So regardless of context, the code is straightforward.

So the code would be:

def index(self, key):
    """
    Returns the key in the form of int.
    """
    return int(key)

But I should check if there's any other consideration. The problem says "based on the function signature and docstring" and not to include any explanations. So that's the code. Let me make sure there's no error. For example, if key is something that can't be converted, it will throw an exception. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that, so the function is just doing the conversion. 

Yes, that should be it.
