Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_arguments that takes in *unparsed_arguments and returns a dictionary mapping the parameters. Hmm, the function's docstring says it parses parameters and returns them as a dict. So, the input is a variable number of arguments, probably strings in the format of key=value pairs. Like, if someone calls parse_arguments("name=John", "age=30"), the function should return {"name": "John", "age": "30"}.

First, I should think about how to process each of the unparsed arguments. Each argument is a string, and I need to split them into key-value pairs. The split should happen on the equals sign, but maybe there's cases where there's no equals? Like, what if an argument is just "debug" without a value? Or maybe the function expects each argument to be in key=value format. The problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps I can assume that each argument is a key-value pair separated by an equals.

So for each argument in unparsed_arguments, I can split on '=', maybe using split('=') once. So split each argument into two parts. Then, add those to the dictionary. But need to handle cases where there's more than one equals sign? Like "key1=value1=value2". In that case, splitting on the first equals would be better, so maybe split once. So using split('=', 1) which splits at the first equals. That way, even if the value has an equals, it's kept as part of the value. Although, maybe the input is such that each argument is properly formatted. But better to handle that.

So the steps are:

Initialize an empty dictionary.

Loop over each argument in *unparsed_arguments:

   For each arg_str, split into parts using split('=', 1). So parts will be a list of 2 elements if there's an equals, else 1.

   If the split results in a list with only one element (meaning no '=' found), then maybe that's an error? Or perhaps the key is present without a value. But the problem says "parameters", which usually have values. So maybe in that case, the value is an empty string, or perhaps we raise an error? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps we proceed by assuming that each argument must have a value. Alternatively, perhaps the key is the entire string and the value is None? But the problem isn't clear. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe just split and if there's only one part, then the key is that part, and the value is None or an empty string? Or perhaps we should ignore such arguments? Hmm. The problem's example in the docstring isn't given, but the example I thought of earlier expects each argument to have a key and value. So maybe in the code, we can split into two parts, and if split into one part, then that's an invalid argument, but the problem might not require error checking. Since the function's docstring doesn't mention handling errors, perhaps just proceed and for such cases, the key would be the entire string, and the value would be None? Or maybe leave it as a key with an empty value. Alternatively, maybe the function just skips those? Hmm. Well, perhaps the code should just split on the first '=', and if there's no '=', then the key is the whole string, and the value is an empty string? Or maybe that's not the case. Let me think again. Let's suppose the input is like ["name=John", "age=30", "debug"], then the third argument "debug" would split into ["debug"], so key is "debug" and value is None? Or perhaps the value is an empty string? Or maybe we just ignore those? Since the problem's example didn't mention this, perhaps the function is designed such that each argument is a key-value pair. So perhaps the code should split, and if the split gives only one part, then raise an error? But the function's docstring doesn't mention error handling. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe proceed by just taking the first part as key and the second as value, and if no '=', then the key is the entire string and the value is an empty string? Or maybe the value is None. Alternatively, perhaps in such cases, the key is present with a value of True? Like for flags. But that's an assumption. Since the problem says "parameters", maybe each has a value. So the code should split, and if the split has only one part, then that's an error, but since the function doesn't have to handle that, perhaps proceed and set the value as an empty string. Or maybe the code just proceeds and for such cases, the key is added with an empty value. Let me proceed with splitting on the first '=', so using split('=',1), then check if the length is 2. If yes, then key and value. Else, perhaps the key is the entire string and the value is an empty string. Or maybe the function just ignores it. Hmm, perhaps the code should process all arguments, and for each, split into two parts. So, for each arg_str in unparsed_arguments:

   parts = arg_str.split('=', 1)

   if len(parts) != 2:

       # handle error, but perhaps just skip? Or set value to empty?

       # Maybe add to the dict with the key as parts[0], and value as empty string?

       # Or perhaps the problem expects that each argument is properly formatted.

       # Since the problem didn't specify, perhaps proceed by assuming that each argument has exactly one '=', so split into two parts.

       # So, in code, perhaps proceed, and if parts is only one element, then the key is parts[0], and value is an empty string?

       # Or maybe the value is None? But in the dictionary, we can have the value as an empty string.

   So in the code:

   key, value = parts if len(parts) == 2 else (parts[0], '')

   Then add to the dict.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should just split, and if there's more than one part, use the first as key and the rest (joined?) as value. Wait, split with maxsplit 1 would split into two parts, even if the value has an '='. So for example, 'a=b=c' would split into ['a', 'b=c'], so key is 'a', value is 'b=c'.

So that's correct. So the code would be:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):

    args_dict = {}

    for arg in unparsed_arguments:

        parts = arg.split('=', 1)

        if len(parts) == 2:

            key, value = parts

        else:

            key = parts[0]

            value = ''

        args_dict[key] = value

    return args_dict

Wait, but what if the argument is something like "key==value"? Then split on first '=' would give ['key', '=value'], which is correct. The key is 'key' and the value is '=value'. So that's okay.

Testing this code with the example ["name=John", "age=30"], the result would be {"name": "John", "age": "30"}, which is correct. If there's an argument like "debug", then key is 'debug' and value is empty string. So the dict would have "debug": "".

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that arguments without '=' are ignored? But the problem's docstring says "parses parameters", so perhaps they are all key-value. But since it's unclear, the code proceeds as above.

Another possible edge case: empty string as an argument? Like parse_arguments(""). Then parts would be [""], so key is "", value is ""? Not sure, but the code would handle it.

So the code as written should work. Let me see if there's any other edge cases. Like if an argument is "key=" (ends with equals), then split into ['key', ''], so the value is empty string, which is okay.

Yes, that's correct. So the code should handle all cases by splitting into two parts, using split('=',1). So the code seems okay.
