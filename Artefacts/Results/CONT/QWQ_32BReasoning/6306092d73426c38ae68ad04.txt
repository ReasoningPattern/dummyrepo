Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method get_parser_option_specs based on the provided docstring. Let's see. The function is part of a class, given the self parameter. The goal is to get all the options for a specified command, like 'main', 'virsh', etc. The return value should be a list of those options.

Hmm, first, I should think about how this method would typically access the command's options. Maybe the class has some internal data structure storing commands and their options. Perhaps there's a dictionary where each command name maps to its parser options. So the method would look up the command_name in that dictionary and return the corresponding options list.

Wait, the function's docstring says it returns the list of all command options. So the code needs to retrieve that list. Let's assume that the class has an attribute like _command_parsers or something similar. For example, maybe each command is stored in self.commands, where each entry has an 'options' attribute. Or perhaps the options are stored directly in a dictionary under the command's key.

Let me structure this. The method would first check if the command exists in the stored data. If it does, return the options. If not, maybe raise an error or return an empty list? The docstring doesn't mention handling errors, so perhaps it's assumed the command exists. But the function's return is specified as the list, so I should just return the options.

So the code might look like:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self.commands[command_name]['options']

But maybe the actual structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the parser uses an argparse-like structure, and the options are stored in some way. But without more context, I have to go with the simplest approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is part of a class that uses a dictionary to map command names to their Option objects or specs. So the code would be straightforward: access the command's entry and extract the options.

Another possibility: the method might loop through some parser's actions to collect options. But that's more complex. The docstring's return is a list of options, so maybe the data is already stored in a list.

Putting it all together, the code would involve accessing a data structure in the class. Since I don't have the rest of the class's code, I'll assume that there's a self.command_options dictionary where the keys are command names and the values are the list of options. So the method would simply return self.command_options.get(command_name, []) or similar. But the docstring says to return the list, so maybe it's required, so just self.command_options[command_name].

Wait, but the user's function's docstring says "Gets all the options for the specified command". So the code must retrieve that. The actual implementation would depend on how the class is structured. Since the problem is to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, perhaps the code is as simple as returning some stored value.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that uses a parser like argparse, and the options are collected by inspecting the parser's added arguments. But that's more involved, and the docstring doesn't hint at that.

So the minimal code would be to have a data structure in the class that maps command names to their options. So the method would look up the command and return the list. Let's code that.

Wait, the function's name is get_parser_option_specs. Maybe the options are stored in some specs structure. Let's say the class has a _parser_options attribute which is a dictionary where each key is a command name and the value is the list of options. Then the code would be:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self._parser_options[command_name]

But what if the command isn't present? The docstring's return doesn't specify handling that, so perhaps it's an error. But maybe the method should return an empty list? Not sure. The problem states to generate the code based on the docstring, so perhaps the code is as straightforward as possible.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a larger system where the command's options are stored in a list under the command's name in a dictionary. So the code is just returning that list.

Therefore, the code would be:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self.command_options[command_name]

But to make it more general, perhaps using a get with a default, but the docstring implies that the command exists. Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class where each command is an object with an options attribute. But without more info, the first approach is better.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that uses a method to collect options from some parser. For example, using an argparse.ArgumentParser for each command, then extracting the options. But that would require more code. Since the problem says to generate code based on the signature and docstring, I think the answer is to return a stored list from a dictionary or similar structure.

So, the code would be something like:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self._options.get(command_name, [])

But again, the docstring says "the list of all command options", implying that it's available. Maybe the code is:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self.parser_specs[command_name]['options']

But since I don't know the exact structure, perhaps the simplest is to return self.command_options[command_name], assuming that the command exists. Alternatively, perhaps the method is part of a class where each command's options are stored in a list under a dictionary, so the code is as I first thought.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to return an empty list if the command isn't found, but the docstring's return doesn't specify that. The function's docstring says "the list of all command options", so it's probably expected to return the list even if empty. But maybe the code is just returning whatever is stored.

In any case, the code must be written without additional context. The user's example in the think section shows that the code is to be output in a markdown code block. So, I'll proceed with the code that uses a dictionary in the class, like:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self._command_options[command_name]

But perhaps the correct structure is to have a list stored. Alternatively, maybe the code is:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self.options.get(command_name, [])

But the problem says to return the list, so perhaps the first approach is better. Alternatively, perhaps the method is part of a class that has a _command_parsers dictionary, and each parser has an .option_specs attribute. Then:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self._command_parsers[command_name].option_specs

But without knowing the exact structure, I have to make a reasonable assumption. The key is that the method takes the command name and returns the list of options stored for that command.

Let me go with the simplest possible code that fits the signature and docstring. Assuming that the class has a data member called _command_options which is a dictionary mapping command names to their option lists:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self._command_options[command_name]

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a method to retrieve the options from some other structure. But given the information, this seems like the best approach.
