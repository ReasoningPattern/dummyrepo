Okay, I need to write a Python function called _c_optimizations_ignored based on the given docstring. The function should check the environment variable PURE_PYTHON. If it's set and not equal to "0", then return True. Otherwise, return False.

Hmm, first, how do I get the environment variable in Python? Oh right, os.environ.get. So I should import os. Wait, but the function doesn't have an import statement. Oh well, the user probably expects that I include the necessary import. But the problem says to generate the code based on the signature and docstring, so maybe the function is part of a module where os is already imported. Or maybe I should include the import inside the function?

Wait the function's code needs to be self-contained. So I should start with importing os. Let me check the docstring again. The condition is if the environ "PURE_PYTHON" is not None and not 0. Wait, the environ value is a string. So when we get it via os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON"), if it's not present, it returns None. If it is present, the value is a string. So the logic is: if the environment variable exists (i.e., get returns a string) and that string is not "0", then return True. Else False.

So the steps are:

1. Check if os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON") is not None. If it is None, then return False.

2. If it's not None, then check if the value is not equal to "0". If it's any other value (like "1", "yes", "true", etc.), then return True. Because the condition says "not 0".

So putting it all together:

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    import os  # Wait, but maybe the function is in a context where os is already imported? The problem says to generate the code, so I should include the import statement here.

    pure_python = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return pure_python is not None and pure_python != '0'

Wait, but the docstring says "if get 'PURE_PYTHON' environ is not none and not 0". So the return is True when both conditions are met. So the code would be as above.

Wait, but in Python, the get method returns the string value. So even if the env variable is set to "0", then we return False. So yes, that's correct.

So the code would be:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    pp = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return pp is not None and pp != '0'

But the function's code needs to be in the correct structure. Wait, the function's code must not have any other imports, but the import os must be outside? Or can I have the import inside the function? Well, in Python, you can import inside the function. So maybe to keep it self-contained, include the import inside.

Wait, but if the function is called multiple times, it would re-import each time, which is allowed but a bit inefficient. However, the problem doesn't specify performance concerns, so that's acceptable.

Alternatively, the code could be written as:

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    import os
    return os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON", None) not in (None, '0')

Wait, no. Let's think: The original condition is (PURE_PYTHON is not None) and (PURE_PYTHON is not '0'). So the return value is True when both are true. The expression (env_var is not None and env_var != '0') is equivalent to that.

Alternatively, the code can be written as:

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    import os
    value = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return value and value != '0'

Wait, no. Because if value is "0", then value is truthy (since it's a non-empty string), so the first part (value) would be True, then the second part (value != '0') would be False. So the total would be False. That works. Wait, but what if the value is None? Then the first part (value) is False, so the whole expression is False. So that's the same as the original logic. Because:

value is not None and (value != '0') is equivalent to (value and value != '0') because if value is None, then value is falsy, so the first term is False. So the two expressions are equivalent. So maybe this is a more concise way.

So perhaps the code can be written as:

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    import os
    return os.getenv("PURE_PYTHON", "") not in ("", "0")

Wait, no. Because os.getenv with a default of "" would return an empty string if the variable isn't set, so the check would be if it's not in ("", "0"). Wait, no, that would invert the logic. Let me think:

If the variable is not set, getenv returns None, but if the default is "", then it would return "" in that case. So, if the variable is set to "0", then it would be in the excluded list, so return False. But the code would return True only if the value is not "" and not "0". But the original condition is that the variable is set (i.e., not None) and not "0".

Hmm, perhaps the concise way is better. Alternatively, the first approach is clearer.

So the best way is probably:

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    import os
    value = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return value is not None and value != '0'

That's straightforward and matches the docstring's description.

So that's the code. I'll write that.
