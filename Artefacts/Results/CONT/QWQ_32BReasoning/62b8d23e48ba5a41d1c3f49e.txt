Okay, I need to write the popitem method for this class. The docstring says to find, remove, and return a random (key, value) pair using __choice. Hmm, wait, how does __choice work here? Oh right, maybe the class has a __choice method that can pick a random key. But wait, in Python, dictionaries have a popitem method that removes and returns an arbitrary item. But the user wants to use __choice to select the random pair. 

Wait, maybe the __choice method is a helper function in the class that returns a random key. So first, I need to get a random key using self.__choice(). Then, once I have that key, I can pop it from the dictionary. But how does __choice work? Since I can't see the rest of the class, I have to assume that __choice is a method that returns a random key from the dictionary. 

Alternatively, maybe __choice is part of the internal implementation. Let me think. The function's docstring mentions using __choice in the class. So the steps would be: call self.__choice() to get a random key, then call pop on that key. 

Wait, but what if the dictionary is empty? Then this would raise a KeyError. So I need to handle that. Oh right, the popitem method in the standard dict does raise KeyError if the dict is empty. So I need to check if the dictionary is empty first. 

Wait, but how do I check if the dictionary is empty? The class might have a __keys list or something. Wait, maybe the __choice method already takes care of that. Or perhaps the __choice method returns None if there are no elements, so I need to check that. 

Hmm, perhaps the __choice method returns a random key, and if there are no keys, it raises an error. But I can't be sure. Alternatively, maybe the __choice method is part of the class's internal structure, so I should proceed as follows:

First, get the random key by calling self.__choice(). Then, if the key exists, pop it from the dictionary. But how is the data stored? Assuming that the class has a dictionary stored as an instance variable, like self.data, then:

key = self.__choice()
value = self.data.pop(key)
return (key, value)

But I need to make sure that the key actually exists. Wait, perhaps the __choice method returns a key only if there are items. So if the dictionary is empty, __choice would raise an error. Alternatively, maybe the __choice method returns None in that case, so I have to check.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method is a helper that selects a random key from the keys of the dictionary. So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.data:  # assuming self.data is the underlying dict
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = self.__choice()
    return key, self.data.pop(key)

But the problem is that I don't know the exact structure of the class. The user hasn't provided the rest of the code, so I have to make some assumptions. The function's docstring says to use __choice in the class. So the code should use self.__choice() to get the key. 

Assuming that __choice returns a key, and that if there's no key (empty dict), then it would raise an appropriate error. Alternatively, maybe the __choice method can return a key even when the dict is empty, so I need to check first. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method returns a random key, and if there are none, it would return None, so I need to check that. 

Hmm, but in the standard popitem(), when the dict is empty, it raises a KeyError. So perhaps in this code, I need to check if the dictionary is empty first. But how?

Wait, perhaps the __choice method will only be called if there are elements. So maybe the __choice method itself will raise an error when the dict is empty. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method is something like picking a random element from a list of keys. So perhaps the class maintains a list of keys, and __choice selects one. 

Well, given the information, I have to proceed. Let's assume that the __choice method returns a key, and that if the dictionary is empty, it would raise an error. So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return key, self.pop(key)

Wait, but how does self.pop(key) work? The pop method would have to exist. Wait, maybe the class has a pop method, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the underlying data is stored in a dictionary, so perhaps self.data.pop(key). 

Alternatively, perhaps the class is a subclass of dict, so that popitem can access the internal dictionary. 

Wait, perhaps the code is part of a dictionary-like class where the data is stored in a dictionary instance variable called something like self.items. 

In any case, the user hasn't provided that, so I have to make minimal assumptions. The key steps are:

1. Use self.__choice() to get a random key. 
2. Remove that key and its value from the dictionary.
3. Return the key-value pair as a tuple. 

So, assuming that the class has a __choice method that returns a key, and that the data is stored in a dictionary (like self._data), then the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self._data.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But since the problem says to not include any explanation, I need to write the code without knowing the exact data structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method returns a (key, value) pair directly? The docstring says "Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice". Wait, maybe the __choice method returns a random key-value pair, but then you have to remove it. 

Wait, perhaps the __choice method is used to select the key, and then you pop it. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method is a helper that returns a random key, and then you proceed to remove it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice is a method that returns a random key, and then you get the value and remove it. 

Hmm, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the following code structure:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self.pop(key)
    return key, value

Wait, but the pop method would need to exist. Alternatively, perhaps the class has a __dict__ or some storage. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method returns the key, then the code uses del to remove it and store the value. But that might be tricky. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice method returns the key, and then the code uses pop on the dictionary. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that uses a dictionary, so that the __choice method returns a key, and then the code does:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self._storage.pop(key)
    return key, value

But since the problem doesn't specify the internal storage, perhaps the code can use the pop method of the class. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice method returns a key, and then the code uses the __delitem__ method to remove it, but then need to get the value first. 

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The function's docstring says to use __choice in the class. So the __choice method is part of the class's implementation. 

Suppose that __choice returns a random key from the dictionary. Then, the code would:

- Call __choice to get a key.
- Then, remove that key from the dictionary (using pop or del).
- Return the key and value.

Assuming that the class has a dictionary stored in self.data, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    val = self.data.pop(key)
    return (key, val)

Alternatively, if the class is a subclass of dict, then self.pop would work:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return key, self.pop(key)

But then, the pop method would have to be properly implemented. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice method is supposed to return a tuple of (key, value), but that's not clear from the docstring. 

The docstring says "Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice". Wait, maybe the __choice method is responsible for finding and removing the pair? That would make sense. Like, the __choice method might return a random key-value pair and remove it. 

In that case, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    return self.__choice()

But that seems too simple, and the __choice method would have to handle the removal. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method just returns the key, then the code uses that key to get the value and remove it. 

Hmm. Given the ambiguity, I think the most plausible approach is to call __choice to get a key, then pop that key from the underlying dictionary and return the pair. 

Therefore, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return key, self.pop(key)

But this assumes that the class's pop method can retrieve and remove the key. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice method returns a (key, value) pair, and then you have to remove the key from the data structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method returns the key, and then you have to get the value and then remove it. 

Wait, perhaps the __choice method is a helper that selects a random key from the available keys. Once the key is selected, you can get its value and then remove the key from the dictionary. 

So, the steps would be:

1. Get the key via self.__choice().
2. Get the value using self[key].
3. Remove the key using del self[key].
4. Return the tuple (key, value).

But then, if the key is not present (though __choice should ensure it is), but that's a possible edge case. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should first check if the dictionary is empty. 

Hmm, given the time constraints, I think the best approach is to assume that __choice returns a key, and then to pop it using the dictionary's pop method. So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return key, self.pop(key)

Wait, but the pop method would return the value, so that's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method returns a key and the value, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice method is a method that returns a random key, and then the code needs to retrieve the value and remove it. 

In that case, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But this could have a problem if the key is not present, but assuming that __choice returns a valid key, this would work. 

However, using del might not be the best approach if the underlying storage is a dictionary, because then you have to check existence. Alternatively, using pop with a default might be better. 

Alternatively, using pop without a default would raise KeyError if the key is not present, but since __choice is supposed to return a valid key, this shouldn't happen. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice method returns a key, and then the code uses pop on that key, which would remove it and return the value. 

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return (key, self.pop(key))

This seems concise and plausible. 

I think this is the best approach given the information. So I'll write the code as such.
