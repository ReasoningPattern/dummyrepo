Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_file_exist that checks if a given file name exists. Let's see. The function should take the file_name as a parameter. The docstring says to check whether it's an existing file.

Hmm, right, in Python, to check if a file exists, I can use the os.path module. Oh right, os.path.isfile() is probably the right function here. Because that returns True if the specified path is an existing regular file. That's exactly what we need.

Wait, maybe I should also consider exceptions? Like if the file is in a directory the user can't access, but os.path.isfile should handle that by just returning False in such cases? Or maybe it raises an exception? I think os.path.isfile would return False if the path doesn't exist, regardless of permissions. But maybe I should use os.path.exists instead? Wait no, because os.path.exists returns True for both files and directories. So if the file_name is actually a directory, then isfile would be False. So the correct approach is to use os.path.isfile(file_name).

So the code would be something like:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

Wait, that's all? Seems straightforward. Let me make sure. The function should return a boolean indicating if the file exists. Yes, os.path.isfile does exactly that. So that's the code. I need to make sure to import os at the top. Oh right, the function doesn't have any other dependencies. So that should work.

I think that's it. The user didn't ask for any additional error handling or platform considerations, so the standard os.path.isfile should suffice.
