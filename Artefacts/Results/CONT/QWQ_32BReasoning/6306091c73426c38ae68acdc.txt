Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function validate_from_content based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function is a class method since it has 'cls' as the first parameter. The goal is to validate that the YAML content has all the required fields. 

First, I should parse the YAML content. So I'll need to import the yaml module, probably using yaml.safe_load. But wait, what if the content isn't valid YAML? The function is supposed to raise an IRValidatorException if something is missing. Oh right, the docstring says to raise that exception when mandatory data is missing. So maybe the first step is to load the YAML and check for parsing errors.

Wait, the function's return is a dictionary with the data from the spec file. So the steps are: load the YAML into a dict, then check that all required fields are present. If any are missing, raise the exception.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if spec_content is provided. If it's None, maybe that's an error? The function's parameter has a default of None, so maybe it's allowed, but in that case, perhaps we need to raise an error. Wait, the docstring says "when mandatory data is missing in spec file". So if spec_content is None, that's invalid, right? So probably, the function should check that spec_content is not None. Hmm, but the parameter is optional. Maybe the function requires it, so if it's None, that's an error. So first, if spec_content is None, raise an exception?

Wait, the function's parameter has a default of None, so the user can call it without passing it. But in that case, the content would be None, leading to an error. So the first step in the code would be to check if spec_content is provided. Let me see the docstring's raises: it says to raise when mandatory data is missing in the spec file. So perhaps the spec_content is required. So if it's None, that's an error. So code should check that.

So first, parse the YAML. Let's do:

data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)

But if that fails, like if the content is invalid, that would raise an error. But the docstring's exception is IRValidatorException. So maybe wrap that in a try-except block? Because if the YAML is invalid, that's a problem. The function's doc says to raise when mandatory data is missing, but maybe invalid YAML also needs to be handled here. Or perhaps the exception from yaml parsing should be caught and converted to IRValidatorException?

Alternatively, maybe the function just assumes that the YAML is valid and proceeds. Hmm, but the function's responsibility is to validate the content. So if the YAML can't be parsed, that's an error, and we should raise an exception. So I should handle that case.

So steps:

- Check that spec_content is not None. If it is, raise an exception.

- Try to parse the YAML into data. If that fails, raise IRValidatorException with a message about invalid YAML.

- Once data is loaded, check that all required fields are present. What are the required fields? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the required fields are defined in the class cls? Like perhaps the class has an attribute like REQUIRED_FIELDS that lists the necessary keys.

Ah right, since it's a class method, the required fields might be defined in the class. So maybe the cls has a list or set called REQUIRED_FIELDS. So the code would check for each field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS and see if it's present in the data.

So for each field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:

if field not in data:
    raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")

Once all checks pass, return the data.

Putting this together:

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("No spec content provided")
    try:
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")
    for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

Wait, but what if data is None after parsing? Like if the YAML file is empty. Then data would be None, and checking fields would cause an error. So maybe need to ensure data is a dict. Let's add a check that data is a dictionary. So:

if not isinstance(data, dict):
    raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be a YAML mapping")

Adding that after parsing.

So putting all together:

Also, need to import the IRValidatorException. But since the function is part of a class, perhaps the exception is already imported in the module. The user didn't specify, so I'll just use it as is.

Wait the function's parameters include cls, so the exception is probably in the same module. So the code would be as above.

Wait, but the function's return is the data dictionary. So after all the checks, return data.

I think that's it. Let me check the docstring again. The parameters: spec_content is the content of the spec file. The function raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So the code checks for each required field in the class's required fields list. Also handles invalid YAML. Also, if the data is not a dict, that's an error.

So the code should look like that. Now, code in Python, in markdown format. The user said to output only the code in Python markdown format, so with triple backticks and 'python'.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with the language specified.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

But first, need to make sure to import the yaml module. Wait, the code may not have the 'yaml' module imported. So in the code, the function would need to have 'import yaml' but that's part of the code. However, since the function is part of a class, perhaps the module already has that. But the code generated here must include all necessary imports? Or is the user expected to have the imports elsewhere?

Hmm, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the code should not include the imports, because the function is part of a class, and the imports are handled elsewhere. The code provided should just be the function's code. But the code uses yaml, so that must be imported. Wait, but in the code, the function uses yaml.safe_load, so the code must have an import for yaml. So the code should include an import statement?

Wait the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the code must not include explanations. So perhaps the code must include the import statements necessary. Because otherwise, the code would not run. So, the code should start with importing the necessary modules.

Wait, but the function is part of a class, so maybe the class is in a module that already has the yaml imported. But since the code is to be generated, the function's code must include the import statements. So the code would have:

import yaml
from .exceptions import IRValidatorException  # assuming the exception is in another module, but the actual path may vary.

Wait, but I don't know where IRValidatorException is coming from. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the code should just use the exception as is, assuming it's already imported. Alternatively, maybe the code should have the necessary imports. But since the user didn't mention that, perhaps the code can just proceed with the code as written, assuming the imports are present elsewhere. But in the code, the function uses yaml, so I have to include the import.

Hmm, this is a problem. The generated code must work. So I need to include the import statements. Let me think. The code for the function must be self-contained. So the code should include the import for yaml and the exception. But since the exception's module isn't specified, maybe I can just write the code as is, assuming that the exception is imported. Alternatively, perhaps the code should just use the exception name as given.

Alternatively, perhaps the code doesn't need to include the imports, because the function is part of a class in a module that already has them. So the code would just be the function's code. Let me proceed with that. Wait, but without the import, the code would fail. So the user probably expects the code to have the necessary imports.

Hmm. The user says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code should include the necessary imports. Let me add the import statements.

Wait, the function is a class method, so the code would be inside a class. But the code to generate is the function's code. So the code would have to include the imports. So the code would start with:

import yaml
from some_package import IRValidatorException

But since the user didn't specify where the exception is coming from, perhaps I can just use a relative import, or assume it's in the same module. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just write the code as is, and the exception is already imported. But in the code, the exception is raised, so the code must have it imported.

This is a bit of a problem. Let me proceed by assuming that the necessary imports are present. So the code would be as follows, including the imports. Alternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without the imports, but then the code would not run. Since the user is asking for code that is correct, I must include the imports.

Wait, the user's instruction says to output the code generated, so the code must be complete. So, the code must include the necessary imports.

So the code would start with:

import yaml
from your_package.exceptions import IRValidatorException  # adjust the path as needed

But since I don't know the actual module path, perhaps the code should just use the exception name, assuming that the import is already done elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the code can just proceed with the code as written, and the user can adjust the imports as needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without the imports and just use the exception. Let me see the code again.

Wait, the function's code:

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("No spec content provided")
    try:
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be a YAML mapping")
    for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

So this requires that 'yaml' is imported and that 'IRValidatorException' is available. So the code must have those imports. Therefore, the generated code should include those imports.

But the user said to output the code in Python markdown format, so with triple backticks and the code inside. So the code would look like:

```python
import yaml
from some.module import IRValidatorException  # adjust the import path as necessary

class YourClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = [...]  # define required fields here

    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        if spec_content is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("No spec content provided")
        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")
        if not isinstance(data, dict):
            raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be a YAML mapping")
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        return data
```

Wait, but the function is a class method, so it's inside a class. But the user provided the function signature as a standalone function. Wait, the function is written with 'def validate_from_content(cls, ...)', so it's a class method. Therefore, the code must be part of a class. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code is just the function's code, but the imports are necessary.

Hmm, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class (since it has 'cls'). Therefore, the code must be inside a class. But the user may have provided the function as a class method. So the code must include the class structure?

Wait the user's function signature is def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):, so it's a method of a class. So the code must be part of a class. But the user's instruction says to generate the code, so the code would need to be in the class. But since the user provided the function's signature, perhaps the code is just the function's body, but within the class.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be written as a standalone function, but that's not the case because of 'cls'.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. The user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. The function is a class method. Therefore, the code must be part of a class. So the code should include the class definition, the required fields, and the method.

But since the user provided only the function's signature and docstring, perhaps the code is just the function's code, assuming that the class has the REQUIRED_FIELDS defined.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should include the necessary parts, including the class and imports. So the full code would be as I outlined above, including the imports and the class structure.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the code should be as follows:

```python
import yaml
from .exceptions import IRValidatorException  # adjust the import path as necessary

class YourClassName:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = [...]  # Define required fields here

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("No spec content provided")
        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}") from e
        if not isinstance(data, dict):
            raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be a YAML mapping")
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        return data
```

Wait, but in the function signature, the method is not decorated with @classmethod, but since it has 'cls' as the first parameter, it must be a class method. So adding the @classmethod decorator is necessary.

Also, in the exception, the 'from e' is optional but can be included for better traceability.

But the user's docstring doesn't mention handling invalid YAML, but the function's raise clause says when mandatory data is missing. So perhaps the invalid YAML case is also considered as an error, but the exception is raised regardless, which is okay.

The code above includes the necessary imports, the class with the REQUIRED_FIELDS (which the user should define), and the method.

However, the user's original function's docstring includes the parameters and raises, so the code's docstring must match exactly.

Wait the function's code in the generated code must have the exact docstring provided. So in the code above, the docstring is exactly as given.

Yes.

But the user's instruction says to output the code generated, so this would be the correct approach.

However, the user might have intended that the code is only the function's body, but given that it's a class method, that's not possible. Therefore, the code must include the class and the imports.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written without the class structure, but that's not possible since 'cls' is used.

Therefore, the code must be as written above.

But in the code above, the class is named 'YourClassName' and the REQUIRED_FIELDS is a placeholder. The user should replace that with the actual class name and required fields. But the code must be written as is, perhaps with the class as part of the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written without the class, but that would not make sense. So the code must include the class.

Wait the user's function is part of a class, so the code must be written within a class. Therefore, the generated code must include the class definition, the required fields, and the method.

Hence, the code block I wrote above is correct. But the user might not have specified the class name, so perhaps it's better to leave the class name as a placeholder, but the code must be complete.

Therefore, I think the correct code is as above, enclosed in triple backticks with the Python language specified. But the user may want the code to be just the function's code, but that's impossible because of the 'cls' parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function, but that would not use 'cls'. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Given the constraints, I'll proceed with the code as outlined, including the necessary imports and class structure. The user can adjust the class name and imports as needed.
