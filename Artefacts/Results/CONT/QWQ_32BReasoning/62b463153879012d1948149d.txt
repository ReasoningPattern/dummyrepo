Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _explore_folder based on the provided docstring. The docstring says it groups files in the given group using _group_files_by_xml_filename. Wait, but the function's parameter is called 'folder', so maybe there's a typo in the docstring? The user probably meant to say that the function groups files in the given folder by using that helper function.

First, I should figure out what the _group_files_by_xml_filename function does. Since it's mentioned here but not defined, I can assume that it's another function that takes a list of files and groups them based on their XML filenames. So, the _explore_folder function's job is to process the folder, perhaps list all the files in it, then pass them to that grouping function.

So, the steps would be:

1. List all the files in the given folder. Maybe using os.listdir(folder).
2. Then, call _group_files_by_xml_filename with those files as the argument.
3. Return the result from that function.

Wait, but the parameters: the function _explore_folder receives 'folder', which is a path. So the code would be straightforward. Let me write it out.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the folder is properly handled. Maybe check if it's a valid directory? Or perhaps the helper function takes care of that. Since the problem doesn't mention error handling, maybe it's omitted here.

So the code would be something like:

def _explore_folder(folder):
    files = os.listdir(folder)
    return _group_files_by_xml_filename(files)

But I need to import os. However, the problem didn't mention any imports, so maybe the code is supposed to assume that the necessary imports are already present. Since the user didn't ask for handling exceptions or path validity, I'll proceed without that.

Wait, the docstring mentions "the given group" but the parameter is a folder. That might be a mistake in the docstring. But I'll proceed as per the function's parameter name, assuming the docstring has a typo. So the code is as above.

Wait, but maybe the _group_files_by_xml_filename function expects a path or the files as a list? The function's name suggests it groups files based on XML filenames, so perhaps the files are the list from the folder. So the code should be correct as written.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

import os

def _explore_folder(folder):
    """
    Groups files in the given group by using _group_files_by_xml_filename.
    """
    files = os.listdir(folder)
    return _group_files_by_xml_filename(files)

But the user said not to include any explanations, just the code. Also, the problem's function signature starts with def _explore_folder... so I need to make sure that's exactly as given, and include the docstring as provided. Also, the code must be in Python, so the os import is necessary. Wait, but the problem didn't mention including the import. Hmm. Since the user is a Python engineer, maybe the code is part of a larger module where 'os' is already imported? Or perhaps the code should include the import.

The problem says to generate the code based on the signature and docstring, so I think the code should include the necessary import. Otherwise, the function would fail. Therefore, I should include 'import os' at the top.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python format. So the code should include the import statement. Let me structure it properly.

Wait, but maybe the helper function _group_files_by_xml_filename is in the same scope. So putting it all together, the code would have the import and the function.

So the final code would be:

import os

def _explore_folder(folder):
    """
    Groups files in the given group by using _group_files_by_xml_filename.
    """
    files = os.listdir(folder)
    return _group_files_by_xml_filename(files)

That's the code. I think that's what is expected here. The function uses os.listdir to get the files in the folder and then passes them to the helper function.
