Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate a Python function called _parse_image_ref that takes an image_href string and returns a tuple with image_id, netloc, and use_ssl as a bool. The function needs to parse the href into these parts. Hmm, the docstring mentions importing urllib, but I should remember to use the correct modules like urlparse.

First, I need to break down the image_href. The parts required are image_id, which is probably the path part without leading slashes. The netloc is the domain from the URL. Use_ssl would be True if the URL starts with https, else False.

Wait, maybe using urlparse from urllib.parse is the way to go. Let me think of an example. Suppose the image_href is "https://example.com/images/12345.jpg". Parsing this with urlparse gives the scheme (https), netloc (example.com), and path (/images/12345.jpg). The image_id might be the part after the last slash in the path, so 12345.jpg here. Or maybe it's the entire path without the leading slash? The problem isn't entirely clear, but perhaps the image_id is the filename part.

Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the part after the domain. Let me think of another example. Like "http://site.net/pic/abc", so the path is /pic/abc. The image_id could be "abc", so splitting the path and taking the last element. But maybe the path could have multiple parts. Need to split on '/' and take the last element that's not empty.

So steps:

1. Parse the URL using urlparse to get components.
2. Check the scheme (http or https) to determine use_ssl. If scheme is https, then True, else False.
3. The netloc is straightforward from the parsed result.
4. The image_id is the last part of the path. So split the path by '/' and take the last non-empty element. But what if the path is just '/'? Then maybe raise a ValueError?

Wait, the function can raise ValueError. So need to handle cases where the path is empty or the URL is malformed. Like if the path is empty (ends with /), then maybe the image_id is empty, which is invalid. So in that case, raise an error?

Alternatively, perhaps the image_href is expected to have a valid path with at least one segment. Let me think of possible errors.

The function's docstring says it raises ValueError, so I need to check for cases where the URL is invalid. For example, if there's no netloc, or the path is empty.

So the steps in code:

Import urlparse from urllib.parse. Wait, in Python, it's usually from urllib.parse import urlparse. But the user's docstring says "import urllib", but maybe they meant the parse module.

Inside the function:

Parse the image_href with urlparse. Then:

scheme = parsed.scheme.lower() if parsed.scheme else ''

use_ssl is (scheme == 'https')

netloc = parsed.netloc

path = parsed.path

Then split the path into parts. Split on '/' and filter out empty strings. So parts = [p for p in path.split('/') if p]

If parts is empty, then the path is just '/', so no image_id. So raise ValueError.

Else, image_id is parts[-1]

So putting it all together.

Wait, but what about cases where the path is like '/images/123' with the last part being the image id. That would work.

So code:

from urllib.parse import urlparse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    scheme = parsed.scheme.lower() if parsed.scheme else ''
    use_ssl = scheme == 'https'
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    path_parts = [p for p in parsed.path.split('/') if p]
    if not path_parts:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: path is empty")
    image_id = path_parts[-1]
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but what if the netloc is empty? Like if the URL is a relative path? Like "image.jpg". Then urlparse would have netloc empty. So in that case, the netloc would be an empty string. But the function's return requires a netloc, so that's a problem. So perhaps the code should check that netloc is not empty. Because otherwise, if the URL is relative, then netloc would be empty, leading to invalid data. So in that case, the function should raise ValueError.

Ah right, the function's docstring says it can raise ValueError. So adding checks for that.

So after parsing, check if netloc is empty. If so, raise ValueError. Also, check that the path has parts. So:

if not netloc:
    raise ValueError("No network location found in the URL")

and the path check as before.

So putting those checks in.

Wait, let me think of possible test cases:

Case 1: "https://example.com/images/12345.jpg" → image_id '12345.jpg', netloc 'example.com', use_ssl True.

Case 2: "http://site.net/pic/abc" → 'abc', 'site.net', False.

Case 3: "ftp://server/file.txt" → scheme 'ftp', use_ssl is False (since not https), but maybe the function allows any scheme as long as it's present. But the use_ssl is determined by the presence of https.

Case 4: "http:///path" → netloc is empty? Wait, let me see. The urlparse for "http:///path" would have scheme 'http', netloc empty, path '/path'. So netloc would be empty, so that's an error.

So in code:

parsed = urlparse(image_href)

Then:

if not parsed.netloc:
    raise ValueError("Invalid URL: missing network location")

Also, check the path parts. So after splitting, if path_parts is empty → error.

Another case: image_href is "https://example.com/" → path is "/", so path_parts is empty → raises error.

Another case: image_href has no scheme, like "//example.com/images/123.jpg" → parsed.scheme is empty, netloc is 'example.com', path is '/images/123.jpg' → so use_ssl would be False because scheme is empty. But maybe in that case, the netloc is present, but the scheme is missing, so the URL is relative. So the code would proceed, but use_ssl would be False (since scheme is empty). But the user may expect that such URLs are invalid? Because without a scheme, the use_ssl can't be determined? Hmm, but the code currently would allow that. Wait, in the case of a URL like "//example.com/...", the parsed.scheme is empty, so use_ssl would be False. But maybe that's not correct. Because such URLs are protocol-relative, but the code can't determine the protocol. So perhaps such URLs are invalid, because they don't have a scheme. So the code should check that the scheme is present (either http or https) ?

Wait the function's docstring doesn't specify, but the use_ssl is based on the scheme. So if the scheme is missing, then use_ssl is False, but that might be incorrect. But perhaps the function expects that the image_href is a valid URL with scheme. So in that case, the code should check that parsed.scheme is not empty. Because otherwise, the netloc might be present but the scheme is missing, leading to an invalid URL.

So adding another check: if not parsed.scheme:

raise ValueError("URL must have a scheme (e.g., http or https)")

Wait, but the example given earlier, like a URL starting with // would have an empty scheme. So that's invalid. So the code needs to ensure that the URL has a scheme.

Therefore, adding:

if not parsed.scheme:
    raise ValueError("Invalid URL: missing scheme")

Also, after checking the netloc:

if not parsed.netloc:
    raise ValueError("Invalid URL: missing network location")

Wait, but in some cases, the netloc could be present but the scheme is not? Like the URL "://example.com" → but that's probably not a valid URL. Let me think: the urlparse of "://example.com" would have scheme empty, netloc as 'example.com', path empty. So in that case, the scheme is missing, so the first check would catch it.

So the code steps would be:

Parse the URL.

Check that scheme is not empty → else raise.

Check that netloc is not empty → else raise.

Check that the path has non-empty parts → else raise.

So code:

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.scheme:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL: missing scheme")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL: missing network location")
    scheme = parsed.scheme.lower()
    use_ssl = scheme == 'https'
    path = parsed.path
    path_parts = [p for p in path.split('/') if p]
    if not path_parts:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: path is empty or invalid")
    image_id = path_parts[-1]
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the path could be empty? Like if the URL is "http://example.com", then parsed.path is empty → path_parts would be empty, so that would raise an error, which is correct because there's no image id in that case.

Another case: the path is "/". Then path_parts is empty → error.

Another edge case: path is "/some/long/path/with/trailing/slash/" → splitting would give parts up to the last slash, so the last part is empty? Wait no. Because splitting on '/' would split into ['', 'some', 'long', 'path', 'with', 'trailing', 'slash', ''] → but after filtering with [p for p in ... if p], the last element would be 'slash'?

Wait, let's see: parsed.path is "/some/long/path/with/trailing/slash/" → split on '/' gives ['', 'some', 'long', 'path', 'with', 'trailing', 'slash', ''] → after filtering, the parts are ['some', 'long', 'path', 'with', 'trailing', 'slash'], so the last is 'slash'.

If the path ends with a slash, then the last part would be the previous element. So the code would take the last non-empty part.

So that's okay.

What about a path like "/id123"? → parts is ['id123'], so image_id is 'id123'.

Another case: image_href is "https://example.com/abc" → path is '/abc', so parts is ['abc'] → image_id 'abc'.

So the code should handle that.

Now, what about if the image_href has query parameters? Like "https://example.com/image/123.jpg?size=large" → the path is '/image/123.jpg', so image_id is '123.jpg' → that's correct, because urlparse's path doesn't include the query.

Yes, urlparse splits the path and the query, so the path is correct.

So the code should work.

Now, the function needs to return a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). The netloc is parsed.netloc, which is correct.

Now, possible errors:

If the URL is "image.jpg" (no scheme or netloc) → parsed.scheme is empty, so the first check raises.

If the URL is "http:///image" → parsed.netloc is empty, so second check raises.

If the URL is "http://example.com", then path is empty → raises.

So all the checks are covered.

I think that's the correct code. Let me write it out now.
