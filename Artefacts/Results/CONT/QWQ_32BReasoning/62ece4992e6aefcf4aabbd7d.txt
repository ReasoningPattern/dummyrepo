Okay, I need to write a Python function called subprocess_run_helper. Let me read the docstring again. The function is supposed to run another function in a sub-process. The args are func, *args, timeout, and extra_env. The return is a CompletedProcess instance.

Hmm, the func must be in an importable module. So, how do I run a function in a subprocess? Oh right, maybe using subprocess.run, but how do I pass the function? Because the subprocess would need to execute that function somehow. 

Wait, the *args are described as additional command line arguments to be passed into the first argument of subprocess.run. Wait, the first argument of subprocess.run is args, which is a list. So the *args here are the command line arguments. So the main function is to construct a command that runs the Python function.

So, the idea is to start a new Python process that imports the function and calls it. But how to structure that? Maybe using the -c option in Python. Or perhaps the function is in a module, so we can do something like python -m module function args...?

Alternatively, the subprocess would need to execute the function. So the command would be something like "python -c 'import module; module.func()'", but with the args passed in. But how to handle the module and function name?

Wait, the func parameter is the actual function object. To get its module and name, I can use func.__module__ and func.__name__. So, the command would need to import the module and call the function. 

Putting that together, the command line would be:

python -c "import {module}; {module}.{func_name}({args})"

But wait, the args are passed as command line arguments. So maybe the function is designed to take command line arguments via sys.argv. So the subprocess would run a script that imports the function's module, calls the function, and passes the *args as the command line args.

Alternatively, the subprocess command would be structured as:

python -m some_module some_function arg1 arg2...

Wait, perhaps the way to do this is to construct a command that executes the function using the -m option or by directly invoking the module.

Alternatively, here's a plan:

The subprocess will execute a Python script that imports the function's module, then calls the function with the given arguments. But how to pass the function's module and name as command line arguments to that script?

Alternatively, the main script can be a small wrapper that does the import and call. But since we need to run this via subprocess, maybe the command would be something like:

python -c "import sys; from {func.__module__} import {func.__name__}; {func.__name__}(*sys.argv[1:])" {args}

Wait, but the args passed to the subprocess would be the *args from the function's parameters. So the *args in the subprocess_run_helper are the arguments to be passed to the subprocess's command line, which would then be picked up by the function.

Wait, the function's *args are the additional command line arguments for the subprocess. So the main command would be the Python command that runs the function, followed by those args.

Putting this together, the command list would be:

["python", "-c", f"from {func.__module__} import {func.__name__}; {func.__name__}(*sys.argv[1:])", *args]

But I need to make sure that the code in the -c string is properly escaped and formatted. Also, the function might need to process the command line arguments. So the function being called should probably read sys.argv to get the args.

Alternatively, the function might be designed to take its arguments from the command line. So the subprocess's args are passed to the function via sys.argv.

Now, about the environment variables. The extra_env is a dict that needs to be added to the subprocess's environment. So when calling subprocess.run, we can update the current environment with extra_env.

Putting this all together, here's the plan for the code:

1. Get the module and function name from the func parameter.

2. Construct the command as a list for subprocess.run. The command starts with 'python' followed by '-c', then the code string that imports the function and calls it with sys.argv[1:], then the *args passed in.

Wait, but the code string needs to include the import and the function call. Let's structure the code string as:

code = f"import sys; from {func.__module__} import {func.__name__}; {func.__name__}(*sys.argv[1:])"

So the command would be:

['python', '-c', code] + list(args)

Wait, but the *args in the function are passed as the command line arguments to the subprocess. So the full command list would be:

['python', '-c', code] + list(args)

Wait, no, the first elements are the command, then the args. So the args are added after the -c option.

Wait, the subprocess's args are the list passed to subprocess.run. So the command list is:

['python', '-c', code_string] + list_of_args

Yes.

Now, handling the environment. The subprocess's environment should be a copy of the current environment, updated with extra_env. So:

env = os.environ.copy()
if extra_env:
    env.update(extra_env)

Then, when calling subprocess.run, pass env=env.

The timeout is passed as well.

Putting all together, the code would be something like:

import subprocess
import os

def subprocess_run_helper(func, *args, timeout, extra_env=None):
    module = func.__module__
    func_name = func.__name__
    code = f"import sys; from {module} import {func_name}; {func_name}(*sys.argv[1:])"
    cmd = ['python', '-c', code] + list(args)
    env = os.environ.copy()
    if extra_env:
        env.update(extra_env)
    return subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=timeout, env=env, capture_output=True)

Wait, but the subprocess.run needs to have the timeout, and also, the return is a CompletedProcess instance, which is exactly what subprocess.run returns. So that's correct.

Wait, but the capture_output=True is not mentioned in the docstring. The function doesn't specify whether to capture output, but the user might want that. However, the docstring says to return the CompletedProcess instance, which can be achieved either way. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps it's better to leave it as is, but maybe the default is to let the subprocess's output go to the parent's stdout/stderr. Alternatively, maybe the code should not capture output unless specified. Hmm, but the function's parameters don't mention that. So perhaps it's better not to set capture_output, so that the subprocess's output is shown as usual. Wait, but the function's return is a CompletedProcess which includes the output only if capture_output is True. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps we should leave it to the default, which is not to capture. But then the user might want to see the output. Alternatively, maybe it's better to capture the output so that the CompletedProcess includes it. But the docstring doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps better to set check=True? No, the user might want to handle errors themselves. 

Wait, the docstring says to return the CompletedProcess instance, so perhaps the code should not suppress output. Let me check: the default for subprocess.run is to not capture output. So if I don't set capture_output, then the subprocess's stdout and stderr will be connected to the parent's, which might be what the user expects. So perhaps I should omit capture_output.

So removing that part, the code would be:

env = os.environ.copy()
if extra_env:
    env.update(extra_env)
return subprocess.run(cmd, timeout=timeout, env=env)

Wait, but then the env is properly set, and the timeout is passed. That should work.

Now, possible issues: the function's module must be importable in the subprocess. So if the module is in a non-standard location, the PYTHONPATH might need to be set, but that's up to the user via extra_env.

Another possible problem: the code string may have syntax errors if the module or function name contains characters that are not valid in Python code. But the user is supposed to pass a function that is in an importable module, so that should be okay.

Also, the function's arguments are passed via sys.argv, so the function must be designed to read sys.argv[1:] for its parameters. If the function expects the arguments in another way, this might not work. But according to the docstring, the *args are the command line arguments for the subprocess, so that's correct.

So the final code would look like this.
