Okay, I need to write a Python function called _dictsum that takes a list of dictionaries and sums the values for each common key. Let's see. The example given is two dictionaries, but the function probably works with any number of them. 

First, I should think about how to approach this. The input is a list called dicts, which contains multiple dictionaries. The output should be a new dictionary where each key is present in any of the input dicts, and the value is the sum of all the values from the input dicts for that key.

Hmm, so the steps would be: 

1. Initialize a result dictionary to keep track of the sums.
2. Iterate over each dictionary in the input list.
3. For each key in the current dictionary, add its value to the result's entry for that key. If the key isn't in the result yet, we start by adding the value.
4. After processing all dictionaries, return the result.

Wait, but how do I handle all the keys across all dictionaries? Like, if a key is in one dict but not another, I still need to include it. So the process should cover all keys from all dicts.

Alternatively, maybe I can collect all the keys first, then for each key, iterate through all the dictionaries and sum the values where the key exists.

Alternatively, a more efficient way might be to loop through each dictionary in the list, and for each key in that dictionary, add the value to the result's key's total. That way, we don't have to process all keys for all dicts, only those present in each dict.

Yes, that's better. So here's a possible approach:

Initialize an empty dictionary, sum_dict. Then, for each dict in the dicts list:

   for each key, value in the current dict.items():

       if the key is in sum_dict, add value to it.

       else, set sum_dict[key] = value.

But wait, some dictionaries might have the same key but others might not. So for example, if a key is in one dict but not another, it's still included. So for the keys that are only in some dictionaries, their values from the other dictionaries would be 0? Wait no. Let's see the example: in the example, the second dict has 'b':0. So adding that to the first's 2 gives 2, which is correct. But if a dict doesn't have a key, then it's like their contribution is 0. 

Wait, but in the approach above, if a key is present in one dict but not another, the second dict's absence would not contribute. But the code above would only process keys that exist in each dict. So for example, suppose there is a third dict that doesn't have 'a', then when processing that third dict, since 'a' isn't a key, it won't be added. So the sum for 'a' would only include the dicts that have it. Wait, but that's correct. Because if a dict doesn't have the key, it's as if their value is 0, so adding 0 doesn't change the sum. 

Wait, no. Let's think: suppose there are three dicts. The first has {'a':1}, the second has {'b':3}, and the third has {'a':5, 'b':2}. Then the sum for 'a' would be 1 + 0 (from second dict) +5 =6. 'b' is 0 +3 +2 =5. So the code above would work because when processing the second dict, 'a' isn't present, so it doesn't get added. But the code only adds the existing keys. So that's okay because the missing keys in a dict are effectively contributing 0. 

Therefore, the approach of iterating through each key in each dictionary and adding their value to the sum is correct. 

Now, code-wise: 

def _dictsum(dicts):
    sum_dict = {}
    for d in dicts:
        for key, value in d.items():
            if key in sum_dict:
                sum_dict[key] += value
            else:
                sum_dict[key] = value
    return sum_dict

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me test with the example given. 

Example: two dicts, dict1 {'a':1, 'b':2}, dict2 {'a':5, 'b':0}. 

Processing first dict: 

sum_dict starts empty. 

Processing 'a' (1) → sum_dict['a'] becomes 1. 'b' becomes 2. 

Then the second dict: 

'a' is already present, so 1 +5 →6. 

'b' is present, 2 +0 →2. 

So the result is {'a':6, 'b':2}, which matches the example. 

What about if there are more keys in some dicts? Like a third dict with 'c':3. 

The sum would have 'c' as 3. 

Edge cases: empty list? Then return empty dict. 

What if a dict in the list is empty? Then it contributes nothing. 

Another case: different keys. Like one dict has 'x':5, another has 'y':3. The sum would have both keys. 

Yes, the code should handle all these. 

I think that's the correct approach. So the code would be as above. 

Wait, but what if the input is an empty list? Then the loop doesn't run, and returns an empty dict. That's correct. 

Another possible issue: the function's parameter is called 'dicts', which is a list of dictionaries. So the code loops over each d in dicts. 

Yes. So the code should be correct.
