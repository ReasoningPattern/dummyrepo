Okay, I need to generate Python code for the formatmany method based on the given signature and docstring. Let's see. The function is part of a class, so it has self as the first parameter. The parameters are sql of type AnyStr, which can be a string or bytes, and many_params which is an iterable of either dictionaries or sequences. The return type is a tuple containing an AnyStr and a list of either dicts or sequences.

The docstring says to convert the sql using self._converter.convert_many. So I guess the method should call that convert_many function on the sql and the many_params. 

First, I should check if the class has a _converter attribute with a convert_many method. Assuming that's set up correctly, the code would probably be straightforward. 

The steps would be: call self._converter.convert_many with sql and many_params as arguments. Then return the result. Wait, but the return type of convert_many must be the same as specified here. The return is a tuple of AnyStr and the list of params. So the code would be something like:

def formatmany(self, sql, many_params):
    return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But I need to make sure that the types match. The parameters are already annotated, so the code should handle that. The function's docstring is clear, so the code is just a pass-through to the converter's method. 

Wait, maybe the method has to process the parameters? Or maybe the convert_many does all the work. Since the problem states to generate code based on the docstring which says to use that converter, the code is just calling that method. 

So the code is as simple as that. Let me make sure that the parameters are passed correctly. The sql is first, then many_params. The return is the tuple from convert_many. 

I think that's all. So the generated code will be the function definition with the parameters, the docstring as given, and the return line.
