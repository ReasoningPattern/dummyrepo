Okay, I need to write the Python function int_to_string based on the given signature and docstring. Let's see. The function takes a number, an alphabet list, and an optional padding. The goal is to convert the number into a string using the given alphabet, with the most significant digit first. 

Hmm, right. So the idea is similar to converting a number into a different base, but instead of base 10 or 2, it's using the length of the alphabet as the base. For example, if the alphabet has 5 characters, each "digit" in the converted string is a character from the alphabet, using base 5.

Wait, but how exactly do I do that? Let's think of the steps. 

First, I need to handle the case where the number is zero. If the number is zero, maybe we just return the first character of the alphabet, but considering padding. 

Then, for numbers greater than zero, I should repeatedly divide the number by the base (which is the length of the alphabet) and get the remainders. Each remainder corresponds to an index in the alphabet. But since we want the most significant digit first, we need to collect the remainders in reverse order?

Wait, no. Let's think step by step. Let's say the base is len(alphabet). Let's call that base. The number is N. 

We start by finding the remainder when N is divided by base. That gives the least significant digit. Then we divide N by base and repeat. But since we want the most significant digit first, we need to reverse the list of remainders.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], so base 3. Let's say the number is 4. 

4 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 1. Then 1 divided by 3 is 0 with remainder 1. So the remainders are [1,1]. Reversed, that would be [1,1], but wait no, actually the order here would be 1 (from first division) and then 1 (from second division). Wait, the first remainder is the least significant digit. So the digits are collected in reverse order. So the actual string should be the remainders in reverse order? Wait no, let's see:

Wait in the example, 4 in base 3 is 11 (since 3^1 *1 + 3^0*1 =4). So the digits are [1,1], but when building the string, since the most significant digit first, it's '11' in base 3. So the order is the same as the remainders collected in reverse. Wait, let's see:

The first remainder is 4 %3 =1. Then we divide N by base: 4//3 is 1. The next remainder is 1%3=1. Then N becomes 0. So the remainders collected in order are [1,1]. To get the most significant first, we reverse them? Wait no, because the first remainder is the least significant digit, so the digits are stored in reverse order. So the correct order is the reverse of the collected remainders. Wait, in the example, the correct digits are [1,1], but how do you get that? Let me see:

Wait the first remainder is the least significant digit. So in the example, the digits are 1 (LSB) and 1 (MSB). So the correct order is [1,1], but when building the string, the MSB comes first, so the string is '11' (using the alphabet's indices). Wait but the collected remainders are [1,1], so the order is correct? Or do I need to reverse?

Wait in the example, the first remainder is the least significant digit. So the digits are stored in the list as LSB first. To get the most significant first, we need to reverse the list of remainders. Because the first remainder is the least, so the last remainder is the most. Wait in the example, the remainders are [1,1]. The second remainder (the 1 from 1%3) is the most significant. So the list [1,1] is already in order of LSB first. To get MSB first, we reverse it to [1,1], which is the same. Wait, that's not right. Because in the example, the number 4 in base 3 is indeed 11, so the order is correct. So maybe in this case, the remainders collected in order are [1,1], but when building the string, we just take them in reverse? Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the first remainder is the first digit (LSB) but the second remainder is the next digit (MSB). So the list of remainders is [LSB, MSB], so to get the string in MSB first, we need to reverse the list. Wait in the example, the remainders are [1,1], reversing would give [1,1], same as before. So in that case, it works. Let's take another example where the order matters.

Suppose base 10, number 123. The remainders would be 3, 2, 1. So the digits are 3 (LSB), 2, 1 (MSB). The list would be [3,2,1], and reversing gives [1,2,3], but that would be 123 in base 10. Wait, no. Wait, the number 123 in base 10 would be represented as 1,2,3. But in the process, the first remainder is 3 (123%10=3, then 12//10 is 12, remainder 2, then 1//10 is 0, remainder 1). So the remainders collected are [3,2,1]. To get the correct digits in order (1,2,3), we need to reverse the list, giving [1,2,3], which would be the correct digits. 

Ah right, so the correct approach is to collect the remainders in reverse order. So the process is:

Initialize an empty list.

While number >0:

   remainder = number % base

   list.append( remainder )

   number = number // base

Then reverse the list to get the digits from MSB to LSB.

Wait no, because after appending, the list has remainders in LSB first. So to get MSB first, you have to reverse it.

So in code, after collecting the remainders, we reverse the list.

Wait but in the first example with 4, the remainders would be [1,1], reversed gives [1,1], which is correct. In the 123 example, reversed gives [1,2,3], which is correct. 

So that's the process. 

Now, for the code steps:

First, handle the case when number is zero. Because if number is zero, then we need to return the first character of the alphabet. But wait, in the case when the number is zero, then the loop won't run, so the remainders list would be empty. So we need to handle that case. 

Wait, let's see:

Suppose number is zero. Then in the loop, the condition (number>0) is false, so the loop doesn't run. The remainders list is empty. So we need to check if the list is empty, and if so, add a zero (the remainder is zero?), but how?

Hmm, perhaps the code should be:

if number ==0:

   return the first character of the alphabet (alphabet[0])

Wait, but that's only if the alphabet is non-empty. But the function's parameters have alphabet as a List[str], so presumably it's non-empty. So we can assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps in the loop, when the number is zero, but the list is empty, then we need to add a zero. But maybe the better approach is to handle that case first. 

Alternatively, proceed as follows:

Initialize digits as an empty list.

base = len(alphabet)

if base ==0:

   raise an error? But the function's parameters probably assume that alphabet is non-empty. So the code can proceed.

number is the input.

if number ==0:

   digits.append(0)

else:

   while number>0:

      remainder = number % base

      digits.append( remainder )

      number = number // base

Then reverse the digits.

Wait, but then for the case when number is zero, the digits list will have [0], reversed is still [0], so the string will be alphabet[0].

Yes, that works. 

Wait, let me see:

In code:

digits = []

base = len(alphabet)

if number ==0:

   digits.append(0)

else:

   while number>0:

      rem = number % base

      digits.append(rem)

      number = number // base

digits = digits[::-1]  # reverse the list

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of number being zero, the digits list is [0], then reversed is same. 

But for the non-zero case, the digits list is collected in LSB first, so reversing gives MSB first. 

Then, the digits are a list of indices into the alphabet. 

So the string is ''.join( alphabet[i] for i in digits )

Wait, but the digits are in the correct order after reversing. 

Putting this together:

So the code outline would be:

def int_to_string(number, alphabet, padding=None):

    base = len(alphabet)

    if base ==0:

        raise ValueError("Alphabet can't be empty")

    digits = []

    if number ==0:

        digits.append(0)

    else:

        while number>0:

            rem = number % base

            digits.append(rem)

            number = number // base

    # reverse to get MSB first

    digits = digits[::-1]

    # Now build the string

    s = ''.join( [alphabet[i] for i in digits] )

    # handle padding

    if padding is not None:

        # need to pad the string to at least 'padding' length

        # if the current length is less than padding, prepend with leading digits?

        # Wait, how to handle padding?

        # For example, if the current length is 2 and padding is 3, then we need to add a leading zero (i.e., the first character of alphabet) to make it 3 characters.

        # Because the most significant digit comes first, padding should be done by adding leading zeros.

        # So the total length is max( len(s), padding )

        # So the padded string is (alphabet[0] * (padding - len(s))) + s

        # but only if padding is greater than the current length.

        if len(s) < padding:

            s = alphabet[0] * (padding - len(s)) + s

    return s

Wait, but what if the original digits were shorter than padding? Then we need to add leading zeros (the first character of the alphabet) to reach the padding length. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Now, what about the case when the number is zero and padding is given? For example, if padding is 5, then the zero would be represented as the first character, but padded to 5 characters. 

Like, if the alphabet is ['a','b'], and the number is zero, then without padding it's 'a'. With padding 3, it becomes 'aaa'? 

Wait, no. Because the original digits for zero is [0], so the string is 'a'. When padding to 3, the code would do:

if len(s) (1) <3, then add (3-1)=2 'a's, resulting in 'aaa'.

Yes. 

Another example: suppose the number is 1, alphabet length is 2 (so base 2). The digits would be [1], reversed gives [1], so the string is 'b'. If padding is 3, then the code would pad with two 'a's to get 'aab'? Wait, no. Wait the padding code adds (padding - len(s)) leading zeros. So for len(s) =1, padding 3: 3-1=2. So we add two 'a's (since zero index is 'a'), so the result is 'aab'?

Wait, the original string is 'b', adding two 'a's in front: 'aab'? Wait, no. The code is:

alphabet[0] * (padding - len(s)) gives 'a'*2, then concatenated with 'b' gives 'a a b' → 'aab'. 

Yes. 

Another test case: number 0, padding 2, alphabet ['a', 'b'] → 'aa'.

That's correct. 

Another test case: number 3, base 2 (alphabet length 2). 

3 in base 2 is 11, so the digits would be [3//2=1, then 1//2=0. 

Wait let's go step by step:

number=3. 

Loop runs:

rem =3%2 →1. digits.append(1). number becomes 3//2=1.

Then next iteration:

rem=1%2 →1. digits.append(1). number becomes 0. 

Loop exits. 

digits is [1,1]. Reversed gives [1,1]. So the string is 'bb'. 

If padding is 3, then adding a leading 'a', so 'abbb'? Wait no. Wait the length is 2, so 3-2=1. So adding one 'a', resulting in 'abb'.

Wait, the code would give 'a' + 'bb' → 'abb'? 

Yes. 

So the padding logic seems correct. 

Now, what about edge cases?

What if the padding is smaller than the actual length? Then we don't do anything. 

Like, if the string is length 5 and padding is 3, then we leave it as is. 

Okay. 

Now, the function parameters: the alphabet is a list of strings. Each entry is a character? I think so. Because the output is a string formed by the alphabet entries. So each entry in the alphabet is a single character? Probably, but the code doesn't enforce that, but the problem says "alphabet: List[str]". So the code can proceed as is. 

Now, putting all together into code. 

Wait, but in Python, the function has to have type hints as per the given signature. 

The function's signature is:

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:

So, the code needs to import List from typing, and Optional. 

Wait, but the user didn't mention importing, so maybe the code should just use the given parameters. 

Wait, but in the problem statement, the code must be generated. So I need to make sure that the code is correct. 

Wait, the code will need to have from typing import List, Optional? But the problem says "do not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output only the code generated, in Python markdown format." Wait, but the code must include the necessary imports? Or does the user expect that the code will have the function as written, assuming that the necessary imports are present? 

Hmm, the function's parameters use List and Optional, so the code must have those imported. But since the user provided the function signature, perhaps they expect that the code uses those types, but the actual code (the function) can be written without the imports. 

Wait, but in Python, when defining a function with type hints using List and Optional, you need to have those imported from the typing module. 

Therefore, the code must include the necessary imports. 

Wait, but the problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". The code should include the function as written, with the type hints, but the code must be valid. So the code must import List and Optional from typing. 

Therefore, the code should start with:

from typing import List, Optional

Then the function definition. 

Wait, but the user didn't specify to include the imports. But since the function's parameters use List and Optional, the code must have those imports. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that the code is written without the imports, but that would make the code invalid. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to include the necessary imports. 

So the code would start with:

from typing import List, Optional

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:

    ... the rest of the code ...

So that's necessary. 

Now, the code steps:

First, handle the base = len(alphabet). 

Check if base is zero? Well, according to the problem's parameters, the alphabet is a list of strings. But if it's empty, then len(alphabet) is zero. In that case, division by zero would occur. So we need to handle that. 

The function's docstring doesn't mention what to do if the alphabet is empty, but the function should probably raise an error. 

Wait, in the code, if alphabet is empty, then base is zero. 

In the code, when number is not zero, the loop will run. 

Wait, let's see:

Suppose alphabet is empty (base 0). 

Then, in the code:

digits = []

if number ==0 → which it can't be if base is zero, but even then, if number is zero, then digits.append(0), then digits[::-1] would be [0], then the string would be alphabet[0], but if alphabet is empty, that's an error. 

So, the code must check for an empty alphabet. 

So adding:

base = len(alphabet)

if base ==0:

    raise ValueError("Alphabet must not be empty")

But since the function's parameters are given as alphabet: List[str], perhaps the user expects that the code can assume that the alphabet is non-empty, but in practice, it's better to handle it. 

The problem's docstring doesn't specify, but to avoid errors, the code should include that check. 

Therefore, in the code, after base = len(alphabet), check if base is zero. 

So, putting all together:

The code:

from typing import List, Optional

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    base = len(alphabet)
    if base == 0:
        raise ValueError("Alphabet must not be empty")
    digits = []
    if number == 0:
        digits.append(0)
    else:
        while number > 0:
            rem = number % base
            digits.append(rem)
            number = number // base
    digits = digits[::-1]
    s = ''.join([alphabet[i] for i in digits])
    if padding is not None:
        if len(s) < padding:
            pad = alphabet[0] * (padding - len(s))
            s = pad + s
    return s

Wait, but in the case where the alphabet is empty, we raise an error. 

Now, testing this code with some examples.

Test case 1:

number = 0, alphabet = ['a'], padding None → returns 'a'.

Test case 2:

number =1, alphabet ['a','b'], padding None → 'b'.

Test case 3:

number =2, same alphabet → 2 in base 2 is 10 → digits would be 0, then 2//2=1, then 1%2 is 1, so digits would be [0,1]. Reversed gives [1,0], so the string is 'ba'.

Wait, let's step through:

number=2:

Loop:

rem =2%2 →0. digits.append(0). number becomes 2//2 =1.

Then next iteration:

rem =1%2 →1. digits.append(1). number becomes 0. 

Loop exits. 

digits is [0,1], reversed becomes [1,0]. 

So the string is alphabet[1] + alphabet[0] → 'b' + 'a' → 'ba'.

Yes. 

Another test case with padding:

number=1, alphabet ['a','b'], padding 3 → the string is 'b', length 1. 

pad is 'a'*(3-1)= 'aa' → 'aab'.

Yes. 

Another test case where the number requires padding beyond the current length:

number=3 (base 2 → '11' → 'bb'), padding 3 → becomes 'abb' (since 3-2=1, so pad with one 'a').

Wait, no. Wait 3 in base 2 is 11, which is two digits. So with padding 3, the result would be 'abb'? 

Wait, the original string is 'bb', length 2. 

So adding one 'a' gives 'abb'? 

Yes, because 'a'*(3-2) + 'bb' → 'a' + 'bb' → 'abb'.

Yes. 

Okay, that seems to work. 

Another test case where the number is zero and padding is given:

number=0, alphabet ['x'], padding 5 → returns 'xxxxx'.

Because the initial s is 'x', then adding four 'x's gives five.

Yes. 

What about when the number is zero and padding is smaller than the required length? 

Wait, no. The padding is optional. If the current length is 1 (from the zero case), and padding is 0, then since 1 >=0, it remains as 'x'. 

Edge case where padding is zero? Probably allowed, but the code would leave it as is. 

Another case where the padding is less than the current length, so no change. 

Looks good. 

Now, the code must be written exactly as per the problem's requirements. The function's parameters are correct. 

Wait, in the code, after reversing the digits, the code builds the string by taking alphabet[i] for each digit. That's correct. 

Yes, this should work.
