Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _reset_logging method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's see. The function is a class method since it has 'cls' as the first parameter. The docstring says it's to reset the logging system. 

Hmm, how do you reset the logging system in Python? Oh right, the logging module has a manager that keeps track of all loggers. To reset, maybe I should disable all handlers and then reconfigure? Or perhaps get the root logger and remove its handlers?

Wait, the standard approach I remember is to get the logger, iterate over its handlers, and remove them. Then maybe set the level again. Since the goal is to reset, maybe just clear all existing handlers so that the logger starts fresh. 

So the code would be something like:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    for handler in logger.handlers:
        logger.removeHandler(handler)
    # Maybe also set the level to not set?
    logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)

But wait, the function is a method of a class, so perhaps the logging is being managed per instance or the class has its own logger. But the docstring says "the logging system", which probably refers to the root logger. So the code should work as is. 

Alternatively, maybe they want to reset all existing loggers, but that's more complex. Since the function is called _reset_logging, maybe just clearing the root's handlers is sufficient. 

I think that's the way to go. So the code would be as I outlined. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The function is a class method, so inside the method, using the logging module to get the root logger and clear its handlers. 

Yes, that should do it. I'll write that code then.
