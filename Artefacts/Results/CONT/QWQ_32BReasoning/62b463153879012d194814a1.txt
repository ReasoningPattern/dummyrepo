Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the add_rendition method based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function signature is def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path): and the docstring says to assign the file path to "lang" in the _renditions class.

Hmm, so first, the method is part of a class. The _renditions is probably a dictionary stored as an instance variable. So the steps would be: check if _renditions exists, if not, create it. Then add the lang as a key with the file_path as the value.

Wait, the docstring mentions "filepath() in the class". Wait, maybe the file_path is the result of calling a filepath() method? Or maybe it's just passing the file_path directly. The wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again. "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions in the class." Oh, maybe "filepath" is a method that returns the path, so perhaps we should store the result of calling file_path()?

Wait, the parameter is called file_path, so maybe the user just passes the path as an argument, and we store that. The wording might be a bit off. The docstring says "filepath() in the class", perhaps indicating that the file_path parameter is the result of that method. But maybe the function is supposed to take the given file_path and store it under the given lang in the _renditions dictionary.

Assuming that _renditions is a dictionary stored as an instance variable. So in the method, I need to do something like:

self._renditions[lang] = file_path

But first, check if _renditions exists. Wait, maybe the first time, it's not initialized. So perhaps we need to initialize it as a dictionary if it's not present. So:

if not hasattr(self, '_renditions'):
    self._renditions = {}

then add the entry.

Alternatively, maybe the _renditions is supposed to be a list or something else, but the term 'renditions' usually refers to different versions, so a dictionary mapping languages to paths makes sense.

Putting this together, the code would be:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    """
    Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions in the class.
    """
    if not hasattr(self, '_renditions'):
        self._renditions = {}
    self._renditions[lang] = file_path

Wait, but maybe the user intended to store the result of a method called filepath(), but the parameter is named file_path, so perhaps the parameter is the actual path. The docstring says "filepath invoke by filepath() in the class", which is a bit unclear. Maybe the method should call self.filepath() and use that value, but the parameter is called file_path. Hmm, perhaps the docstring is saying that the file path comes from the class's own filepath() method. But the parameters are lang and file_path. So maybe the function is supposed to take the given file_path (which could be from another method) and store it in _renditions under the given language key.

In that case, the code as above is correct. The check for _renditions ensures that the dictionary is initialized before adding the entry. So that's probably the right approach.
