Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called deprecated that takes a message and marks functions or methods as deprecated. Let me think about how decorators work. A decorator function usually takes a function as an argument and returns a wrapped version. But here, the decorator itself has an argument (the message), so I need a outer function for the message. 

So the structure would be something like: the deprecated function returns the actual decorator. That makes sense based on the given signature. The returned function will be the decorator. 

The decorator needs to issue a warning when the function is called. The standard way to do this is to use warnings.warn. The message should include the original function's name and the provided message. 

Wait, also, the wrapped function should still keep the original function's name and docstring, so maybe using functools.wraps to preserve those metadata. 

So steps:

1. Import warnings and functools.

2. The deprecated function takes a message and returns a decorator. Let's call the decorator decorator_func.

3. The decorator_func takes the function to be decorated (the real function being deprecated).

4. Inside, it should create a wrapper function that calls the original function but also issues a DeprecationWarning with the message.

Wait, but when exactly is the warning issued? Probably every time the function is called. So inside the wrapper function, before calling the original, we emit the warning.

The message should probably state that the function is deprecated, include the provided message. So something like f"{func.__name__} is deprecated. {message}".

Also, the DeprecationWarning is the right category here. So using warnings.warn with that category, and maybe a stack level to indicate where the call is coming from.

Putting this together:

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator_func(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(
                f"Deprecated: {message}", 
                DeprecationWarning,
                stacklevel=2  # So it points to the caller, not this wrapper
            )
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator_func

Wait, the message in the warn function should include the function name? Wait, the user's message is passed as the parameter. Let me check the docstring. The doc says the decorator is for deprecating functions, so the warning should mention that the function is deprecated, perhaps along with the message. So maybe the message parameter is additional info. 

Wait the function's docstring says "Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods." The message passed to deprecated is part of the warning. So the warning message should be something like f"Function {func.__name__} is deprecated. {message}" ?

Hmm, but maybe the user's message is the main part. Alternatively, perhaps the message is the entire content. Let me think. The user might write @deprecated("Use new_function instead"). So the warning message should be "Use new_function instead", but also mention the function's name. 

Wait the example in Python's own deprecated functions usually include the function name in the warning. So the warning message should state that the function is deprecated, perhaps with the message as additional info. 

So the warn message could be f"{func.__name__} is deprecated. {message}".

Wait in the code above, the warn message is "Deprecated: " plus the message. Maybe that's redundant. Let me adjust. The message parameter is part of the user's input. So perhaps the full warning is f"{func.__name__} is deprecated: {message}".

Alternatively, maybe the message is the entire warning. Let me read the problem again. The function's doc says "Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods." The user is supposed to provide a message, so the message is part of the warning. The exact phrasing isn't specified, but it's common to include the function's name in the warning.

So I think the code should format the message to include the function's name. 

Therefore, inside the wrapper's warn call, the message should be f"{func.__name__} is deprecated. {message}".

Wait in the example code I wrote earlier, the message is "Deprecated: " + message. That's redundant. Let me correct that. The first part of the message would be the function's name and that it's deprecated, then the user's message.

So the code would have:

warnings.warn(
    f"{func.__name__} is deprecated. {message}",
    DeprecationWarning,
    stacklevel=2
)

Yes. 

Also, need to import warnings and functools. The user's code must have those imports. Since the problem says to generate the code, I need to include those imports at the top.

Wait the problem says to output the code, so I have to make sure that the code includes the necessary imports. So the code should start with:

import warnings
from functools import wraps

Wait, the functools.wraps is needed for the @wraps(func) decorator. So in the code, the wrapper function must use that.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import warnings
from functools import wraps

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(
                f"{func.__name__} is deprecated. {message}",
                DeprecationWarning,
                stacklevel=2
            )
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but in the function signature given in the problem, the deprecated function is supposed to return the decorator. So yes, that's exactly what's happening here. 

Wait, in my code, the outer function is 'decorator', which is returned by deprecated(message). Then the inner functions proceed as usual. 

Testing this, if someone does:

@deprecated("Use newfunc instead")
def oldfunc(): pass

Then calling oldfunc() would trigger a DeprecationWarning with the message "oldfunc is deprecated. Use newfunc instead".

That seems correct. 

I think that's the code. Let me check again for possible mistakes. 

Ah, the stacklevel: stacklevel=2 is correct because when the warning is issued, the stack is: the wrapper function is calling warn, and the caller is the user's code. So stacklevel=2 would point the warning to the line where the deprecated function is called, which is what we want.

Yes. 

So the code should be as written above.
