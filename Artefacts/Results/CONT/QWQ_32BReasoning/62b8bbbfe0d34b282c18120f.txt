Okay, I need to write the Python function file_to_textbuffer that takes a file name and an encoding, and loads the file into a text buffer. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to read the file and store its contents in a text buffer. Wait, what's a text buffer here? Probably a string, since that's the standard way to hold text in memory. So the function should open the file, read its contents using the given encoding, and return the string.

So the steps are: open the file in read mode with the specified encoding. Then read the entire content. Handle possible errors? The docstring doesn't mention error handling, so maybe just proceed with trying to read it. But using a with statement is important for proper file handling.

Wait, the parameters are file_name and encoding. So in Python, the open function can use encoding by passing the encoding parameter. So the code would be something like:

def file_to_textbuffer(file_name, encoding):
    with open(file_name, 'r', encoding=encoding) as f:
        return f.read()

That seems straightforward. Let me check edge cases. What if the file doesn't exist? Then it will raise a FileNotFoundError, which is correct behavior. The function's docstring doesn't specify to handle that, so letting it propagate is okay.

Is there any other consideration? Maybe using 'r' mode, which is correct for reading. The encoding is passed as an argument, so that's covered. The function returns the contents as a string, which is a text buffer in memory. That should meet the requirements.

I think that's all. The code should be as simple as that. Let me write it out.
