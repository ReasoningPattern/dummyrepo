Okay, I need to generate Python code for the inject_config method based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function should check if the 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' environment variable is present in os.environ. If it's not there, then set it to self.ansible_config_path.

Hmm, right. So first, I should import os, because we're dealing with environment variables. Wait, but the function is a method of a class, so maybe the class already has self.ansible_config_path defined. I don't need to worry about that part, just use it.

The steps are straightforward. Check if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' is in os.environ. If not, then set it using os.environ['ANSIBLE_CONFIG'] = self.ansible_config_path. 

Wait, but how does the assignment work here? Oh right, in Python, you just assign to os.environ. So the code inside the method would be:

if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' not in os.environ:
    os.environ['ANSIBLE_CONFIG'] = self.ansible_config_path

That's it. So putting that into the method. Also, the function is a method, so it's inside a class. The user didn't mention any other parts, so just the code for the method.

Wait, the function's docstring says exactly that. So the code should be exactly that. Make sure to import os? Wait, the user didn't mention including any imports. The function is part of a class, so the code should assume that os is already imported. Probably the code is to be written within the class's method, so the user's code will have the necessary imports. So I don't need to add the import here.

So the code would be:

def inject_config(self):
    if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' not in os.environ:
        os.environ['ANSIBLE_CONFIG'] = self.ansible_config_path

Yes, that's it. Let me double-check the docstring. It says if the property does not exist, set it to self.ansible_config_path. Yep, that's exactly what the code does. Okay, that should be correct.
