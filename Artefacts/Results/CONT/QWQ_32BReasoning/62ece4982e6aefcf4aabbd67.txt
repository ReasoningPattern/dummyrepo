Okay, I need to write a Python function called vertex3tuple that takes a list of vertices and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain three points: the current vertex and the two adjacent vertices on either side. But if the indices go out of bounds, I should wrap around using modulo arithmetic so that it's like a circular list.

Let me think about the steps here. Let's say the input is a list like [v1, v2, v3, v4]. For each vertex at index i, I need to get the previous vertex (i-1) and the next vertex (i+1). But since the list is circular, if i-1 is -1, it should be the last element. Similarly, if i+1 is equal to the length, then it should wrap around to 0.

Wait, the problem says if the subscript is out of bounds, take the index as 0? Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me check the docstring again. Oh, the description says "if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". Hmm, maybe that's not exactly correct. Wait, perhaps when accessing vertices beyond the list, like for the first element, the previous element would be the last one, and the next is the second. So maybe using modulo len(vertices) to handle the indices?

Alternatively, the problem might mean that when the index is out of bounds, you take the element at 0? That might not make sense. Wait, perhaps the problem is that for the first element, the previous is the last element, and the next is the second. For the last element, the next is the first, and previous is the second to last. So modulo would be the way to go here.

So the approach would be:

For each index i in the range of the vertices list:

prev_index = (i - 1) % len(vertices)

next_index = (i + 1) % len(vertices)

Then the tuple for the current vertex is (vertices[prev_index], vertices[i], vertices[next_index])

Wait, but the current vertex is part of the three points. Wait the description says "the vertex and the 2 points on both sides". So the three points are the previous vertex, the current vertex, and the next vertex. So the tuple would be (prev, current, next).

Wait the wording says "include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides". So the current vertex is in the middle. So yes, the three elements would be previous, current, next.

So for each i in 0 to len(vertices)-1:

prev is i-1 mod len

current is i

next is i+1 mod len.

So the code needs to loop through each vertex, compute the previous and next indices using modulo, then create the tuple and add to the result list.

Now, in code:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        prev = (i - 1) % n
        curr = i
        next_ = (i + 1) % n
        triplet = (vertices[prev], vertices[curr], vertices[next_])
        result.append(triplet)
    return result

Wait, but what if the list is empty? Then len(vertices) is 0, but the loop won't run. So the function returns an empty list, which is correct.

Wait, but when n is 1, then (i-1) mod 1 is 0, and (i+1) mod 1 is 0. So for a single vertex, the triplet would be (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[0]). Which makes sense because there's only one point, so previous and next are the same as the current. That's correct according to the problem's wrapping requirement.

Another test case: suppose vertices is [A,B,C,D].

For i=0 (A):

prev is -1 mod 4 → 3 → D

next is 1 → B

so triplet is (D, A, B)

i=1 (B):

prev is 0 → A, next is 2 → C → (A,B,C)

i=2 (C): prev is 1, next is 3 → (B,C,D)

i=3 (D): prev is 2, next is 0 mod4 → 0 → A → (C,D,A)

So that's the list.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the code should work. Let me check the function's return type. The docstring says returns a list of tuples. Each element is a tuple of three elements. So the code above does that. The function uses the vertices list and for each index, computes the previous and next via modulo, then appends the triplet. So that's correct.
