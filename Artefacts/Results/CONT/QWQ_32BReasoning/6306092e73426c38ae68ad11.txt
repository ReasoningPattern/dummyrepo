Okay, I need to write a Python function called merge_extra_vars. The function takes two parameters: vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring says to extend vars_dict with the extra_vars. Let me think about what that means.

First, the vars_dict is the dictionary we're merging into. The extra_vars is a list of extra variables. Wait, how are these extra_vars structured? Are they key-value pairs? Like maybe each item in the list is a string in the format "key=value"? That's a common way to represent extra variables in some contexts, like command-line arguments.

So the idea is to parse each item in the extra_vars list into key-value pairs and then add those to vars_dict. But I need to make sure that if a key already exists in vars_dict, whether we overwrite it or not. The docstring doesn't specify, but typically when merging dictionaries, later values override earlier ones. Since the function is called "merge_extra_vars", maybe the extra_vars should take precedence. Wait, but the function's first parameter is vars_dict, and we're extending it with extra_vars. So perhaps the extra_vars should be added on top, overriding existing keys in vars_dict.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Check if extra_vars is provided. The parameter has a default of None, so if it's None or an empty list, we can just return the original vars_dict without changes.

2. Iterate over each element in extra_vars. Each element is probably a string like "key=value". So for each string, split it into key and value. But how to split? Using split('=', 1) to split on the first '='. Because if the value has an '=' in it, splitting on the first occurrence would be better. For example, "host=url=http://example.com" would split into key "host" and value "url=http://example.com".

3. Once split into key and value, add that key-value pair to vars_dict. But since the value is a string, maybe we need to handle different data types? The problem description doesn't mention that, so perhaps just leave them as strings.

Wait, but the function's purpose is to merge, so perhaps the existing vars_dict could have other data types, but the extra_vars are all strings. So we just add them as strings.

So the code outline would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []  # because the default is None, so if called without, use empty list
    for item in extra_vars:
        if '=' in item:
            key, value = item.split('=', 1)
            vars_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # What if the item doesn't have an '='? Maybe it's a key with a None value? Or is that an error?
            # The problem description doesn't say, so perhaps just ignore such items, or set the value to an empty string?
            # Alternatively, maybe treat the entire item as the key and set the value to None or True?
            # The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps we can just skip it, but that might be an error case.
            # Since the problem says "extend with extra-vars", maybe if there's no '=', then the value is an empty string?
            # Or maybe the key is the entire string and the value is True? Not sure. Let's proceed under the assumption that items without '=' are invalid and perhaps skip them, but maybe the function should just process them as key with empty value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that each extra var is properly formatted. So for the code, perhaps just split and if there's no '=', then key is the entire string and value is an empty string? Or maybe the key is the item and the value is None? Hmm.

            # Alternatively, maybe in that case, the key is the item and the value is an empty string. Let's proceed with splitting, and if there's no '=', then key is the whole string and value is an empty string. Wait, but split with 1 would return a list of length 1 if there's no '='. So in that case, key would be the entire string, and value would be an empty string? Wait, no. Let's see: "key".split('=',1) would give ['key', '']? No, wait, if the string is "key" and split on '=', then since there's no '=', it would return a list of one element. So the split would be ["key"], so trying to unpack into key, value would cause a ValueError. Oh right! So in that case, the code would crash if an item doesn't have an '='.

Hmm, so that's a problem. So I need to handle that. So, for each item in extra_vars:

split the item into parts using split('=', 1). If the resulting list has only one part (i.e., no '=' found), then perhaps the key is that part and the value is an empty string? Or maybe the value is None? Or is that an error?

The problem's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the function expects that each item in extra_vars is a properly formatted "key=value" string. So in that case, we can just proceed and let the split error occur? But that would raise a ValueError if there's no '='. That might not be desired. Alternatively, perhaps the code should handle that by setting the value to an empty string. Wait, let's see:

If item is "key", then split('=',1) gives ["key"], so trying to split into key and value would fail. So, perhaps we need to check the length after splitting. Let's adjust the code:

parts = item.split('=', 1)
if len(parts) != 2:
    # handle error case?
    # perhaps skip it, or raise an error? Since the problem says to "extend with extra-vars", maybe just ignore invalid entries.
    continue
else:
    key, value = parts
    vars_dict[key] = value

Alternatively, the function might just proceed, but in that case, the code would crash. Since the problem doesn't mention handling such cases, perhaps the code should just split and process only those items that have an '=', and skip others. So the code would check if '=' is present first. Wait, the initial code had 'if '=' in item: ... else: ...' but that's not sufficient. Because even if '=' is present but split into more parts, but with split(1) it would split into two parts. So maybe the correct approach is to split into parts, check if the length is 2, then proceed, else skip.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should just proceed, but in the case where the split gives only one part, the code would have an error. Since the problem didn't specify, maybe the code can just process only items that have at least one '=', so the code can check if there is an '=', and split only then. So, in the code:

for item in extra_vars:
    if '=' in item:
        key, value = item.split('=', 1)
        vars_dict[key] = value
    else:
        # perhaps ignore, or maybe set the key to the item and value to an empty string?
        # Or perhaps the key is the item and the value is None? Not sure. The problem says "extra-vars", perhaps each entry must have a key and value. So if no '=', then perhaps skip that item. So proceed with that.

So in this case, the code would process only items with an '=', and ignore others.

Putting it all together:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for item in extra_vars:
        if '=' in item:
            key, value = item.split('=', 1)
            vars_dict[key] = value

Wait, but the function's parameters have extra_vars as a list. So the code above should work. But what about the case where extra_vars is not a list? The problem says in the parameters that extra_vars is a list of extra-vars, so the function can assume that. So that's okay.

Wait the function's parameters specify that extra_vars is a list. So we don't have to check for that. The code is okay.

Another point: the function is supposed to extend vars_dict with the extra_vars. So the changes are made in-place? Because the vars_dict is being modified directly. The function returns nothing, but the vars_dict is modified. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with...", so yes, it's modifying the input dictionary.

So this code should work. Let me test with an example.

Suppose vars_dict is {'a': 1}, and extra_vars is ['b=2', 'c=d']. After merging, vars_dict should have a, b, c. The code would split 'b=2' into key 'b' and '2', so vars_dict['b'] = '2'. Similarly for 'c=d', so 'c' becomes 'd'. The original 'a' remains unless overridden. So that's correct.

Another test: if an item in extra_vars is 'x=y=z', then split on the first '=', so key is 'x', value is 'y=z'. That's acceptable.

What about an item without '=' like 'onlykey'? The code skips it, so it's not added.

What if extra_vars is None? The code sets it to empty list, so nothing is added.

So the code seems to handle those cases.

Therefore, the code should be as written above.
