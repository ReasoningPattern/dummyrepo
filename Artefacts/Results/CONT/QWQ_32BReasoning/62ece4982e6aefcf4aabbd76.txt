Okay, I need to write a Python function called match that checks if a given filename is a Doxyfile. Let's see. The function takes a filename as an argument. The docstring says to return True if the filename in lowercase is exactly 'doxyfile'. 

Hmm, right. So the steps are: first, take the filename, convert it to lowercase, then check if it equals 'doxyfile'. So the function should return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'.

Wait, but what about the file extension? Like, is the filename supposed to be the full name including the extension? The problem statement says the type is 'doxyfile', so maybe the filename itself, when lowercased, must be exactly 'doxyfile'. So for example, 'DoxyFile' would become 'doxyfile' and return True. But 'doxyfile.txt' would be 'doxyfile.txt' which isn't equal, so return False. 

So the code is straightforward. The function just does that comparison. 

Therefore, the code would be:

def match(filename):
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

Yes, that's it. I think that's all. Let me check the docstring again. The returns section says exactly that. So the code should be correct.
