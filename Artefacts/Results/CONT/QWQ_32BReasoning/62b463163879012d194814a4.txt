Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _explore_zipfile which uses _group_files_by_xml_filename. Let's see the docstring says it groups the zip path using that function. So first, I should probably open the zip file and list all the entries. Then, I need to process those entries, maybe grouping them by the XML filename. Wait, but how does _group_files_by_xml_filename work? Since I don't have its code, I have to assume it's a helper function that takes a list of files and groups them in some way based on the XML filename. 

Hmm, the function's name suggests that it groups files in the zip by their XML filename. Maybe the zip contains multiple files related to XML files, like some data files for each XML. So the goal is to group those related files together. 

So the steps would be:

1. Open the zip file at zip_path.
2. Get a list of all the file names in the zip.
3. Use the helper function _group_files_by_xml_filename to group these filenames.
4. Return the grouped result.

Wait, but how does the helper function take the list? The docstring of _explore_zipfile says it "groups the given zip path by using...", so maybe the helper function takes the list of files from the zip. Therefore, in the code, after reading the zip's file list, pass that list to the helper.

So the code structure would be something like:

import zipfile

def _explore_zipfile(zip_path):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zf:
        files = zf.namelist()
    return _group_files_by_xml_filename(files)

Wait, but maybe the helper function needs the actual file contents or something else? The docstring isn't clear. But according to the problem, the function's job is to group the zip's files using that helper, so probably just passing the list of filenames is correct here.

I should make sure that the code uses the correct method. The 'namelist()' gives all the entries in the zip. So this code should work. Let me check for possible errors. Oh, the function is supposed to be called _explore_zipfile, and the helper is _group_files_by_xml_filename. Since the problem says to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring, and not to include explanations, I'll proceed with that.

I think that's it. The code will open the zip, get the list, pass it to the helper function, and return the result.
