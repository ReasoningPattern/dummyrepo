Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the normalized method based on the given docstring. The function's purpose is to normalize all units of time to integers. Hmm, so probably the method is part of a class that represents some time units, maybe like days, hours, minutes, etc. The task is to convert all those units into a single integer representation, like total seconds or something similar.

Wait, the docstring says "Normalize all units of time to integers." So maybe each unit (like days, hours, etc.) is stored as an integer, but perhaps they were stored as other types before? Or maybe the method combines all the time components into a single integer value. For example, if the class has attributes like days, hours, minutes, then normalized would convert all of those into a total number of minutes or seconds as an integer.

Alternatively, maybe the method returns a new instance where all the time units are converted to a common unit. Like, if there are days, hours, etc., they are all converted to seconds and summed up into an integer.

Wait, but the function is a method called normalized, so perhaps it returns a new object with all units normalized. But the docstring says "Normalize all units of time to integers." So maybe each component is converted to an integer? Or perhaps the method converts all time units into a single unit, like total seconds as an integer.

Assuming that the class has various time units stored as attributes (like years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, etc.), the normalized method would combine all these into a single integer representing the total time in a base unit. For instance, converting everything to seconds and summing them up. But without knowing the exact class structure, I have to make some assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe each unit is stored as a separate integer, and the normalized method ensures that they are all in the correct form. Like, if someone set hours to 2.5, it would convert to 2 hours and 30 minutes, but normalized would adjust so that all units are integers. But that might involve propagating the decimal parts to lower units.

Hmm, perhaps the method is part of a time delta class. Let me think of a possible structure. Suppose the class has attributes like days, hours, minutes, seconds. To normalize, you would convert everything into the smallest unit, say seconds, so days would be converted to seconds by multiplying by 24*3600, hours to 3600, etc., and sum all into a total_seconds integer. But then the normalized method might return that total as an integer. Or maybe it returns a new instance where all the higher units are properly calculated so that no lower units are left. Like, if you have 60 minutes, that becomes 1 hour, so normalized would adjust so that minutes are less than 60, hours are adjusted accordingly, etc. That's another possible interpretation.

The problem is the docstring is a bit vague. The key is "Normalize all units of time to integers." So perhaps each unit (like days, hours, etc.) is stored as an integer, and the method ensures that they are all integers, maybe converting from a float? Or maybe it's converting all the time units into a single integer representation, like total number of seconds as an integer.

Alternatively, perhaps the class has units stored as separate values (like days, hours, etc.), and the normalized method combines them into a single integer value, such as total seconds. But how to code that without knowing the class's attributes?

Hmm, maybe the method is part of a class that has a list or dictionary of time units, and the normalized method converts each unit's value to an integer. But that seems a bit vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to return a new instance where all the time components are in their proper ranges. For example, if there are 70 minutes, that would convert to 1 hour and 10 minutes, so the normalized version would have hours increased by 1 and minutes set to 10, ensuring that each unit is within its valid range (like minutes <60). So the normalized method would adjust all the units so that they don't overflow into higher units. But in that case, the normalization would involve converting each unit into integers and propagating overflows.

Alternatively, maybe the units are stored as floats, and the normalized method converts them all to integers by truncating or rounding, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, the method could return a new object where all the time is expressed in the smallest unit (e.g., seconds) as an integer, combining all other units. For example, if the class has days, hours, minutes, and seconds, the normalized would compute total_seconds = days*86400 + hours*3600 + minutes*60 + seconds, then return that as an integer.

But without knowing the exact structure of the class, it's a bit hard. But given that the function is called normalized and the docstring says to normalize to integers, perhaps the correct approach is to sum all the time units into a single integer value, such as total_seconds.

Wait, perhaps the class is similar to Python's timedelta, but maybe with more units. Let's think of an example. Suppose the class has attributes like years, months, days, hours, etc. But those are hard to normalize into a single unit because months can vary in days. So maybe the normalized method here is to convert all units into days, hours, etc., but ensuring that each is an integer. Or perhaps it's just converting each unit to an integer, like if they were stored as floats, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is part of a class that has time components in different units, and the normalized method returns a new instance where all the units are integers. For example, if a component was 2.5 hours, it would be converted to 2 hours and 30 minutes, so that each unit is an integer. The normalized method would propagate the decimal parts into lower units until all are integers.

That makes sense. Let's think of that approach. For instance, if the class has days, hours, minutes, and seconds, each as a float, then normalized would convert them into integers by carrying over the fractions. Like, 2.5 days would be 2 days and 12 hours (since 0.5 days is 12 hours). Then 12 hours would be added to the hours component, and so on, until all components are integers.

So the normalized method would process each component, starting from the largest unit (like days), take the integer part, then the fractional part is converted to the next smaller unit (hours), add that to the existing hours, and repeat until all units are integers.

But how to implement that without knowing the actual attributes? Well, maybe the code would assume that the class has certain attributes. For example, let's suppose the class has days, hours, minutes, and seconds as attributes. The normalized method would need to adjust these so that each is an integer.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that uses a dictionary to store units and their values, and the normalized method converts all values to integers. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to return a new instance where all time components are converted to the smallest unit (like seconds) as an integer. So, for example, if the class has days, hours, minutes, and seconds, then normalized would compute the total number of seconds as an integer and return that. But the function is a method, so maybe it returns an object of the same class with all the units normalized to the smallest unit.

Alternatively, the method could return the total number of seconds as an integer. But the function is called normalized, so maybe it's returning an object with normalized units.

Hmm. Since the problem doesn't give more context, perhaps the code is straightforward. Let's think of the simplest case. Maybe the class has an attribute that's a float, and normalized converts it to an integer. But the docstring says "all units of time", implying multiple units. 

Alternatively, perhaps the class has multiple attributes like years, months, days, etc., and normalized converts each to an integer, perhaps by truncating decimal parts, but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is something like:

def normalized(self):
    return self.days * 86400 + self.hours * 3600 + self.minutes * 60 + self.seconds

But that would return an integer, but the method's return type isn't specified. The problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is given as:

def normalized(self):
    """
    Normalize all units of time to integers.
    """

The function's return type isn't specified here, so perhaps it returns a new instance where all the units are integers. But without knowing the class's structure, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the code is simply returning an integer that's the sum of all time units converted to a base unit. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to ensure that all the instance's attributes are integers. For example, if the class has attributes like 'seconds' as a float, then normalized would set it to an integer. But then the method would modify the instance's attributes. But since it's a method, maybe it returns a new instance with normalized values.

Alternatively, the method could return a new object where all the time components are integers. For example, if the original had 1.5 hours, the normalized version would have 1 hour and 30 minutes, so hours=1, minutes=30, etc.

To implement that, you might need to process each component, starting from the largest unit and converting the fractional parts into the next smaller unit.

Suppose the class has days, hours, minutes, seconds as attributes. Let's say the normalized method would process days first. Take the integer part of days, then the fractional part is converted to hours (0.5 days = 12 hours). Add that to the existing hours, then process hours similarly, converting fractional to minutes, etc. until all are integers.

Let's try to code that. Here's a possible approach:

def normalized(self):
    days = self.days
    hours = self.hours
    minutes = self.minutes
    seconds = self.seconds

    # Process days
    int_days = int(days)
    fractional_days = days - int_days
    added_hours = fractional_days * 24  # convert days to hours

    hours += added_hours

    # Now process hours
    int_hours = int(hours)
    fractional_hours = hours - int_hours
    added_minutes = fractional_hours * 60

    minutes += added_minutes

    # Process minutes
    int_minutes = int(minutes)
    fractional_minutes = minutes - int_minutes
    added_seconds = fractional_minutes * 60

    seconds += added_seconds

    # Now process seconds (though maybe we need to handle fractions here too)
    int_seconds = int(seconds)
    # But if there's a fractional second, perhaps we can ignore or round?

    # So the normalized values are the integers:
    return self.__class__(
        days=int_days,
        hours=int_hours,
        minutes=int_minutes,
        seconds=int_seconds
    )

Wait, but this is just an example assuming the class has those attributes and a constructor that takes them. But without knowing the actual class structure, this is a guess. Alternatively, maybe the code is simpler, like converting each attribute to an integer.

Alternatively, perhaps the normalized method just returns an integer that is the sum of all time units converted to a base unit. For example, total_seconds = days * 86400 + hours * 3600 + etc. So:

def normalized(self):
    total_seconds = (
        self.days * 86400 +
        self.hours * 3600 +
        self.minutes * 60 +
        self.seconds
    )
    return int(total_seconds)

But this would return an integer, and the method's return type isn't specified. The problem says "normalize all units of time to integers", which could mean converting each unit into an integer, but if they are already integers, perhaps the method just returns the same instance?

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to return a new instance where each unit is an integer, by converting any fractional parts into lower units. Like the first example I thought of.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to return a dictionary with all the units as integers, but the function's return isn't specified.

Hmm, given the ambiguity, perhaps the code is as simple as returning an integer that represents the total time in seconds, assuming that the class has days, hours, etc. attributes. But the docstring says "Normalize all units of time to integers." So maybe each unit is converted to an integer, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to return a new instance where each time unit is an integer, by truncating any fractions. For example:

def normalized(self):
    return self.__class__(
        days=int(self.days),
        hours=int(self.hours),
        minutes=int(self.minutes),
        seconds=int(self.seconds)
    )

But that would lose the fractional parts, which might not be correct. The normalization might need to carry over the fractions into smaller units instead of truncating.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to convert each unit into an integer, so for example, if there's a 0.5 days, that's converted to 12 hours, so the hours component is increased by 12, and days becomes an integer. So the normalization propagates the fractions into lower units until all are integers.

In that case, the code would need to handle each unit step by step.

Let me try to write that code. Suppose the class has days, hours, minutes, seconds.

def normalized(self):
    # Start with days
    days = self.days
    hours = self.hours
    minutes = self.minutes
    seconds = self.seconds

    # Process days to hours
    days_int = int(days)
    hours += (days - days_int) * 24
    days = days_int

    # Process hours to minutes
    hours_int = int(hours)
    minutes += (hours - hours_int) * 60
    hours = hours_int

    # Process minutes to seconds
    minutes_int = int(minutes)
    seconds += (minutes - minutes_int) * 60
    minutes = minutes_int

    # Process seconds (but we might need to handle fractions here)
    # Assuming seconds can have fractions, but normalized requires them to be integers
    # So maybe take the integer part of seconds
    seconds_int = int(seconds)
    # The remaining fraction is lost, but perhaps that's acceptable?

    return self.__class__(
        days=days,
        hours=hours,
        minutes=minutes,
        seconds=seconds_int
    )

Wait, but this code would need to handle each step, converting the fractional part of the current unit into the next smaller unit. The problem is, this requires that the class has those attributes and a constructor that takes them.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is simpler, and the method just returns the sum as an integer, like total_seconds.

Alternatively, maybe the code is returning a new instance with all the units converted to integers by truncating. But that's not proper normalization.

Hmm. Since the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the docstring is brief, perhaps the intended code is to return the total number of seconds as an integer. So assuming the class has days, hours, minutes, and seconds attributes:

def normalized(self):
    total_seconds = (
        self.days * 86400 +
        self.hours * 3600 +
        self.minutes * 60 +
        self.seconds
    )
    return int(total_seconds)

But then the docstring says "Normalize all units of time to integers." So maybe each unit is converted to an integer, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the method returns a dictionary or a tuple of the units as integers. But without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to return a new instance where each time component is an integer, and the fractions are carried over properly.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the simplest way is to assume that the method returns an integer that represents the total time in seconds. So the code would sum all the units converted to seconds and return that as an integer. The docstring mentions "all units", so this approach would normalize all into a single integer.

Alternatively, maybe the method returns a new instance where all the units are integers, by properly converting fractions. For example, if the class has a constructor that takes days, hours, etc., the code would process each unit step by step.

Since I have to write the code without knowing the class's structure, perhaps the best assumption is that the normalized method returns an integer representing the total time in seconds. Let me go with that approach.

Wait, but the function's return type isn't specified. The user didn't give a return type, so the code can return an int. Let me proceed.

So the code would be:

def normalized(self):
    total_seconds = (
        self.days * 86400 +
        self.hours * 3600 +
        self.minutes * 60 +
        self.seconds
    )
    return int(total_seconds)

But this requires that the class has days, hours, etc. attributes. Since the problem doesn't specify, this is an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to return a new instance with all units converted to the smallest unit. But without knowing the class structure, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the code is simply converting each unit to an integer, like:

def normalized(self):
    self.days = int(self.days)
    self.hours = int(self.hours)
    self.minutes = int(self.minutes)
    self.seconds = int(self.seconds)
    return self

But that would modify the instance's attributes, but the method's name is normalized, which might imply returning a new instance instead of modifying in place.

Hmm. Given the lack of information, perhaps the first approach is best. Let me proceed with the code that returns the total_seconds as an integer.

Wait, but the docstring says "Normalize all units of time to integers." So perhaps each unit is an integer, so maybe the method returns a new instance where all the time components are integers, by properly converting fractions into the lower units.

Let me try to code that. Let's assume the class has days, hours, minutes, seconds as floats, and the normalized method converts them to integers by propagating fractions:

def normalized(self):
    # Start with days
    days = self.days
    hours = self.hours
    minutes = self.minutes
    seconds = self.seconds

    # Process days to hours
    days_int = int(days)
    hours += (days - days_int) * 24
    days = days_int

    # Process hours to minutes
    hours_int = int(hours)
    minutes += (hours - hours_int) * 60
    hours = hours_int

    # Process minutes to seconds
    minutes_int = int(minutes)
    seconds += (minutes - minutes_int) * 60
    minutes = minutes_int

    # Process seconds to integer
    seconds_int = int(seconds)
    # The remaining fraction is lost, but perhaps that's acceptable for normalization

    return self.__class__(
        days=days,
        hours=hours,
        minutes=minutes,
        seconds=seconds_int
    )

This code assumes the class has a constructor that takes days, hours, etc. as parameters. This way, the normalized method returns a new instance with all integer units, properly normalized.

This seems plausible. The docstring says "Normalize all units of time to integers," so converting each unit to an integer by carrying over fractions into lower units makes sense.

Therefore, I'll write the code based on this logic.
