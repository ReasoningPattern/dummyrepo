Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the ansible_config_manager method based on the provided docstring and function signature. Let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. The function is a class method that should retrieve the ansible config manager using ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER from cls._get_service(). 

First, I should check the parameters. The function is defined with (cls), so it's a class method. The docstring mentions using ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER, so I'll need to import that enum or constant if it's defined elsewhere. But since the code is supposed to be self-contained here, maybe ServiceName is part of the existing codebase, so I can just reference it directly.

The key line is "Gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So the method probably calls cls._get_service() with the ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER as an argument. 

Assuming that cls._get_service is a method that takes a service name and returns the corresponding service instance. So the code would be something like returning cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER).

Wait, the function is called ansible_config_manager, and it's a method. So putting it all together:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER)

But I should make sure that the ServiceName is properly imported. However, the problem states not to include any explanations, just the code. So perhaps the ServiceName is already defined in the current scope, so no need for an import here.

Wait, the user didn't mention any other parts, so the code should just be the method as per the signature and docstring. Therefore, the code is straightforward. The method simply returns the result of cls._get_service with that specific service name.

I should also check if there's any other logic needed. The docstring doesn't mention any exceptions or additional steps, so the simplest implementation is to return that service. 

So the final code would look like this inside the class. Since it's a method, it's part of a class, but the user just wants the function defined as per the signature. Therefore, the code is as above. I just need to write that, ensuring that the indentation is correct for a method inside a class. But since the code is to be output as is, without the class context, perhaps the function is written with the cls parameter, so it's a class method. 

Yes, that's all. So the code is just a one-liner returning the service.
