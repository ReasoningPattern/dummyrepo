Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called workspace_manager and it's a class method. The docstring says it gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

Hmm, so I need to write a class method decorated with @classmethod. The function should return the result of calling cls._get_service() with the argument ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER. 

Wait, first I need to make sure that ServiceName is imported or defined somewhere. But since the problem doesn't mention that, maybe it's part of the existing codebase. The user didn't ask for any imports, so I'll just use it as is.

The structure should be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    [docstring as given]
    """
    return cls._get_service()(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

Wait, no, wait. The wording in the docstring says "via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So probably, the function should call cls._get_service() with the ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER as an argument. So maybe the _get_service is a method that takes a service name and returns the service instance.

Therefore the code would be something like:

return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

Wait, but maybe _get_service is a method that when called without arguments returns a function, and then you pass the ServiceName to that function? The wording in the docstring is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: "Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". The phrase "via" might mean that the service name is passed to _get_service.

Alternatively, perhaps the _get_service() method is a method that when called, returns a service, and ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER is the specific service being retrieved. So maybe the correct code is to call cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER). 

Alternatively, maybe the _get_service is a method that returns a service, and the ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER is the key to get that service. For example, maybe cls._get_service() is a dictionary or a function that takes the service name as an argument.

Assuming that the correct approach is to call cls._get_service with the ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER as an argument. Therefore the code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

Yes, that makes sense. So the function is a class method that returns the result of calling the class's _get_service method with the specific ServiceName. 

I need to make sure that the code is formatted correctly. Also, the user mentioned to output only the code in Python markdown format, which probably means just the code without any extra text. So the final code should be as above. Let me check again. The docstring says exactly that the workspace manager is gotten via that ServiceName in the _get_service call. So the code should be straightforward. I think that's it.
