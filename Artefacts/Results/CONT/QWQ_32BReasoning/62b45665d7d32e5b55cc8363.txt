Okay, I need to generate Python code for the make_parsers function based on the given docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says to build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple. 

Hmm, I remember that in Python, argument parsing is often done using the argparse module. So the main parser is created with argparse.ArgumentParser, and then subparsers are added using add_subparsers. The function should probably create the main parser, set up the subparsers, and then return both as a tuple (parser, subparsers).

Wait, the function doesn't take any arguments, so I'll start by importing argparse. Then inside the function, create the parser. Let me structure this step by step.

First line: import argparse. Then, inside make_parsers:

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return parser, subparsers

Wait, but when you call add_subparsers(), sometimes you need to specify a dest or other parameters, but the docstring doesn't mention any specifics. Maybe the minimal setup is enough. The key is to return the parser and the subparsers as a tuple. 

Wait, the add_subparsers() method returns a _SubParsersAction object, which is what you use to add subparsers. So the function should return (parser, subparsers). 

Let me check the syntax again. The code seems straightforward. So the code would look like that. I think that's all. Let me make sure there are no typos. The function name is correct, and the return is a tuple of two elements. Yes, that should do it.
