Okay, I need to write a Python function called integral that takes two parameters: bins and edges. The goal is to calculate the area of the overall graph based on these inputs. Let's think about how histograms work here. 

Hmm, bins are probably the heights of each bar in the histogram, and edges are the bin edges. The area of each bar would be the height (from bins) multiplied by the width of the bin. So the total area is the sum of each bin's area.

Wait, right. So first, I need to find the width of each bin. The edges array should have the boundaries between bins. For example, if edges is [0,1,2], the first bin's width is 1-0=1, and the second is 2-1=1, so each bin has width 1 here. So the widths are the differences between consecutive edges.

So the steps are: iterate over each bin, calculate the width between edges[i+1] and edges[i], multiply by the bin's height (bins[i]), then sum all those products.

Wait, but how do the bins and edges align? The length of bins should be one less than the length of edges. For example, if edges has n elements, there are n-1 bins. So if len(bins) is not len(edges)-1, that might be an error, but maybe the function expects that the inputs are correctly provided. Since the problem says to calculate the area, I can assume that the inputs are compatible.

So the code steps:

Initialize total_area to 0.

Loop over each i from 0 to len(bins)-1:

width = edges[i+1] - edges[i]

height = bins[i]

add width * height to total_area.

Then return total_area.

So putting that into Python code.

The function def is given. The docstring says to calculate the area.

So the code would be something like:

def integral(bins, edges):
    total_area = 0.0
    for i in range(len(bins)):
        width = edges[i + 1] - edges[i]
        total_area += bins[i] * width
    return total_area

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me test with an example.

Suppose bins = [1, 2], edges = [0, 2, 3]. Then the first bin's width is 2-0=2? Wait wait, no. Wait edges for two bins would be three elements. Let's see, the first bin is between edges[0] and edges[1], so the width is edges[1] - edges[0]. The second bin is edges[1] to edges[2], so width edges[2]-edges[1]. So for the example edges [0,2,3], the first bin's width is 2, second is 1. So if bins are [1,2], then the areas would be 1*2 + 2*1 = 2 + 2 = 4. So the total would be 4, which is correct.

Another test case: edges are [1,3], and bins has length 1. Then the width is 2, so area is bins[0] * 2.

Yes, the code should work. So the code is as written above. I think that's all.
