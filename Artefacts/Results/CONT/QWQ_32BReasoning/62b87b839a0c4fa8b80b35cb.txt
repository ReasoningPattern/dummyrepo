Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _get_err_indices method based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function is supposed to find all error indexes corresponding to a coordinate name, coord_name. 

Hmm, first, I should think about where the errors might be stored. Maybe the class has some kind of error data structure, like a dictionary that maps coordinate names to lists of indices where errors occurred. So perhaps something like self.errors which is a dictionary. 

The function's parameters are self and coord_name. The docstring says it returns the error indexes for that specific coord_name. So the method would check if coord_name exists in the errors dictionary. If it does, return the list of indices. If not, maybe return an empty list or raise an error? The docstring doesn't specify, but since it's about finding all, probably returning an empty list makes sense if there are no errors for that coordinate.

Wait, but the function is called _get_err_indices, which suggests it's a private method. So maybe the internal structure is known. Let me structure the code. 

So inside the method, first check if coord_name is a key in self.errors. Then return self.errors[coord_name]. If not present, return an empty list. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to collect indices from some other source, like a list of errors with coordinates and indices?

Alternatively, maybe the errors are stored in a list of tuples or something. But without more context, the simplest approach is to assume that self.errors is a dictionary where each key is a coordinate name and the value is a list of indices. 

So the code would be:

def _get_err_indices(self, coord_name):
    return self.errors.get(coord_name, [])

That's concise. But maybe the problem expects a loop or something else? Like, perhaps the errors are stored in a different structure. But given the information, the dictionary approach makes sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the errors are stored in a list, and the method has to iterate through them to find entries where the coordinate name matches, then collect the indices. For example, if self.errors is a list of (coord, index) pairs, then:

def _get_err_indices(self, coord_name):
    return [idx for coord, idx in self.errors if coord == coord_name]

But that would be less efficient if called multiple times. Since the first approach with a dictionary is O(1) access, the first solution is better. But since the problem doesn't specify the internal data structure, maybe I should go with the first approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the class has a way to track errors per coordinate. Since the user hasn't provided more details, the first approach is the most straightforward. 

Therefore, the code would be as simple as using a dictionary get. So the code is as I first thought. Let me write that.
