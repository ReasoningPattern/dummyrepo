Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method get_spec_defaults based on the provided docstring. The function's purpose is to resolve arguments' values from the spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). 

First, I should figure out what the method is supposed to do. The docstring mentions resolving arguments' values, so maybe it's about gathering default values from a specification. The self._get_defaults() method is likely a helper that retrieves default values from various places.

The function is part of a class, so 'self' is the instance. The method doesn't have parameters besides self. The return value isn't specified, but probably a dictionary of the resolved defaults.

Let me think about the steps. Maybe the method loops through the parameters in the spec, and for each, it calls self._get_defaults() to get the value. Then it constructs a dictionary with the parameter names and their default values.

Wait, perhaps the spec is stored in an attribute like self.spec. So the code might iterate over each parameter in self.spec, then for each parameter, determine if it has a default, and use self._get_defaults() to resolve it. Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() method handles all parameters by name.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() function is called with the spec as an argument or uses the spec internally. The exact implementation depends on how the class is structured, but since I don't have that info, I need to make a reasonable assumption.

The function's name suggests it's returning the defaults from the spec. So perhaps:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    defaults = {}
    for param in self.spec.params:  # assuming there's a params list in the spec
        default = self._get_defaults(param)
        defaults[param.name] = default
    return defaults

But the exact structure of the spec might vary. Alternatively, maybe the spec has a 'parameters' section, and each parameter has a 'default' key. But the problem states that the values are resolved from the spec and other sources via _get_defaults(), so perhaps the _get_defaults() function knows how to look up the default for a parameter, possibly from the spec or other places.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to collect all the default values for parameters defined in the spec by using the helper function. The code could be something like:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults(self.spec)

But that might be too simplistic. The docstring says "resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources", so maybe it's more involved. Perhaps the method needs to go through each argument in the spec, and for each, get its default using _get_defaults, which might check environment variables, config files, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() method is designed to take a spec and return all the defaults. So the code is straightforward.

Wait, the user's function signature is a method with no parameters. The docstring says it uses self._get_defaults() to resolve the values. So perhaps the code is as simple as calling that method and returning the result. Like:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But that might not involve the spec. The docstring mentions "from spec and other sources", so maybe the _get_defaults() function uses the spec internally. In that case, the code could indeed just be a wrapper around that call. However, perhaps the _get_defaults() requires some parameters. Without more info, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the get_spec_defaults needs to process each parameter in the spec and collect their defaults via _get_defaults. For example:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    defaults = {}
    for param in self.spec.parameters:
        defaults[param.name] = self._get_defaults(param)
    return defaults

But again, the exact structure depends on the spec's structure. Since the user hasn't provided the class's other methods or attributes, I have to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the _get_defaults() method is supposed to handle all the logic, so get_spec_defaults just calls it and returns the result. So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But the docstring says "resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()", implying that the method's role is to coordinate getting the defaults using the spec. Maybe the _get_defaults() is a helper that takes the spec into account.

Alternatively, maybe the code is:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults(self.spec)

But again, without knowing the parameters of _get_defaults, it's tricky.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to iterate over each parameter in the spec, and for each, call self._get_defaults() with the parameter's name or other details, then collect those into a dictionary.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() function returns a dictionary of all the defaults when given the spec, so:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults(self.spec)

But I'm not sure. Since the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given docstring and function signature, perhaps the code is as simple as returning the result of self._get_defaults(), assuming that method already does the work with the spec.

Alternatively, maybe the method has to combine the spec's parameters with the defaults. Let me think again.

The function's docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()". So the main action is to use the spec and other sources, and the _get_defaults() method is the way to do that. So perhaps the code is simply:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But then why mention the spec in the docstring? Maybe the _get_defaults() uses the spec internally. So that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the method loops through each parameter in the spec, and for each, it uses self._get_defaults() to get the value. For example:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    defaults = {}
    for param in self.spec.params:
        defaults[param.name] = self._get_defaults(param.name)
    return defaults

But without knowing the exact structure of the spec or the parameters, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the get_spec_defaults is supposed to call _get_defaults() with the parameters from the spec. But I'm not sure.

Since the user's example in the problem shows that the code is to be written without any markdown and just the code in a Python code block, perhaps the correct code is as simple as:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But maybe the _get_defaults() is a method that returns the necessary dictionary. Alternatively, perhaps the code is more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults(self.spec)

Assuming that _get_defaults takes the spec as an argument. But without knowing the parameters of _get_defaults, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the code is:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return {name: self._get_defaults(name) for name in self.spec.arguments}

But again, this depends on the structure.

Hmm. Since the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()", perhaps the code is straightforward, just calling the helper method and returning its result. So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

Alternatively, if the _get_defaults() method requires parameters, but the docstring doesn't mention them, maybe the helper already uses the spec from the instance. So the code is as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to return the defaults for all parameters in the spec, so it's a dictionary where each key is the parameter name, and the value is obtained via self._get_defaults for that parameter. So:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    defaults = {}
    for param in self.spec.params:
        defaults[param.name] = self._get_defaults(param.name)
    return defaults

But again, without knowing the exact structure of the spec, this is a guess. Since the problem is to generate code based on the given info, perhaps the simplest approach is to call self._get_defaults() and return that. Because the docstring says that the method uses self._get_defaults() to do the work, so the code is just returning the result of that method.

Therefore, the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() is a method that needs to be passed the spec. For example, if the spec is an attribute of self, then:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults(self.spec)

But since the function's docstring mentions "from spec and other sources", perhaps the _get_defaults() function is already designed to take into account the spec when called. Therefore, the code is just returning the result of that method.

Alternatively, perhaps the _get_defaults() returns a dictionary of defaults, so the code is as above. 

In the absence of more information, I think the simplest answer is to return the result of self._get_defaults(). So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But maybe the method is supposed to process the spec first. Alternatively, perhaps the code is:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults(spec=self.spec)

But again, without knowing the parameters of _get_defaults, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the _get_defaults() is a method that requires the parameter names, so the code loops through all parameters in the spec and collects their defaults. But how to get the parameters?

Assuming that self.spec has a list of parameters, each with a name, then:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    defaults = {}
    for param in self.spec.params:
        defaults[param.name] = self._get_defaults(param.name)
    return defaults

But since the problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring, and the docstring doesn't give more details, perhaps the first approach is better. 

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() already takes care of the spec, so the code is as simple as returning that method's result. 

Given that the user's example in the problem shows that the code is to be written without any markdown and just the code in a Python code block, perhaps the correct code is simply returning self._get_defaults(). 

So I'll go with that.
