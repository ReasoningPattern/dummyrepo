Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function directlyProvidedBy(object) based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function is supposed to return the interfaces directly provided by the object, and the return type is an IDeclaration from zope.interface.interfaces.

First, I remember that in Zope Interface, the standard way to get the directly provided interfaces of an object is using zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy(). So the function should probably just call that.

Wait, but the user is writing a function with the same name and purpose. Oh right, maybe they want to wrap it or something, but according to the problem statement, they just need to generate the code based on the docstring. So the correct approach is to import zope.interface and return directlyProvidedBy from there.

So the code would start with importing the necessary module. Let me think: from zope.interface import directlyProvidedBy. Then the function can just return directlyProvidedBy(object). But wait, the function's name here is the same as the imported one. Oh right, maybe we need to import it as something else, but the function's code is supposed to be as per the problem. Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to use the zope.interface's function directly.

Wait the user is to generate the code for the function. So the code would be:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    [the docstring given]
    """
    return zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy(object)

But then, I need to make sure that the zope.interface is imported. Since the problem says to generate the code based on the signature and docstring, perhaps the code should include the necessary import statements. Wait the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python code. So the function must be written correctly, including any necessary imports?

Hmm, the user's instruction says to generate the Python code based on the signature and docstring. The function's docstring mentions that the return is an IDeclaration from zope.interface.interfaces. Therefore, the code must use the zope.interface module.

Therefore, the correct code is to import the directlyProvidedBy function from zope.interface and return it. But how to structure that in the function. Wait, actually, the function is supposed to do exactly what zope.interface's directlyProvidedBy does, so the code would be:

from zope.interface import directlyProvidedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    [the docstring]
    """
    return directlyProvidedBy(object)

Wait, but that would have a name conflict. Because the function being defined is named directlyProvidedBy, same as the imported one. To avoid that, perhaps the import should be as:

import zope.interface

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    ...
    return zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy(object)

That way, there's no name conflict. So the code would need to import the zope.interface module, then call the function from there. That's better. So the code would be:

import zope.interface

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy(object)

Yes, that should work. Let me check the docstring formatting. The user's docstring has a note about the return value being an IDeclaration, using the `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration` syntax, which is typical for Sphinx Napoleon documentation. The code's docstring should match exactly what was provided. So the triple quotes include the text as given, with the note. The function's code just returns the result of the zope.interface's function.

Therefore, the correct code is as above. So I'll write that, making sure to include the import statement. Wait, but in the problem statement, the user says to output only the code generated, in Python code. So the code should include the import?

Wait, the function signature given starts with def directlyProvidedBy(object):, so the code must define that function. The import is necessary for the code to work, so it must be included. Therefore, the code should start with the import, then the function.

Yes. So the final code is:

import zope.interface

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy(object)

That's it. I think that's correct. No other steps needed. The function just calls the zope.interface's function. The docstring is exactly as provided, with the note about the return value. The return type is an IDeclaration as specified. So this should be the correct code.
