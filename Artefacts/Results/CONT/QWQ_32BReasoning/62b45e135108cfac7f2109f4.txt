Okay, I need to generate the Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's see. The function is called is_valid, takes self and identifier as parameters. The docstring says to return True if the identifier is valid, and in this base implementation, always return True. 

Hmm, the (D) might indicate something, but maybe it's just part of the docstring. The user wants the code without any explanations. So I should write the method exactly as specified. 

The function is an instance method since it has self. The docstring is properly formatted. The base case is to always return True, so the code inside the function should just have return True. 

Wait, I need to make sure that the indentation is correct. Since it's a method, it's part of a class. But the user didn't mention the class, so the code as given is just the function definition. So the code would be:

def is_valid(self, identifier):
    """
    Return True if identifier is valid. In this base implementation, always return True.  (D)
    """
    return True

Yes, that's it. No need for anything else. The docstring is exactly as provided. The function returns True unconditionally. I think that's all.
