Okay, I need to generate the Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called keys and it's supposed to return the __keys property as a list. Let me start by thinking about the structure.

The function is defined with def keys(self):, and the docstring says it returns the __keys property. So probably, the method is part of a class, and the class has a property named __keys. Since it's using double underscores, that might be a private variable, like __keys is the actual name of the private attribute.

So the method should simply return self.__keys. But wait, what if __keys isn't a list? The docstring specifies to return it as a List. Maybe the __keys is already a list, so returning it directly is okay. Alternatively, perhaps the method should convert it into a list if it's stored in another format, but the problem statement doesn't mention that. The docstring says "returns the __keys property", so probably just returning it as is.

Therefore, the code would be:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return self.__keys

Hmm, but I should make sure that the method is part of a class. Since the function is defined with self as the first parameter, that's implied. The user probably expects that the __keys is an attribute of the class instance. So this should be correct. I don't see any other requirements here. The docstring is straightforward. Alright, that's the code.
