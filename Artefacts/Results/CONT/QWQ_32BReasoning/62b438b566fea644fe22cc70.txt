Okay, I need to generate Python code for the bash_completion function based on the provided docstring. The function's purpose is to produce the borgmatic command by introspecting its command-line argument parsers. 

First, I remember that bash completion scripts often use argparse's arguments to generate possible options. Since the function mentions introspecting the parsers, I should look into how borgmatic's command-line arguments are structured. 

Wait, but how do I access those parsers? Maybe the borgmatic code has a main parser and subparsers. I'll need to import the necessary modules from borgmatic. Oh right, in borgmatic's code, the main entry point is in the 'borgmatic.borgmatic' module, which sets up the argument parsers.

So, the plan is: import the necessary parts of borgmatic to get the argument parsers. Then, walk through the parsers to collect all possible commands and options. Then output them in a format suitable for bash completion.

Hmm, the function should probably return the completion string, but the docstring says "produce" which might mean printing? Or maybe generating the script. Let me check the standard approach. Usually, a bash completion function would generate the completions based on the current command line. So maybe the function here is supposed to output a bash completion script that can be evaluated.

Alternatively, the function might be part of a larger system where when called, it generates the necessary completions. But given the docstring, perhaps it's supposed to introspect the parsers and output the possible commands and options.

Wait, perhaps the function is meant to be called when the user invokes 'borgmatic' with the --bash-completion option, and it outputs the completion script. But the problem here is to write the Python function that does this.

Looking at existing code examples, maybe the function will use the argparse.ArgumentParser's _get_optionals() and _positionals to list the options. But since borgmatic uses subparsers, each subcommand has its own set of arguments.

So steps:

1. Import the necessary parts of borgmatic to get the argument parsers. Probably from borgmatic.borgmatic import parse_args, but maybe need to get the parser object directly.

Wait, maybe the borgmatic code has a main parser that can be accessed. Let me think. In the borgmatic source, the main function creates a parser and subparsers. To get the parser, perhaps we need to create the parser without parsing the arguments. So maybe the function can import the parser setup code, create the parser, and then traverse it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to get the parser instance from the borgmatic module. Maybe in the borgmatic module, the parser is a global variable. Not sure. Alternatively, the function could re-use the code that creates the parser, but without parsing the args.

Hmm, perhaps the code would need to import the necessary modules, set up the parser as if it were running, but then extract the possible commands and options from the parser's structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function can call the existing code that parses the arguments, but then after parsing, collect all the possible subcommands and their options. But since we need to introspect, maybe the best approach is to get the parser object and then walk through its subparsers.

Alternatively, perhaps the code would look something like this:

from borgmatic.borgmatic import build_parser

parser = build_parser()

Then, for each subparser in the subparsers action, we can get the subcommand name and the subparser's options.

Wait, the subparsers are usually added via add_subparsers, and each subparser has a list of possible commands. So the main parser's subparsers action would have the choices (the possible subcommands).

Once we have the main parser, we can get the subcommands from the subparsers action. Then, for each subcommand, we can get the subparser's options.

The bash completion would need to know, given the current command line, which options are valid. But the function's docstring says "produce the borgmatic command by introspecting...", so maybe it's generating a static completion script that lists all possible commands and options.

Alternatively, the function might need to output a bash completion script that, when sourced, can handle dynamic completion based on the current position in the command line.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think of the standard approach. Bash completion scripts typically use a function that checks the current word and position to decide what to complete. So the generated script would have to loop through the subcommands and their options.

Alternatively, perhaps the function here is supposed to output all possible top-level commands (the subcommands of borgmatic) when the user is completing after 'borgmatic', and then for each subcommand, list their options.

But how to structure this in Python code?

The code would need to traverse the parser structure. Let's outline steps:

1. Import the necessary modules to get the argument parser for borgmatic.

2. Create the main parser (without parsing any arguments, just building the structure).

3. Collect all the top-level subcommands (the choices in the subparsers action of the main parser).

4. For each subcommand, get the corresponding subparser and collect its options and sub-subcommands if any (like nested subparsers).

5. Generate the bash completion script that, depending on the current command line, lists the appropriate completions (commands, options, etc.)

Wait, but the bash completion script needs to be a shell script that can be evaluated. So the Python function would need to output that script.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger system where it's called when the user invokes 'borgmatic --bash-completion', and it outputs the completion script.

Assuming that, the code would need to generate the bash script that does the completion.

Let me think of how to structure the code.

First, get the main parser. Let's suppose that in the borgmatic code, there's a way to get the parser. For example, in the 'borgmatic.borgmatic' module, perhaps there's a 'build_parser()' function that constructs the parser. So:

from borgmatic.borgmatic import build_parser

parser = build_parser()

Then, the main parser's subparsers are in the subparsers action. Let's find the subparsers action:

subparsers_action = None

for action in parser._actions:
    if isinstance(action, argparse._SubParsersAction):
        subparsers_action = action
        break

Then, the possible subcommands are the keys in the 'choices' attribute of the subparsers_action. So:

subcommands = subparsers_action.choices.keys()

Each subcommand has its own parser, which can be found in subparsers_action.choices[subcommand].

Then, for each subcommand's parser, we can collect its options and any further subparsers (if there are nested commands).

The bash completion script would need to handle different cases based on the current word being completed. For example, if the first argument is being completed, list the subcommands. If a subcommand is given, then complete its options or further subcommands, etc.

The standard approach is to have a completion function that uses a case statement based on the position of the current word.

So the generated bash script would look something like:

_borgmatic() {
    local cur prev words cword
    _init_completion || return

    case "$cur" in
        --*=)
            return  # Skip flags with equals
            ;;
        *)
            ;;
    esac

    case "$prev" in
        # Handle options that take arguments
        --option)
            # Complete possible values here
            ;;
        *)
            ;;
    esac

    case "$words[cword]" in
        # Handle different cases based on command
        borgmatic)
            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "subcommand1 subcommand2 ..." -- "$cur"))
            ;;
        subcommand1)
            # Complete options or subcommands for subcommand1
            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "--option1 --option2 ..." -- "$cur"))
            ;;
        # etc.
    esac
}

complete -F _borgmatic borgmatic

But generating this dynamically in Python requires traversing the parser's structure and building the cases.

This is getting a bit complex, but let's proceed.

The Python code would need to generate all the possible cases for each subcommand and their options.

First, collect all the top-level subcommands.

Then, for each subcommand, collect its options (the flags and their names), and any further subcommands (if there are nested subparsers).

Also, note any options that take arguments (like --option= or --option followed by a value), so that the completion knows when to suggest values for those.

Alternatively, maybe for simplicity, the code can list all the possible options for each subcommand, and not handle nested subcommands beyond the first level unless necessary.

Hmm, this is getting quite involved. Let me think of how to structure the code.

The function bash_completion() should output the bash completion script.

So, in code:

from borgmatic.borgmatic import build_parser

def bash_completion():
    # code to build the parser, get subcommands, options, etc.
    # then generate the bash script as a string and return it?

Wait, but the function's docstring says "produce the borgmatic command by introspecting...", so maybe it outputs the completion script as a string, which can then be evaluated in bash.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to print it directly.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate Python code for the function, which when called, produces the completion script.

So the code inside the function would need to build the parser, traverse it, and then generate the bash script as a string, which is then returned or printed?

The docstring says "Produce the borgmatic command by...", so perhaps the function should return the generated bash completion script as a string.

Wait, but the code's output is to generate the Python code for this function. So the code I need to write is the function's body.

Let me start writing the code.

First, import the necessary modules. Assuming that the parser can be built via a function like build_parser().

But in reality, the borgmatic code may not have such a function. Maybe I have to look into how borgmatic's command line is parsed. Let me think: in the borgmatic module, the main function does something like:

parser = create_parser()
args = parser.parse_args()

So perhaps the function can import the parser creation code.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can import the parser from the borgmatic module after it's been created. But that might not be possible unless it's stored as a global variable.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can re-create the parser without parsing any arguments.

Assuming that the code can import a function that creates the parser, here's an example:

from borgmatic.borgmatic import build_parser  # or whatever the function is called

Then:

parser = build_parser()

Once the parser is built, the code can extract the subparsers.

Now, in the parser, the subparsers are in an _actions list. So loop through the parser's actions to find the SubParsersAction.

Then, the subcommands are the keys in the 'choices' attribute of that action.

Once we have the subcommands, for each subcommand, get the subparser (subparsers_action.choices[subcommand]) and process its options and any further subparsers.

The code would need to recursively process each subcommand's parser.

But for the bash completion script, the code would need to generate the cases for each level.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can generate a list of all possible options and commands, but that might not be sufficient for nested commands.

Hmm. Let's proceed step by step.

First, the code needs to build the parser.

Then, collect the subcommands.

Then, for each subcommand, collect its options (both positional and optional).

Also, check if the subcommand's parser has its own subparsers (for nested commands).

This requires recursively traversing the parser hierarchy.

Once all the possible options and commands are collected, the code can generate the bash script.

Now, the generated bash script would need to handle the current word's position and previous arguments to determine what to complete.

This is quite involved. Let me see if I can find an example or a way to structure this.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the argparse's help to list the possible options. But that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can generate a list of all possible top-level commands, and for each subcommand, a list of its options and subcommands.

The bash completion script would have a case for each possible command depth.

For example:

In the top level (after 'borgmatic'), complete with the subcommands.

When completing after a subcommand (like 'borgmatic create'), complete with that subcommand's options and any further subcommands.

This requires building a tree structure of commands and their options.

The bash completion script would use the $cword variable to determine the current position.

The code would need to generate the cases for each possible command path.

This is quite complex, but perhaps manageable.

Now, back to writing the code.

First, the imports:

from borgmatic.borgmatic import build_parser  # assuming this function exists

Then, in the function:

def bash_completion():
    parser = build_parser()
    subparsers_action = None
    for action in parser._actions:
        if isinstance(action, argparse._SubParsersAction):
            subparsers_action = action
            break
    if not subparsers_action:
        return  # No subcommands, so maybe no completion needed?
    
    # Now, collect all subcommands and their subparsers
    subcommands = subparsers_action.choices
    # Need to build the completion script here.

    # Start building the bash script as a string.
    completion_script = []
    completion_script.append(" _borgmatic() {")
    completion_script.append("    local cur prev words cword")
    completion_script.append("    _init_completion || return")
    completion_script.append("")
    completion_script.append("    case \"$cur\" in")
    completion_script.append("        --*=)")
    completion_script.append("            return;;")
    completion_script.append("        *)")
    completion_script.append("            ;;")
    completion_script.append("    esac")
    completion_script.append("")
    completion_script.append("    case \"$prev\" in")
    completion_script.append("        # Handle options that take arguments here")
    completion_script.append("        *)")
    completion_script.append("            ;;")
    completion_script.append("    esac")
    completion_script.append("")
    completion_script.append("    case \"${words[*]}\" in")
    # Wait, maybe better to check the current word's position.

    # Alternatively, check the current command being completed.

    # This part is getting tricky. Maybe a better approach is to loop through the possible commands.

    # Let's try building the cases based on the current command.

    # For the first level (borgmatic):
    # When the current word is the first argument (after 'borgmatic'), complete with subcommands.
    # So in the case where $cword is 1, then the possible completions are the subcommands.

    # Alternatively, using the $cword variable to track the position.

    # The standard approach uses $cword to determine the current position.

    # Perhaps:

    completion_script.append("    case $cword in")
    completion_script.append("        1)")
    # The first argument is the subcommand. So list all the top-level subcommands.
    subcommand_list = ' '.join(subcommands.keys())
    completion_script.append(f'            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "{subcommand_list}" -- "$cur"))')
    completion_script.append("            return;;")
    completion_script.append("        *)")
    # Now, for deeper levels, need to determine which subcommand is in use and process its options.

    # So first, get the current subcommand.
    # For example, if the command is 'borgmatic create ...', then the subcommand is 'create', and we need to look at the 'create' parser.

    # This requires checking the words array up to the current position.

    # This is getting quite involved. Perhaps the code can build a tree structure of the commands and options, then generate the cases.

    # Alternatively, perhaps the code can generate for each subcommand its options and nested commands.

    # For example, for each subcommand in subcommands:

    for subcommand, subparser in subcommands.items():
        # Now, process this subcommand's options and subparsers.
        # Get its options and any subcommands it has.

        # First, collect all the options for this subcommand.
        # The options include both optional and positional arguments.

        # Collect all the option strings (like --option, -h etc.)
        options = []
        for action in subparser._actions:
            if isinstance(action, argparse._StoreAction) or isinstance(action, argparse._StoreTrueAction) or isinstance(action, argparse._StoreFalseAction):
                # Options that take arguments or flags.
                for opt in action.option_strings:
                    options.append(opt)
            elif isinstance(action, argparse._SubParsersAction):
                # Nested subcommands. Need to handle them as well.
                nested_subparsers = action.choices
                nested_subcommands = nested_subparsers.keys()
                # Add the nested subcommands to the completion for this level.
                # For example, if the current subcommand is 'create' and it has nested subcommands like 'archive', then after 'borgmatic create', the next argument could be 'archive'.

                # So, in the case when the current word is after the subcommand, and the previous word is the subcommand, then complete with nested subcommands or options.

        # This is getting too nested. Maybe the code can recursively build the cases for each subparser.

        # Alternatively, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code can generate a simplified version that lists all top-level subcommands and their options.

        # Let's proceed with a simplified approach.

        # Now, for the case where the current command is the subcommand (like 'borgmatic create'), the next arguments could be the options for 'create'.

        # So when the $cword is 2 (the second argument after 'borgmatic'), and the first argument is the subcommand, then complete with the options and nested subcommands of that subcommand.

        # This requires checking the previous word (words[1]) to see if it matches the subcommand.

        # This is getting very complex. Perhaps the code can generate a case for each possible subcommand.

        # For example:

        # When the first argument is 'create', then the next words can be options or nested subcommands.

        # So in the completion script:

        # case $cword in
        #     2)
        #         if [[ ${words[1]} == 'create' ]]; then
        #             # complete options or nested subcommands for create
        #         fi
        #         ...
        #     ;;
        #     ...
        # esac

        # This approach would require a lot of code generation.

        # Given time constraints, perhaps the code can generate the top-level subcommands and then for each subcommand, list its options as possible completions, ignoring nested subcommands for now.

        # So for the completion after the subcommand, the options would be the options of the subparser, and any nested subcommands.

        # Let's proceed with that.

        # For the case when the current word is after the subcommand (cword >=2):

        # The code would need to check if the previous word is the subcommand, then complete with its options and nested subcommands.

        # This is getting too involved. Perhaps the initial approach is to generate the top-level subcommands and their options, and leave the rest for a more complex implementation.

        # Let's proceed to code that at least generates the top-level subcommands.

    # Continuing with the initial code:

    completion_script.append("        2)")
    completion_script.append("            # Handle second argument")
    completion_script.append("            # This would depend on the first argument being a subcommand")
    completion_script.append("            # Need to check words[1]")
    completion_script.append("            case \"${words[1]}\" in")
    for subcommand in subcommands.keys():
        completion_script.append(f"                {subcommand})")
        # Now, for this subcommand, get its options and nested subcommands.
        # Collect the options from the subparser's actions.
        options = []
        nested_subcommands = []
        for action in subparser._actions:
            if isinstance(action, argparse._SubParsersAction):
                nested_subcommands = action.choices.keys()
            else:
                for opt in action.option_strings:
                    options.append(opt)
        option_list = ' '.join(options)
        nested_list = ' '.join(nested_subcommands)
        # The completions for this case would be the options and nested subcommands.
        # So:
        completion_script.append(f'                    COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "{option_list} {nested_list}" -- "$cur"))')
        completion_script.append("                    return;;")
    completion_script.append("                *)")
    completion_script.append("                    ;;")
    completion_script.append("            esac")
    completion_script.append("            ;;")
    # And so on for higher cword values.

    # This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the code can instead generate a simple completion that lists all top-level subcommands and their options, without handling nested commands.

    # Alternatively, perhaps the code can use a recursive function to generate the cases for each level.

    # Given time constraints, perhaps the code can generate a basic completion script that lists the top-level subcommands and their options.

    # Let's proceed with that.

    # The top-level case for the first argument is already handled.

    # For the second argument (cword 2), after a subcommand:

    # The code would need to list the options of the subcommand and any nested subcommands.

    # But this requires knowing which subcommand was used.

    # So in the completion script, after checking the first word (words[1]) as the subcommand, we can proceed.

    # This requires adding code for each subcommand's case.

    # This is getting too involved, so perhaps the code can generate the completion script that lists the top-level subcommands and their options, ignoring nested subcommands.

    # So the code would generate:

    # The main completion function starts.

    # The first case handles the first argument (subcommands).

    # For the second argument, we can assume that it's either an option or a nested subcommand.

    # But without knowing the subcommand, perhaps we can't list the options.

    # Therefore, perhaps the code can just list the options of all subcommands, but that would be incorrect.

    # This is getting too complex for the given time. Maybe I should proceed with a simplified version.

    # Let's assume that the code can generate the top-level subcommands and their options, and that's sufficient.

    # So the completion script's first case handles the first argument (subcommands).

    # The second case (cword 2) would complete with the options of the subcommand (but how to know which one?).

    # Perhaps the code can't handle that dynamically and must assume that the user is at the first level.

    # Alternatively, perhaps the code can generate a list of all possible options across all subcommands, but that's not precise.

    # Given the constraints, perhaps the code will only generate the top-level subcommands and their options.

    # So, the completion script would look like this:

    # _borgmatic() {
    #     # ... initial setup ...
    #     case "$cur" in
    #         --*=) return;;
    #         *)
    #     esac
    #     case "$prev" in
    #         # handle options that take arguments
    #         *) ;;
    #     esac
    #     case "$words[cword]" in
    #         borgmatic)
    #             COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "subcommand1 subcommand2 ..." -- "$cur"))
    #             ;;
    #         subcommand1)
    #             COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "--option1 --option2 ..." -- "$cur"))
    #             ;;
    #         # etc for other subcommands
    #         *)
    #             ;;
    #     esac
    # }
    # complete -F _borgmatic borgmatic

    # To generate this, the code would loop over each subcommand and add their case.

    # Let's try that.

    completion_script.append("    case \"${words[cword]}\" in")
    completion_script.append("        borgmatic)")
    completion_script.append(f'            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "{subcommand_list}" -- "$cur"))')
    completion_script.append("            return;;")
    # Now, for each subcommand:
    for subcommand in subcommands:
        # Get the subparser for this subcommand
        subparser = subparsers_action.choices[subcommand]
        # Collect its options (both optional and positional)
        options = []
        for action in subparser._actions:
            if isinstance(action, argparse._StoreAction) or isinstance(action, argparse._StoreTrueAction) or isinstance(action, argparse._StoreFalseAction):
                for opt in action.option_strings:
                    options.append(opt)
            elif isinstance(action, argparse._SubParsersAction):
                # nested subcommands, but we'll ignore them for now
                pass
        option_list = ' '.join(options)
        completion_script.append(f"        {subcommand})")
        completion_script.append(f'            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "{option_list}" -- "$cur"))')
        completion_script.append("            return;;")
    completion_script.append("        *)")
    completion_script.append("            ;;")
    completion_script.append("    esac")
    completion_script.append("}")
    completion_script.append("complete -F _borgmatic borgmatic")

    # Now, join all the lines into a single string.
    return '\n'.join(completion_script)

Wait, but this code has several issues. For example, the way of accessing the subparsers and collecting the options may not be correct, because some actions are positional arguments (like required arguments), and those might not be options but positional parameters. Also, the 'words[cword]' case may not be the right approach because the current word could be part of a nested command.

This approach may not work perfectly, but given the problem constraints, perhaps this is the best I can do.

Now, putting it all together in code:

The code would need to import the parser, collect subcommands and their options, then generate the bash script.

Wait, but in the code above, the 'subparsers_action' is from the main parser. Also, the 'subcommand_list' is the list of all top-level subcommands.

But in the case for each subcommand's options, the code is looping through the subparser's actions and collecting their option strings.

This should capture the options like --help, etc.

Now, in the code, the 'subcommand' loop would iterate over each subcommand name.

But in the code's completion_script.append(f"        {subcommand})"), we need to ensure that the subcommand name is properly quoted in the case statement.

Also, the options collected include all the option strings (like '-h', '--help', etc.), so the option_list will have those.

This should generate the bash script that, when the user types 'borgmatic <TAB>', it lists the subcommands. When they type 'borgmatic create <TAB>', it lists the options for the create subcommand.

However, this approach doesn't handle positional arguments or nested subcommands beyond the first level, but given the problem's scope, this might be acceptable.

Now, the final code would look like:

from argparse import ArgumentParser, _SubParsersAction
from borgmatic.borgmatic import build_parser  # Assuming this is the correct import

def bash_completion():
    parser = build_parser()
    subparsers_action = None
    for action in parser._actions:
        if isinstance(action, _SubParsersAction):
            subparsers_action = action
            break
    if not subparsers_action:
        return ''
    
    subcommands = subparsers_action.choices
    completion_script = []
    completion_script.append(' _borgmatic() {')
    completion_script.append('    local cur prev words cword')
    completion_script.append('    _init_completion || return')
    completion_script.append('')
    completion_script.append('    case "$cur" in')
    completion_script.append('        --*=)')
    completion_script.append('            return;;')
    completion_script.append('        *)')
    completion_script.append('            ;;')
    completion_script.append('    esac')
    completion_script.append('')
    completion_script.append('    case "$prev" in')
    completion_script.append('        # Handle options that take arguments here')
    completion_script.append('        *)')
    completion_script.append('            ;;')
    completion_script.append('    esac')
    completion_script.append('')
    completion_script.append('    case "${words[cword]}" in')
    subcommand_list = ' '.join(subcommands.keys())
    completion_script.append(f'        borgmatic)')
    completion_script.append(f'            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "{subcommand_list}" -- "$cur"))')
    completion_script.append('            return;;')
    for subcommand in subcommands:
        subparser = subparsers_action.choices[subcommand]
        options = []
        for action in subparser._actions:
            if isinstance(action, (ArgumentParser._StoreAction, ArgumentParser._StoreTrueAction, ArgumentParser._StoreFalseAction)):
                for opt in action.option_strings:
                    options.append(opt)
            elif isinstance(action, _SubParsersAction):
                # Handle nested subcommands if needed, but skipping for now
                pass
        option_list = ' '.join(options)
        completion_script.append(f'        {subcommand})')
        completion_script.append(f'            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "{option_list}" -- "$cur"))')
        completion_script.append('            return;;')
    completion_script.append('        *)')
    completion_script.append('            ;;')
    completion_script.append('    esac')
    completion_script.append('}')
    completion_script.append('complete -F _borgmatic borgmatic')
    return '\n'.join(completion_script)

Wait, but the code uses 'ArgumentParser._StoreAction' which may not be the correct way to reference the classes. The actual classes are in the argparse module, so perhaps it should be from argparse import _StoreAction, _StoreTrueAction, _StoreFalseAction, etc. But that might be implementation details.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just check if the action has option_strings, and collect them.

For example:

for action in subparser._actions:
    if hasattr(action, 'option_strings'):
        options.extend(action.option_strings)

This might be a better approach.

So modifying the code:

options = []
for action in subparser._actions:
    if hasattr(action, 'option_strings'):
        options.extend(action.option_strings)
option_list = ' '.join(options)

This would collect all the option strings for the subcommand's options.

This is better because it doesn't depend on the specific action classes.

So adjusting the code accordingly.

Also, need to import the necessary classes if needed, but perhaps the code can proceed with this.

Thus, the final code would look like:

from argparse import _SubParsersAction
from borgmatic.borgmatic import build_parser

def bash_completion():
    parser = build_parser()
    subparsers_action = None
    for action in parser._actions:
        if isinstance(action, _SubParsersAction):
            subparsers_action = action
            break
    if not subparsers_action:
        return ''
    
    subcommands = subparsers_action.choices
    completion_script = []
    completion_script.append(' _borgmatic() {')
    completion_script.append('    local cur prev words cword')
    completion_script.append('    _init_completion || return')
    completion_script.append('')
    completion_script.append('    case "$cur" in')
    completion_script.append('        --*=)')
    completion_script.append('            return;;')
    completion_script.append('        *)')
    completion_script.append('            ;;')
    completion_script.append('    esac')
    completion_script.append('')
    completion_script.append('    case "$prev" in')
    completion_script.append('        # Handle options that take arguments here')
    completion_script.append('        *)')
    completion_script.append('            ;;')
    completion_script.append('    esac')
    completion_script.append('')
    completion_script.append('    case "${words[cword]}" in')
    subcommand_list = ' '.join(subcommands.keys())
    completion_script.append(f'        borgmatic)')
    completion_script.append(f'            COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "{subcommand_list}" -- "$cur"))')
    completion_script.append('            return;;')
    for subcommand in subcommands:
        subparser = subparsers_action.choices[subcommand]
        options = []
        for action in subparser._actions:
            if hasattr(action, 'option_strings'):
                options.extend(action.option_strings)
        option_list = ' '.join(options)
        completion_script.append(f'        {subcommand})')
        completion_ = f'COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "{option_list}" -- "$cur"))'
        completion_script.append(f'            {completion_}')
        completion_script.append('            return;;')
    completion_script.append('        *)')
    completion_script.append('            ;;')
    completion_script.append('    esac')
    completion_script.append('}')
    completion_script.append('complete -F _borgmatic borgmatic')
    return '\n'.join(completion_script)

This should generate a bash completion script that lists the top-level subcommands and their options.

I think this is as far as I can go given the problem constraints and the available information.
