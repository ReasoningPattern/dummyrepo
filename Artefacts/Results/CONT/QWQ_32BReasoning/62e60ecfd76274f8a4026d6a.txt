Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function protocol_handlers based on the given docstring. The function is a class method since it has 'cls' as the first parameter. The task is to return different forms of Bolt protocol handlers depending on the protocol_version provided.

Hmm, the docstring says "Different forms... based on the value of protocol_version." So I should probably have a structure that checks the protocol_version and returns the appropriate handler. But what if protocol_version is None? Maybe the default case would return a list of all available handlers or perhaps a specific default one?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return a handler class or instance based on the version. Let me think about possible implementations. Since it's a class method, perhaps the handlers are subclasses of cls, each handling a specific version. So the function would check the protocol_version and return the corresponding subclass.

Alternatively, maybe it's a factory method that selects the correct handler class based on the version. For example, if protocol_version is 4, return Bolt4Handler, etc. But without knowing the exact handler classes, perhaps the code should use a dictionary mapping versions to handler classes.

So the code might look something like this:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        1: Bolt1Handler,
        2: Bolt2Handler,
        3: Bolt3Handler,
        4: Bolt4Handler,
        # etc.
    }
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls)  # or a default?
    else:
        return list(handlers.values())

Wait, but the docstring says "different forms" might be returned. Maybe when protocol_version is not given, it returns all available handlers? Or perhaps the function can return a specific handler when a version is given, and maybe a list or all when it's None. The problem is the exact requirements aren't clear from the docstring alone. Since the user provided only that, perhaps the code should handle both cases: if protocol_version is provided, return the specific handler for that version; else, maybe return all handlers?

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has different subclasses for each protocol version. Then the method would look up the correct subclass. Let me think of a standard approach for protocol handlers. Usually, such a method would map versions to classes. So perhaps:

handlers = {
    1: BoltHandlerV1,
    2: BoltHandlerV2,
    # etc.
}

Then, given a version, return the corresponding class. If the version isn't found, maybe raise an error or return a default. But the function's return type isn't specified. The docstring says "Different forms... are returned"â€”so maybe when protocol_version is not given, it returns all handlers as a list?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return an instance of the appropriate handler. But without knowing the parameters for initialization, that's hard. Maybe the function is a class method that returns the handler class based on the version.

Putting this together, the code might use a dictionary to map versions to their handler classes. Let's structure it like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
        2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
        # ... other versions
    }
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return handlers.get(protocol_version)
    else:
        return list(handlers.values())

Wait, but the exact structure depends on how the handlers are stored. Maybe the handlers are stored as class attributes of cls. So each handler is a subclass of cls, and stored as cls.V1, etc. Alternatively, maybe the handlers are in a list or a separate dictionary.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a list of versions and their handler classes. But the exact code can't be known without more info, but the user wants a plausible code.

Another approach: maybe the function returns an instance of the handler for the given version. But since it's a class method, perhaps it returns the class itself.

Assuming that, here's a possible code:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    handler_map = {
        1: cls.HandlerV1,
        2: cls.HandlerV2,
        3: cls.HandlerV3,
        4: cls.HandlerV4,
    }
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return handler_map.get(protocol_version, cls.default_handler)
    return list(handler_map.values())

But the exact names of the handler classes would depend on the actual implementation. Since I don't have those, I can use placeholder names like Handler1, Handler2, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function raises an error if the protocol_version isn't found, but the docstring doesn't mention that. Since the user wants code that works, perhaps it's better to return None or a default in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return all handlers when protocol_version is None, and a specific one otherwise. So the code would use a dictionary mapping versions to classes, then return the specific one when given, else all.

But how to structure the code? Let's try:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        1: BoltHandler1,
        2: BoltHandler2,
        3: BoltHandler3,
    }
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return handlers[protocol_version]
    return handlers.values()

Wait, but this would require the handlers to be defined as classes. But in the class method, perhaps the handlers are stored as class attributes. So maybe:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handler_map = getattr(cls, '_handler_map', None)
    if handler_map is None:
        handler_map = {
            1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
            2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
            # etc.
        }
        cls._handler_map = handler_map
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return handler_map.get(protocol_version)
    return handler_map.values()

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the simplest code is to have a dictionary inside the method. But in Python, each call would recreate the dictionary. Alternatively, maybe the handler classes are stored as class attributes of cls. For example, cls.handlers is a dictionary.

Alternatively, the code could be written as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is None:
        return [cls._handler_for_version(v) for v in sorted(cls.SUPPORTED_PROTOCOLS)]
    else:
        return cls._handler_for_version(protocol_version)

But then the method would need to have a _handler_for_version method, which may not be present. Since the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps the code should be as simple as possible.

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a list of all handler classes when protocol_version is None, and the specific one otherwise. So the code could be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handler_classes = {
        1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
        2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
        3: cls.Bolt3Handler,
        4: cls.Bolt4Handler,
    }
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return handler_classes.get(protocol_version)
    else:
        return list(handler_classes.values())

This seems plausible. The function uses a dictionary mapping version numbers to the corresponding handler classes (which are presumably subclasses of cls). If protocol_version is given, it returns the specific class, else all of them.

I think this is a reasonable approach given the information provided. The docstring says "different forms" are returned based on the version, so returning the specific handler for the version makes sense. When no version is given, perhaps the function returns all handlers as a list.

So I'll write the code accordingly, using a dictionary inside the method. The actual handler names can be placeholders like BoltHandlerX, but since the user didn't specify, I'll use generic names. Alternatively, maybe the handlers are stored as attributes of the class, so I can reference them as cls.BoltHandler1, etc.

Wait, the code must be valid Python. Since the function is a class method, the handler classes must be accessible through the cls parameter. So the code should reference them as cls.BoltHandler1, assuming that the class has those attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps the handlers are stored in a class-level dictionary. But without knowing, the simplest code is to create a local dictionary inside the function that maps versions to the handler classes as attributes of cls.

So the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
        2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
        3: cls.Bolt3Handler,
        4: cls.Bolt4Handler,
    }
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return handlers.get(protocol_version)
    return list(handlers.values())

This way, each time the method is called, it constructs the dictionary by accessing the class's attributes. This assumes that the class has these attributes (like Bolt1Handler, Bolt2Handler, etc.) defined as its subclasses or other classes. The code returns the specific handler for the given version, or all of them if none is specified.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should return an instance, but since it's a class method, returning the class itself is more likely. The docstring says "forms of handlers", so maybe the classes are the forms. So this code should work.

I think that's the best approach given the information. Now, I'll write the code exactly as per this logic.
