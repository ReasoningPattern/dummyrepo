Okay, I need to write a Python function called replace_dots. The function takes two arguments, value and arg. According to the docstring, it should replace all the dots in the value string with the arg string. 

Hmm, so the first thing that comes to mind is using the string replace method. Like, value.replace('.', arg). But wait, I should check if value is actually a string. Oh, but the problem statement says that value is the old string, so maybe I can assume it's a string. So maybe no need for type checking here.

Wait, but what if the arg is None or something? The doc says arg is the new string, so probably it's a string. The function's return type is str, so I have to make sure the result is a string.

So the code should be straightforward. Just return value.replace('.', arg). But let me read the doc again. The function's parameters are value and arg. The return is the replaced string. So yes, that's all. 

Wait a second, maybe the function is supposed to handle cases where arg is not a string? But according to the args section, arg is a new string to replace. So it's safe to assume arg is a string. 

Therefore, the code is just one line: return value.replace('.', arg). 

I think that's it. Let me test with an example. Suppose value is "hello.world" and arg is "-", then the result should be "hello-world". Using replace, that works. Another example: if arg is an empty string, then dots are removed. That's also correct. 

So the function is simple. Just the replace method. I don't see any edge cases that would require extra handling here. The function's responsibility is just to replace the dots, so the code should be as simple as possible.
