Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_none_string that checks if a given value is a string that represents 'None'. Let's look at the docstring. The function should return True only if two conditions are met: the val is a string, and when converted to lowercase, it equals 'none'. Otherwise, it returns False.

First, I'll start by defining the function with the given signature. The parameter is 'val' of any type. The return type is a bool.

The first check is to see if the val is a string. So I can use isinstance(val, str) for that. If it's not a string, the function should immediately return False.

If it is a string, then I need to compare it to 'none' in lowercase. So I should convert the input string to lowercase using .lower() method. But wait, what if the string has leading or trailing whitespace? The docstring doesn't mention trimming, so I shouldn't do that. Just check the lowercase exactly.

So the steps are: check if the input is a string. If not, return False. Then check if the lowercase of the string is 'none'. If both are true, return True, else False.

Putting it all together:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    if not isinstance(val, str):
        return False
    return val.lower() == 'none'

Wait, let me think about edge cases. What if the string is "NONE" or "None"? The lower() converts it to 'none', so that's covered. What about empty strings? If val is an empty string, then lower() is '', which isn't 'none', so returns false. Correct.

So that should do it. The function first checks the type, then the lowercase equality. That's all. I think that's the correct approach here.
