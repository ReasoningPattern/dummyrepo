Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'on' and it's a method of some class. The docstring says it returns a decorator that adds a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class. 

Hmm, so the method takes a 'hook' parameter. The goal is to create a decorator that can be used to register functions as handlers for that hook. Let me think about how decorators work in Python. A typical approach is to have the method return a decorator function, which then takes the actual function to be decorated and adds it to some registry.

The registry is probably a dictionary stored somewhere in the class, maybe as a class-level variable. So each hook name would map to a list of handlers. 

Wait, the function is an instance method (since it has 'self' as the first argument), but the registry is likely a class-level thing. So maybe the registry is stored as a class variable, like '_registry' or something similar. 

So here's the plan: The 'on' method will return a decorator. The decorator will take the function being decorated and add it to the registry under the given 'hook' key. 

Let me structure this step by step. 

First, the method 'on' is called with a hook name. It needs to return a decorator. The decorator function will be the one that actually handles adding the function to the registry. 

The structure would look like this:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry under 'hook'
        return func
    return decorator

But how to access the class's registry? Since it's a class-level variable, maybe the class has a registry stored in the class itself. So perhaps the code should use the class's __dict__ or a class variable like 'registry'.

Wait, the problem says "in the class", so maybe the registry is a class variable. Let's assume the class has a class variable called '_registry' which is a dictionary. Each key is a hook name, and the value is a list of functions.

So inside the decorator, when we get the function, we need to append it to the list for that hook in the class's registry. 

Wait, but since 'self' is an instance, accessing the class variable might need to use the class. Alternatively, perhaps the registry is stored on the class, so to modify it, we can do something like:

cls = self.__class__
if hook not in cls._registry:
    cls._registry[hook] = []
cls._registry[hook].append(func)

But in Python, class variables are shared among all instances, so modifying cls._registry would affect all instances. That's probably the right approach here.

Putting this together, the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        cls = self.__class__
        if hook not in cls._registry:
            cls._registry[hook] = []
        cls._registry[hook].append(func)
        return func
    return decorator

Wait, but what if the _registry hasn't been initialized yet? Maybe the class should initialize it as an empty dict. The user is supposed to have that in their class already? Or maybe the code should ensure that the registry exists. Let's assume that the class has an _registry as a class variable. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check if the registry exists and create it if not. Like:

cls = self.__class__
if not hasattr(cls, '_registry'):
    cls._registry = {}
if hook not in cls._registry:
    cls._registry[hook] = []
cls._registry[hook].append(func)

That way, even if the class didn't pre-initialize the _registry, it gets created when the first hook is added. That's probably safer.

So modifying the code accordingly:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        cls = self.__class__
        if not hasattr(cls, '_registry'):
            cls._registry = {}
        if hook not in cls._registry:
            cls._registry[hook] = []
        cls._registry[hook].append(func)
        return func
    return decorator

That should work. Let me double-check. When someone uses the decorator like:

class MyClass:
    _registry = {}  # or not, the code initializes it

    def on(self, hook):
        ... as above ...

Then, when they write:

@my_instance.on('some_hook')
def my_handler():
    pass

The 'on' method is called with 'some_hook', returns the decorator, which takes my_handler, adds it to the registry. 

Yes, that should do it. So the code should be as written above. I need to make sure that the code only outputs the function, without any explanations. Also, the problem says to output the code in Python markdown format, but maybe that's a typo and they just want the code. Since the user provided an example with the '/think' and the code block, perhaps they want the code in a code block. But the instructions say to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, maybe that's a misunderstanding. The user probably wants the code in a code block, but since they specified "output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format", perhaps they mean using triple backticks and specifying the language.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be enclosed in a markdown code block, like:

```python
def on(self, hook):
    ...
```

Yes, so the final answer should be the code inside a code block with the proper syntax. Let me write that out.
