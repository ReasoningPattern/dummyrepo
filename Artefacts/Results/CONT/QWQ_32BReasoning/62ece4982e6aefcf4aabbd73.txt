Okay, I need to write the split function based on the given docstring. Let me think about what the problem is. The function splits a string according to different shell-like rules depending on the platform. The platform can be 'this' to auto-detect, 1 for POSIX, or 0 for Windows/CMD.

Hmm, so first, I should handle the platform parameter. If it's 'this', then I need to check the current platform. Maybe using sys.platform? Like, if sys.platform starts with 'win', then it's Windows, else POSIX.

Wait, the Windows style probably uses semicolons as path separators, while POSIX uses colons. But the splitting here is about splitting the string into arguments, right? Or wait, maybe the function is splitting a path-like string? Wait, the function's description says "split the input str under given platform", similar to how shells split arguments. Oh, perhaps it's splitting a command line into arguments according to the platform's rules.

Oh right, in Windows, the default argument splitting might be different from POSIX. For example, quotes handling, spaces in paths, etc. But the problem might be simpler here. Maybe the function is splitting a string into parts separated by colons or semicolons, depending on the platform? Like for PATH variables?

Wait the problem's example says if platform is 0 (Windows/CMD), then maybe split on semicolons? Or maybe the function is supposed to parse the string into arguments considering quotes and spaces, similar to how command line arguments are split but with platform-specific rules.

Hmm, the problem's description is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the docstring. The function returns the splitting result, and the parameters are s and platform. The returns are a list of splitting strings. The platform options are 0,1, or 'this'.

Wait, maybe the function is splitting the input string according to the PATH separator for the given platform. Like, on Windows, the PATH uses semicolons, so split on ';', and on POSIX split on ':'.

But the problem says "split the input str under given platform", so perhaps that's the case. Let's see.

So for example, if the input is '/usr/bin:/bin', and platform is POSIX (1), the split would be into ['usr/bin', '/bin'].

If the input is 'C:\Windows;C:\Program Files', and platform is 0, split on ';' to get those two parts.

But then the function's name is split, but the parameters are s and platform, so maybe that's the case. But the problem mentions 'splitting result', so maybe that's all it is.

Alternatively, maybe it's about splitting the string into tokens, considering quotes and escaping, which is more complex. Like, similar to shlex.split but platform-dependent?

Hmm, but the problem might be expecting a simpler approach. Let's look at the possible parameters. The platform options are 0,1, or 'this'. The description says if platform is 0, use Windows/CMD style. So perhaps Windows uses semicolons as separators, and POSIX uses colons. So the split function would split the string on the appropriate separator based on the platform.

Wait, but in Windows command-line, the path separator is semicolon, but splitting arguments is different. Wait, maybe the question is about splitting a PATH-like string. So the function's purpose is to split a path string into its components using the correct separator for the platform.

If that's the case, then the code would be straightforward. For example:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        # check current platform
        import sys
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            sep = ';'
        else:
            sep = ':'
    elif platform == 1:
        sep = ':'
    elif platform == 0:
        sep = ';'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return s.split(sep)

Wait, but the parameters for platform are given as 'this', 1, or 0. So in the function, platform can be a string or integer? The function's signature says platform is a string, but the docstring says if platform equals 1 or 0. Wait, looking back:

The function signature says platform is a string. The docstring says: If platform equals 'this', auto-detect. If platform equals 1 (so as an integer?), use POSIX. Hmm, but the parameter is passed as a string. Wait, the function's parameters are:

def split(s, platform='this'):

So platform is a string. But the docstring says "if platform equals 1, use POSIX". That's conflicting because 1 is an integer. Oh, maybe that's a mistake in the problem's description. Wait, maybe the platform is a string that can be '0', '1', or 'this'? Or perhaps the platform argument can take integers? Let me check the function's parameters again.

The function's parameters are: platform='this', so the default is a string. The docstring says: platform can be 'this' (so as a string), or 1, 0 (as integers). Wait, but then the parameter is a string. So maybe there's a mistake here, and the platform is supposed to be either a string 'this', or an integer 0 or 1? So the function can accept platform as a string or an integer?

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that platform can be passed as a string, but the possible options are 'this', '1', '0'? Or maybe the platform is an integer, but the default is a string. That might be a problem. Wait, looking at the function's signature, the default is 'this', which is a string, so the platform parameter must be a string. But the docstring says "if platform equals 1, use POSIX". So that would mean that the platform can be an integer, but that contradicts the function's signature. So perhaps the problem has a mistake, and the platform parameter is supposed to be an integer, but the default is 'this'? Or maybe the docstring is wrong, and the platform is a string, so the options are '0', '1', or 'this'.

Alternatively, maybe the platform is passed as a string, but the values '0' and '1' are treated as the integer 0 and 1. So in the code, when checking, we can convert it to an integer if it's a string? But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's docstring has a typo, and the platform can be '0', '1', or 'this', all as strings. Then the code can check the string's value.

Alternatively, maybe the platform is an integer, but the default is a string. That can't be, because the default is 'this' (a string), so the parameter is a string, but the docstring's examples mention platform equals 0 or 1, which are integers. That's conflicting. So perhaps the problem expects that platform is a string, and the options are '0', '1', and 'this'? Or perhaps the user can pass 0 or 1 as integers, but the function will treat them as such. So in the code, we need to handle both cases where platform is a string or an integer.

Hmm, perhaps the problem's description has a mistake in the parameters. Let me read the function's docstring again:

"If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform. If platform equals 1, use POSIX style. If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style."

Ah, so the 1 and 0 are integers, but the platform parameter is passed as a string. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe the function's platform parameter is actually supposed to accept integers, but the default is a string. That can't be, because the default is 'this', which is a string. So perhaps the problem's description has an error, and the platform can be '0', '1', or 'this'? So the code should check if platform is 'this', '1', or '0'.

Alternatively, maybe the user can pass platform as a string '0' or '1', or as integers. So in the code, we need to check if it's a string or integer. But perhaps the problem expects that platform is a string, so the code can just check the value as a string. Like, if platform is '1', use POSIX, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended for the platform parameter to be an integer, but the default is 'this'? That's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem's description has an inconsistency, and the code should treat platform as a string, and check for '0', '1', or 'this'.

Well, given the problem's parameters, I'll proceed under the assumption that the platform is a string, and the possible values are 'this', '0', or '1'. Or maybe the function can accept platform as an integer (0 or 1) or the string 'this'. So the code should handle both cases. Wait, the function's parameter is platform='this', so the default is a string, but when the user passes 0 or 1, it would be an integer. So the code needs to check the type as well.

Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the platform parameter is a string that can be 'this', '0', or '1', so we just check the string.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's description is correct, and the platform can be an integer (0 or 1) or the string 'this'. So in the code, we can check:

if platform == 'this':

elif platform == 1:

elif platform == 0:

But since platform is a string by default, passing an integer would require the user to do so. So in the code, perhaps the function should accept platform as either a string or integer. So, in the code, first check if it's 'this', then check if it's 0 or 1 as integers, else raise an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that platform is a string, so when the user wants to use 0 or 1, they pass the string '0' or '1'.

Well, given the ambiguity, perhaps the best way is to proceed with the code as follows:

Use the platform parameter as given. So:

- if platform is 'this', auto-detect using sys.platform.

- else, if platform is '1', use POSIX (so colon separator).

- else if platform is '0', use Windows (semicolon separator).

Wait, but the function's parameters are written as platform='this', so the user can pass an integer? Because the parameter is of type str, but in the docstring, the examples say platform equals 1 (integer). Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps the problem's parameters have a mistake, and the platform should be an integer (with default 0?), but the description says 'this' for auto-detect. Alternatively, maybe the function's platform parameter is a string, and the options are 'this', '0', or '1'.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the platform can be passed as 0 or 1 as integers, but the default is 'this' as a string. That's a bit inconsistent, but perhaps the code can handle it by converting platform to a string or checking the type.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the platform parameter is an integer, but the default is 'this'? No, that's not possible. So perhaps the problem's description is wrong, and the platform parameter is an integer, with the default being 0 or 1. But the function's signature says platform is a string. Hmm.

Well, given that the problem's function signature says platform is a string with default 'this', but the docstring mentions platform equals 1 (integer), perhaps the problem has an error, but I have to proceed.

Assuming that the platform can be 'this', '0', or '1' as strings, then the code can do:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        import sys
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            sep = ';'
        else:
            sep = ':'
    elif platform == '1':
        sep = ':'
    elif platform == '0':
        sep = ';'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return s.split(sep)

Alternatively, if the platform can be passed as an integer (like 0 or 1), then the code would need to check for that. So perhaps:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if isinstance(platform, str):
        if platform == 'this':
            # detect
            import sys
            if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
                sep = ';'
            else:
                sep = ':'
        elif platform == '1':
            sep = ':'
        elif platform == '0':
            sep = ';'
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    else:
        # handle as integer
        if platform == 0:
            sep = ';'
        elif platform == 1:
            sep = ':'
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return s.split(sep)

But that complicates the code, and the problem's function signature specifies platform as a string. So perhaps it's better to stick with the first approach, treating the platform as a string, and checking the strings '0', '1', or 'this'.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the platform can be passed as an integer (0 or 1) or the string 'this', so the code must check both possibilities. So, in code:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        # auto detect
        import sys
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            sep = ';'
        else:
            sep = ':'
    else:
        # check if it's 0 or 1 as integer
        if isinstance(platform, int):
            if platform == 0:
                sep = ';'
            elif platform == 1:
                sep = ':'
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
        else:
            # if it's a string but not 'this', check if it's '0' or '1'
            if platform == '0':
                sep = ';'
            elif platform == '1':
                sep = ':'
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return s.split(sep)

Hmm, but this could get complicated. Maybe the problem expects that the platform is passed as a string, so the code can just check for 'this', '0', or '1'.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's intended solution is to use shlex.split with platform-specific handling, but that would be more complex. But the problem's description might not be about that. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to split the string into arguments, considering quotes and spaces, but according to the platform's rules. For example, in Windows, the command-line parser may have different rules than POSIX. But handling that would require a more complex approach, perhaps using shlex but with different options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the function just splits on the path separator (colon or semicolon) based on the platform. So the first approach is correct.

Assuming that, then the code would be:

import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            sep = ';'
        else:
            sep = ':'
    elif platform == '1':
        sep = ':'
    elif platform == '0':
        sep = ';'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return s.split(sep)

Wait, but in the function's parameters, the platform can be passed as an integer. So if someone passes 0 as an integer, then the code would check for '0' (as a string) and not find it, leading to the ValueError. So to handle that, the code must check whether platform is an integer or a string.

Hmm, this is a problem. The function's signature says platform is a string, but the docstring says platform can be 0 or 1 (integers). So the user might pass an integer. Therefore, the code must accept both cases.

So, perhaps:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        # auto detect
        import sys
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            sep = ';'
        else:
            sep = ':'
    else:
        # check if it's 0 or 1. Could be a string or an integer.
        if isinstance(platform, int):
            if platform == 0:
                sep = ';'
            elif platform == 1:
                sep = ':'
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
        else:  # it's a string, but not 'this'
            if platform in ('0', '1'):
                sep = ';' if platform == '0' else ':'
            else:
                raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return s.split(sep)

That way, whether the platform is passed as an integer (0 or 1) or as a string ('0', '1'), it works. The default is 'this' as a string. So this code would handle all cases.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the platform parameter is a string, so passing '0' or '1' as strings, so the code can check for those.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the platform can be 0 or 1 as integers, and the code will check for that. So in the code, first check if platform is 'this', else if it's 0 or 1 (as integers), else raise.

But in the function's signature, the default is 'this', so the parameter is a string, so passing 0 would be an error. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, this is a problem. The function's signature says platform is a string, but the docstring says that passing 1 or 0 (integers) is allowed. That's a discrepancy. So perhaps the function's parameter is actually supposed to be an integer with a default of 'this'? That can't be, because integers and strings are different types.

Given that, perhaps the problem has a mistake, and the correct approach is to treat the platform as a string that can be '0', '1', or 'this'. So the code can proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that platform is an integer (0 or 1), and the 'this' is a string. But then the function's signature would have to allow that, but in Python, the default is 'this' (string), so passing an integer would require the parameter to be of type int, but the default is a string. Which is not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the problem's description is correct, and the code should treat the platform as a string, but when checking, the code uses string comparisons. So platform can be '0', '1', or 'this'. So the code can be written as:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        # auto detect
        import sys
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            sep = ';'
        else:
            sep = ':'
    elif platform == '1':
        sep = ':'
    elif platform == '0':
        sep = ';'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return s.split(sep)

This way, the user must pass '0', '1', or 'this' as the platform parameter. That would be consistent with the function's signature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the platform can be an integer, so the code must check if it's an integer. But how?

Perhaps the problem's actual intention is to split the string into arguments according to shell-like rules for the given platform. For example, in Windows, the command-line parser handles quotes and spaces differently than in POSIX. But that would require using shlex.split with different options.

Wait, maybe that's what the problem is about. Let me re-read the problem's description again.

The function's docstring says: "Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result". The examples mention that for Windows/CMD, the style is different. So perhaps it's about splitting a command line into arguments, considering the platform's rules. For instance, in Windows, the command-line parser may treat quotes differently than in POSIX.

In that case, the code would need to use shlex.split but with different parameters depending on the platform.

For example, on Windows, perhaps the code uses posix=False in shlex.split, while on POSIX, it uses posix=True.

So the code would be something like:

import shlex
import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        posix = not sys.platform.startswith('win')
    elif platform == 1:
        posix = True
    elif platform == 0:
        posix = False
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

Wait, but the parameters for platform in the problem's docstring specify that platform can be 0 (Windows/CMD) or 1 (POSIX). So using shlex.split with posix=False for Windows and True for POSIX would be appropriate.

This approach would handle splitting the string into arguments considering quotes and escaping, which is more complex than just splitting on a separator. This makes more sense for a function named split, as splitting on path separators is usually done with os.pathsep, but splitting command-line arguments is a different task.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is about splitting command-line arguments according to the platform's rules, not path separators. That would make more sense.

In that case, the code would use shlex.split with the appropriate posix flag. So:

import shlex
import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        # auto-detect
        posix = not sys.platform.startswith('win')
    elif platform == 1:
        posix = True
    elif platform == 0:
        posix = False
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return shlex.split(s, posix=_posix)

Wait, but in the code, the parameter is called 'platform' and the code uses 0,1, or 'this'. So the code should check if platform is an integer or a string. Wait, in this approach, the code would have to handle the platform parameter correctly.

Wait, in the code above, the function's parameters are platform='this', so it's a string. So when the user passes platform=0 or 1, which are integers, that would be a type error. So the code would have to check whether platform is a string or an integer.

Hmm, but the problem's function signature says platform is a string, so the user must pass a string. So the code can check the string value.

Wait, but the problem's docstring says "if platform equals 1, use POSIX style". So perhaps the platform can be passed as a string '1' or '0', so the code can proceed as follows:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        posix = not sys.platform.startswith('win')
    elif platform == '1':
        posix = True
    elif platform == '0':
        posix = False
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

This way, the platform is a string, and the code uses the string to decide the POSIX flag.

That would be the correct approach if the function is intended to split command-line arguments according to platform rules.

This makes more sense than splitting on path separators, because splitting a path is usually done with os.pathsep, but the function's name is 'split', which is more general.

So I think the correct approach is to use shlex.split with the appropriate posix flag.

Therefore, the code would need to import shlex and sys.

So putting it all together:

import shlex
import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        posix = not sys.platform.startswith('win')
    elif platform == '1':
        posix = True
    elif platform == '0':
        posix = False
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")
    return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

Yes, this code should work. Let's test some cases.

For example, on Windows platform:

platform is 'this', so if current platform is Windows, then posix is False.

Then shlex.split would use Windows rules, which handle quotes differently.

For example, if s is 'a "b c"', then shlex.split with posix=False would return ['a', 'b c'], whereas with posix=True, it would return ['a', 'b', 'c'] (assuming quotes are treated as part of the string).

Wait, no. Let me think:

In POSIX mode, the quotes are used to group words. So in 'a "b c"', shlex.split would return ['a', 'b c'] in both cases, but perhaps with other differences.

Wait, perhaps the main difference is in how backslashes are handled. In POSIX mode, backslashes are used to escape characters, while in Windows mode, they might not be.

So this code would correctly split the string according to the platform's rules.

Therefore, this is the correct approach. The initial assumption about splitting on colons or semicolons was probably incorrect.

So the final code should use shlex.split with the appropriate posix flag, based on the platform parameter.
