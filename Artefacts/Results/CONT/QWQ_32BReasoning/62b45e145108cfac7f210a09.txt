Okay, let's see. I need to write the Python method check_digests_present_and_used based on the given docstring. The parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. The goal is to check that all the digests in the manifest that are needed are both present and used. Then return an error if something's wrong, using the error() method of the class.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what the inputs are. Manifest_files is probably a list or a dictionary of the files in the manifest. Maybe each manifest entry has a digest. And digests_used is a collection of digests that are actually used. So the task is to ensure that every digest required (from the manifest) is present in the digests_used set. Wait, or is it the other way around? The problem says "all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." Maybe the needed digests are the ones listed in the manifest, and we have to check that each of those is present (maybe in some store?) and also used (i.e., present in digests_used). Or perhaps the problem is to check that every digest in the manifest is both present (exists?) and is actually used, so that none are present but unused?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to verify two things: first, that all digests listed in the manifest are present (maybe in some data structure), and second, that all those digests are actually used (i.e., they are in the digests_used collection). So any digest in the manifest must be in digests_used, and also perhaps exist somewhere else (like a storage). But the exact meaning might depend on the context of the class. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll have to go by the docstring.

The function should return an error if any digest in the manifest is either not present (maybe not in some required set) or not used (not in digests_used). Wait, the wording says "are needed are present and used". So maybe the needed digests (the ones that are required) must be both present (in the system) and used (in digests_used). But how to parse this?

Alternatively, perhaps the function needs to check two things: all digests in the manifest are present (so maybe they exist in some storage), and also all of them are actually used (i.e., each digest in the manifest is in the digests_used set). So the error would occur if any digest in the manifest is missing from either the storage (not present) or from the used set (not used). But how do I get the list of digests from the manifest_files?

Assuming manifest_files is a list of files, each of which has a digest. Let's say for example that each element in manifest_files has a 'digest' attribute or is a dictionary with 'digest' as a key. Then I need to collect all the digests from the manifest_files. Let's say we have a set called digests_in_manifest. Then, for each digest in that set, check two things: first, that it is present (maybe in some other data structure? But the parameters only include manifest_files and digests_used). Wait, perhaps the 'present' part refers to being in the manifest_files, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe 'present' means they are actually stored somewhere else, but since that's not a parameter, maybe the problem is that 'present' here is redundant, and the actual check is that each digest in the manifest is in the digests_used set.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to ensure that every digest listed in the manifest is actually used (i.e., exists in digests_used). So the check is that the set of digests from the manifest is a subset of digests_used. If any digest in the manifest is not in digests_used, then that's an error.

Wait the docstring says "all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used". Maybe "needed" are the ones that should be both present (in some storage) and used (in digests_used). But since I don't have access to the storage, perhaps the 'present' part is not part of this check. Maybe the parameters are such that manifest_files is the list of files, each with a digest, and digests_used is the set of digests that are actually used. So the method should check that all the digests in the manifest are present in digests_used. Because if a digest is in the manifest but not in the used set, then it's not being used, which is an error. So the error occurs when there exists a digest in the manifest that's not in digests_used.

Alternatively, perhaps 'present' refers to being present in the manifest, and 'used' is being in the digests_used set. So the check is that every digest in the manifest is indeed used. So the code would be: collect all digests from manifest_files, check each is in digests_used. If any are missing, return an error.

So first, extract all the digests from the manifest_files. Let's assume each element in manifest_files has a 'digest' attribute. So for example:

digests_in_manifest = {f.digest for f in manifest_files}

Then, check that every digest in this set is present in digests_used. So the difference between digests_in_manifest and digests_used would be the ones not used. If that set is not empty, then return an error.

So the steps would be:

1. Extract all the digests from the manifest_files into a set.

2. Find the set of digests in the manifest that are not in digests_used. Let's call that missing_used = digests_in_manifest - digests_used.

3. If missing_used is not empty, then there are digests in the manifest that are not used. So we need to report that as an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem also requires that the digests in the manifest are present in some storage, but since that's not a parameter, maybe the 'present' part is redundant, and the check is just about being used.

In that case, the code would look like this:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    digests_in_manifest = {f.digest for f in manifest_files}
    missing = digests_in_manifest - digests_used
    if missing:
        return self.error(f"Digests {missing} from manifest are not used")
    return None  # or some success indicator?

But the problem says to return error() in the class. So perhaps the method returns the result of error(), which might be an exception or an error object. So in the code, if there are missing digests, we call self.error(...) and return that. Otherwise, perhaps return None or some success.

Wait the docstring says "Return error() in the class." So perhaps when an error is found, it returns the result of calling self.error(), which might be an error message or an exception. So in the code, if there are missing digests, we return the error, else maybe return None?

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to return an error object if there's a problem, else maybe nothing. But the exact return value isn't specified. The code should return the error() when there's an issue.

So putting it all together, the code would collect the digests from the manifest, check against the used set. If any are missing, call self.error with a message and return it. Else, maybe return None.

Wait, but the function's return is not specified. The docstring says "Return error() in the class." So maybe the method should return the error, or perhaps raise it? But the wording suggests that when an error is found, the function should return the result of calling self.error(), otherwise, perhaps returns None or some success.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to return an error message if there's a problem, else return something like True or None. Since the exact return is not specified, but the docstring says to return error() when needed, I'll proceed with that.

So code steps:

- Iterate over each file in manifest_files, collect their digests into a set.

- Compute the difference between this set and digests_used. If any, then there are digests not used.

- If so, return an error message via self.error(), else return nothing or proceed.

Wait, but how exactly is the error method structured? Since I don't have that info, I'll just assume that self.error takes a message as an argument and returns an appropriate error object.

Thus, the code:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    required_digests = {f.digest for f in manifest_files}
    unused_digests = required_digests - digests_used
    if unused_digests:
        return self.error(f"Digests {unused_digests} are present in the manifest but not used")
    return None  # or perhaps return a success indicator, but the problem says to return error() when needed.

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires checking that all digests in the manifest are present in some storage (hence 'present') and also used (in digests_used). But without more parameters, perhaps the 'present' is redundant, and the check is just about being used. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'present' refers to the digests existing in the manifest, and 'used' refers to being in the digests_used. So the check is that all in manifest are used. Hence the code as above.

Another possibility: perhaps 'present' means that the digest is in the manifest, and 'used' means it's in the digests_used. So the code is correct as written.

Therefore, the code should be as written above.
