Okay, I need to write the Python function fetch_content_type that takes a URL and returns the content type from the headers. Let's see. The function should use a HEAD request to get the headers without downloading the whole content. 

First, I'll need to import the necessary modules. The requests library is useful for HTTP requests. Also, the Optional type hint suggests using from typing import Optional. 

Wait, but maybe I should use the standard libraries to avoid dependencies? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so using requests is probably okay. Oh right, but sometimes people prefer urllib. Let me think. The function's docstring mentions setting the USER_AGENT. Oh right, so I need to set a custom User-Agent in the headers. 

So the steps are: send a HEAD request to the given URL, set the User-Agent, then check the response headers for the 'Content-Type' field. If it exists, return it; otherwise, return None.

Wait, how to structure this. Let's outline:

Import requests and Optional. Wait, the function's return is Optional[str], so I need to return None if the Content-Type isn't found.

Start by defining the function. Inside:

Set the headers with a USER_AGENT. The docstring says "set the head of the request through the URL and USER_AGENT". So probably, the USER_AGENT is a variable or a constant. Wait, the problem's docstring mentions URL and USER_AGENT, but the parameters only have the URL. Maybe the USER_AGENT is a constant in the code. Since the problem didn't specify, perhaps I should use a default user agent string. Let's pick a common one like 'Mozilla/5.0' or maybe 'Python requests' but the user might expect a standard one. Let's set a USER_AGENT variable, like USER_AGENT = 'My User Agent' or maybe use a real one. But for the code, just set a constant.

Wait, the function's docstring says "through the URL and USER_AGENT", so maybe the URL is part of the user agent? No, that doesn't make sense. Probably, the user agent is a separate header that needs to be set. So in the code, create a headers dictionary with 'User-Agent' set to some value, like 'Python requests example'.

Then, send the HEAD request using requests.head with the url, headers=headers, and allow_redirects=True so that it follows redirects. Because sometimes the content type is in the final response after redirects.

Wait, but sometimes the HEAD might not be allowed by the server. In that case, the server might respond with 405 Method Not Allowed. Then, maybe we need to do a GET instead? But the function is supposed to use HEAD. Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects us to proceed with HEAD regardless. Let's proceed as per the problem's instruction.

Once the response is obtained, check if 'Content-Type' is in the headers. If yes, return the value. Else, return None.

But also, need to handle exceptions, like if the URL is invalid or the server is not reachable. The function's return is Optional[str], so if there's an error, maybe it should return None? So wrap the request in a try block. 

Wait, the problem's docstring doesn't mention error handling, but since it's a real function, probably necessary. So, the code would be something like:

import requests
from typing import Optional

def fetch_content_type(url: str) -> Optional[str]:
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'My User Agent 1.0'}
    try:
        response = requests.head(url, headers=headers, allow_redirects=True)
        return response.headers.get('Content-Type')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return None

Wait, but the User-Agent is set to a specific value here. The problem's docstring says "through the URL and USER_AGENT". Maybe the USER_AGENT is a variable that should be passed, but the function's parameters only have the URL. Since the function signature doesn't include a user_agent parameter, perhaps the code uses a predefined USER_AGENT variable. So maybe in the code, I should define a constant like USER_AGENT = 'some string' and use that in the headers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the user agent to be part of the request, but the exact value isn't specified. So using a default is okay.

Another point: the function should return the content type as a string, or None. The headers.get('Content-Type') would return None if not present, so returning that directly would work. 

Wait, but sometimes the server might send a Content-Type with parameters, like 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'. The function should return the entire value, so that's okay.

Putting it all together, the code would look like the above. But I need to make sure to import the necessary modules. Also, note that in Python, the 'requests' module is third-party, so if the problem expects a solution without it, maybe using urllib. But the problem didn't specify. Since the user is a Python software engineer, perhaps using requests is acceptable.

Alternatively, using urllib:

import urllib.request
from typing import Optional

def fetch_content_type(url: str) -> Optional[str]:
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'My User Agent 1.0'}
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers=headers, method='HEAD')
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
            return response.getheader('Content-Type')
    except urllib.error.URLError as e:
        return None

Hmm, which is better? The problem's docstring says "set the head of the request through the URL and USER_AGENT". Maybe using requests is more straightforward. Let me go with the requests version.

Wait, but in the requests.head call, the allow_redirects is set to True by default? Or do I need to set it? Because sometimes HEAD requests might not follow redirects. So setting allow_redirects=True is better to ensure that redirects are followed. So that's correct.

So the code would be:

from typing import Optional
import requests

def fetch_content_type(url: str) -> Optional[str]:
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'My User Agent 1.0'}
    try:
        response = requests.head(url, headers=headers, allow_redirects=True)
        return response.headers.get('Content-Type')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return None

Wait, the User-Agent string can be any. Since the problem's docstring mentions USER_AGENT, perhaps I should use a variable for it? Like:

USER_AGENT = 'My User Agent String'

Then in the headers:

headers = {'User-Agent': USER_AGENT}

But the code can just hardcode it. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the user agent to be part of the function's parameters, but according to the function signature, it's not. So the code as above is okay.

Wait, the docstring says "through the URL and USER_AGENT". Maybe that's indicating that the user agent is part of the request's headers. Which it is. So the code is okay.

Testing edge cases: if the server doesn't support HEAD, it might return 405, but the requests.head would still get a response, and the headers may or may not have Content-Type. But the code would return whatever is there. Alternatively, maybe the server returns a 200 with the body, but using HEAD should avoid that. So the code should handle that.

Overall, this seems correct. Now, the code must be output without any explanations, just the code in markdown. Wait, the user says to output the code in Python markdown format. Wait, maybe they want the code block with triple backticks? Like:

```python
... code here ...
```

So I need to make sure to enclose the code in triple backticks. Also, the code must not have any extra text, just the code. Let me check again the code:

Wait, the import statements: from typing import Optional and import requests. The order doesn't matter, but usually, standard libraries come before typing. So:

import requests
from typing import Optional

Then the function.

Yes. So putting it all together:

The final code would be:

```python
import requests
from typing import Optional

def fetch_content_type(url: str) -> Optional[str]:
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'My User Agent 1.0'}
    try:
        response = requests.head(url, headers=headers, allow_redirects=True)
        return response.headers.get('Content-Type')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return None
```

I think this should work. The User-Agent is set, the HEAD request is made, and the content type is returned or None. The exception handling covers network issues.
