Okay, I need to write a Python function called size_to_bytes that converts a human-readable size string into bytes. Let's see. The input is a string like '500K' or '2.5M', and the output should be the equivalent in bytes.

First, I should think about the possible formats the input can take. The examples given are '500K' and maybe something like '2.5M' or even '3G' or '100B'. The function has to handle those suffixes. The suffixes probably stand for different units: B for bytes, K for kilobytes, M for megabytes, G for gigabytes, etc. But I need to confirm the exact units. Usually, K is 1024 bytes, but sometimes people use 1000. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but in computing contexts, it's typically 1024. So I'll assume that.

The steps I need to take are:

1. Extract the numerical part and the unit part from the string.
2. Convert the numerical part to a float, then multiply by the appropriate unit factor.
3. Return the result as an integer.

So first, split the string into the number and the unit. The unit is the last character, and the number is the rest. But what if the unit is more than one character? Like 'KiB' or 'MiB'? Probably not here. The examples given are single letters, so I'll assume the unit is a single character at the end.

Wait, the problem's example includes '500K' so the unit is K. So the function can split the string into the numeric part and the suffix. Let's see: the input is '500K' → number is 500, unit K. The code would take the last character as the unit, and the rest as the number. But what about a decimal point? Like '2.5M' → the number part is '2.5', unit M.

So the plan is:

- Check if the input string is valid. If it's just a number with no suffix, maybe it's bytes? Like '100' would be 100 bytes. Or maybe the suffix is required. The problem's docstring says the input is a string like '500K', so perhaps the input must have a suffix. Wait, the problem says "human readable" so maybe '500' could be 500 bytes, but the function expects the suffix. Hmm, the problem's example includes '500K' so maybe the input must have a suffix. But perhaps the function should handle cases where there's no suffix, treating it as bytes. Let me check the problem again. The docstring says "a string representing a human readable file size (eg: '500K')". So the example includes a suffix. So perhaps the function requires that the input has a suffix. But maybe the code should handle the case where the input is just a number (without a suffix) by treating it as bytes. Or maybe it's an error? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that the input always has a valid suffix, but perhaps the code should handle cases where there's no suffix by considering it as bytes. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the code can split the string into the numeric part and the unit. So first, separate the unit. Let's see:

Take the input string, find the last character, check if it's a unit. Then the rest is the number. But what if the unit is not at the end? Like '500 K' with a space? Probably not, as per the example given. So the code can split the string into the part before the last character and the last character. But maybe the unit is uppercase or lowercase? The problem's example uses uppercase, but the function should probably be case-insensitive. So perhaps we should convert the unit to uppercase or lowercase before processing.

The units and their multipliers:

- B: 1 (byte)
- K: 1024
- M: 1024^2 (1048576)
- G: 1024^3 (1073741824)
- T: 1024^4, etc. But perhaps the problem only requires up to G or so. Let's see. The examples include K and M, so probably need to handle those.

So the steps:

1. Check if the input string is empty or has length 0. Probably not, but need to handle that.

2. Split the string into the numeric part and the unit. The unit is the last character. The numeric part is everything before that. So for '500K', the numeric part is '500', unit 'K'. For '2.5M', numeric '2.5', unit 'M'. For '3G', '3' and 'G'.

3. Convert the numeric part to a float. Then multiply by the unit's factor.

4. Return the integer value. Since bytes are integers, but the input might have a decimal (like 2.5M), so we can cast to int after multiplying. So 2.5 * 1048576 would be 2621440, which is an integer. But if the number is a fraction that doesn't result in an integer, like '0.5K' (512 bytes), that's okay.

Now, code steps:

First, extract the unit and number:

size_str = size.strip()  # Maybe leading/trailing whitespace?

But according to the problem's example, the input is like '500K' so probably no whitespace. But perhaps the code should handle leading/trailing spaces. The problem's docstring says the input is a string like '500K', so maybe the input is properly formatted. But better to process it in case.

Wait, the function's argument is a str, so it's up to the user. To handle cases where there's a space, perhaps split the last character. Let me think.

So, let's take the last character as the unit. So:

unit = size[-1].upper()  # to handle lowercase like 'k' or 'm'

number_str = size[:-1]

But if the input is like '100', then size[-1] is '0', which is not a valid unit. So in that case, the code would throw an error. But according to the problem's example, the input must have a suffix. Wait, the problem's example includes '500K', so perhaps the function expects that the input always has a valid suffix. Therefore, the code should handle cases where the input does not have a valid suffix by raising an error? Or perhaps the function should treat the absence of a suffix as bytes. Like, '500' would be 500 bytes.

Hmm, the problem's docstring says that the input is a human-readable size, which usually includes the unit. But maybe in some cases, the user might input just a number. So perhaps the code should check if the last character is a unit. Alternatively, perhaps the code can check if the unit is valid. Let me think: if the input is '500', then the code would take the unit as '0', which is invalid, leading to an error. So in that case, the function should raise a ValueError. But perhaps the function should treat the absence of a unit as bytes. So maybe the code should check if the unit is valid. So first, check that the input has at least one character. So:

if len(size) < 1:

    raise ValueError("Input string is empty")

But the problem's example includes '500K' which is 4 characters. So, let's proceed.

So, code outline:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:

    unit = size[-1].upper()

    number_str = size[:-1]

    # parse the number_str to float

    try:

        number = float(number_str)

    except ValueError:

        raise ValueError("Invalid number format")

    # Now, check the unit and compute the multiplier

    units = {'B': 1, 'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4}

    if unit not in units:

        raise ValueError(f"Invalid unit: {unit}")

    return int(number * units[unit])

Wait, but what about the case where the unit is 'B'? For example, '500B' would be 500 bytes. That's okay.

But what if the unit is not present? Like '500' → the code would take unit as '0' (from '500'[:-1] → '50', unit is '0' → which is not in units, so error. So the function would return an error, which is correct, since '500' is not a valid input according to the problem's example.

But the problem's docstring says "human readable file size" which could include '500' as 500 bytes. Hmm, maybe the function should allow that. So perhaps, if the unit is not present (the string is all digits or has a decimal point but no suffix), then it's considered bytes. So, perhaps the code should check if the last character is a unit. If not, then the entire string is the number, and the unit is 'B'.

Wait, but how to detect that. Maybe the code can check if the last character is a digit or a decimal point. Alternatively, the code can try to parse the entire string as a number first. Let me think of another approach.

Alternative approach:

Split the string into parts where the unit is the last non-numeric character. Alternatively, find the unit by checking the last character. But perhaps the unit can be uppercase or lowercase.

Wait, maybe the code can process the entire string by finding the unit as the last non-digit character. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the code can process the string by checking if the last character is a valid unit. If not, then it's part of the number, and the unit is B. But that's getting complicated. The problem's example includes '500K', so the code is probably intended to require the suffix. So if the input is '500', the code should raise an error. But perhaps the problem expects that the input may have no suffix and in that case, it's treated as bytes. Let me check the problem's docstring again.

The docstring says "human readable file size (eg: '500K')". The example includes a suffix, so the function expects that the input has a suffix. So in the code, if the input has no suffix (like '500'), then it's invalid, so the code should raise an error.

Thus, proceeding with the initial approach.

Now, code:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:

    unit = size[-1].upper()

    number_str = size[:-1]

    try:

        number = float(number_str)

    except ValueError:

        raise ValueError("Invalid number format in size string")

    units = {'B': 1, 'K': 1024, 'M': 1048576, 'G': 1073741824, 'T': 1099511627776}

    if unit not in units:

        raise ValueError(f"Invalid unit '{unit}' in size string")

    return int(number * units[unit])

Wait, but the units can be represented as exponents. For example, K is 2^10, M is 2^20, etc. So, perhaps it's better to compute them dynamically. But for code brevity, maybe just use the exact numbers. Alternatively, using 1024**n.

Wait, let me compute them:

K: 1024 ** 1 → 1024

M: 1024 ** 2 → 1048576

G: 1024**3 → 1073741824

T: 1024**4 → 1099511627776

So the units can be stored as such.

Alternatively, code can use a dictionary that uses exponents:

units = {'B':0, 'K':1, 'M':2, 'G':3, 'T':4}

then multiplier is 1024 ** units[unit]

But that might be more flexible. Let me see.

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:

    unit = size[-1].upper()

    number_str = size[:-1]

    try:

        number = float(number_str)

    except ValueError:

        raise ValueError("Invalid number format in size string")

    unit_exponents = {'B':0, 'K':1, 'M':2, 'G':3, 'T':4}

    if unit not in unit_exponents:

        raise ValueError(f"Invalid unit '{unit}' in size string")

    exponent = unit_exponents[unit]

    return int(number * (1024 ** exponent))

This way, it's easier to add more units if needed, without having to update the numbers. This might be better. Let's see.

Testing with '500K' → exponent 1 → 500 * 1024 = 512000 → correct.

'2.5M' → exponent 2 → 2.5 * 1048576 = 2621440 → correct.

So this approach is better.

So code can be written this way.

Now, edge cases:

- What about '100B'? → 100 * 1 → 100.

- '0.5K' → 0.5 *1024 = 512 → correct.

- '1G' → 1073741824 → yes.

Now, what if the unit is not in the allowed list, like '500X'? → error.

Now, what about leading or trailing spaces in the input? For example, ' 500K ' → the code would take the last character as ' ', which is invalid. So the function would raise an error. So perhaps the code should first strip whitespace from the input.

Ah, right. So the input might have leading or trailing whitespace. So the first step should be to strip the input.

Modify the code to first process:

size = size.strip()

Then proceed.

So:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:

    size = size.strip()

    if len(size) == 0:

        raise ValueError("Input string is empty")

    unit = size[-1].upper()

    number_str = size[:-1]

    try:

        number = float(number_str)

    except ValueError:

        raise ValueError("Invalid number format in size string")

    unit_exponents = {'B':0, 'K':1, 'M':2, 'G':3, 'T':4}

    if unit not in unit_exponents:

        raise ValueError(f"Invalid unit '{unit}' in size string")

    exponent = unit_exponents[unit]

    return int(number * (1024 ** exponent))

Wait, but what if the number_str is empty after stripping? Like, if the input is 'K' → after stripping, size is 'K', then number_str is size[:-1] → empty string. Then converting to float would fail. So the code would raise an error. That's correct because 'K' is invalid.

Another case: input is '500Kb' (with lowercase b). But the unit is 'b', which is valid. The code takes unit.upper() → 'B', so that's okay. So '500kb' would be treated as 500 * 1024^1 (since the unit is 'K')? Wait, no. Wait, in the code, unit is the last character. So in '500kb', the last character is 'b', so unit is 'B', so the number_str is '500k'. But '500k' is not a valid number because of the 'k'? Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, the input '500kb' would be stripped to '500kb'. Then unit is 'b', uppercase becomes 'B'. Then number_str is '500k'. The number_str is '500k', which can't be converted to a float, so the code would raise an error. So that's correct, because the input should have the number part without letters except the unit.

Hmm, so the code requires that the number part is a valid float, so letters other than the unit would cause an error. So that's okay.

Another case: '123.45MB' → the unit is 'B' (uppercase), but the exponent for 'B' is 0, so that would be 123.45 * 1 → 123.45 bytes. But the user probably intended 'MB' as the unit. But according to the code, the unit is the last character, which is 'B', so the code would parse the unit as 'B' (since the last character is B). But the actual intended unit is 'MB', but the code would treat it as 'B', which is wrong. So this is a problem. Because the unit is the last character, but in 'MB', the unit is 'B', but that's not correct. So this shows a flaw in the approach.

Ah, right! The code is taking the last character as the unit, but in cases where the unit is more than one character, like 'MB' or 'KiB', this approach would fail. The problem's example uses '500K', so the unit is a single character. But if the input is '500MB', then the code would take 'B' as the unit, leading to an error. So this is a problem.

So the problem is that the code's current approach only takes the last character as the unit, which works for single-letter units but not for multi-letter units. The problem's example uses single letters, so perhaps the function is intended to only handle single-letter units. But the problem's docstring says "human readable", which sometimes includes multi-letter like 'MB' or 'GiB'. But maybe in this problem, the units are single letters.

Alternatively, perhaps the unit is the last non-digit character. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the code should look for the first occurrence of a non-numeric character and take that as the unit. Wait, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, the code can split the string into the numeric part and the unit part by checking where the unit starts. The unit is the last character, but in cases like 'MB', the unit is the last character 'B', which is not a valid unit. So this approach is flawed.

Hmm, this is a problem. So perhaps the code should look for the unit as the last character that is not a digit or a decimal point. Let me think of another way. Let's process the string from the end backwards, looking for the first non-numeric character (excluding the decimal point). The unit is the last non-numeric character.

Alternatively, perhaps the unit is the last alphabetic character in the string. Let's think:

Take '500MB' → the alphabetic characters are 'MB', so the unit is 'B'? That's not right. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the unit is the last letter, but in the case of 'MB', the user intended 'M' as the unit. So the code should take the unit as the last letter if it is a valid unit, but in 'MB', the last character is 'B', which is a valid unit but not intended. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the user intended 'MB' as the unit, but according to the code's current approach, the code will take 'B' as the unit, leading to an error. So that's an issue.

Hmm, so this suggests that the code's current approach is not sufficient for cases where the unit is more than one character. But according to the problem's example, the input is like '500K', so the unit is a single character. So perhaps the problem expects that the unit is a single character, so the code is okay. So maybe the code is correct under the assumption that the input's unit is a single character at the end.

Therefore, in the case of '500MB', the code would treat 'B' as the unit, which is invalid because the unit is not in the allowed list (since 'B' is allowed, but in this case, the number_str is '500M', which is not a valid number. Wait, no. Let me see:

Input '500MB' → stripped to '500MB'. The unit is the last character 'B', so number_str is '500M'. Trying to convert '500M' to a float would fail, because of the 'M'. So the code would raise a ValueError on the number conversion. So that's correct, because the input '500MB' is invalid in this code's framework, since the unit is supposed to be a single character. The user should have written '500M' instead.

Therefore, the code is okay, as long as the input follows the format of a number followed by a single unit character.

Another test case: '2.5M' → the code would process correctly, unit 'M', number_str '2.5' → 2.5 * 1024^2 → correct.

Another edge case: '0K' → 0 * 1024 → 0, which is okay.

Now, what about '1024K' → 1024 * 1024 → 1,048,576 → which is 1M.

But code would return that correctly.

Now, code also needs to handle case where the unit is lowercase. Like '500k' → the code converts unit to uppercase, so 'K' is valid.

Now, what about leading zeros? Like '05K' → the number_str is '05' which converts to 5.0 → okay.

Now, code also needs to handle the case where the number is an integer or a float. Like '5.5K' → 5.5 *1024 → 5632 → correct.

So the code seems okay.

Now, what about the case where the unit is 'B'? Like '500B' → the code would return 500 * 1 = 500.

Another case: '100' → stripped to '100', then unit is '0', which is not in the unit_exponents. So code would raise an error. Which is correct, as per problem's example.

Thus, the code should work as intended.

Now, the code:

Wait, in the code above, after stripping, the code checks if the length is 0. Then, proceeds.

Now, let's write the code as per the problem's requirement.

The function must have the docstring as given. Also, the code must be in a code block, without any explanation.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I need to write the code inside triple backticks, with the code.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Ah, so the code must be enclosed in triple backticks, and the code itself. So the final code would be:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert human readable file size to bytes

    Args:
            size: str, a string representing a human readable file size (eg: '500K')
    Returns:
            int: file size in bytes
    """
    size = size.strip()
    if len(size) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Input string is empty")
    unit = size[-1].upper()
    number_str = size[:-1]
    try:
        number = float(number_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number format in size string")
    unit_exponents = {'B':0, 'K':1, 'M':2, 'G':3, 'T':4}
    if unit not in unit_exponents:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid unit '{unit}' in size string")
    return int(number * (1024 ** unit_exponents[unit]))

Wait, but in the code above, the docstring is part of the function. So the code must include that.

Now, let me check for possible errors:

- What if the number_str is empty? Like input 'K' → stripped to 'K', length 1. Then number_str is '', so converting to float would fail → error.

- What if the unit is 'B' and the number is 0 → returns 0, which is okay.

- What if the unit is 'T' → exponent 4 → 1024^4.

Yes.

Now, testing the code with the example '500K' → returns 500 *1024 = 512000 → correct.

Another test case: '2.5M' → 2.5 * 1024^2 → 2.5 * 1048576 → 2621440 → correct.

Another test case: '1G' → 1 * 1024^3 → 1073741824 → correct.

Edge case: '0B' → 0 → correct.

Now, code should handle all these. So the code should be as above.
