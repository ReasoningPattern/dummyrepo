Okay, I need to write a Python function called load_configurations based on the given docstring. Let's see what the parameters are: config_filenames is a sequence of filenames, overrides is optional (defaults to None), and resolve_env is a boolean that's True by default. The function should load and validate each config file, handle errors, and return a tuple with a dict of filename to parsed configs and a list of LogRecords for any errors.

Hmm, first, I should think about how to process each config file. The function needs to read each file, parse it, and check for errors. If there's an error like permission issues or parsing errors, log those. The return is a dictionary mapping each filename to its config, and a list of log records for errors.

Wait, the doc mentions that if a config file can't be read (permissions) or parsed, the error is logged. So for each file, I need to try opening it, parse it, and handle exceptions. Also, maybe the overrides parameter is a way to override some config values? The doc doesn't specify what overrides does exactly, but since it's an optional parameter, maybe it's a dictionary of key-value pairs that override the parsed config. But the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps I should focus on the main points first.

The function should return two things: the configs as a dict (filename -> config dict), and the log records of errors.

First step: Iterate over each filename in config_filenames. For each, attempt to open and read the file. If there's an IOError (like permission denied), catch that and create a LogRecord. Then, parse the config. How is the config parsed? The doc doesn't specify the format, like JSON or YAML. Oh, maybe the problem assumes that the config is in a standard format, but perhaps the function is supposed to read the file as a dictionary. Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to read the config as a Python dictionary, maybe using some standard parsing, but since it's unspecified, maybe the code will just read the file as text and then parse it as a config (but maybe the actual parsing is left to some function?).

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to assume that each config file is a .ini file, or some other format? Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the code will just read the file's contents and then parse it as a dictionary. Wait, but that's unclear. Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file, parse it (maybe using some standard method, like JSON), and then validate it. But since the problem doesn't specify the format, maybe the code just reads the file's contents as a string and then parses it into a dict using some method, but without knowing the format, perhaps the code will just return an empty dict or something. Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use a dummy parser, but maybe I need to proceed with the assumption that the config is in a format that can be parsed into a dictionary, perhaps using some standard method.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to just read the file, and then the actual parsing is not part of the problem, so maybe the code just reads the file and returns the contents as a string? But that doesn't make sense because the return is a dict. Hmm, maybe the problem expects that the config is in a format like JSON or YAML, but since it's unspecified, perhaps the code uses a dummy parser that just reads the file into a dictionary. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the configuration files are in a format that can be parsed via some function, but since it's not specified, perhaps the code will just assume that each config file is a Python file that can be imported, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to read the config files as simple key-value pairs, splitting on lines, and splitting each line into key=value? That's possible, but without more info, maybe the code can just read the file's contents and return them as a dictionary. Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to use a default parser, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code can just read the file as a dictionary by some method, but I need to make some assumptions here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function's actual parsing is not the focus here. The main points are error handling and logging. So, the core steps are:

For each filename in config_filenames:

1. Try to open the file. If can't (IOError), log the error (insufficient permissions, etc.), add the LogRecord to the error list.

2. If the file is opened, read its contents. Then parse it into a configuration dictionary. If parsing fails (like invalid JSON syntax), catch the exception (e.g., json.JSONDecodeError if using JSON), log the error, add to the error list.

3. After parsing, apply any overrides. The overrides parameter is a dictionary that might override some keys in the config. So, the parsed config is updated with overrides.items().

Wait, but the docstring says "overrides" is an optional parameter. So, perhaps the overrides are applied to the final configuration. Wait, but the function returns a dict of filename to config. So maybe each config is first parsed, then overrides are applied? Or are the overrides applied per config? The docstring isn't clear, but maybe the overrides are applied to each config. Or maybe the overrides are a way to override the final merged config, but the function's return is per-file configs. Hmm, this part is unclear. Since the problem says "overrides=None", perhaps it's a dictionary that can override the parsed config. But since the function returns a dict of filename to config, maybe the overrides are applied to each individual config. For example, when loading each file, after parsing, the overrides are applied, overwriting the values from the config. So, for each config, config = parsed_config and then config.update(overrides) if overrides is not None. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a way to provide default values? Or perhaps the overrides are applied after merging all configs? The problem's docstring isn't clear. Since the function's parameters are config_filenames and overrides, perhaps the overrides are applied to each config file's parsed data. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied to the final merged config, but the function returns per-file configs. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that the overrides are applied to each config's parsed data. Let me note that and proceed, but maybe the code can handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are a list of key-value pairs that override the config. But the problem's parameters say overrides is a sequence? Wait, the function's parameters say overrides is None by default. The docstring says "overrides=None", so perhaps it's a dictionary where the keys are the config keys to override. So, for each config, after parsing, we do config.update(overrides) if overrides is provided. But the problem says "overrides" is optional, so if it's not None, then apply it.

But the problem's main task is to read the config files, handle errors, and return the configs and errors. The overrides part is an extra step, but perhaps it's part of the configuration processing.

Wait, the function's return is a dict of filename to parsed configuration. So, after parsing each file's content into a config dict, if there are overrides, those overrides are applied to that config. So the overrides would be a dictionary that overrides the parsed config. So, for each config, the parsed data is updated with the overrides.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied in some other way, but given the parameters, it's probably that.

Now, the resolve_env parameter: if True, then perhaps the configuration should resolve environment variables? Like, if the config has a value like ${VARIABLE}, then it's replaced with the environment variable's value. So, maybe the code needs to perform variable substitution using os.environ. But how to handle that? That's part of the configuration parsing step.

Hmm, so steps for each config file:

- Open the file, read its contents.

- Parse the contents into a config dict (maybe using some parser, but the problem doesn't specify the format). Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code is supposed to read the file as a dictionary using some standard method, like JSON or YAML. But since that's not specified, maybe the code can read the file as a string and split into lines, then parse each line as key=value pairs. For example, a simple config file where each line is key=value, and empty lines are ignored. That might be a common approach for simple configs. Let's assume that.

So, the parsing function would be:

def parse_config(content):
    config = {}
    for line in content.splitlines():
        line = line.strip()
        if not line or line.startswith('#'):
            continue
        if '=' in line:
            key, val = line.split('=', 1)
            key = key.strip()
            val = val.strip()
            config[key] = val
    return config

Alternatively, maybe the config is in JSON format. But since it's unspecified, perhaps the code uses a simple key=value per line.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read the file as a Python dictionary, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the code is to read the file as a .ini file using ConfigParser. But again, the problem doesn't specify. Since the problem is from an interview, perhaps the code is supposed to read the file as a simple key=value pairs, and parse into a dictionary. Let me proceed with that approach.

So, for each file:

1. Try to open the file in read mode. Catch exceptions like PermissionError or FileNotFoundError. Those would be logged as errors.

Wait, the doc says "insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file". So, if the file can't be read due to permissions (like PermissionError), or if parsing fails (like invalid format), then log the error.

So, first, open the file. Let's see:

try:
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
except (IOError, PermissionError) as e:
    # log the error, add to log records
    # create a LogRecord
    # but how to create a LogRecord?

Wait, the function needs to return a list of logging.LogRecord instances. So, the logging module's LogRecord class is used here. The function has to create these LogRecord objects when errors occur.

So, first, for each file, in a loop:

errors = []
configs = {}

for filename in config_filenames:
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
    except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        # create a LogRecord for this error
        # the LogRecord requires a name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, etc.
        # but how to construct it?
        # perhaps using logging.makeLogRecord? But that requires a dictionary with certain fields.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the logging module's functions to create a log record, but I might have to create one manually. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to capture the error and create a LogRecord with the appropriate message.

Wait, the LogRecord class has __init__ parameters. The required parameters are:

name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func, sinfo, created, msecs, relativeCreated, thread, threadName, process, processName, message.

Hmm, that's a lot. Maybe it's easier to use a helper function or use the logging module's functions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the code uses the logging module's basicConfig and then captures the logs, but that's not feasible here because the function must return the LogRecords directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can create a LogRecord instance with minimal required parameters. Let me check the LogRecord's __init__ method. Looking at the Python documentation:

The LogRecord constructor takes a number of parameters, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can create a LogRecord with the most essential parameters. For example:

record = logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=filename, lineno=0, msg=str(e), args=None, exc_info=None)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code can just create a LogRecord with a message indicating the error. Since the problem requires returning a LogRecord, perhaps the code can use a helper to create it. Alternatively, maybe the code can use the logging module's get_logger and capture the logs, but that would require setting up a handler and then retrieving the logs, which is more complex. Since the function must return the LogRecords directly, perhaps the code must construct them manually.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the code uses a simple approach, like creating a dictionary for the log record, but the problem specifies that the return is a sequence of LogRecord instances. Therefore, the code must create LogRecord objects.

Alternatively, maybe the code can use the logging.makeLogRecord function, but that requires a dictionary with certain keys. The parameters needed for makeLogRecord include:

- name
- level
- pathname
- lineno
- msg
- args
- exc_info
- func
- sinfo

Hmm, perhaps the code can create a minimal dictionary with the necessary fields. Let me think:

When an error occurs (like a file can't be opened), the error message would be something like "Error reading file 'filename': error message".

So, for the LogRecord:

name could be 'config_loader' (the logger name), level is logging.ERROR, pathname is the filename, lineno 0, msg is the error message, exc_info is the exception if any.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can just set the msg to str(e) and pass the exception info.

So, in the case of a file open error:

error_msg = f"Error reading file '{filename}': {e}"
record = logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=filename, lineno=0, msg=error_msg, args=None, exc_info=None)
errors.append(record)

But I need to make sure that all required parameters are present. Alternatively, maybe the code can use the exception's __traceback__ but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the code uses a simplified approach, and the LogRecord can be created with minimal parameters. Let me proceed with that approach.

Now, after opening the file successfully, the next step is to parse the content into a config dict. Let's assume that the config is in a simple key=value format, one per line. So, the parsing function would split lines, ignore comments (lines starting with #), and split on the first '='.

So, for content in the file:

def parse_config(content):
    config = {}
    for line in content.splitlines():
        line = line.strip()
        if not line or line.startswith('#'):
            continue
        if '=' in line:
            key, val = line.split('=', 1)
            key = key.strip()
            val = val.strip()
            config[key] = val
    return config

Wait, but that's a function that would need to be defined inside the load_configurations function? Or perhaps written inline. Alternatively, the code can handle that inline.

Now, after parsing, if there was an error (like the line didn't have an '='), then we need to catch that. Wait, in this parsing approach, if a line doesn't have an '=', it's just ignored. So maybe that's okay. But if the file is supposed to have valid lines, then maybe some other error?

Alternatively, perhaps the parsing could throw an error if the line is invalid. But in the problem's docstring, the error parsing is mentioned. So, perhaps the code should check if the parsed config is valid, but in this case, maybe the parsing function returns an empty dict if there's an invalid format. Or perhaps the code can check for that.

Wait, the problem says "error parsing configuration file" would be logged. So, if after reading the file's content, the parsing fails (like the content is not in the expected format), then that's an error to be logged.

So, in the code:

After reading the content, try to parse it. If parsing fails (like in the case of JSON, if it's not valid JSON), then log an error.

But in the simple key=value approach, the parsing function doesn't throw exceptions, but maybe that's not sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps the parsing function could return a boolean indicating success, but in this case, the code would have to check for that.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a try-except block around the parsing. Let me think again.

Suppose the config is in JSON format. Then, parsing would be:

import json

def parse_config(content):
    try:
        return json.loads(content)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid JSON: {e}")

Then, in the main code:

    content = f.read()
    try:
        config = parse_config(content)
    except ValueError as e:
        # log the error
        record = ... 
        errors.append(record)
        continue

But the problem's docstring mentions "error parsing configuration file", so this would be handled here.

But since the problem didn't specify the format, perhaps I should proceed with a simple key=value parser, and assume that if the content is not parsable (like if there are no '=' in lines), then the config would be empty but not an error? That might not fit the problem's requirement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the parsing is done via some method, and any parsing error (like invalid format) would be caught and logged.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous, but let's proceed with the key=value parser, and assume that lines without '=' are just ignored, so no parsing error unless the file is empty? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the code can consider that if the parsed config is empty, that's an error. But that's not necessarily true, as the config could be empty on purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the config must have at least one key-value pair, otherwise it's an error. But that's not stated.

Well, given the ambiguity, perhaps the code can proceed with the key=value approach and handle exceptions as needed.

Now, back to the main code flow.

After reading the file's content, the code parses it into a config dict. Then, if there are any parsing errors (like in the case of JSON, but here maybe not), then log the error. Wait, in the key=value approach, there are no exceptions, so the only parsing errors would be if the file is empty, but that's not an error. So perhaps the code only logs errors if the file can't be read (IOError) or if the parsed config is empty? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the parsing is done such that if a line is invalid (like no '='), then it's considered an error. In that case, the code would need to track that.

Hmm, perhaps the code should proceed as follows:

After reading the content, parse it using the key=value method. If the parsed config is empty, then log an error? Or not.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's "error parsing" refers to cases like syntax errors in the config format (like missing '=' in key=value lines). So, in that case, the parsing function would raise an error if such a line is encountered. But in my current parser, those lines are just ignored, so no error is raised. So perhaps that's not the case.

This is getting a bit too stuck on the parsing method. Let's proceed with the key=value parser, and assume that any lines not in key=value format are ignored. Thus, the only errors would be file reading issues, and perhaps if the parsed config is empty but that's not considered an error.

Now, after parsing, the code applies the overrides. The overrides parameter is a dictionary. So, if overrides is provided (not None), then the parsed config is updated with the overrides.

Wait, the overrides would be applied per file? So for each config file's parsed data, we do config.update(overrides) if overrides is not None.

But what if overrides is a list? The parameter says overrides=None, so I think it's a dictionary.

So:

if overrides is not None:
    config.update(overrides)

Wait, but that would replace the existing keys in the config with the overrides' keys. So the overrides override the config's values.

Then, if resolve_env is True, we need to resolve any environment variables in the config's values. For example, if a value is "$VAR", it should be replaced with the value of os.environ['VAR'].

So, for each key in the config, check if the value contains environment variable references. The standard way to do this is using os.path.expandvars, but that's for paths. Alternatively, using a function to replace ${VARIABLE} style.

Wait, the standard method in Python is to use os.path.expandvars which replaces $VAR and ${VAR} with the environment variable's value. So, perhaps for each value in the config, we can apply os.path.expandvars.

So, for each key in config:

config[key] = os.path.expandvars(config[key])

But this would expand any variables in the string.

So, the code would do that only if resolve_env is True.

Putting this together:

After parsing the config:

if resolve_env:
    for key in config:
        config[key] = os.path.expandvars(config[key])

Then, apply overrides (if any):

if overrides is not None:
    config.update(overrides.items())  # or just config.update(overrides)

Wait, config.update(overrides) would do it.

Putting all together:

for filename in config_filenames:
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
    except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        # create a log record for this error
        error_msg = f"Error reading file '{filename}': {str(e)}"
        record = logging.LogRecord(
            name='config_loader',
            level=logging.ERROR,
            pathname=filename,
            lineno=0,
            msg=error_msg,
            args=None,
            exc_info=None
        )
        errors.append(record)
        continue  # skip to next file
    
    # parse the content into config
    config = {}
    for line in content.splitlines():
        line = line.strip()
        if not line or line.startswith('#'):
            continue
        if '=' in line:
            key, val = line.split('=', 1)
            key = key.strip()
            val = val.strip()
            config[key] = val
    
    # check for parsing errors? Like if no '=' in line?
    # maybe not, since we just ignore those lines. So no error here.
    
    # apply resolve_env
    if resolve_env:
        for key in list(config.keys()):  # iterate over a copy since we're modifying
            config[key] = os.path.expandvars(config[key])
    
    # apply overrides
    if overrides is not None:
        config.update(overrides)
    
    # add to configs dict
    configs[filename] = config

Wait, but what if there's an error in parsing? Like the config file has a line that is not key=value, but that's not an error, just ignored. So, perhaps the only errors are file read errors. The problem's docstring mentions "error parsing configuration file" as a possible error. So, maybe in some cases, the parsing can fail. Like, if the config is in JSON and the JSON is invalid, then that's a parsing error. But in our key=value approach, there are no such errors. So perhaps I need to reconsider the parsing method.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should assume that the config is in a format that can be parsed into a dictionary, and if the parsing function (like JSON) throws an error, then that's a parsing error. So, in that case, the code should catch exceptions from the parsing function.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that the config is in a format that requires a parser which can raise exceptions. Let me try to adjust the code accordingly.

Let me switch to using JSON parsing, which would allow for parsing errors.

So, first, import json.

Then, in the parsing step:

try:
    config = json.loads(content)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    # parsing error, log it
    error_msg = f"Error parsing config file '{filename}': {e}"
    record = logging.LogRecord(...)
    errors.append(record)
    continue

But then the code would have to read the file as JSON, which requires that the config files are in JSON format. Since the problem didn't specify, but the function's docstring mentions parsing errors, this approach would make sense.

So, let's proceed with JSON parsing.

So, modifying the code:

import json
import os

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    configs = {}
    errors = []
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
        except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
            error_msg = f"Error reading file '{filename}': {str(e)}"
            record = logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=0,
                msg=error_msg,
                args=None,
                exc_info=None
            )
            errors.append(record)
            continue
        
        try:
            config = json.loads(content)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            error_msg = f"Error parsing config file '{filename}': {e}"
            record = logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=,  # not sure, maybe 0
                msg=error_msg,
                args=None,
                exc_info=None
            )
            errors.append(record)
            continue
        
        # Now apply resolve_env
        if resolve_env:
            # Need to replace environment variables in the config's values.
            # This is a bit tricky because the config could be nested, but assuming it's a flat dict.
            # For each value in the config, expandvars.
            for key in config:
                val = config[key]
                if isinstance(val, str):
                    config[key] = os.path.expandvars(val)
        
        # Apply overrides
        if overrides is not None:
            config.update(overrides)
        
        configs[filename] = config
    
    return (configs, errors)

Wait, but in this approach, the config is a JSON object, so it's a dictionary. The overrides are also a dictionary, so that's okay.

But the problem's docstring says "sequence of configuration filenames", so each file is parsed as a separate config. The overrides are applied to each config individually.

This makes sense.

Now, the resolve_env part: expanding environment variables in the config's string values. Using os.path.expandvars which replaces $VAR and ${VAR} with the environment variable's value. So for each string value in the config, we do that.

But what if the config has nested structures (like lists or nested dicts)? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that the config is a flat dictionary. So, we can loop through each key in config and process the value.

So, in the code above, that's handled.

Now, the LogRecord creation: the parameters need to be filled. The lineno can be set to 0, as we don't have the exact line number of the error in the file. The name is 'config_loader' as a logger name.

Now, what about the exc_info? The problem's docstring doesn't mention including the exception info, so perhaps it's okay to set it to None. Or maybe include the exception's traceback. But since the code is catching the exception, maybe exc_info can be (type(e), e, e.__traceback__), but that's more complex. For simplicity, perhaps set exc_info to None.

Now, the code's structure seems okay.

Wait, in the case where both reading and parsing errors occur for a file, it's handled by first catching the read error, and if that's not the case, then parsing is attempted, which may throw an error. So, each error is logged once.

Testing this code:

Suppose a config file is not found: the first except block catches it, logs an error, and skips.

If the file exists but has invalid JSON, the second except block catches it, logs an error, skips.

Otherwise, process the config.

Now, the overrides are applied per config. The resolve_env is also per config.

So this should meet the requirements.

Now, what about the return value? The first element is a dict of filename to config, and the second is a list of LogRecord instances.

Yes, that's what the code returns.

Now, the code needs to import necessary modules: json, os, and logging.

Wait, the code uses logging.LogRecord, so need to import logging.

So, the code should start with:

import json
import os
import logging

Then, the function.

Now, putting all together:

Wait, in the code above, the line for the LogRecord's lineno is missing a value. The code has:

lineno=,  # not sure, maybe 0

Which is a syntax error. So need to fix that. So in both places where the LogRecord is created for reading error and parsing error, the lineno is set to 0.

So, in the first LogRecord for read error:

lineno=0,

Similarly in the parsing error:

lineno=0,

Now, the code should be correct.

Testing for the case where a file is read successfully but has a valid JSON, then the config is processed with resolve_env and overrides.

Thus, this should fulfill the problem's requirements.
