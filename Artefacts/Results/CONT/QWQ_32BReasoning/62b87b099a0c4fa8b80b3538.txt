Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_request_el that checks if the given object's class has both 'fill' and 'request' attributes. Let's see. The function should return True if the class has both attributes, else False.

First, I should get the class of the object. Since in Python, even instances have a __class__ attribute, so I can do obj.__class__ to get the class. Then, I need to check if 'fill' is in the class's __dict__ or maybe using hasattr? Wait, the question says "has the fill and request attributes". So maybe using hasattr is better because it checks the entire attribute chain, not just the class's own dictionary. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The problem says "the obj class has the fill and request attributes". So perhaps it's looking for whether the class (not the instance) has those attributes. So maybe checking the class's __dict__ directly?

Hmm. Let me think. For example, if the class has 'fill' as an attribute, but maybe it's inherited from a parent class. Does the problem consider that as having the attribute? The question isn't clear on that. The docstring says "has the fill and request attributes". The wording might mean that the class itself has them, not inherited. Because if it's inherited, then the class's __dict__ won't have them. Alternatively, using hasattr would check all the way up the MRO.

But the function's name is is_fill_request_el, maybe 'el' is 'element'? Not sure. The main point is to check if the class of the object has both attributes. So perhaps using hasattr on the class for 'fill' and 'request'?

Wait, the correct approach would be to check the class's own attributes. Let's think: if I have a class A that has 'fill' and a subclass B. Then B's class (type(B) is type) would not have 'fill' unless it's redefined. So maybe the function needs to check if the class of the object has those attributes as its own attributes, not via inheritance. So using the __dict__.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is okay with the attributes being present anywhere in the class hierarchy, so using hasattr is better.

Hmm. Let me read the docstring again: "Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes." The wording is a bit ambiguous. The function's name suggests it's a boolean check, so perhaps the simplest way is to use the hasattr function on the class.

Wait, but hasattr is called on the instance. Wait no, hasattr is a function that takes an object and a string. So if I want to check the class itself, I should do something like:

class_of_obj = obj.__class__
return hasattr(class_of_obj, 'fill') and hasattr(class_of_obj, 'request')

Yes, that makes sense. Because the question is about the class's attributes, not the instance's. So the function should check if the class (of obj) has the attributes 'fill' and 'request'.

So the code would be:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'request')

Alternatively, maybe using the dir() function or checking in the __dict__, but hasattr is more straightforward and accounts for descriptors or properties as well.

I think that's the correct approach here. Let's code that.
