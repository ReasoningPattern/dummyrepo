Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the method validate_hierarchy based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem. The method is supposed to validate the storage root hierarchy and return two numbers: the total objects checked and how many were valid.

First, the function parameters are self, validate_objects (a boolean defaulting to True), check_digests (also a boolean defaulting to True), and show_warnings (boolean, default False). The return values are num_objects and good_objects. 

Hmm, the method is part of a class, so I'll have to use self. The docstring says it returns num_objects and good_objects. So the code should calculate these two values. 

But how? Well, since the actual implementation details aren't given, maybe I need to structure the method in a way that loops through objects, checks their validity, and counts. But since it's a template, perhaps the code will have placeholders or example logic. 

Wait, the user said not to include explanations, just the code. So I need to write the code that fits the signature and the docstring. Let me think of a basic structure. 

The method would probably start by initializing counters. Then, perhaps iterate over some objects in the hierarchy. For each object, if validate_objects is True, check if it's valid. Maybe check digests if check_digests is True. If there are warnings, maybe log them if show_warnings is True. 

But without knowing the exact structure of the hierarchy or how the objects are stored, maybe the code will have a loop over some self.objects or similar, and for each, perform checks. 

Let me outline the code steps:

1. Initialize num_objects and good_objects to 0.
2. Iterate over each object in the hierarchy. Maybe something like for obj in self.get_objects() or similar.
3. Increment num_objects by 1 each time.
4. Check if the object is valid. Perhaps call a method like obj.is_valid() or some other validation function. 
5. If valid, increment good_objects.
6. If check_digests is True, also check the digest and maybe affect the validity.
7. If there are warnings, perhaps collect them and print if show_warnings is True.
8. Finally return num_objects and good_objects.

But since the actual data structures and methods aren't specified, maybe the code will have dummy implementations. However, the user wants the code based on the given signature and docstring, so perhaps the code will have a basic structure with dummy loops and return statements. 

Wait, maybe the code should return the two values as a tuple. So the function ends with return num_objects, good_objects.

Putting it all together, here's a possible code outline:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    #假设有某种方式遍历所有对象，比如一个列表
    for obj in self.objects:  #假设self.objects是存储的对象列表
        num_objects +=1
        if validate_objects:
            #这里进行验证，比如调用对象的validate方法
            if obj.validate(check_digests):
                good_objects +=1
        #处理警告，如果需要显示的话
        if show_warnings and obj.has_warnings():
            print(obj.get_warnings())
    return num_objects, good_objects

But wait, the parameters include check_digests, which might be part of the validation. Maybe the obj.validate method takes check_digests as an argument. Or perhaps there's a separate check for digests. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is structured to check each object's validity, considering the parameters. For example:

def validate_hierarchy(...):
    ...
    valid = True
    if validate_objects:
        valid = obj.is_valid()
        if check_digests:
            valid = valid and obj.check_digest()
    if valid:
        good_objects +=1
    ...

But without knowing the exact methods available, perhaps the code uses some placeholder functions. 

Another consideration: the method is part of a class, so maybe the hierarchy is stored in some way, like a tree or a list. The code might need to traverse the hierarchy, but again, without specifics, perhaps just loop over a list.

Alternatively, the code might have a dummy implementation, just returning 0,0, but that's probably not useful. The user expects a proper structure.

Wait, the docstring says "Returns: num_objects - number of objects checked, good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid". So the code must return those two integers.

So, the code must have variables to track these, loop through the objects, check each, and count.

Putting it all together, here's a possible code:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Iterate over all objects in the hierarchy
    for obj in self._get_all_objects():  #假设有一个方法获取所有对象
        num_objects += 1
        is_valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            # Perform validation, possibly involving digests
            if check_digests:
                is_valid = obj.validate_with_digest()
            else:
                is_valid = obj.validate()
        if is_valid:
            good_objects += 1
        # Handle warnings if needed
        if show_warnings and obj.has_warnings():
            print(f"Warning: {obj.warning_message}")
    return num_objects, good_objects

But the exact methods (like _get_all_objects, validate_with_digest, etc.) would depend on the class's implementation. Since the problem doesn't specify those details, the code must be generic. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is more minimal, just initializing the variables and returning them, but that's probably not useful. The user expects a plausible implementation.

Wait, maybe the code is structured to loop through some existing structure, like a list stored in the class. For example, self.objects, and for each object, check if it's valid. But since the exact structure isn't known, the code will have to make assumptions.

Another point: the parameters check_digests and validate_objects control whether to perform certain checks. So if validate_objects is False, maybe the method skips validating the object, but still counts it. Or perhaps it still counts but marks as valid? The doc says "number of objects checked that were valid", so if validate_objects is False, maybe they aren't checked, so their validity isn't determined. So in that case, those objects wouldn't be counted towards good_objects. 

Hmm, the logic here is a bit tricky. Let me think again. If validate_objects is True, then the code does the validation. If it's False, then perhaps the validation isn't done, so the objects are not checked, so their validity isn't known. Therefore, in that case, those objects wouldn't contribute to good_objects. 

Alternatively, maybe when validate_objects is False, the method still counts the objects but doesn't validate them, so good_objects would only count those where validation was done and passed. 

The code should probably only perform the validation steps if validate_objects is True. 

Putting this all together, here's the code I'll write, using some plausible method names and structure. The code will have to have a loop over objects, count them, check validity based on parameters, and return the counts.
