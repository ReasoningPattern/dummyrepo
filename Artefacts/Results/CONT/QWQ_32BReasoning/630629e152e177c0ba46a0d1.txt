Okay, I need to write a Python function called try_retrieve_webfinger_document that takes a handle string and returns an Optional string. The function should attempt to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document without raising exceptions if it fails. 

First, I remember that WebFinger works by making an HTTP GET request to the host's well-known endpoint. The handle is probably in the form of an account, like user@domain.tld. So the URL would be something like https://domain.tld/.well-known/webfinger with query parameters.

The parameters needed are 'resource' which is the handle, and maybe 'rel' set to 'self' as per some standards. Wait, the RFC7033 specifies that the resource parameter is required. So the query should include 'resource' equals the handle.

I'll need to parse the handle to get the domain. So split the handle at the @ to get the local part and domain. If there's no @, maybe it's a bad handle, but the function should just return None instead of erroring.

Then, construct the URL with the domain and the query parameters. Using the requests library to get the data. But since we can't raise exceptions, we need to handle possible exceptions like connection errors, timeouts, etc.

So steps:
1. Check if the handle has an @. If not, return None.
2. Split into local and domain parts.
3. Build the URL with the domain and the parameters.
4. Use requests.get with a reasonable timeout, maybe 5 seconds?
5. Check the response status code. If 200, return the content as text. Else, return None.
6. Catch any exceptions (like requests.exceptions.RequestException) and return None.

Wait, also need to URL encode the parameters. The resource value should be properly encoded. So using urllib.parse.quote or urlencode.

Wait, the parameters should be passed as a dictionary to the params argument in requests.get, which will handle the encoding. So the params would be {'resource': handle}.

Wait, the handle is already the full 'acct:user@domain' as per WebFinger specs? Or is the handle just the email-like address without 'acct:'? The RFC says that the resource is typically in the form acct:localpart@domain. So maybe the handle passed in is already in that format. Or maybe the function expects the handle to be in that form. For example, if the handle is "alice@example.com", then the resource would be "acct:alice@example.com".

Wait, the function's handle parameter is a string, so I think the handle should include the 'acct:' part. Or does the function need to add that? Let me check the RFC. 

Looking up RFC7033, it says that the resource attribute is an IRI, and common practice is to use "acct" scheme for user accounts. So the resource parameter should be "acct:"+handle. Wait, but the handle might already include that. Hmm, the function's parameter is called "handle", so perhaps the handle is in the form of user@domain, and we need to prepend "acct:" to it. So the code would take handle, check it has an @, then construct the resource as "acct:"+handle.

So, first, split the handle into local and domain. But first, check if there's an @ in the handle. If not, return None.

So code steps:

Split handle into parts. Let's see, handle.split('@', 1) will split into two parts. If the length is not 2, then invalid, return None.

Then, the domain is the second part. Then, construct the resource parameter as 'acct:'+handle.

Wait, the handle is the full string. So if the handle is "user@domain.com", then resource is "acct:user@domain.com".

So the URL is https://domain.com/.well-known/webfinger with params {'resource': 'acct:user@domain.com'}.

Then, send the request to that URL, with the params. 

Now, in code:

import requests
from typing import Optional
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        # Split the handle to get domain
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        local_part, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        
        # Construct the URL
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
        params = {'resource': f"acct:{handle}"}
        
        # Make the request with a timeout
        response = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=5)
        
        # Check status code
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.text
        else:
            return None
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return None
    except Exception:  # Catch any other exceptions, just in case
        return None

Wait, but what if the domain has a port or other parts? Like if the handle is user@domain:8080, then the URL would have the port. The urlparse might be needed to get the domain properly, but splitting on @ once is sufficient. Because the domain part after @ could include a port, but the URL would need to have that in the host part. So splitting on the first @ is correct here.

Also, what about HTTPS vs HTTP? The RFC might require using HTTPS. The function uses https in the URL, so that's correct.

But what if the server is using HTTP? Then the request would fail. But the function is supposed to not raise, so it would return None in that case.

Another point: the timeout is set to 5 seconds, which is reasonable to prevent hanging.

The try block wraps all the steps. Any exception from requests.get (like connection error, invalid domain, etc) would be caught and return None.

Testing edge cases: handle without @, which returns None. Handle with @ but invalid domain (like "user@invalid..com") would cause a DNS error, caught by the exception.

Wait, also, maybe the handle has multiple @, like "user@sub.domain@domain.com". The split would take the first @, so the domain would be "sub.domain@domain.com", which is probably not a valid domain. But the code would proceed, but the request would likely fail. Which is okay because the function doesn't raise.

Another possible issue: the handle could be something like "acct:user@domain.com", which includes the acct part. In that case, splitting on the @ would still work, but the resource would become "acct:acct:user@domain.com", which is incorrect. But according to the function's docstring, the handle is the input. So if the user passes "acct:user@domain.com@domain.com", that's their problem, and the function can't handle that. The function's responsibility is to process the handle as given. The RFC says that the resource is the acct URI, so perhaps the handle should be in the form "user@domain", and the code correctly adds the acct: prefix. So if the handle already has the acct: part, that's a problem. But the function's parameters are as per the user's input. The docstring says "Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document", so the code should follow the RFC's requirements.

Hmm, maybe the handle should be in the form "user@domain", and the function prepends "acct:" to form the resource parameter. So the code is correct in that.

Another possible error is if the domain is invalid, but that's handled by the exception.

So the code should be as above. Let me check again for possible errors.

Wait, what if the handle is "user@domain", but the domain is an IPv6 address? Like user@[2001:db8::1], but the split would not capture the brackets. Wait, in that case, the handle would have @ inside brackets, but the split would still split on the first @. So the domain would be "[2001:db8::1]" but the URL would be constructed as "https://[2001:db8::1]/...", which is correct. So the code is okay there.

Another thing: the function returns the response.text, which is the document as a string. The RFC requires it to be in JSON or XML, but the function doesn't validate that, just returns the content if the status is 200.

Yes, that's correct per the docstring's requirement.

So the code should be as written above. Let me make sure all exceptions are caught. The requests.get can raise various exceptions like ConnectionError, Timeout, etc., which are all subclasses of RequestException. So catching that is sufficient. The other exceptions (like in splitting, but splitting on @ can't really throw an exception except maybe for some Unicode issues, but in Python, split is safe. So the only other exceptions would be in the case of, say, the handle being None, but then splitting would throw a TypeError. Which would be caught by the general except clause. But better to have the first check: if '@' not in handle, return None. So that case is handled.

Thus the code should be correct.
