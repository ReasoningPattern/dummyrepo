Okay, I need to write a Python function called _shuffled that takes a sequence of strings and returns a shuffled list. The docstring says to use a fixed random seed, so the shuffling must be deterministic.

First, I remember that the random module's shuffle function can be used, but since we need a fixed seed, we should set the seed each time before shuffling. Wait, but the problem says "FIXED_RANDOM_SEED" as a given. So maybe the seed is a constant here. The user didn't specify the actual value, but perhaps in the code, we just pick a specific seed, like 42, and use that every time.

Wait, the function's parameters don't include a seed. The docstring mentions "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", but the parameters of the function don't have a seed parameter. Hmm, maybe the seed is a constant inside the function. Since the problem says "given" but the parameters don't include it, perhaps the seed is hard-coded. So I can choose any fixed number, like 42, and use that as the seed each time.

So the steps are:

1. Convert the input sequence to a list because the random.shuffle function modifies the list in place. Alternatively, we can make a copy first.

2. Set the random seed using random.seed(FIXED_SEED), where FIXED_SEED is a constant like 42.

3. Shuffle the list.

4. Return the shuffled list.

Wait, but how to ensure that each call with the same input gives the same result? By setting the seed each time before shuffling. That way, the shuffling is reproducible.

So here's the plan:

- Make a copy of the input sequence as a list. Because the original might be a tuple or another non-list sequence.

- Set the seed to the fixed value. Let's pick 123 or 42. Let's just use 42 as an example unless specified otherwise. The problem didn't give the actual seed, so perhaps the user expects us to use any fixed value, but maybe the question expects that the seed is a specific constant? Since the problem states "FIXED_RANDOM_SEED" but didn't specify, perhaps the code should have a constant named FIXED_RANDOM_SEED inside the function. Like:

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

Then, inside the function:

random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)

But where to define that constant? Maybe inside the function, or outside? Well, the function is supposed to be self-contained except for the parameters given. Alternatively, perhaps the seed is a module-level constant. Since the problem didn't specify, I can choose to define it inside the function, but maybe better to have a constant outside. Hmm, but the function's code is to be written, so I can define the seed inside the function's code.

Alternatively, perhaps the seed is a global variable. But since the problem didn't specify, I'll just pick a number and use it.

Wait, but the problem says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". The wording suggests that the seed is provided, but perhaps in the problem's context, the seed is a constant. Since the function signature doesn't include it, maybe the seed is a fixed value in the code. Let's just choose 42 as the seed.

So the steps in code:

Import necessary modules. The function's parameter is a Sequence[str], so we need to import Sequence from typing. Wait, but the function's code would need to import random. So the code will start with import random.

Wait, but the user's code may not have those imports. Since the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, the code must be self-contained. So I need to include the necessary imports.

Wait, the function is supposed to be part of the code. So the code should include the import statements. Let's see:

The function is named _shuffled and takes a Sequence[str]. The return is a list of strings. So the code would need to import the Sequence type from typing. However, sometimes in Python, people might omit the import if they are using a string-based annotation, but since the function's signature uses Sequence, the code must have that imported.

Therefore, the code should start with:

from typing import Sequence
import random

Then, the function:

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    ... 

Now, inside the function:

We need to create a list from the input sequence because the original might be immutable. So:

shuffled_list = list(seq)

Then, set the seed. Let's say the fixed seed is 42.

random.seed(42)

Wait, but if we set the seed each time before shuffling, then the same input will be shuffled the same way every time. That's correct for a fixed seed.

Then, shuffle the list:

random.shuffle(shuffled_list)

Then return it.

Putting it all together:

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    from typing import Sequence
    import random  # Wait, no, the imports can't be inside the function. Oh right, the code must have the imports outside.

Wait, I made a mistake here. The imports should be at the top, not inside the function. So the correct code structure would have the imports outside. So the code should start with the from typing import Sequence and import random.

Wait, but in the code that the user is to generate, the function must be written with the correct imports. So the code would look like:

from typing import Sequence
import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(42)  # Using 42 as the fixed seed
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result

Wait, but the problem mentions "FIXED_RANDOM_SEED" in the docstring, so perhaps the code should have a named constant for the seed. Like:

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

Then in the function:

random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)

But then, where to define that constant? It could be a global variable. So adding that:

from typing import Sequence
import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    shuffled_list = list(seq)
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_list)
    return shuffled_list

This way, the seed is a constant, which is better for readability and adherence to the problem's mention of "FIXED_RANDOM_SEED".

However, the problem might not require the constant to be named, but just to use a fixed number. But using a named constant makes the code clearer. So I think that's better.

Therefore, the code should include the constant. So the code would start with the imports, then the constant, then the function.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the seed is a certain value, but since it's not specified, using 42 is a common choice.

Therefore, the code would be as above.

Wait, but in the function's docstring, the phrase "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED" might imply that the seed is provided as an argument, but since it's not in the parameters, perhaps the seed is a module-level variable. The code as written uses a constant in the same module, which is correct.

So the code should be:

from typing import Sequence
import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    shuffled_list = list(seq)
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_list)
    return shuffled_list

Wait, but the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The user's function signature is given as def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str], so the code must include that. The imports are necessary.

However, in some cases, maybe the code is supposed to have the seed inside the function. Alternatively, perhaps the seed is part of the function's code. Let me check again.

The problem's instruction says: "Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED".

The wording "given" might be confusing because the seed isn't an argument. So the seed is fixed in the code, so using a constant like 42 is correct.

Therefore, the code as above is correct.

But let me think: when we call random.seed each time before shuffling, that's necessary because otherwise, if the function is called multiple times, the seed would have been set only once, and the subsequent calls would not reset the seed, leading to different results. By setting the seed each time before shuffling, the shuffle will be the same every time the function is called with the same input. That's correct.

Yes, so the code is correct.

Now, the user wants the code in Python, without any markdown. Wait, the user says:

"Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, perhaps they mean to put the code in a code block, like with triple backticks? Or maybe they just want the code as is, without any explanation. Wait, the user's exact instruction after the thinking process is to output the code only, in Python markdown format. So probably, the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with the Python language specified.

Wait, the initial instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be formatted as a code block. Like:

```python
# code here
```

So putting all together, the final code would be enclosed in triple backticks with the python language tag.

Putting it all together:

The code with the imports, the constant, and the function, enclosed in the markdown code block.

Wait, but in the problem's function signature, the function is named _shuffled, so that's correct.

So the code would be:

```python
from typing import Sequence
import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    shuffled_list = list(seq)
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_list)
    return shuffled_list
```

That should be the correct code. Let me double-check.

Yes, the function converts the input to a list, seeds the random number generator with the fixed seed, shuffles the list, and returns it. The seed is fixed, so the same input will always produce the same shuffled output. The imports are properly included. The constant is named FIXED_RANDOM_SEED as per the docstring's mention.

Therefore, this code should be correct.
