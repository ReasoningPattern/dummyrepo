Okay, I need to write a Python decorator called cachedmethod based on the given signature and docstring. Let's see. The function takes cache, key (which defaults to hashkey), and lock (optional). The decorator should check if the result is already in the cache using the key, and if so, return it. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and then return it. 

Wait, but how does the key work here? The key parameter is probably a function that generates the cache key from the function's arguments. Oh right, the default is hashkey, which I assume is a function that can take the arguments and return a hashable key. 

The decorator needs to wrap a method. So when the decorated method is called, first we generate the key using the key function, then check the cache. If the key is present, return the cached value. If not, call the method, store the result in the cache with that key, and return it. 

But since it's a method, the first argument is self. Wait, but the key function might need to take into account the instance? Or maybe the key function is supposed to handle all the arguments, including self. Hmm, the problem says key=hashkey, so perhaps hashkey is a function that can take *args and **kwargs and create a key. 

So the decorator structure would be something like this:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # generate the key using key function
            k = key(*args, **kwargs)
            # check cache with possible lock
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if k in cache:
                        return cache[k]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the key function might need to know the function being decorated. Or does the key function just take the arguments passed to the method? Because the key is generated based on the arguments of the function call. 

Wait the function's signature is that the decorator is created with cache, key, and lock. The key is a function that can generate the key for the function's arguments. So when the wrapper is called, it uses key(*args, **kwargs) to get the key. 

But what about the function's own name or the instance? For methods, the first argument is self. So the key function must account for that. Since the key is passed as a parameter, the user of the decorator can choose how to generate the key. So the code above should work, assuming that the key function can handle all the args and kwargs passed to the method. 

Wait, but in the code above, the key is generated as key(*args, **kwargs). That's correct. 

Now, about the lock. If a lock is provided, we need to use it to synchronize access to the cache. So when multiple threads are accessing, they check the cache under the lock. 

So the code structure would have the lock managed via a with statement if lock is provided. 

Wait, but the lock parameter could be any lock object that supports the context manager protocol. So in the code, if lock is not None, we use it. 

Putting it all together. The outer function (cachedmethod) returns the decorator (the function that takes func), which returns the wrapper. 

Wait, but the key function might need to have access to the function's name or other attributes? Not sure. The problem states that the key defaults to hashkey, so perhaps hashkey is a function that can take the arguments and return a suitable key. 

So the code I wrote earlier should work. Let me check again. 

Wait, in the case without a lock, the check and store might not be atomic. So if two threads check at the same time, both might compute the result. But the lock would prevent that. 

The user can pass a lock if they want to handle concurrency. 

So the code seems okay. 

Wait, but the key could also return a tuple including the function name or something? Not sure, but the parameters are as given. 

Hmm, maybe the key function should take the function, args, and kwargs? But according to the problem's parameters, the key is passed as a parameter to the cachedmethod, and when creating the decorator, the key is used with the args and kwargs of the function call. 

I think the code I have is correct. Let me write it properly. Also, the key might need to be a function that takes the same arguments as the decorated function. So yes, the key is called with *args and **kwargs. 

Wait, but in the code, the key is passed as an argument to the cachedmethod, so when the decorator is created, the key is fixed. 

Yes, that's right. 

So the final code would look like that. Let me make sure to structure it properly with the nested functions. 

Wait, the outer function (cachedmethod) takes cache, key, lock. Then returns the decorator function, which takes the function (func) and returns the wrapper. 

Yes. 

So the code would be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            k = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if k in cache:
                        return cache[k]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but in the case without a lock, there's a possible race condition where two threads could compute the result. But that's up to the user to provide a lock if needed. 

Also, the key function must be provided, or use the default. 

Wait, but what if the key function is not hashable? The code assumes that the key returns a hashable type, which is required for the cache (since it's a dictionary). 

But that's the responsibility of the key function. 

Yes, so this should be okay. 

Hmm, I think that's the code. Let me check again. Oh, in the case of the lock, when you acquire it, you check if the key is present. If not, compute the result, store it, then return. That's correct. 

Yes, that's the standard pattern for a cache with a lock. 

I think this should work. So the code is as above.
