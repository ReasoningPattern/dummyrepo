Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the pretty method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The function is called pretty and is an instance method, since it has self as the first parameter. It takes two optional parameters: indent, which defaults to 0, and debug, a boolean that defaults to False. The docstring provides some instructions on how to format the representation.

Looking at the docstring's example, it seems the goal is to return a string that represents the object in a pretty-printed format, possibly with indentation. The example shows that if self.obj is a string, it should be wrapped in single quotes and then in f-strings. Otherwise, it uses repr(self.obj). Then, the class name is included along with some debug details and the formatted obj.

Wait, the docstring's first line after the triple quotes has some code-like lines. Let me parse that. The line "obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)" seems to be a code snippet that determines how to represent self.obj. So, if self.obj is a string, enclose it in single quotes, else use repr(). Then, the return line is (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})".

Hmm, but there's a part where debug_details is mentioned but not defined in the provided lines. Maybe that's a mistake in the docstring? The user might have intended that debug_details is part of the f-string, but perhaps in the actual code, it's supposed to include some debug information based on the debug flag. Wait, the problem says to generate code based on the docstring. Let me check again.

The docstring's example lines show that the return is built using f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})", but where does debug_details come from? The user might have intended that when debug is True, some additional details are included. Maybe the debug_details variable is a string that, when debug is True, adds some extra info like the object's ID or other attributes. Since the problem mentions that the code should be generated based on the docstring, perhaps I need to infer that part.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a placeholder. Let me re-examine the problem. The user provided the docstring as:

"""
Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
"""

Wait, the first line after the docstring's description seems to be code. The lines after "Return a pretty..." are code examples? Or are they part of the docstring's explanation? The way it's written, the code lines are part of the docstring's content, but perhaps the user is indicating that the code inside the docstring is the logic to implement. That is, the docstring's content is the algorithm to use, even though that's non-standard.

So, the code inside the docstring is part of the instructions. Let me parse that:

First line after the return statement's description is:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)

Then the return line is:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So, the code for the method should be structured as follows:

Inside the method, first compute obj as per that line. Then build the return string.

But the debug_details variable isn't defined in the given lines. That's a problem. Maybe the user made a typo, and the debug_details is supposed to be something else. Let me think again. Perhaps the debug parameter is supposed to influence what's included in the output. For instance, if debug is True, maybe include additional info like the object's id or other attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a mistake, and the correct code is to include some debug info. Let me see the return line again. The part inside the class name's parentheses is {debug_details}{obj}. So, perhaps when debug is True, debug_details is something like 'debug: ... , ' and when it's False, it's an empty string. For example, maybe debug_details is an f-string that includes other attributes when in debug mode.

Wait, maybe the code in the docstring is supposed to be the code for the method. So the actual code of the method is:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But then where is debug_details defined? That variable isn't mentioned elsewhere. That suggests there's a mistake in the docstring. Maybe the user intended that the debug parameter is used to include some debug info. For instance, perhaps debug_details is a string that is empty unless debug is True, in which case it adds some debug info.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the line should have something like:

if debug:
    debug_details = f"debug_info, {obj}"
else:
    debug_details = ""

But that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a placeholder for the debug part. Maybe the correct code is to have debug_details be an empty string unless debug is True, in which case it includes some additional info. Since the problem says to generate the code based on the docstring, perhaps I need to proceed as follows:

The first line inside the method is the assignment to obj as per the code in the docstring. Then, the return line uses debug_details, but since that variable isn't defined, perhaps the user intended that debug_details is an empty string when not in debug mode, and something else when in debug mode. Since the debug parameter is present, perhaps the code should include some debug information only when debug is True. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a mistake, and the code should instead include some variable or logic. Let me think again. The return line in the docstring shows that inside the class name's parentheses, there's {debug_details}{obj}. So maybe the debug_details is a string that's empty unless some condition is met, but given the parameters, perhaps when debug is True, it adds something. Since the problem says to generate the code based on the docstring, perhaps the code is exactly as written in the docstring, except that the lines after the first sentence are part of the code block.

Wait, the docstring's content is structured as a paragraph, but the code lines are part of the docstring's content. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the user intended that the code inside the docstring is the code to be written. So the function's body should be exactly those lines. Let me check again:

The docstring says:

Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the lines after the first sentence are the code. Therefore, the code for the method would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But this would have an error because debug_details is not defined. That suggests that there's a mistake in the docstring. Since the user provided that as the docstring, perhaps they intended that debug_details is a variable that's part of the code. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the correct code should have something else. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the user intended that the debug_details is a string that is empty unless the debug flag is set. For instance, maybe the code should have:

if debug:
    debug_details = f"debug: {self.debug_info}, "
else:
    debug_details = ""

But that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is part of the code as written but the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the line in the docstring is missing a part where debug_details is constructed based on the debug parameter.

Alternatively, maybe the code in the docstring is written as a single line, and the debug_details is actually supposed to be an empty string. Let me see the return line again. The return line in the docstring has f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})". So, if debug_details is an empty string, then it would just have the obj. But the debug parameter is present, so perhaps the debug_details is constructed conditionally based on that.

Wait, perhaps the code is supposed to include some debug information when debug is True, like the object's id or other attributes. Since the problem statement doesn't specify, maybe the code should just proceed with what's in the docstring, even if there's an undefined variable. But that would result in a NameError. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the user made a typo and the debug_details is supposed to be the debug parameter. Wait, maybe it's a typo and the correct variable is something else. For instance, maybe the code should have:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

But that would omit the debug_details. Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a mistake and the correct code is to include the debug parameter in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that when debug is True, additional details are included, like the object's id, so debug_details would be something like (f"id={id(self)}, " if debug else ""). 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a variable that's part of the class, but since the problem doesn't mention it, that's unlikely.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code in the docstring is the correct code to implement, except that there's a mistake in the variable name. Let me see again. The line has {debug_details}{obj}, but maybe the variable is called debug_info or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that debug_details is empty unless some condition, but since the variable isn't defined, that's impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the line is missing an assignment. Perhaps the code should have:

debug_details = "DEBUG: " if debug else ""
then the return would include that. But that's adding code not mentioned in the docstring.

Wait, looking back at the problem's exact wording:

The user says, "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So the code must be written as per the docstring's content. The docstring's content includes the lines:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) 

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the code inside the method should be exactly those two lines. But since debug_details is undefined, that would cause a NameError. Therefore, this suggests that there's a mistake in the docstring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line is written as a single line, and the debug_details is actually a typo. For example, maybe the user intended that the debug parameter is used, so perhaps the code should have:

if debug:
    debug_details = f"DEBUG: {some_info}, "
else:
    debug_details = ""

But since the problem's docstring doesn't include that, perhaps the correct code is to proceed as per the given lines, but the variable is a typo. Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a mistake and should be replaced with an empty string. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the debug_details is the empty string, and the line should be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

But then why is debug_details in the code?

Alternatively, maybe the code in the docstring is written with a missing part. Like, perhaps the line is missing an assignment for debug_details based on the debug flag. For instance, perhaps the code should have:

debug_details = f", debug={debug}" if debug else ""

But since that's not in the docstring's provided code, I can't assume that.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the debug_details is a mistake and should be omitted. So the correct code is:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

But then the debug parameter isn't used, which is possible but not ideal.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is supposed to be a string that includes other attributes when debug is True. For example, if the class has other attributes like 'name' or 'value', then when debug is True, those are included. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code should proceed as per the docstring, even with the undefined variable. But that would be incorrect.

Hmm. Given the problem's instructions, I must generate the code exactly as per the given docstring. The code in the docstring's lines are:

Inside the method:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Therefore, even though debug_details is undefined, that's what's in the docstring. But that would cause an error. So perhaps the user made a typo and the variable should be something else, like 'obj' or 'debug'?

Wait, maybe the line is supposed to have {debug_details}{obj}, but perhaps the code should have the debug_details as an empty string when not in debug mode. Since the debug parameter is present, maybe the code should construct debug_details based on that. For instance:

debug_details = f"debug={debug}, " if debug else ""

But again, that's adding code not present in the docstring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a mistake and should be replaced with an empty string. So the return line should be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

But then why is the debug parameter there? Maybe the debug is supposed to affect how the obj is formatted. For example, when debug is True, include more details. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the debug_details is part of the code and should be an empty string unless some condition. Maybe in the method, before the return, there's an assignment like:

debug_details = f"DEBUG: {something}, " if debug else ""

But that's not in the provided lines. 

Given the problem's instructions, I have to follow the docstring exactly. The code in the docstring includes the line with debug_details, so I have to include that. But that variable isn't defined in the code lines provided. Therefore, this must be an error in the docstring, but I have to proceed as per the user's instruction. 

Wait, maybe the line is written as a single line, and the debug_details is actually a typo. For example, perhaps it's supposed to be 'debug and ...' or something else. Alternatively, maybe the code in the docstring is written with a missing part. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a typo and should be replaced with something else. Like, maybe the code should have:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

and the debug parameter is not used, but that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a variable that's part of the instance. Like, self.debug_details, but that's not mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the code in the docstring is correct, and I should write it as is, but the variable is supposed to be empty. Maybe the user made a mistake and the line should have empty string instead of debug_details. Like:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that's empty unless in debug mode, but the code to generate it is missing. Since the problem says to generate the code based on the docstring, perhaps I should proceed to write the code as per the docstring's code lines, even if there's an error, but the user expects that.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a typo and should be 'debug and ...' but I can't see.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the debug_details is a variable that is part of the class. For example, maybe the class has a debug_details attribute, but the problem doesn't mention that. 

Given that the user is asking to generate the code based on the provided docstring, even if it has an error, perhaps I should just write the code as per the docstring's lines, even if it has an undefined variable. But that would be incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the debug_details is a mistake and should be omitted. So the correct code is:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

That's possible. The debug parameter isn't used here, but maybe that's okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a variable that is constructed using the debug flag. Let me think again. The user's docstring's return line includes {debug_details}{obj}, so maybe debug_details is a string that's empty unless in debug mode, where it adds some info. For example:

debug_details = f"debug={debug}, " if debug else ""

But adding that line would be necessary. Since that's not in the docstring's code lines, but perhaps the user expects that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code in the docstring is missing an assignment for debug_details, but the user wants us to include that based on the debug parameter. 

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code as per the docstring's code lines, even if it has an undefined variable, because the problem states to generate the code based on the given docstring. However, that would result in an error. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem's exact wording.

The problem says:

The docstring includes:

Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the first line after the return statement's description is the assignment to obj. The next line is the return statement. Therefore, the method's code is exactly those two lines. Therefore, the code would have an error because debug_details is not defined. 

Hmm. This is a problem. Perhaps the user made a typo and the variable name is different. Like maybe it's supposed to be 'obj' instead of 'debug_details'? But then the code would be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

Which would make sense, using the obj variable that was just computed. That would be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a typo and should be omitted. So the code is:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

In that case, the debug parameter is not used, but that's possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is supposed to be the debug parameter's value. Like, if debug is True, then include something. For example, if debug is True, then add some debug info. But since the code in the docstring doesn't show that, perhaps the correct code is to have:

debug_details = f"DEBUG: {something}, " if debug else ""

But again, without knowing what 'something' is, I can't proceed. 

Given the problem's instructions, perhaps the best approach is to write the code exactly as per the docstring's code lines, even if it has an undefined variable. However, that would result in an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a mistake and the correct line should be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

In that case, the code would work, and the debug parameter is not used. But why include it then? 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug parameter is used to include more details. For example, if debug is True, then include the object's id. So the code would have:

if debug:
    debug_details = f"id={id(self)}, "
else:
    debug_details = ""

But then the code would need that assignment before the return line. 

Given that the docstring's code lines don't include that, but the problem says to generate the code based on the docstring, I'm stuck. 

Perhaps the user intended that the debug_details is an empty string, and the line is a typo. So the correct code is as follows:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

This way, the debug parameter is unused, but the code is valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a placeholder for the debug parameter's value. Like, if debug is True, then add something, but since the code doesn't show that, I can't tell. 

Given that the problem requires to output the code exactly based on the docstring's content, even if it has an error, I'll proceed with the code as per the docstring's lines. However, since that would have an undefined variable, perhaps I should assume that the debug_details is a typo and the correct variable is empty string. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a mistake and the correct code uses the debug parameter somehow. For example, if debug is True, then include more details. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a mistake and should be replaced with an empty string. 

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code as per the docstring's code lines, even if it has an error. But that would be incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should assume that the debug_details is supposed to be the empty string, and the code should omit it. 

So the final code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

This way, the debug parameter is unused, but the code is valid. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring and the return line should be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

Thus, the code is as above. 

I think this is the best approach given the problem's constraints. Even though the debug parameter isn't used, the code is valid and follows the docstring's instructions except for the undefined variable. 

Therefore, I'll write the code accordingly.
