Okay, I need to write the Python function _replace_register based on the given docstring. Let me read the docstring again. The function should replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and then delete flow_params[register_value]. 

Hmm, so the parameters are flow_params, which is probably a list or a dictionary? Wait, the indices are called register_number and register_value. Oh, maybe flow_params is a list, since they're using numerical indices. Because in a dictionary, the keys could be any hashable type, but here the parameters are numbers. So assuming flow_params is a list.

Wait, but lists in Python are zero-based, so if the register numbers are valid indices, that's okay. So the task is to take the value at position register_value in flow_params, and set the element at register_number to that value. Then delete the element at register_value. 

Wait, but when you delete an element from a list, the indices of the elements after it will change. So the order of operations matters here. Let me think. Let's say the list is [a, b, c, d]. Suppose register_number is 1 and register_value is 3. So first, set flow_params[1] = flow_params[3], so the list becomes [a, d, c, d]. Then delete flow_params[3]. Wait, but after deletion, the list would become [a, d, c]. But the original indices might have been important. Wait, but the problem says to replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with the value from register_value, then delete the register_value entry. 

Wait, perhaps the order is important. Suppose the register_number and register_value are indices. Let's say the list is [0,1,2,3]. If register_number is 0 and register_value is 2. Then first, set flow_params[0] = flow_params[2], so list becomes [2,1,2,3]. Then delete the element at index 2 (since register_value is 2). Wait, but when you delete an element from a list, the indices after that position shift. So if the original indices were 0,1,2,3, deleting index 2 would leave the list as [2,1,3]. Wait, but the register_value might be the key here. 

Wait, the problem is, when you delete the element at register_value, the other elements after that index will shift left. But since we have already copied the value from that index to register_number, which might be before or after the register_value's position, that could affect the result. 

Wait, but the problem says to first replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with the value from flow_params[register_value], then delete the register_value's entry. So the steps are:

1. flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]

2. del flow_params[register_value]

But the problem is, when deleting, the indices after the deleted index will shift. So if the register_number is higher than register_value, after deletion, the original register_number's index might no longer exist. Wait, but the order of the indices is important here. Let me think of an example.

Suppose the list is [a, b, c, d], and register_number is 2, register_value is 1. 

Step 1: set flow_params[2] = flow_params[1], so the list becomes [a, b, b, d].

Step 2: delete the element at index 1. The list becomes [a, b, d]. 

Wait, but the original register_number (2) was after the register_value (1). After deleting index 1, the element that was at index 2 (the b) is now at index 1. So the value at the original register_number (2) would now be gone. Wait, but in step 1, we had set the value at register_number (2) to the value from 1 (b). Then when we delete index 1, the list becomes [a, b, d]. So the original index 2 (the third element) was d, but after step 1, it became b, and after deletion, the third element (index 2) is d. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the original indices. 

Alternatively, maybe the order of operations is correct as long as we first do the assignment, then delete. Because the delete is on the original register_value's index. But when the delete occurs, the list's elements after that index shift. So the register_number's index must be less than the register_value's index to avoid issues? Or perhaps not, because when you delete, the index is based on the current list. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the register_number and register_value are valid indices before any changes. So the steps are safe as long as you first copy the value, then delete. 

Therefore, the code would be straightforward. 

Wait, but in Python, when you delete an element from a list using del, the elements after that position shift left. So, for example, if the list is [0,1,2,3], and we set index 3 to 3 (no change), then delete index 3, the list becomes [0,1,2]. 

But in the case where the register_number is higher than register_value, like in the first example where register_number is 3 and register_value is 1, then after setting flow_params[3] to flow_params[1] (which is 1), the list becomes [0,1,2,1]. Then deleting index 1 would result in [0,2,1]. So the original register_number (3) was beyond the length after deletion? Wait, no. Let's see:

Original list length is 4. After deleting index 1 (which is 1), the new list length is 3. The original index 3 was the fourth element (index 3), but after deleting index 1, the new list is [0,2,1] (since after deleting index 1, the elements after shift left by one). Wait, no, let's track step by step:

Original list: [0,1,2,3]

Set flow_params[3] = flow_params[1] (so flow_params[3] becomes 1). Now list is [0,1,2,1].

Now, delete the element at index 1 (the second element). The list becomes [0,2,1]. 

The original register_number was 3 (the fourth element), which in the original list was index 3. After deletion, the length is 3, so the last element is index 2. But since we had already done the assignment, the value at index 3 (before deletion) was part of the list before the deletion. 

So the code should work as intended, because when we do the assignment first, the value is taken from the original register_value's index, and then the deletion is done on that original index, so the order is correct. 

Therefore, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

Wait, but in Python, lists are mutable, so this should work. 

Wait, but what if the register_number is the same as the register_value? Then, we would set flow_params[reg_num] to itself, then delete it. But that would cause issues. For example, if the list is [a, b], and both registers are 0 and 0. Then flow_params[0] is set to flow_params[0], which is same. Then delete index 0, so the list becomes empty. But maybe the function is designed to handle that. 

The problem statement says to replace the value and delete the register_value. So even if they are the same, it should proceed. 

Therefore, the code should be as above. 

Wait, but the parameters are called register_number and register_value. Wait, perhaps the register_value is an index (number), but maybe the function is using the value stored in flow_params[register_value] as the new value. Wait, the docstring says "Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value]". So the new value is the value stored at register_value's index. Then, delete the entry at register_value's index. 

Yes, so the code is correct as written. 

Wait, but in the code, after setting flow_params[register_number], then deleting the element at register_value. So the key is that the register_number is the target index, and the value comes from the source index (register_value). Then the source is removed. 

Yes, that's correct. 

So the code is as above. Let me check again. 

Wait, what if the register_value is larger than register_number? Like, suppose the list is [a, b, c], and register_number is 0, register_value is 2. Then:

Set flow_params[0] = flow_params[2] (so a becomes c). The list becomes [c, b, c].

Then delete index 2. The list becomes [c, b]. 

So the original register_number (0) is fine, and the value from index 2 was taken before deletion. 

Yes, so that works. 

Another test case: suppose the list is [x, y, z], register_number is 1, register_value is 0. 

Set flow_params[1] to flow_params[0] (so y becomes x). Now list is [x, x, z]. 

Then delete index 0. The list becomes [x, z]. 

The original register_number (1) was after the deleted index (0), so its position shifts. But since we already copied the value from the 0th element, the new element at index 1 (after deletion) is z. Wait, no. Let me see:

Original list after assignment: [x, x, z]

After deleting index 0 (the first x), the list becomes [x, z]. 

The original register_number was 1, but after deletion, the index 1 is now z. 

Wait, but the value at register_number (1) was set before deletion. The problem is, after deleting the element at 0, the element that was at index 1 (x) moves to index 0. So the value at the original register_number (1) is now part of the shifted elements. 

Hmm, but the function's purpose is to replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with the value from register_value, and delete the register_value's entry. So in this example, the register_number is 1, and after the assignment, it's x. Then deleting the element at 0 (the first x) leaves the list as [x (from index1), z]. 

Wait, the new list after deletion is [x, z], so the value at the new index 1 is z, but the original register_number (1) now refers to the new index 0. 

But the problem statement says to replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with the value from the other index. So regardless of the subsequent deletions, the assignment is done first. 

The user probably expects that after the function call, the value at register_number (original index) is set to the value from register_value (original index), and then the register_value entry is removed. 

Therefore, the code is correct as written. 

Thus, the function should be written as:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

Yes, that's the code.
