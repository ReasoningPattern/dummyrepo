Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's required.

The function is called protocol_handlers and is a class method. It should return a dictionary of Bolt protocol handlers, keyed by version tuples. If a protocol_version is provided, the dictionary should contain either zero or one items based on whether that version is supported. If no version is given, return all available versions. Also, it should raise a TypeError if the protocol_version isn't a tuple.

Hmm, the function is part of a class, so maybe the handlers are stored as class attributes? The docstring mentions "supported protocol versions," so perhaps there's a class-level dictionary that maps version tuples to handler classes. The function's job is to filter that based on the input.

First, I need to think about how the available handlers are stored. Let's assume there's a class variable like _HANDLERS which is a dictionary with version tuples as keys. The function will access this.

The function signature has cls as the first parameter, so it's a class method. So inside the function, I can reference cls._HANDLERS or something similar. Wait, but the code example might need to have a placeholder for that. Since the user didn't specify the actual handlers, perhaps the code will have a sample or just refer to a class variable.

The steps for the function:

1. Check if protocol_version is provided. If it is, ensure it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError.

Wait, the parameters: protocol_version is an optional argument. So in the code, first, if protocol_version is not None, then check if it's a tuple. Because the doc says to raise TypeError if it's not passed as a tuple.

So, inside the function:

if protocol_version is not None:
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError

Then, proceed to get the handlers. If protocol_version is given, then create a new dict that includes only that version if it exists in the handlers. Otherwise, return all.

Wait, the function's return is a dict of version to handler. So, when protocol_version is provided, the returned dict is either {version: handler} or empty.

Wait, the doc says "either zero or one items, depending on whether that version is supported". So if the version is in the handlers, then the dict has that one entry, else empty.

Putting it all together:

First, get all the handlers from the class. Let's say the class has a class-level dictionary called HANDLERS. So:

handlers = getattr(cls, 'HANDLERS', {})  # but maybe it's assumed to exist?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to have that HANDLERS as a class attribute. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the code will just use a class variable named something like _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS. Let me think of standard ways. Maybe in the code, the function will check cls._HANDLERS or similar.

Wait, the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details of where the handlers are stored. So the code must refer to some existing class variable. Since the function is part of the class, perhaps the handlers are stored in a class-level dictionary. The code will have to reference that.

Assuming that the class has a class variable called _HANDLERS which is a dictionary mapping version tuples to handler classes. So inside the method:

if protocol_version is not None:
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS.get(protocol_version, None)} if protocol_version in cls._HANDLERS else {}
Wait, no. Because if the version is not present, then the get would return None, but the key would not be in the dictionary, so the value would be None, but we need to return an empty dict in that case. Alternatively, perhaps the code should check if the version is in the handlers, and if so, return a dict with that key, else empty.

Alternatively, the code can do:

if protocol_version is not None:
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError(...)
    return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS[protocol_version]} if protocol_version in cls._HANDLERS else {}
else:
    return cls._HANDLERS.copy()  # to avoid returning the actual dict reference?

Wait, but the return is supposed to be a dictionary. So when a version is given, if it's in the handlers, return a new dict with just that key-value pair. Otherwise, return an empty dict.

Wait, no. The doc says "either zero or one items". So if the version is supported (i.e., present in the handlers), then the dict has one item. Else, zero. So:

if protocol_version is not None:
    if not isinstance(...):
        raise...
    if protocol_version in cls._HANDLERS:
        return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS[protocol_version]}
    else:
        return {}
else:
    return dict(cls._HANDLERS)  # or a copy?

Alternatively, maybe just return a copy so that the original isn't modified.

Now, handling the case when protocol_version is not a tuple. So the function must check that. The error message in the doc says to raise a TypeError if the protocol version is not passed as a tuple. So if protocol_version is provided and is not a tuple, then raise TypeError.

So code steps:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    # proceed

Now, the actual handlers. Since the code is supposed to be part of a class that has these handlers stored, perhaps in a class variable like _HANDLERS. So the code will reference that.

Putting it all together:

The code would look like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    [docstring as given]
    """
    handlers = cls._HANDLERS  # assuming this is a class-level dict
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
        handler = handlers.get(protocol_version)
        if handler:
            return {protocol_version: handler}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        return dict(handlers)  # returns a copy

Wait, but in the code, if the protocol_version is given, then we check if it's in the handlers. If so, return a dict with that one entry. Otherwise, return empty dict.

Alternatively, using a dictionary comprehension or just creating a new dict. The code above does that.

But wait, in the code, the HANDLERS is a class variable. So the function must have access to that. The user hasn't provided that, but since the function is part of the class, it's assumed that the class has that variable. So the code will proceed as such.

Another thing to note: the return for the general case (no protocol_version) is a dictionary of all supported versions, so returning a copy of the class's handlers dict is okay. But maybe the class's _HANDLERS is already a dict, so returning a new dict (like dict(handlers)) would prevent modification.

Alternatively, perhaps the code just returns a shallow copy, which is fine.

Now, possible edge cases: what if the protocol_version is an empty tuple? The problem says the example is (3,5), so probably the check for tuple is sufficient, as the user is supposed to pass a valid version.

So, putting all together, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    handlers = getattr(cls, '_HANDLERS', {})
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
        handler = handlers.get(protocol_version)
        return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}
    else:
        return dict(handlers)

Wait, but the function is supposed to return a dictionary even if the version is not present. So in the case when protocol_version is given but not in handlers, return empty dict. That's correct.

But in the code above, when protocol_version is given, the return is either {version: handler} or empty. That's correct.

Wait, the code uses getattr(cls, '_HANDLERS', {}), which is okay if the class might not have that attribute. But maybe the problem assumes that the class has it, so perhaps just cls._HANDLERS. However, using getattr with a default might be safer, but perhaps the problem expects that the class has that variable. But since the user hasn't specified, I'll proceed with the code as written.

Wait, the problem's docstring says "supported protocol versions", so perhaps the class must have that variable. So perhaps the code should just access it directly. So changing to:

handlers = cls._HANDLERS

But if the class doesn't have that, it would throw an error. But the function is part of the class's code, so it's expected to have that.

Hmm, perhaps the code should be written as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = cls._HANDLERS  # assuming this is a class-level dict
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
        handler = handlers.get(protocol_version)
        return {protocol_version: handler} if handler is not None else {}
    else:
        return dict(handlers)

Wait, but in the case where handler is None (but the version is present?), but probably the _HANDLERS will have the version as a key only if the handler is present, so .get would return the handler or None if not present. Wait no, if the key is not in the dict, then get returns None. So if the version is not in the handlers, then handler is None, so the return is empty dict. If it is present, then return the dict with that key and handler.

Yes, that works.

Now, the code must raise a TypeError if the protocol_version is not a tuple. So the check is correct.

Now, the function returns a copy of the handlers when no version is given, so that modifications to the returned dict don't affect the class's internal state. Using dict(handlers) creates a shallow copy.

Putting all together, the code should look like this. The function is a class method, so it's decorated with @classmethod? Wait, the function signature says def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), so it's a class method, so the code must include the @classmethod decorator.

Ah, right! I almost forgot. The function is a class method, so it must be decorated with @classmethod. Otherwise, the first argument would be an instance, but here it's cls.

So adding that decorator at the top.

So the final code would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    [docstring as given]
    """
    handlers = cls._HANDLERS
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
        handler = handlers.get(protocol_version)
        return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}
    else:
        return dict(handlers)

Wait, but in the code above, when protocol_version is present and the handler exists, we return a dict with that version and handler. Otherwise, empty dict. That's correct.

Another point: the docstring says "dictionary of version tuple to handler class", so the handler must be a class. So the _HANDLERS must map versions to classes, but that's beyond the function's responsibility.

Now, checking all requirements:

- The function returns a dict of versions to handlers, either all or filtered by version.

- If protocol_version is given and not a tuple, raises TypeError.

- When a version is given, returns a dict with 0 or 1 items.

- The code uses cls to access the class's _HANDLERS.

Yes, this should work.

Wait, but in the code, the function is a class method, so the @classmethod decorator is necessary. So that's included.

I think that's all. Now, I need to write the code exactly as per the user's instructions. They said to output only the code in Python markdown format, which probably means just the code without any explanations, enclosed in triple backticks. But the user's example shows a code block, so perhaps just the code.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Hmm, perhaps they mean to put the code in a markdown code block with ```python. But the user's example shows a code block with the function, so maybe I should just present the code as is, with the necessary decorators and the function.

So the final code would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    handlers = cls._HANDLERS
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
        handler = handlers.get(protocol_version)
        return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}
    else:
        return dict(handlers)

Wait, but in the docstring, the line breaks may have to be exactly as given. Let me check the original docstring's formatting. The user's docstring has lines with leading spaces for the parameters and returns. So I need to ensure that the docstring in the code matches exactly.

Looking back at the original docstring:

The parameters and returns have lines that start with four spaces, like:

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple

So in the code, the docstring should preserve those indentation levels. The code I wrote above has the same formatting.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the code uses cls._HANDLERS. But the problem didn't specify that variable, so perhaps in the actual code, the class has that variable. Since the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring," it's acceptable to assume that the class has a _HANDLERS attribute. That's part of the implementation.

Therefore, the code above should be correct.
