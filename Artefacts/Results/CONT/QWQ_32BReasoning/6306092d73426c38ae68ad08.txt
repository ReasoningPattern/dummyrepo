Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method _get_conditionally_required_args based on the provided docstring and parameters. Let's see what the function is supposed to do. The goal is to list the arguments whose 'required_when' condition is met. 

First, the parameters are command_name, options_spec, and args. The options_spec is a list of command spec options. Each option probably has a 'required_when' attribute or something similar. The args are the input arguments provided. 

So the steps would be: iterate over each option in options_spec. For each option, check if it has a 'required_when' condition. Then determine if that condition is met based on the args provided. If yes, add the argument's name to the list.

Wait, how do I check the condition? The 'required_when' might be a function or a string that needs evaluation. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I have to assume that the condition is a function that takes args and returns a boolean. Or perhaps the condition is a string that can be evaluated in some context. Hmm, the docstring doesn't give details, so I need to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of conditions, like (var, value) pairs. For example, the argument is required when another argument has a certain value. Like, if the option has required_when [['other_arg', 'value']], then check if 'other_arg' is present in args and equals 'value'.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a callable that takes the args and returns True or False. The code would have to call that function.

Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the standard approach here is to check each option's required_when condition. Let's assume that each option in options_spec is a dictionary or an object with a 'name' and a 'required_when' attribute. The required_when could be a list of conditions, maybe like (condition_string, value), but without more info, maybe the condition is a function. Alternatively, perhaps the required_when is a list of tuples where each tuple is (option_name, expected_value). So the condition is met if the option_name is present in args and equals the expected_value.

Alternatively, perhaps the required_when is a function that takes args and returns a boolean. So for each option in options_spec, we check if the option has a required_when attribute, then call that function with the args, and if it returns True, add the argument's name to the result list.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a string that can be evaluated in the context of the args. Like, "some_var == 'value'", but that might be more complex.

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to check each option's required_when condition, which is a function, and collect the names where the condition returns True.

Assuming that each option in options_spec has a 'name' and a 'required_when' attribute (maybe a function), the code would loop through each option:

result = []
for option in options_spec:
    if hasattr(option, 'required_when') and option.required_when(args):
        result.append(option.name)
return result

But maybe the options are in a different structure. Let me check the parameters again. The options_spec is a list of command spec options. So each element in the list is an option. Each option must have a 'name' and a 'required_when' condition. 

Alternatively, perhaps the required_when is a list of conditions, and the condition is met if any of them is true. But without more info, perhaps the code is straightforward.

Wait, the return is a list of argument names where the required_when condition is matched. So for each option in options_spec, if the required_when condition evaluates to True given the args, then include the option's name in the list.

So the code structure would be:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required = []
    for opt in options_spec:
        # check if the option has a required_when condition
        if hasattr(opt, 'required_when'):
            # evaluate the condition, which is a function that takes args?
            if opt.required_when(args):
                required.append(opt.name)
    return required

But maybe the required_when is a list of callables, or perhaps it's a single condition. The problem's docstring says "required_when condition matched", so perhaps each option has a single required_when condition. 

Alternatively, perhaps the required_when is a list of (parameter, value) pairs. Like, the argument is required when another parameter has a certain value. For example, if the option has required_when: [('mode', 'advanced')], then if the args include mode='advanced', then this argument is required.

In that case, the code would need to check each of those conditions. Let's see. Suppose required_when is a list of such tuples. Then for each condition in required_when, check if the parameter exists in args and matches the value. If any of them is true (or all?), then the condition is met.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure of options_spec, this is tricky. The problem might expect a certain approach. Since the user hasn't provided more details, maybe the required_when is a function that takes args and returns a boolean. So the code would be as I first thought.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a string that represents an expression to evaluate. But that could be a security risk and is probably not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of (option_name, value) pairs, and the condition is met if any of those pairs are present in the args. For example, if the required_when is [('option_a', 'on')], then if args['option_a'] == 'on', then the condition is met.

In that case, the code would loop over each option in options_spec, check if they have a required_when list, then check each condition in that list. For each condition (param, value), check if args[param] equals value. If any of them is true, then add the option's name to the list.

So the code might look like:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if hasattr(option, 'required_when'):
            for condition in option.required_when:
                param, value = condition
                if args.get(param) == value:
                    required_args.append(option.name)
                    break  # once one condition is met, no need to check others
    return required_args

Wait, but maybe the required_when conditions are all ANDed or ORed. The problem says "condition matched", so perhaps any one of them being true is sufficient. So the first approach would work.

But how are the options structured? The problem's parameters say options_spec is a list of command spec options. Each option would have a name and a required_when condition. Let's assume that each option is an object with a 'name' attribute and a 'required_when' list of tuples.

Alternatively, maybe each option is a dictionary. So for example, each option in options_spec is a dict with 'name' and 'required_when' keys. The required_when is a list of (param, value) pairs.

In that case, the code would check each option's required_when list. For each condition in that list, check if the param's value in args matches the expected value. If any of them is true, then add the name to the result.

So putting this together:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    result = []
    for opt in options_spec:
        req_when = getattr(opt, 'required_when', None)
        if req_when:
            for (param, value) in req_when:
                if args.get(param) == value:
                    result.append(opt.name)
                    break  # no need to check other conditions for this option
    return result

But wait, what if the option's required_when is a single condition, not a list? Then perhaps the code would have to adjust. But given the problem's description, the docstring says "required_when condition matched", implying that there might be a single condition. Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of conditions, and any of them being true triggers the requirement.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a function that takes the command name and args and returns a boolean. For example, opt.required_when(command_name, args) would return True or False.

In that case, the code would be:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required = []
    for opt in options_spec:
        if hasattr(opt, 'required_when'):
            if opt.required_when(command_name, args):
                required.append(opt.name)
    return required

But since I don't know the exact structure of the options, perhaps the first approach is better. Let me think of possible options structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the required_when is a string that represents a Python expression, and the args are passed as a dictionary to evaluate it. But that's more complex and possibly unsafe.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the first approach where each option has a required_when method that takes args and returns a boolean is the way to go, leading to code like:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required = []
    for opt in options_spec:
        if hasattr(opt, 'required_when') and opt.required_when(args):
            required.append(opt.name)
    return required

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of callables. But without more info, the code can't proceed. Since the problem's docstring says "required_when condition matched", perhaps the condition is a function that returns a boolean when given the args.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of (option, value) pairs, and the condition is that all of them are met. But that's unclear. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll go with the first approach where the required_when is a method that evaluates to True when the condition is met.

Wait, but in the parameters, options_spec is a list of command spec options. So perhaps each option has a 'required_when' attribute which is a function that takes the args and returns whether the argument is required.

Thus the code would loop through each option in options_spec, check if the option has a required_when attribute, then call that function with the args. If it returns True, add the option's name to the list.

So the code would be as I first thought.

Another possibility: the required_when is a string that can be evaluated in the context of the args. For example, something like "mode == 'debug'", which would check if the 'mode' argument is 'debug'. In that case, the code would need to evaluate the string as an expression using the args. But that could be done with eval, but it's dangerous. However, given that the problem is about generating code, perhaps that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of (param, operator, value) tuples, but that complicates things.

Since I need to write code based on the given info, and the problem's docstring doesn't give specifics, the safest assumption is that each option in options_spec has a required_when method that takes the args and returns a boolean. So the code would loop through each option, check if required_when exists, call it with args, and collect the names where it returns True.

Thus the code is as follows.
