Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_compute_el that checks if the given object's class has both fill and compute methods. Let's see. The function should take an object as input and return a boolean.

Hmm, first, I should get the class of the object. Maybe using obj.__class__? Then, check if 'fill' and 'compute' are in the class's methods. Wait, how do I check if a method exists?

Oh right, I can use hasattr. So, for the class, check if it has the fill method and also the compute method. Wait, but maybe the methods are part of the instance's __dict__ or the class's attributes. Using hasattr should handle that.

Wait, but sometimes descriptors or other things might complicate it, but the simplest way is to use hasattr. So the function would be something like:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'compute')

Wait, but the question says "the obj class has the fill and compute methods". So maybe checking the class directly instead of the instance? Like checking obj's class attributes. Because if the instance has the method via an instance variable, that's not part of the class's methods.

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The docstring says "whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods". So the methods should be present on the class of the object, not on the instance itself. Because if the instance has an attribute named fill, but it's not part of the class, maybe that's not what is required here.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct approach is to check the class's __dict__ for the methods. Alternatively, using hasattr on the class.

Wait, let's think. For example, if the class defines fill and compute as methods, then hasattr(obj, 'fill') would return True. But if the method is a class method or a static method, or inherited, that's still okay. The function just needs to check if the instance has those methods via its class.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants to check if the class (not the instance) has those methods. So perhaps we should get the class first, then check on that.

So:

cls = obj.__class__
return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

Wait, but in Python, instance methods are accessed via the instance, but the hasattr would work because when you do hasattr(obj, 'fill'), it checks if the instance has an attribute 'fill' either directly or via its class. So for a regular instance method, the hasattr would return True even if the instance doesn't have it directly. So maybe the first approach is sufficient.

Wait, the question's docstring says to check whether the obj's class has those methods. So maybe the correct approach is to check the class, not the instance. Because if the instance has an attribute fill set separately, but the class doesn't, then the function should return False. So perhaps checking the class's attributes is better.

So the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

Alternatively, maybe using the methods dir. Like checking if 'fill' and 'compute' are in dir(cls). But hasattr is probably better.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to check that the methods are callable. Because having an attribute named 'fill' that's not a method would still pass the hasattr check. Hmm, but the question says "methods", so perhaps they need to be callable.

In that case, we need to check not only that the attribute exists but also that it's a callable method. So maybe:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    fill_attr = getattr(cls, 'fill', None)
    compute_attr = getattr(cls, 'compute', None)
    return callable(fill_attr) and callable(compute_attr)

Wait, but in Python, instance methods are callable. So even if the attribute is a function, it's callable. But if someone set a non-callable attribute, like a string, then it would return false. So that might be better.

Alternatively, the original question's wording says "has the fill and compute methods", so perhaps the presence of the attributes that are methods is sufficient, so the first approach with hasattr is okay. But maybe the user wants to ensure that the methods are actually there in the class (not in the instance's __dict__).

Hmm, the problem is a bit ambiguous. But given the problem's description, the simplest solution is to check whether the obj has those methods via hasattr. Because if the methods are part of the class, then the instance would have them via the class.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects checking the instance's own attributes, but that's unlikely. The wording says "class has the methods".

So I think the best way is to check the class's attributes for the presence of those methods, so using the cls approach with hasattr.

So the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

Wait, but in some cases, like if the method is a classmethod or staticmethod, the hasattr would still return True, which is correct because those are still methods of the class.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the instance has the methods, so that when you call obj.fill(), it works. In that case, using hasattr on the instance would be better, because instance methods are accessible via the instance.

Wait, for example, if the class defines a method 'fill', then hasattr(obj, 'fill') would return True, because the instance's __dict__ would look up the class's attributes. So in that case, checking the instance's attributes with hasattr(obj, 'fill') would work.

Wait, let me test in my mind:

class Test:
    def fill(self):
        pass
    def compute(self):
        pass

t = Test()
hasattr(t, 'fill') â†’ True.

So the first approach (checking the instance's attributes via hasattr) would work.

But suppose someone has a subclass that overrides the methods. The check would still work.

Alternatively, if the instance has an attribute named 'fill' which is not a method, like t.fill = 5, then hasattr would return True but it's not a method. But the question's docstring says "has the fill and compute methods", so perhaps that's a problem. The function should return False in that case.

Ah, right. So in that case, the first approach (using hasattr on the instance) would return True even if the instance's attribute is not a method, but the question requires checking whether the class has the methods, not the instance. So perhaps the correct approach is to check the class's attributes, not the instance's.

Because if the instance has an attribute 'fill' set to a non-method, then the class's 'fill' method would still be shadowed, but the function's requirement is about the class, not the instance.

Hmm, so to make sure that the class itself has those methods, not the instance, the better approach is to check the class's attributes.

Therefore, the code should check the class, so the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

Alternatively, maybe also checking that they are callables? Because the question says "methods", which implies they are functions.

So perhaps adding that check:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return (hasattr(cls, 'fill') and callable(getattr(cls, 'fill'))) and (hasattr(cls, 'compute') and callable(getattr(cls, 'compute')))

Hmm, but that's more code. The question's docstring says "has the fill and compute methods", so maybe the presence of the attributes which are methods (i.e., callable) is required.

So perhaps the better approach is to use the second version. Let's see.

Suppose a class has a 'fill' attribute which is a non-callable. Then, the first version would return True, but the second would return False. Since the question requires checking for methods, the second approach is better.

Therefore, I should adjust the code to check that the attributes are callable.

So putting it all together:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    fill = getattr(cls, 'fill', None)
    compute = getattr(cls, 'compute', None)
    return callable(fill) and callable(compute)

Alternatively, using hasattr and then checking if they are callable.

Wait, but in the code above, if the attribute doesn't exist, then getattr returns None, and callable(None) is False, so that would correctly return False.

So that code should work.

Alternatively, maybe the function should also check that the method is an instance method, but perhaps that's overcomplicating. The question says "methods" so any callable attached to the class as an attribute is acceptable.

So the code above would work.

Hmm. Now, which approach is correct?

The original problem's docstring says: "Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods."

So the methods must be present on the class. So the code that checks the class's attributes and their callability is correct.

Therefore, the code I should write is:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return (hasattr(cls, 'fill') and callable(getattr(cls, 'fill'))) and (hasattr(cls, 'compute') and callable(getattr(cls, 'compute')))

Alternatively, using the getattr approach as in the second example.

Wait, but in the first version, if the attribute exists but is not a method (like a string), then it would return false. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the user just wants to check if the attributes exist, regardless of being callable. But the term "methods" implies they are functions.

So I think the correct code needs to check for both existence and callability.

Therefore, the final code would be as above.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects just the hasattr checks on the instance. Let me think again.

Suppose the class has the methods, but the instance's __dict__ has no interference. Then, checking the instance with hasattr(obj, 'fill') would return True, because the instance can access the class's method. However, if someone has an instance that has an attribute 'fill' set to a non-callable, then the hasattr would return True but the method isn't there. So the function would return True incorrectly.

Hence, the better approach is to check the class's attributes directly.

So I'll go with the code that checks the class's attributes and their callability.

Thus, the code should be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return (hasattr(cls, 'fill') and callable(getattr(cls, 'fill'))) and (hasattr(cls, 'compute') and callable(getattr(cls, 'compute')))

Wait, but maybe I can simplify that.

Wait, the hasattr is redundant here because if getattr returns None, then the callable check will be false. So perhaps:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    fill = getattr(cls, 'fill', None)
    compute = getattr(cls, 'compute', None)
    return fill is not None and callable(fill) and compute is not None and callable(compute)

But that's more code. Alternatively, the first approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    return (hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and callable(getattr(obj.__class__, 'fill'))) and (hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute') and callable(getattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')))

But that's a bit more compact.

Hmm. Let me think of possible test cases.

Test case 1: A class with both methods. Should return True.

Test case 2: A class with fill but not compute. Should return False.

Test case 3: A class with fill as a non-callable (like a string). Then, the check would return False.

Test case 4: A class with compute as a class method. Since class methods are callable, that's okay.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code needs to check that the attributes exist on the class and are callable.

So the code as written should be correct.

Therefore, I will write that code.
