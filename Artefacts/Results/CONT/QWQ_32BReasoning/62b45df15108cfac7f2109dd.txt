Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the method status_str based on the given docstring and function signature. Let's see. The function is an instance method because of the self parameter. The docstring says it returns a string representation using self.log.status_str, and it can take an optional prefix.

Hmm, so first, the method should probably call self.log.status_str(). But wait, maybe self.log has a method called status_str? Or is it an attribute? The docstring says "with self.log.status_str", so maybe it's an attribute. But the way to get the string would be to call that attribute's string representation. Wait, maybe the self.log object has a method status_str(), so perhaps the code is self.log.status_str() and then prepend the prefix?

Alternatively, maybe the status_str is a method of self.log, so the code would be something like: return prefix + self.log.status_str(). But I need to make sure that the prefix is added before the result of self.log's status_str. Also, if the prefix is provided, it should be included. 

Wait, the parameters are def status_str(self, prefix=''), so the default is an empty string. The function should return a string. So the code inside the method would be to get the string from self.log's status_str, perhaps by calling it as a method, then concatenate the prefix. 

Wait, maybe the self.log's status_str is a method, so we have to call it. So the code would be:

return prefix + self.log.status_str()

But I need to make sure that the self.log has such a method. Since the problem statement mentions using self.log.status_str, perhaps that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the status_str is an attribute that's a string, so we just get that string and add the prefix. But the problem says "with self.log.status_str", so maybe the method uses that attribute's value. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to call a method on self.log called status_str, and then prepend the prefix. 

In any case, the code structure would be something like:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    return prefix + self.log.status_str()

But I should check if there's any need for string conversion. Maybe self.log.status_str is a string attribute, so just adding the prefix would work. 

Alternatively, maybe the method of self.log returns a string, so the code is correct as above. Since the problem states "Return string representation with self.log.status_str", the exact way might be to get the string from self.log's status_str method or attribute and prepend the prefix. 

Assuming that self.log has a method called status_str that returns a string, the code should call that and add the prefix. 

Therefore, the code would be as written above. I'll go with that.
