Okay, I need to write a Python function called next_version that takes a version string and returns the next version according to some pattern. Let me think about how version numbers usually work. 

Hmm, typically version numbers are like "1.2.3", and the next would increment the last part, so "1.2.4". But maybe the pattern could be different if there's more parts or if some parts are zero. Wait, the problem says "following existing pattern"—so I need to figure out the pattern from the input.

Wait, maybe the pattern is that each part is incremented, starting from the right. Like, for example, "0.0.1" would go to "0.0.2", then "0.1.0", then "1.0.0"? Or maybe not. The problem isn't specific, so I have to assume the standard versioning where the rightmost part is incremented, and if it overflows (like 999 to 1000?), but probably just split into integers, increment the last one, and carry over if necessary.

So the steps would be:

1. Split the input version string by dots into parts. For example, "1.2.3" becomes [1,2,3].
2. Convert each part to an integer.
3. Increment the last element by 1. If it becomes 10, then maybe we have to carry over? Wait, no, because version numbers can have numbers of any size. Like 1.999 becomes 2.000? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says "following existing pattern"—so perhaps each part is just a number, and we just increment the last part, even if that makes it a larger number. Like 1.999 would become 1.1000?

So, the process is: split into list of integers, increment last, then if it overflows, like 9 becomes 10, but that's okay. Then, rejoin with dots.

Wait, but how about cases like "0.0.0"? The next would be "0.0.1", then "0.1.0", then "1.0.0"?

Wait, maybe the pattern is that each time, you increment the rightmost non-zero digit? No, that's more complicated. The problem's description is a bit vague, but I think the standard approach is to treat each version part as a number, and increment the last one, unless it overflows (like if it's 9 and becomes 10, but the problem probably allows that). So let's proceed with that.

So, the steps in code:

First, split the version string into parts. For example, version.split('.') gives a list of strings. Then convert each to integer. 

Then, starting from the end, increment the last element by 1. If it's okay, then done. Otherwise, maybe there's a carry? Wait no, adding 1 can't cause a carry beyond a single digit unless the number is like 999, but in that case, it's okay to become 1000. So no carry-over is needed except when the part is something like 999, but adding 1 makes it 1000, which is acceptable. 

Wait, no, there's no carry-over in version numbers. Each part is independent. For example, 1.2.9 becomes 1.2.10, then 1.3.0 would be the next after that? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says "following existing pattern"—so probably the standard way is to just increment the last part, regardless of its value.

So code steps:

Take the list of integers, increment the last element by 1. Then, if that element was 9, it becomes 10, which is fine.

Wait, but what if the version is like "1.2.3.0"? The next would be "1.2.3.1", then "1.2.4.0" after that? Or maybe the pattern is that you always increment the last part. So the code should just do that.

So, in code:

def next_version(version):
    parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))
    # Increment the last part by 1
    parts[-1] +=1
    # Check if it overflows and needs to carry over? Wait, no, because 9 +1 is 10, which is allowed in version numbers. So no need to carry.
    # Then, join back into a string
    return '.'.join(map(str, parts))

Wait but wait, what about cases like "0.0.9"? The next version would be "0.0.10", which is correct. But what if the version is "0.9.9"? The next would be "0.9.10", then "0.10.0"? Wait no, that's not the case. The next version after "0.9.9" would be "0.9.10", because we only increment the last part. The next version after "0.9.999" is "0.9.1000". 

So the code above would work for all those cases. 

But what about if the version is something like "1"? Then splitting gives [1], increment to 2, so "2".

Another test case: "1.9.999" becomes "1.9.1000".

Another edge case: "0.0.0" → "0.0.1", then next would be "0.0.2", etc. That's correct.

Wait, but what if the version is "1.2.3.4.5"? Then the next is "1.2.3.4.6".

So the code seems correct. 

Wait but what if the version has a single part? Like "5" becomes "6".

Yes. 

Hmm, I think that's the solution. Let me test some examples.

Test 1: next_version("1.2.3") → "1.2.4" ✔️

Test 2: next_version("0.0.9") → "0.0.10" ✔️

Test 3: next_version("0.9.9") → "0.9.10" ✔️

Test 4: next_version("1") → "2" ✔️

Test 5: next_version("123.456.789") → "123.456.790" ✔️

What about leading zeros? Like "001.2.3" → but the problem says the input is a version string. The code converts to integers, so leading zeros would be lost. For example, "001.02.3" → split into ["001", "02", "3"], then converted to [1,2,3], so next is "1.2.4". But if the input had leading zeros, maybe the output should preserve them? But the problem's docstring doesn't specify that. Since the function's input is a version string, perhaps leading zeros are not part of the pattern. So the code as written would treat them as numbers. So the input "010.2" would become [10,2], so next is "10.3". So leading zeros are dropped. The problem might not care about that, since it's common for version numbers to not have leading zeros in numeric parts. 

The problem says "following existing pattern"—so perhaps the pattern is that each part is a number, so leading zeros are not preserved. So the code is correct as written.

Therefore, the code is as written above.
