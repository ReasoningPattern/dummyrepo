Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method validate_choices_args based on the provided docstring. Let's see. The function is supposed to check if the value of the given arguments is one of the available choices. The parameters are self and args. 

Hmm, first, I should figure out what args is. The doc says it's the received arguments. Maybe args is a dictionary of arguments to check? Or perhaps a list of argument names? Wait, the function is part of a class, so self might have some internal data structure that defines the available choices for each argument.

So, the method probably needs to iterate over each argument in args, check if its value is in the allowed choices. But how are the choices stored? Maybe the class has a property like _choices which is a dictionary mapping argument names to their valid options. 

Wait, maybe the args parameter here is a single argument name, or multiple? The name is args, plural, so maybe it's a list of argument names. Or perhaps args is a dictionary containing the arguments to validate. The doc isn't entirely clear, but the function's job is to check each of those arguments against their available choices.

Assuming that for each argument in args, we have to check its value. So perhaps the steps are:

1. For each argument name in args:
   a. Get the value from somewhere, maybe from self's attributes or another data structure.
   b. Get the list of allowed choices for that argument from self._choices or similar.
   c. If the value is not in the choices, raise an error.

Wait, but how do we get the current value of the argument? Maybe the arguments are stored in a dictionary in the class, like self.args. Or maybe the args parameter is a dictionary of the arguments passed in. Let me re-read the docstring.

The parameters are: "args: The received arguments." So maybe args is a dictionary where the keys are the argument names and the values are their values. So the function's job is to check each key in args to see if their value is in the allowed choices.

Alternatively, maybe args is a list of argument names, and the actual values are stored in self. Hmm, the function's name is validate_choices_args, so perhaps it's part of a class that handles form validation or similar, where each argument has predefined choices.

Assuming that for each argument in args (which is a list of argument names), the class has a _choices attribute that maps each argument name to a list of allowed values. Then, the current value of the argument (maybe stored in self.data or something) is checked against those choices.

Alternatively, maybe the args parameter here is a single argument's name, but the function is written to handle multiple. The function's doc says "the given args", so plural. Let's think of the code structure.

Possible code steps:

- Iterate over each arg in args:
   - Get the allowed choices for that arg from self's choices (like self._choices.get(arg, []))
   - Get the current value of the argument, perhaps from self.args or some other attribute.
   - If the value is not in the choices, raise an error, like ValueError or a custom exception.

Wait, but how exactly are the values stored? Since the function is a method of a class, perhaps the current values are stored in a dictionary like self.values. Let me assume that.

Alternatively, maybe the args parameter is a dictionary where the keys are the argument names and the values are their current values. Then, the function would loop through each key in args, check if the value is in the allowed choices for that key.

But the function's parameter is called args, which is a bit ambiguous. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Suppose that the class has a _choices attribute that is a dictionary where each key is an argument name and the value is a list of allowed choices. The args parameter is a dictionary of the current arguments to validate. Then the code would look something like this:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg_name, arg_value in args.items():
        if arg_name in self._choices:
            valid_choices = self._choices[arg_name]
            if arg_value not in valid_choices:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid value for {arg_name}: {arg_value}. Must be one of {valid_choices}")
        else:
            # maybe raise an error if the argument isn't even in the choices dict?
            pass  # or maybe just ignore it?

Alternatively, if the args parameter is a list of argument names, and the values are stored in another part of the class, like self.data:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg in args:
        current_value = self.data.get(arg)
        valid_choices = self._choices.get(arg)
        if valid_choices and current_value not in valid_choices:
            raise ValueError(...)
        elif not valid_choices:
            # no choices defined for this argument, maybe it's okay?
            pass

But the problem is the exact structure of the class isn't known. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I have to make reasonable assumptions.

Looking at the function's docstring again: it says "Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices." The parameter is "args: The received arguments." So perhaps args is a dictionary of the arguments to check, and each key is the argument name, and the value is the value provided. Then the code would loop over each key in args, check if the value is in the choices for that argument.

Assuming that the class has a _choices attribute which is a dictionary mapping argument names to their valid choices. Then the code would be something like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg_name, arg_value in args.items():
        valid_choices = self._choices.get(arg_name)
        if valid_choices is None:
            # Maybe the argument isn't in the choices, so it's not required to check? Or maybe it's an error?
            # The problem says to check if the value is one of the available choices, so perhaps if there are no choices defined, it's okay.
            continue
        if arg_value not in valid_choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Value '{arg_value}' for argument '{arg_name}' is not a valid choice. Valid choices are: {valid_choices}")

Wait, but maybe the _choices is a list, but per argument. So the code would loop through each arg in args (the parameter), and for each, get the value, then check against the choices stored in the class for that argument.

Alternatively, maybe the args parameter is a list of argument names, and the actual values are stored in another attribute of the class, like self.values. In that case, the code would look like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg_name in args:
        current_value = self.values.get(arg_name)
        valid_choices = self._choices.get(arg_name)
        if current_value not in valid_choices:
            raise ValueError(...)

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit ambiguous. Since the function is called validate_choices_args and the parameter is args, perhaps the args parameter is a dictionary of arguments and their values, so the first approach makes sense.

Another point: the function's return isn't mentioned. The docstring doesn't specify a return value, so it probably raises an error if something is wrong, and returns nothing otherwise.

Putting this all together, the code would loop through each argument in the args dictionary, check if its value is in the valid choices for that argument. If not, raise a ValueError with an appropriate message.

So the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg_name, arg_value in args.items():
        valid_choices = self._choices.get(arg_name)
        if valid_choices is not None and arg_value not in valid_choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid value for '{arg_name}': {arg_value}. Valid choices are: {valid_choices}")

Wait, but what if valid_choices is None? Then the argument might not have any choices defined, so it's okay. So we check that valid_choices is not None first. Otherwise, if the argument isn't in self._choices, then perhaps there are no constraints, so we don't need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the argument in args implies that it should have choices, but that's probably not the case.

Hmm, this seems reasonable. Let me think of possible edge cases. Suppose an argument in args has no valid_choices (i.e., not in self._choices), then the code skips checking it. But maybe the function is intended to only check arguments that have choices. Alternatively, if an argument is passed in args but has no choices defined, perhaps it's an error. But the docstring doesn't say that, so better to proceed as per first approach.

Therefore, the code as above should work. Let me write that.
