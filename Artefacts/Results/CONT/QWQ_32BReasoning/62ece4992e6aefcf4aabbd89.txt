Okay, I need to write a Python function called gaussian that takes an input x and calculates the Gaussian distribution with mean u=0.2 and standard deviation sigma=0.1. Let me remember the formula for the Gaussian probability density function. The formula is (1/(sigma * sqrt(2 * pi))) * e^(- (x - u)^2 / (2 * sigma^2)). 

So first, I'll need to import the math module because I'll need sqrt, pi, and exp functions. Wait, right, math.sqrt, math.pi, math.exp. 

The function should return the value of the Gaussian at point x. Let me structure it step by step. 

The mean u is 0.2, sigma is 0.1. So subtract x by u, square that, divide by (2 * sigma squared), then take negative of that exponent. Then multiply by the coefficient which is 1 over (sigma * sqrt(2 * pi)).

Let me make sure I get the order right. The exponent part is the e raised to the power of (- (x - u)^2/(2 sigma^2)). 

So putting it all together:

First calculate the exponent term: numerator is (x - u)**2, denominator is 2 * sigma**2. Then exponent_term = - (numerator / denominator). 

Then the exponential part is math.exp(exponent_term). 

The coefficient is 1/(sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi)).

Multiply coefficient by the exponential part. 

So in code:

import math

def gaussian(x):
    u = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    exponent = - ( (x - u)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    return coefficient * math.exp(exponent)

Hmm, that should work. Let me check if I have all the parts. Yes. Oh, wait, the order of operations in the exponent calculation. The parentheses are important. The (x - u) is squared first, then divided by (2 sigma squared), then multiplied by -1. 

Yes, that looks right. I think that's all. The function should take x and return the Gaussian value with the given parameters. Let me make sure I didn't miss any constants. The parameters u and sigma are set inside the function, so every time the function is called, it uses those fixed values. 

I think that's correct. Let me see if there's any possible error. Like, if sigma is zero, but since sigma is 0.1, division is okay. So the code should work.
