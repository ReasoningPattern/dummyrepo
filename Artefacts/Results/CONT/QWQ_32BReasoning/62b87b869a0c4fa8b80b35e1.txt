Okay, I need to write a Python function called hist_to_graph based on the given docstring and parameters. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function converts a histogram into a graph. The parameters are hist, make_value, get_coordinate, field_names, and scale. 

First, the make_value parameter is a function that takes a bin's content and returns the value for the graph point. The default is to use the bin content directly, so if make_value is None, I should set it to a lambda that returns the value. But wait, maybe the default is to just return the bin's content as is. The example given uses a lambda that returns a tuple of mean and error, so the make_value can return multiple values. So the default make_value should be a function that returns the bin's content. Hmm, but how does that work when the bin has context? The doc says that if the histogram has context, make_value must remove it. But for now, maybe the default is to just take the value part of the bin. Wait, perhaps the histogram's bins are stored as a value, and if they have context, then make_value must process that. 

Next, the get_coordinate can be "left", "right", or "middle". This determines where the graph's point is placed relative to the bin. For a 1D histogram, each bin has edges, so for example, if it's "left", the coordinate is the left edge, "middle" the center, etc. The graph's points will be at those coordinates.

The field_names must match the dimension of the result. The example given uses ("x", "y") but if make_value returns two values (like mean and error), then the field names would be three? Wait, no, the example says if make_value returns (mean, mean_error), then the field_names would be ("x", "y_mean", "y_mean_error"). Wait, that's three fields. Wait, the graph's dimension is the length of field_names. So, if make_value returns a tuple with two elements, then the total fields would be (x coordinate) + those two, making 3 fields. So the field_names must have the same length as the dimension, which is 1 (coordinate) plus the length of the make_value's return. Wait, no. Let me read the parameters again.

The doc says: "field_names set field names of the graph. Their number must be the same as the dimension of the result." The dimension here probably refers to the graph's data points. For example, if the graph is 2D (x and y), then the field names should be two. But if the make_value returns a tuple of two values (like y and error), then the graph would have three fields? Or maybe the dimension is the number of coordinates plus the number of values from make_value. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of the graph's point as having coordinates and values. For instance, a graph point in 2D would have x and y, but if there are errors, maybe each point has x, y, y_err. So the field names would need to match the total elements returned by make_value plus the coordinate.

Wait, looking at the example in the docstring: when make_value returns (mean, mean_error), then field_names would be ("x", "y_mean", "y_mean_error"), which has three elements. So the dimension here is 3? Or perhaps the graph's dimension is the number of coordinates plus the number of values. Hmm, maybe the graph's points are tuples with the coordinate (like x) and the values from make_value. So the total length of the field names is 1 (coordinate) plus the length of the make_value's return. 

So for the function, the steps are:

1. Iterate over each bin in the histogram. 
2. For each bin, compute the coordinate (left, right, or middle of the bin's edges).
3. Use make_value to process the bin's content to get the value(s) for the graph point.
4. Combine the coordinate and the values into a tuple for the graph's point.
5. Collect all these points into the graph's data.
6. Set the graph's scale, using the histogram's scale if scale is True, or the given scale parameter.

Now, how to get the coordinate. Let's think about a 1D histogram. Each bin has edges, like for bin i, the left edge is edges[i], right edge is edges[i+1]. So the coordinate for "left" would be edges[i], "right" edges[i+1], "middle" (edges[i] + edges[i+1])/2. 

But the histogram could be multidimensional? The function's doc mentions the dimension of the result, so perhaps the histogram can be multi-dimensional. However, the example uses field_names like ("x", "y") which is 2D. Hmm, but maybe the code here is for a 1D histogram, given the parameters. Wait, the parameters don't specify the dimension of the histogram, so perhaps the function is for 1D. Or maybe it's more general. 

Assuming the histogram is 1D, let's proceed. Let's see the parameters:

The make_value's return is the value part of the graph point. So the coordinate is the x value, and the make_value returns the y value(s). So the graph point would be (x_coordinate, y_value). Or if make_value returns a tuple, then (x_coordinate, y_part1, y_part2). So the field_names must have as many elements as the total of coordinate and the make_value's return.

So, first, the code structure:

We need to create a graph object. The function's return is a graph, so perhaps the graph is an instance of some class. Since the function is part of a module, maybe the graph class is predefined. But since we are to write the code, perhaps the code will create a data structure, like a list of namedtuples, with the given field_names. 

Alternatively, the code may return a dictionary with 'points' and 'scale' keys. But the function's return is a graph. Let's assume that the graph is an object with a 'points' attribute and a 'scale' attribute. 

The code steps:

- Iterate over each bin in the histogram's bins. For each bin, get its content and its edges. 

Wait, the histogram must have a way to get the edges of each bin. So perhaps the histogram has an 'edges' attribute, which is a list of the bin edges. For a 1D histogram, edges would be a list where the i-th bin is between edges[i] and edges[i+1].

Alternatively, the histogram's bins have start and end points. 

Alternatively, perhaps the histogram has a method to get the edges for a bin. 

Assuming that for each bin in the histogram, we can get its left and right edges. 

Let me think of the code structure:

First, get the coordinates. For each bin, compute the coordinate based on get_coordinate. 

Then, get the bin's content. 

Apply make_value to the content to get the value part. 

Combine the coordinate and the value parts into a tuple. 

Collect all these tuples into a list of points. 

Then, create the graph with these points and the scale. 

Now, the code must handle the histogram's structure. Let's assume that the histogram has a 'bins' attribute which is a list of bin objects, each with a 'content' and 'edges' (or start and end). 

Alternatively, maybe the histogram has a method to get the bin edges. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code needs to loop over the histogram's axes. 

Wait, perhaps the code can be written as follows:

Assuming the histogram has a 'axes' list, each axis has edges. But this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is for a 1D histogram, so the edges are a 1D array. 

But the problem is that without knowing the structure of the histogram, it's hard to proceed. The function's parameters mention that the histogram must contain only numeric bins or make_value must remove context. So the bins may have context, but make_value is supposed to process them. 

Wait, the function signature says that hist must contain only numeric bins (without context) or make_value must remove context when creating a numeric graph. So the bin's content can be a value (if numeric) or an object with context. The make_value function must return a numeric value or a tuple of numeric values. 

Assuming that each bin has a 'content' and 'edges', then for each bin in the histogram:

- For the coordinate, get the left edge, right edge, or middle. 

The code steps:

points = []
for each bin in hist.bins:
    left = bin.left_edge
    right = bin.right_edge
    if get_coordinate == 'left':
        coord = left
    elif get_coordinate == 'right':
        coord = right
    else: # middle
        coord = (left + right)/2
    content = bin.content
    value = make_value(content)
    point = (coord,) + tuple(value)
    points.append(point)
    
Then, create the graph with these points and the scale. 

But how to access the edges? The code may need to loop through the histogram's axes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the histogram has an 'edges' array. For a 1D histogram, edges would be a list where each bin's left edge is edges[i], and the right edge is edges[i+1]. 

So, for bin i in 0 to len(edges)-2:

left = edges[i]
right = edges[i+1]

So, perhaps the code can do:

edges = hist.edges  # assuming 1D
for i in range(len(edges) - 1):
    left = edges[i]
    right = edges[i+1]
    coord = ... as before
    content = hist.get_bin_content(i)  # or something like that
    value = make_value(content)
    point = (coord,) + tuple(value)
    points.append(point)

But this requires knowing how the histogram is structured. Since the problem statement doesn't give details, maybe I need to make some assumptions here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the histogram's 'binedges' or similar. 

Alternatively, the code can iterate over the bins, assuming each has a left and right edge. 

Assuming that each bin has a 'left' and 'right' attribute, then:

for bin in hist.bins:
    left = bin.left
    right = bin.right
    ... 

But this is all speculative. Since the problem requires generating the code based on the function's parameters and docstring, perhaps I can proceed with the structure. 

The function must return a graph. Let's assume that the graph is a list of points with the given field_names. So, using the field_names as the names for a named tuple. 

Wait, perhaps the graph is a list of tuples, and the field_names are the column names. So, for example, if the field_names are ("x", "y"), then each point is a tuple (x, y). 

So the code would create a list of points, then create a graph with those points and the scale. 

Now, handling the scale parameter:

If scale is None, the graph's scale is unknown. If scale is True, then use the histogram's scale. Else, use the provided scale. 

So, the scale for the graph is:

if scale is True:
    graph_scale = hist.scale
elif scale is not None:
    graph_scale = scale
else:
    graph_scale = None

Wait, the parameter is called scale. The doc says: "if it is True, it uses the histogram scale." So yes. 

Putting it all together:

The code would:

- Iterate over each bin in the histogram, get the coordinate and the value via make_value, then create a point. 

The code's skeleton would be something like:

def hist_to_graph(hist, make_value=None, get_coordinate="left",
                  field_names=("x", "y"), scale=None):
    if make_value is None:
        make_value = lambda val: (val,)  # returns a tuple of one element
    points = []
    # Need to loop through bins, get edges, compute coordinate, etc.
    # Assuming that the histogram has a method to get the edges and content
    # This part is tricky without knowing the histogram's structure. 
    # Let's make a simplified assumption for the code. 
    # Suppose the histogram has a list of bins, each with left, right, and content.
    for bin in hist.bins:
        left = bin.left
        right = bin.right
        if get_coordinate == 'left':
            coord = left
        elif get_coordinate == 'right':
            coord = right
        else:
            coord = (left + right) / 2.0
        content = bin.content
        value = make_value(content)
        point = (coord,) + tuple(value)
        points.append(point)
    # Now create the graph with these points and field_names
    # Assuming the graph class is defined with field names and points
    # For example, using a class like this:
    # class Graph:
    #     def __init__(self, points, field_names, scale):
    #         ...
    # So the code would be:
    graph = Graph(points, field_names, scale=graph_scale)
    return graph

But how to handle the scale:

graph_scale = None
if scale is True:
    graph_scale = hist.scale
elif scale is not None:
    graph_scale = scale

Wait, but how to get the histogram's scale? The code would need to access hist.scale. 

Now, the problem is that the code can't assume the structure of the histogram. But since the function is supposed to be written, perhaps the code can proceed with the given parameters, even if some parts are placeholders. 

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a list of edges. For example, edges = hist.edges, and then loop over the bins with their indices. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses the histogram's axes. For a 1D histogram, the x-axis edges are available. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that the edges are obtained from the histogram's axes. 

But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code structure I have, making some assumptions about the histogram's structure. 

Wait, the function must return a graph. Let's assume that the graph is a dictionary with 'points' and 'scale' keys. But the field_names must match the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a list of tuples, and the field_names are stored as an attribute. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a class called Graph, which is initialized with the points, field_names, and scale. 

In any case, the code must generate the points list correctly. 

Now, the make_value function's default is to return the bin's content. So if the content is a single number, then make_value returns (content,), so the point is (coord, content). 

If the bin's content is an object with mean and mean_error, then the make_value function (like in the example) returns (mean, mean_error), so the point is (coord, mean, mean_error). 

Thus, the code's make_value default is to return a tuple with the content. 

Wait, the default for make_value is None, but in the code, if it's None, we set it to a lambda that returns (val,). 

So, in code:

if make_value is None:
    make_value = lambda val: (val,)

Then, when the content is a context object, the user must supply a make_value function that extracts the necessary numbers. 

Now, the code must also handle multi-dimensional histograms? The field_names parameter's length must match the dimension. For example, in 2D, the coordinate would be (x_mid, y_mid), but perhaps the code is for 1D only. 

The problem statement's example uses field_names like ("x", "y"), which is 2 elements. But the coordinate is a single value. So the total elements are 1 (coordinate) plus the make_value's return length. 

Assuming the code is for 1D histograms, the coordinate is a single number, and the make_value returns a tuple of any length. The field_names must have length 1 + len(make_value's return). 

Wait, no. Let me see the example again. The example says when make_value returns (mean, mean_error), then field_names are ("x", "y_mean", "y_mean_error"). So that's 3 elements, which is 1 (x coordinate) plus 2 (the two values from make_value). 

Thus, the code's points will be tuples of length (1 + len(make_value_return)). 

Therefore, the code must ensure that the field_names length matches that. 

But the function's parameters specify that the user must provide field_names with the correct length. So the code doesn't have to check that. 

Now, putting all together. 

The code will:

- Iterate over each bin in the histogram. 

Assuming that the histogram has a 'binedges' list for 1D, but perhaps each bin has left and right edges. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code can get the edges from the histogram's axes. 

Let me think of a possible way. Let's say the histogram has an 'axes' attribute, each axis has edges. For a 1D histogram, the first axis's edges are stored in hist.axes[0].edges. 

Then, for each bin in the histogram's bins:

But perhaps the code can iterate over the bins, and for each bin, get its edges. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code can loop over the edges and calculate the bin's edges. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written as:

edges = hist.axes[0].edges  # for 1D
for i in range(len(edges)-1):
    left = edges[i]
    right = edges[i+1]
    # get the bin's content. Assuming the bin content is stored in a list like hist.values
    content = hist.values[i]
    # compute coordinate
    if get_coordinate == 'left':
        coord = left
    elif get_coordinate == 'right':
        coord = right
    else:
        coord = (left + right)/2.0
    # process content with make_value
    value = make_value(content)
    point = (coord,) + tuple(value)
    points.append(point)

But this requires that the histogram has 'axes' and 'values' attributes, which may not be the case. 

Since I can't know the exact structure, but the problem requires writing the code, I'll proceed with the assumption that each bin has a left and right edge, and a content. 

Thus, in code:

for bin in hist.bins:
    left = bin.left
    right = bin.right
    content = bin.content
    ... 

Now, the code:

def hist_to_graph(hist, make_value=None, get_coordinate="left",
                  field_names=("x", "y"), scale=None):
    if make_value is None:
        make_value = lambda val: (val,)
    points = []
    for bin in hist.bins:
        left = bin.left
        right = bin.right
        if get_coordinate == 'left':
            coord = left
        elif get_coordinate == 'right':
            coord = right
        else:  # 'middle'
            coord = (left + right) / 2.0
        content = bin.content
        val_tuple = make_value(content)
        point = (coord,) + val_tuple
        points.append(point)
    # Determine the scale
    if scale is True:
        graph_scale = hist.scale
    elif scale is not None:
        graph_scale = scale
    else:
        graph_scale = None
    # Create the graph object
    # Assuming there's a Graph class that takes points, field_names, and scale
    from some_module import Graph  # but the code shouldn't have imports
    # Wait, the code can't have imports unless they're in the problem's context. 
    # The problem says to generate the code, so perhaps the Graph is a class that's already imported. 
    # Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a list of tuples and a dictionary, but the problem says to return a graph. 
    # Maybe the code returns a dictionary with points and scale, but the function's return is a graph. 
    # Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code returns a list of points with the field names and scale. 
    # But the problem says to return the graph, so perhaps the code creates a data structure. 
    # Let's assume the graph is a dictionary with 'points', 'field_names', and 'scale' keys. 
    graph = {
        'points': points,
        'field_names': field_names,
        'scale': graph_scale
    }
    return graph

Wait, but the code must not include any markdown or explanations. Also, the code must be in Python, but without any extra text. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to output ONLY the code in Python markdown format. Wait, the user's message says:

"Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, perhaps they mean to put the code in a code block, like:

```python
... code here ...
```

So the code must be enclosed in triple backticks with the 'python' language tag. 

Putting it all together, here's the code I think would work, assuming the histogram has a 'bins' list with each bin having left, right, and content attributes. 

But I need to make sure that the code handles the parameters correctly. 

Wait, the get_coordinate can be 'left', 'right', or 'middle', so the code checks that. 

The make_value is applied to the bin's content. 

The field_names are passed to the graph, which uses them as the field names. 

The scale is handled as per the parameters. 

Now, here's the code in the required format:

```python
def hist_to_graph(hist, make_value=None, get_coordinate="left",
                  field_names=("x", "y"), scale=None):
    if make_value is None:
        make_value = lambda val: (val,)
    points = []
    for bin in hist.bins:
        left = bin.left
        right = bin.right
        if get_coordinate == 'left':
            coord = left
        elif get_coordinate == 'right':
            coord = right
        else:
            coord = (left + right) / 2.0
        content = bin.content
        val_tuple = make_value(content)
        point = (coord,) + val_tuple
        points.append(point)
    if scale is True:
        graph_scale = hist.scale
    elif scale is not None:
        graph_scale = scale
    else:
        graph_scale = None
    return {"points": points, "field_names": field_names, "scale": graph_scale}
```

Wait, but the problem mentions a graph class. However, since the code must not have any dependencies, perhaps returning a dictionary is acceptable. 

This code assumes that each bin has left, right, and content attributes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the histogram's bins are stored in a different way. But given the problem's constraints, this code should be the best possible given the information. 

Another point: the make_value function is supposed to accept the bin's content. So the code uses bin.content as the argument. 

Yes. 

The returned graph is a dictionary with points, field_names, and scale. 

This should fulfill the requirements based on the given docstring.
