Okay, I need to write a Python function called normalize_cmd that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns another tuple of strings. The docstring says to "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Hmm, wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me think. The function's purpose is probably to ensure that the first element of the command tuple is a full path to the executable. If it's not a full path (like just the executable name), then we need to find its full path, maybe by checking the PATH environment variables. But how do I do that in Python?

Oh right, the shutil which has which command? Wait, no. Maybe using the os module. Alternatively, the subprocess module can help find the executable. Wait, maybe using shutil.which() function. Because shutil.which takes a command name and returns the path if it's found in the PATH. So the idea is: for the first element of the cmd tuple, check if it's an absolute path. If not, try to find the full path using shutil.which. Then replace the first element with that full path. Then return the modified tuple. But what if the executable isn't found? The problem might just assume that it exists, so perhaps we can proceed under that assumption.

So the steps would be:

1. Take the first element of the cmd tuple, the executable name.
2. Check if it's already an absolute path. Like, on Unix, does it start with a '/'. On Windows, does it have a drive letter or is it absolute?
3. If it's not absolute, use shutil.which to find the full path. If found, replace the first element with that path.
4. The rest of the elements in the tuple remain as they are.
5. Return the new tuple.

Wait, but how do I check if the path is absolute? Using os.path.isabs() function. That's cross-platform.

So the code outline would be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd):
    if not cmd:
        return cmd  # maybe return empty tuple?
    exe_name = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(exe_name):
        # already absolute, do nothing
        return cmd
    # else, find the full path
    full_path = shutil.which(exe_name)
    if full_path is None:
        # what to do? Maybe just return the original? Or raise an error?
        # The problem says "complement", so perhaps we should assume it can be found?
        # Let's proceed under that assumption, so raise an error?
        # But the problem's docstring says to return it in original form. Wait the docstring says "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Wait that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I misread the docstring. Let me check again.

The docstring says: "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Wait that's a bit confusing. So "complement" meaning add the full path? Then the return should have the full path for the executable, but the rest as original. But the second part says "return it in its original form". Hmm maybe the wording is a bit off, but perhaps the function's purpose is to ensure that the command's executable path is a full path, and return the modified tuple. The original form for the rest.

Alternatively, maybe "return it in its original form" refers to that the rest of the arguments are kept as before. So the first element is replaced with full path, others stay same.

So assuming that, proceed. So in code:

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(exe):
        return cmd
    full_path = shutil.which(exe)
    if full_path is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Could not find executable: {exe}")
    # replace the first element
    new_cmd = (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    return new_cmd

Wait but the problem says to return in the original form. Wait maybe if the executable can't be found, we just leave it as is? The problem's docstring isn't entirely clear. The function's name is normalize_cmd, so perhaps it's supposed to do the complement (i.e., add the full path) if possible, and return the modified tuple. If it can't find the path, maybe leave it as original? Or perhaps the problem expects that the function will always find the path. Since the problem says "complement the full path", so perhaps we have to assume that the executable is found.

Alternatively, the problem might not care about error cases and just expects that when the first element is not absolute, replace it with the full path found via shutil.which. So proceed with that.

So the code would need to import os and shutil. But the problem says to generate the code without any explanations, so I should include those imports inside the function? No, that's not possible. Wait the function has to be self-contained? Or the code should have the necessary imports at the top.

The user's instruction says to generate the Python code based on the signature and docstring, so the code should include the necessary imports. But the function's code must be as written. So the code would start with the imports, then the function.

Wait the user's example shows the code in markdown format, but just the code. So the code should include the import statements before the function.

Wait the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Probably meaning just code, with triple backticks, but the code itself must include the necessary imports.

Wait, let me see. The function's code requires 'import os' and 'import shutil'?

Yes. So the code would start with those imports.

Putting it all together:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe_name = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(exe_name):
        return cmd
    full_path = shutil.which(exe_name)
    if full_path is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Executable '{exe_name}' not found in PATH")
    return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but the problem's docstring says "return it in its original form". So if the executable can't be found, perhaps we should return the original cmd? Because otherwise, the function might raise an error, but the problem's docstring might not expect that. Let me re-read the docstring.

The docstring says "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Hmm, maybe the wording is a bit off. Maybe "complement" means to add the full path, and return the command with that path, while the rest remains original. But if it can't find the path, then perhaps it leaves it as is, so the return is the original. That way, it's a best-effort.

So modifying the code to handle that case:

if full_path is None:
    return cmd  # can't find, so return original

So the code becomes:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe_name = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(exe_name):
        return cmd
    full_path = shutil.which(exe_name)
    if full_path is None:
        return cmd  # leave as original
    return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]

That way, if the executable isn't found, the original tuple is returned. That seems better, as per the problem's description.

So this should be the code.
