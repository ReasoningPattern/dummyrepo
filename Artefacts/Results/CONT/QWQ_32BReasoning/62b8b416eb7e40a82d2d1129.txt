Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method names(self, all=False) based on the provided docstring. Let's see. The method is supposed to return the attribute names of the current class. 

Hmm, first, since it's a method of a class, self refers to an instance of that class. To get the attribute names, I might need to use dir() perhaps? But dir() gives all attributes, including the ones inherited. The parameter all=False might control whether to include all attributes or just the ones directly defined on the class.

Wait, the problem is, how do I distinguish between the instance's own attributes and the ones from the class? Or maybe the method is intended to get the class's attributes, not the instance's. The docstring says "attribute names of current class", so maybe it's the class's attributes.

So, if the class has attributes defined in its namespace, like class variables, then perhaps using vars() or the __dict__ of the class. But for that, I can do something like self.__class__.__dict__.keys(). But that might include methods as well. 

Alternatively, using dir(self.__class__) gives all attributes, including inherited ones. The all parameter might determine whether to include those. Wait, maybe when all is False, it should return only the attributes defined directly in the class, not inherited. So how to do that?

Hmm, perhaps the standard approach is to subtract the keys from the base classes. But that could be complicated. Alternatively, the __dict__ of the class itself (excluding base classes) would give exactly the attributes defined on that class. So self.__class__.__dict__.keys() would give the names of the class's own attributes, including methods and such.

Wait, the problem says "attribute names", which could include methods. So maybe the method should return the list of keys in the class's __dict__.

But the parameter all=False might mean that when all is False, it returns only the instance's own attributes, but I'm confused because the method is part of the class. Wait, perhaps the method is supposed to get the names of the instance's attributes, but the wording says "current class".

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the names of the instance's attributes (like the __dict__ of the instance), but that's not clear. Let me read the docstring again: "Return the attribute names of current class." So probably the class's attributes, not the instance's.

So, for the class, the __dict__ would include all attributes and methods defined in that class, not inherited. So, the method could return the keys from self.__class__.__dict__, excluding the special ones like '__module__' or '__dict__'? Or maybe not, since the user might want all names.

Alternatively, the method might need to list all attributes, including inherited ones when all is True, but only the class's own when all is False.

Wait, if all is False, then return only the attributes directly in the class. So in that case, list(self.__class__.__dict__.keys()) would work. But if all is True, then include all attributes including inherited ones, so dir(self.__class__) minus the ones from the base classes?

Alternatively, when all is True, just return dir(self.__class__)?

Hmm, the problem is that the user's intention isn't entirely clear. The function's docstring is brief. But given the parameters, maybe the all flag determines whether to include inherited attributes. So the code might look like:

def names(self, all=False):
    if all:
        return dir(self.__class__)
    else:
        return list(self.__class__.__dict__.keys())

Wait, but the __dict__ includes methods and other special attributes. The user might want just the data attributes? Not sure. But given the problem statement, perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the __dict__ includes all the class's own attributes, so that's okay. Let's try that. So the code would return the keys from __dict__ when all is False, and all attributes (including inherited) when all is True.

Wait, but dir() includes inherited attributes. So for all=True, using dir() is correct. For all=False, using __dict__.keys() would give just the class's own attributes.

Yes, that makes sense. So the code would be:

def names(self, all=False):
    if all:
        return dir(self.__class__)
    else:
        return list(self.__class__.__dict__.keys())

Wait, but the __dict__ is a dictionary, so converting to a list is okay. Alternatively, just the keys view can be returned, but converting to a list is better for a consistent return type.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the names as a list. So this code should work. Let me check possible edge cases. For example, if the class has no base classes, then the __dict__ would have all its attributes. 

Another thought: the __dict__ of the class is the namespace of the class, so it includes all the attributes, methods, etc. defined in that class. So that's correct for all=False. For all=True, using dir() which lists all accessible attributes including inherited ones.

Therefore, the code should be as above. Let me write that.
