Okay, I need to generate Python code for the get_option_spec method based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function's purpose is to get the specification for a specific option, which is identified by command_name and argument_name. The docstring mentions using self.get_parser_option_specs() to get the options of the given command.

Hmm, so first, I should probably retrieve all the options for the specified command using self.get_parser_option_specs(). Then, iterate through those options to find the one where the argument_name matches. 

Wait, how are the options structured? Probably each option has a name field. So maybe loop through each option in the list returned by get_parser_option_specs, check if option['name'] equals the argument_name. Once found, return that option's spec.

But what if the command isn't found, or the argument isn't present? The docstring doesn't specify error handling, so maybe just return None or raise an error? The docstring says "Gets the specification", so perhaps it's expected to return the spec if found, else maybe None. But I should follow the doc's instruction without additional assumptions.

So the steps are:

1. Call self.get_parser_option_specs() with command_name to get all options for that command.
2. Iterate over each option in the returned list.
3. Check if the option's name matches argument_name.
4. Return the first matching option's spec.
5. If not found, perhaps return None.

Wait, the function is called get_option_spec, so maybe each option has a 'spec' key? Or is the entire option the spec? The docstring says "gets the specification for the specified option name". So probably each option in the list from get_parser_option_specs is a spec, so we just need to find the one with the matching name.

So code outline:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    for option in options:
        if option['name'] == argument_name:
            return option
    return None  # or raise an error? But the doc doesn't say.

Wait, but the parameters are command_name and argument_name. The method get_parser_option_specs() might require the command_name as an argument. Wait, the docstring says "Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()". So perhaps self.get_parser_option_specs() is a method that takes the command_name as an argument. So I need to call it like self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name) to get the list of options for that command.

Yes, that makes sense. So the code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    for option in self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name):
        if option['name'] == argument_name:
            return option
    return None

Wait, but maybe the options are stored in a different key. Like maybe the 'name' is under a different attribute. But given the docstring, I have to assume that each option has a 'name' field. Alternatively, maybe the options are tuples or objects. But since the user didn't specify, the code should work with the most probable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are in a dictionary where the keys are the command names, but the function is supposed to get the options for a specific command, so self.get_parser_option_specs() probably returns a list of options for that command when passed the command name.

So putting it all together, the code would loop through each option in the list obtained from get_parser_option_specs with the command_name, check for the argument_name, and return the first match. If none found, returns None.

Yes, that should be the code.
