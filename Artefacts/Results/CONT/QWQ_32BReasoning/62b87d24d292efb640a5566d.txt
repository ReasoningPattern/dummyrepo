Okay, I need to write a Python function called plus_or_dot that takes a list called pieces. The docstring says to return "." if the closest-tag of the pieces contains "+", otherwise return "+". 

Hmm, first I need to figure out what "closest-tag of the pieces" means. Maybe the pieces are parts of a string that's split, and the closest tag is the last element in the list? Or perhaps the last piece that contains a tag? Wait, maybe the function is looking for whether any of the pieces has a "+" in it, specifically in the closest tag. 

Wait, the problem says "if the closest-tag of the pieces contains "+", so perhaps the "closest-tag" refers to the last element in the pieces list? Because the closest would be the last one. So maybe I should check the last element of the pieces list to see if it contains a '+'.

Alternatively, maybe "closest-tag" is a specific part of the pieces, but since the input is just a list called pieces, perhaps the function is supposed to check all the pieces for any occurrence of "+" in any of them, but the wording says "closest-tag contains", so maybe it's just the last piece. 

Let me read the docstring again. The function returns "." if the closest-tag contains "+", else "+". So the logic is: check if the closest tag (probably the last element in pieces) has a '+', then return '.'; else return '+'.

So the steps are:

1. Check the last element in the pieces list. 
2. If that element contains a '+', return '.'.
3. Otherwise, return '+'.

Wait, but what if the pieces list is empty? Then maybe there's an error, but the problem probably assumes that pieces is non-empty. 

So the code would be something like:

def plus_or_dot(pieces):
    if '+' in pieces[-1]:
        return "."
    else:
        return "+"

Wait, but maybe the "closest-tag" is not the last element. Maybe "closest" refers to the most recent tag in some structure. But given the information, I think the best approach is to check the last element. 

Alternatively, maybe the "closest-tag" is the last tag in the list, so perhaps any element that is a tag. But without more context, the problem probably expects to check the last element. 

So the code should be as above. Let me test some cases. Suppose pieces is ["some", "text", "tag+"] then the last element is "tag+", which has '+', so return '.'. If the last element is "tag-", then return '+'. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the code is straightforward. Just check the last piece for presence of '+', return accordingly.
