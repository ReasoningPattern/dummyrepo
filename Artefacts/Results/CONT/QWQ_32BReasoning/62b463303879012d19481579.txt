Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element based on the provided docstring. The function is supposed to return possible values for number and sup from the contents of the issue.

Hmm, the function's name suggests that it's parsing some HTML element, maybe a tag related to an issue in a journal or something similar. The return values are likely extracting a number and a supplement indicator. Maybe the issue element has text like "5 suppl 1" or "3S" which would mean the number is 5 and the supplement is 1, or number 3 and supplement S.

First, I should think about how to process the text content of the issue element. Let's assume the input 'issue' is a BeautifulSoup element or similar, so we can get its text. So first step: get the text from the issue element, maybe using .text.strip().

Then, split the text into parts to find the number and supplement. The supplement might be indicated by words like 'suppl', 'supplement', 'S', or other abbreviations. Alternatively, maybe the number is the main part and any trailing 'suppl' part is the supplement.

Possible approach: split the text into parts, look for keywords like 'suppl', 'supplement', or 'S' and separate the number and supplement. For example, if the text is "2 suppl 3", then number is 2, supplement 3. If it's "4S1", maybe number is 4 and supplement S1?

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is any part after 'suppl' or similar. Need to handle different formats.

Another idea: use regular expressions to extract the number and supplement. Let's think of possible patterns.

Regular expression pattern could look for a number, followed by some indicator of supplement, then another number or letter. Maybe something like (\d+)\s*(suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]*)?

Wait, perhaps the number is the main issue number, and the supplement is any suffix that indicates a supplement. For example:

- "6 suppl 2" → number 6, supplement 2
- "3S" → number 3, supplement S
- "7a" → maybe the 'a' is a supplement, but not sure. Maybe the 'suppl' keyword is needed?

Alternatively, the presence of 'suppl' in the text might indicate that the supplement exists. So split the text into parts before and after 'suppl'.

So, first, split the text into parts. Let's take the text, split on whitespace and check for keywords.

Alternatively, using regex to capture the number and the supplement part.

Let me think of some test cases:

Case 1: "5 suppl 1" → number 5, supplement 1

Case 2: "3 suppl 2a" → number 3, supplement 2a

Case 3: "7S" → number 7, supplement S

Case 4: "8" → number 8, supplement None or empty string?

Case 5: "suppl 4" → maybe number is missing, so supplement 4?

Hmm, the function's docstring says "possible values", so maybe return the best guess even if not perfect. So perhaps the number is the first number found, and the supplement is any part after a 'suppl' keyword.

So, the plan is:

1. Extract the text from the issue element, stripping whitespace.

2. Split into parts, looking for 'suppl' or similar.

Alternatively, use a regex to capture the main number and any supplement.

Let me try to design a regex.

The regex could look for:

^(\d+)  # the main number

then possibly followed by some indicator (like 'suppl', 'S', etc.)

Then the supplement part. Maybe something like:

(\s*(?:suppl|supplement|S)\s+([A-Za-z0-9]+))? 

But this might be too specific. Alternatively, after the main number, look for any non-digit characters and then a supplement number.

Alternatively, the supplement could be any letters or numbers after a keyword like 'suppl'.

Alternatively, the regex could be:

r"(\d+)(?:\s+(suppl|supplement|S)\s+([A-Za-z0-9]+))?"

So, the first group is the number, the second group is the keyword (suppl etc.), and the third is the supplement value.

Wait, but in the case of "3S", the 'S' would be captured as the keyword, but then the third group would be empty? Hmm, maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the supplement can be captured as any letters or numbers after a 'suppl' part, but also consider cases where 'S' is part of the supplement.

Alternatively, maybe split the text into parts and check for keywords. Let's think step by step.

First, get the text. Let's say the text is stored in s.

s = issue.text.strip()

Then split into words. For example, split on whitespace:

parts = s.split()

Now, look for the keyword in the parts. For instance, if any part is 'suppl' or 'supplement', then the number before that is the main number, and the part after could be the supplement.

Alternatively, maybe the first number is the main number, and the supplement is any part after a keyword.

Alternatively, the main number is the first number found, and the supplement is any part after a 'suppl' keyword, or if 'S' is present, that could indicate a supplement.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of possible regex patterns again.

Another approach: the number is the first sequence of digits in the string. The supplement is any part that comes after a keyword like 'suppl' or 'S'.

Alternatively, the supplement could be any letters or numbers after 'suppl' or 'supplement' in the string.

So, perhaps:

First, find the main number: find the first occurrence of digits.

Then, check if there's a 'suppl' or similar term after that. If so, capture the supplement part.

Alternatively, the regex could be:

r"(\d+)(?:\s+(?:suppl|supplement|S)\s+([A-Za-z0-9]+))?"

This would match the number, then optionally the keyword and the supplement.

Let me test this regex with some examples:

Example 1: "5 suppl 1" → groups are '5', 'suppl', '1'

So the number is 5, supplement is 1.

Example 2: "3S" → the regex would not match because there's no space between 3 and S. So maybe the regex should account for that.

Alternatively, adjust the regex to allow for no space between the number and the S.

Hmm, perhaps the regex should be more flexible. Maybe:

r"(\d+)(?:\s*(?:suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+))?"

But then in "3S", the 'S' would be captured as the keyword, but the second group (the supplement) would be empty? Wait, no. Let me see:

In "3S", the regex would have:

- The first group is '3'

- Then, after the digits, we have 'S', which is matched by (?:suppl|supplement|S). Since it's exactly 'S', that's the keyword.

Then the next part is \s*([A-Za-z0-9]+). But after the S, there's nothing, so the [A-Za-z0-9]+ can't match. So the second group (supplement) would not be captured. So that case would not match the entire group.

Hmm, so maybe the regex isn't sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the supplement can be captured as the part after the keyword, even if it's directly attached. For example, in "3S1", the S is the keyword, and the supplement is "1"?

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is any non-digit that comes after the main number and before a digit? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the supplement can be captured as any letters or numbers after the keyword, but the keyword itself can be part of the supplement?

Alternatively, perhaps the supplement is everything after the keyword, but that might include spaces. So maybe:

The regex could be:

r"(\d+)(?:\s*(suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+))?"

Wait, but in "3S", the S is the keyword, and there's nothing after. So the third group would not match. So the supplement would be None or empty?

Alternatively, maybe the supplement can be the keyword itself if there's no further part. But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of 'S' indicates that the supplement is 'S', even without a number. So in "3S", the supplement is 'S'.

Hmm. Maybe the regex can be adjusted to capture the keyword as part of the supplement.

Alternatively, split into two parts: the main number is the first digits, and the supplement is any letters or numbers that come after a 'suppl' keyword, or the presence of an 'S' as part of the string.

Alternatively, perhaps the supplement is any part of the string after the main number that contains letters or numbers, but that might be too vague.

Alternatively, let's think of the problem differently. The function is to return possible values, so even if it's not perfect, the best attempt.

Maybe the approach is:

1. Extract the text, stripping whitespace.

2. Split into parts, looking for the first number (the main issue number).

3. Then check the rest of the string for any supplement indicators like 'suppl' followed by a number, or 'S' followed by something.

Alternatively, here's a possible step-by-step plan:

- Initialize number and supplement as None or empty strings.

- Find the first occurrence of a number in the text. That's the main number.

- Then, check the remaining text after the number for supplement indicators.

Alternatively, use split on the first occurrence of a non-digit after the number.

Hmm, perhaps code steps:

s = issue.text.strip()

number_part = re.match(r'^\d+', s)

if number_part:

    number = number_part.group()

    remaining = s[number_part.end():].strip()

    # Now look in remaining for supplement

    # Look for 'suppl' or 'supplement' followed by some characters

    suppl_match = re.search(r'(suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+)', remaining, re.IGNORECASE)

    if suppl_match:

        supplement = suppl_match.group(2)

    else:

        # check if there's an S in the remaining part without the keyword

        # like in '3S' case, the 'S' is part of the remaining

        # maybe check if remaining starts with 'S'

        if remaining and remaining[0].upper() == 'S':

            supplement = remaining

        else:

            supplement = None

else:

    # no number found, so maybe the entire text is the supplement?

    # but according to the problem, maybe return empty for number and supplement as the text?

    # Not sure. Maybe in that case, number is empty, supplement is the whole text?

    number = ''

    supplement = s

Wait, but this approach might miss some cases. Let's see.

Take the example "5 suppl 1":

- number is 5, remaining is 'suppl 1'.

The suppl_match would find 'suppl' followed by '1', so supplement is '1'.

Another example "3S" → s is '3S'.

number_part is '3', remaining is 'S'.

Then, in the remaining, the suppl_match would look for 'suppl' etc. Since 'S' is there, but the regex is case-insensitive? Wait, the regex is re.IGNORECASE, so 's' would match 'suppl'? No, because 'S' is one character. The regex is looking for 'suppl' or 'supplement' or 'S' as the first group. So in the remaining 'S', the first group would be 'S', then the second group would be the next characters. But there are none, so group 2 would not exist. So the suppl_match would not have group 2.

Hmm, so in this case, the code after would check if remaining starts with 'S' → yes, so supplement is 'S'.

Another example: "7suppl2" → s is "7suppl2"

number_part is '7', remaining is 'suppl2'.

Then, the regex would match 'suppl' (the first group) followed by '2' → group 2 is '2', so supplement is '2'.

Another case: "suppl4" → the number_part is None (since starts with 's'), so number is empty, supplement is 'suppl4'? Not sure. But according to the problem statement, maybe that's acceptable.

But perhaps the code should return the best possible values. Let's try to code this approach.

Now, coding this in Python:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    s = issue.text.strip()
    number = None
    supplement = None
    import re
    # Find the first number
    number_match = re.match(r'^\d+', s)
    if number_match:
        number = number_match.group()
        remaining = s[number_match.end():].strip()
        # Look for supplement in remaining
        suppl_match = re.search(r'(suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+)', remaining, re.IGNORECASE)
        if suppl_match:
            supplement = suppl_match.group(2)
        else:
            # Check if remaining starts with S (case-insensitive)
            if remaining and remaining[0].upper() == 'S':
                supplement = remaining
    else:
        # No number found. Maybe the whole text is supplement?
        # Or perhaps return empty for number and supplement as the text?
        # Let's set number as empty string and supplement as the entire text
        number = ''
        supplement = s
    return number, supplement

Wait, but in the case where the remaining after the number has 'supplement' but no following characters, like '3supplement', then group 2 would be empty, so supplement would be None. Hmm, but in that case, maybe the supplement is 'supplement'? Or not.

Alternatively, perhaps in such cases, the supplement is the keyword itself, but that might not be desired. The code as written would not capture it.

Alternatively, maybe adjust the regex to capture the keyword as part of the supplement. Or perhaps the code can check for the presence of the keyword and take the rest of the string as supplement.

Hmm, perhaps the regex could be adjusted to capture any characters after the keyword, even if there are spaces.

Wait, the current regex is:

r'(suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+)'

The second group requires [A-Za-z0-9]+, so if there is no such characters after the keyword and spaces, then it won't match. So in the case of 'suppl' with nothing after, it won't capture.

Hmm, perhaps that's okay. Because in that case, maybe the supplement is just 'suppl'? Not sure. The problem says "possible values", so maybe it's better to have something.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to capture everything after the keyword, including spaces and other characters.

Maybe changing the second group to .*? but that might be too greedy. Alternatively, [^,]* to capture until a comma or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can look for any occurrence of the keywords and take the rest as supplement.

Alternatively, maybe the code can split the remaining into parts and check for the keywords.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can look for any occurrence of the keywords and then take the following part, even if it's not strictly alphanumeric.

Alternatively, the problem might not require handling all edge cases, just the most common ones.

Another test case: "6 suppl" → remaining after number is 'suppl', so the regex's group 2 is not matched. So the code would check if the first character is S. 'suppl' starts with 's', so remaining[0].upper() is 'S', so supplement is 'suppl'.

So that would capture 'suppl' as the supplement, which might be acceptable.

Another case: "5supplement" → remaining is 'supplement', so first character is 's', so supplement is 'supplement'.

Hmm, perhaps that's okay, even if 'supplement' is the entire remaining.

Alternatively, maybe the code should check for any of the keywords, and then the supplement is the entire remaining part after the keyword.

Wait, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to capture everything after the keyword, including spaces and other characters.

Let me adjust the regex:

r'(?:suppl|supplement|S)\s*([^\d]*)' → but not sure.

Alternatively, the regex could capture everything after the keyword, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the regex can be:

r'\b(suppl|supplement|S)\b\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+)' → but that requires a word boundary.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe the code as written is sufficient for common cases.

Another possible case: "issue 7 suppl 3a" → the first number is 7, remaining is 'suppl 3a' → the regex would capture 'suppl' as first group, and '3a' as second group → supplement is '3a'.

That's good.

What about "8S1"? The text is "8S1".

number_match is '8', remaining is 'S1'.

The suppl_match would look for S followed by something. The regex would match 'S' as the first group, then the second group is '1'? Wait, no. Let's see:

The remaining after '8' is 'S1'. The regex is:

'(suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+)'

Looking at 'S1':

The first part matches 'S' (the first option), then \s* matches nothing, then the second group is [A-Za-z0-9]+ → '1' is matched. So supplement is '1'.

So that works.

Another case: "3S2" → same as above. 'S' is matched, then '2' → supplement is '2'.

Another case: "3S" → remaining is 'S', the regex's group 2 would be empty because after 'S', there are no characters. So the else clause would trigger, since the first character is S, so supplement is 'S'.

That's acceptable.

Another case where the remaining has 'supplement' but no following numbers: "4supplement" → remaining is 'supplement'. The first character is 's', so the else clause would set supplement to 'supplement'.

Hmm, but the user might want that to be considered as a supplement. So that's okay.

Another edge case: "12supplABC" → remaining is 'supplABC'. The regex would match 'suppl' as first group, then the second group is 'ABC' (since [A-Za-z0-9]+ matches letters and numbers). So supplement is 'ABC'.

Okay.

Now, what about the case where there's a number after the supplement keyword but also other letters? Like "5 suppl 2a" → supplement is '2a' which is captured correctly.

What about a case without any supplement indicators? Like "10" → then remaining is empty, so supplement is None. The code would return number 10, supplement None.

But the function's docstring says "possible values", so maybe supplement can be an empty string? The code currently sets supplement to None in that case.

Alternatively, maybe return empty strings instead of None.

Looking at the code: in the case where number is found but no supplement, supplement remains as None. So in the return, it would be (number, None). The problem says "possible values", so maybe returning None is okay, but perhaps better to return empty strings.

Alternatively, adjust the code to set supplement to an empty string if no match.

Let me think again.

In the code:

if number_match:

    ...

    else:

        if remaining and remaining[0].upper() == 'S':

            supplement = remaining

        else:

            supplement = None

So, in cases where remaining exists but doesn't start with S, supplement is None.

Else, if no number_match (number is None?), but in the code, if there's no number, then:

number = ''

supplement = s

Wait, in the else clause (no number_match), the code sets number to empty string and supplement to the entire text.

Hmm, perhaps that's okay. For example, if the issue is "suppl 5", then number is empty, supplement is "suppl 5".

But maybe in some cases, the number is after the supplement keyword? Like "suppl 3 4" → but the code would not capture the 4 as number because the first number is after the keyword.

Hmm, but the first number in the string is the first occurrence of digits, so in "suppl 3 4", the first number is 3, so number would be 3, remaining is ' 4' → then no supplement.

But that's okay.

Another case: "suppl 3a" → number is empty, supplement is "suppl 3a".

Hmm, but maybe the user wants to capture the '3a' as supplement even without the keyword. But according to the problem's docstring, the function is to return possible values, so perhaps that's acceptable.

Now, putting all this into code.

Wait, in the code above, the variables number and supplement are initialized as None. But in the case where number_match exists, but no supplement, supplement is set to None. Then, when returning, the function returns (number, supplement). But in Python, returning tuples with None is okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should return strings, so maybe set to empty strings instead of None. For example, if there's no supplement, return (number, '').

But the problem's docstring says "possible values", so maybe None is okay.

But in the case where no number is found, the code sets number to empty string and supplement to the entire text. So for example, if the text is "suppl", then number is '' and supplement is "suppl".

Alternatively, maybe the number should be None in that case, but the code uses empty string. Not sure which is better.

Alternatively, perhaps better to return the number as a string, so even if there's no number, it's an empty string, and supplement is also a string or empty.

So, in the code, the variables should be initialized as empty strings.

Let me adjust the code:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    s = issue.text.strip()
    number = ''
    supplement = ''
    import re
    number_match = re.match(r'^\d+', s)
    if number_match:
        number = number_match.group()
        remaining = s[number_match.end():].strip()
        suppl_match = re.search(r'(suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+)', remaining, re.IGNORECASE)
        if suppl_match:
            supplement = suppl_match.group(2)
        else:
            if remaining and remaining[0].upper() == 'S':
                supplement = remaining
    else:
        # No number found. Maybe the entire text is supplement?
        supplement = s
    return number, supplement

Wait, but in this case, the 'supplement' is initialized to empty string. If there's no supplement, then it remains empty. But in the first case where there's no supplement match, but remaining starts with S, then supplement is set to remaining. Otherwise, supplement stays empty.

Wait, but in the previous code, the else clause after the suppl_match:

if number_match:

    ... 

    else:

        if remaining and remaining[0].upper() == 'S':

            supplement = remaining

        else:

            supplement = ''

Wait, no, in this adjusted code, I removed the initial None assignments. Let me re-express.

Wait, the code now:

- number is initialized to empty string.

- supplement to empty string.

Then, if number_match exists:

- set number to the group.

- process remaining.

Then, if there's a suppl_match, set supplement to group(2).

Else, check if remaining starts with S → then set supplement to remaining.

Else, leave supplement as empty string (since it was initialized to empty).

If no number_match:

- set supplement to s (the entire text), and number remains as empty.

Thus, in cases where there is a number but no supplement, supplement remains empty.

In cases where there is a remaining starting with S but no suppl_match, supplement is set to remaining.

This way, the return values are always strings (empty if not found).

This seems better, as the function returns strings, which might be more consistent.

Testing this code:

Case 1: '5 suppl 1' → number '5', supplement '1'

Case 2: '3S' → remaining is 'S', so since first character is S, supplement is 'S'

Case 3: 'suppl 4' → no number_match, so number is empty, supplement is 'suppl 4'

Case 4: '7suppl' → remaining is 'suppl', which doesn't start with S (since 's' is lowercase?), but the code checks remaining[0].upper() → 'S' → so yes. So supplement is 'suppl'

Case 5: '12supplABC' → supplement is 'ABC'

Case 6: '8' → number '8', supplement ''

Case 7: 'issue 9 suppl 2a' → number is '9', supplement '2a'

Case 8: '10' → supplement is ''

Case 9: 'S2' → no number_match, so number is '', supplement is 'S2'

Hmm, in case 9, maybe the user would expect that the 'S2' is the supplement, which is captured correctly.

Another case: 'suppl 3' → supplement is 'suppl 3'

But the user might want the supplement to be '3', but since there's no number, perhaps the function can't know.

Overall, this code should handle most cases. Now, I need to write this as the code.

Wait, but in the code above, the 'supplement' variable is initialized to an empty string. In the case where remaining starts with S but there is no suppl_match (like 'suppl' in remaining), then supplement is set to remaining. For example, in '5 suppl', remaining is 'suppl', so supplement would be 'suppl'. But maybe the user would prefer 'suppl' as the supplement value, even if it's not a number. That's acceptable as per the problem's "possible values".

Now, coding this correctly:

Wait, in the code:

supplement = ''

if number_match:

    ... 

    else:

        if remaining and remaining[0].upper() == 'S':

            supplement = remaining

        else:

            # leave supplement as ''

So, that's correct.

Another point: in the regex, the group 2 is [A-Za-z0-9]+, so letters and numbers are allowed. So '2a' is allowed.

Now, putting all together.

The code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    s = issue.text.strip()
    number = ''
    supplement = ''
    import re
    number_match = re.match(r'^\d+', s)
    if number_match:
        number = number_match.group()
        remaining = s[number_match.end():].strip()
        suppl_match = re.search(r'(suppl|supplement|S)\s*([A-Za-z0-9]+)', remaining, re.IGNORECASE)
        if suppl_match:
            supplement = suppl_match.group(2)
        else:
            if remaining and remaining[0].upper() == 'S':
                supplement = remaining
    else:
        supplement = s
    return number, supplement

Wait, in the 'else' part of the number_match (when there is no number_match), the code sets supplement to s. But the number is kept as empty string, which is correct.

This should work for the cases considered.

Another test case: "6supplement" → remaining is 'supplement', which starts with 's' → so supplement is 'supplement'.

Yes.

Another edge case where the remaining has 'supplement' but no letters/numbers after:

s is 'supplement' → remaining is 'supplement' (since number is empty), so supplement is 'supplement'.

Okay.

Another case where after the number, there's 'supplement' but no following characters: "7supplement" → remaining is 'supplement', which starts with 's', so supplement is 'supplement'.

Thus, the code works.

Now, I think this code should fulfill the requirements as per the problem's docstring.
