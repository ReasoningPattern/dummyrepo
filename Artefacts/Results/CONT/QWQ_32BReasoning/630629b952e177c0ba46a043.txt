Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document based on the provided docstring. The function is supposed to return a formatted dictionary including the url and document_path. 

Hmm, the function signature has two parameters: url and an optional document_path which defaults to None. The docstring says the return is a dictionary with info like url and document_path. 

Wait, so the dictionary should at least have the 'url' key. And if document_path is provided, it should include that as well. But how exactly? Let me think. The function probably constructs a dictionary where 'url' is always present, and 'document_path' is included only if it's not None. 

So the basic structure would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    result = {'url': url}
    if document_path is not None:
        result['document_path'] = document_path
    return result

Does that make sense? Let me check the docstring again. The example mentions "including information such as url and document_path". So when document_path is given, it should be part of the dict. If it's not provided (i.e., None), then the dict won't have that key. 

Yes, that should work. I don't see any other requirements. The function is straightforward. Just build the dictionary conditionally. Alright, that's the code.
