Okay, I need to write the _get_resource_name_regex function. The docstring says it returns regular expressions for validating Krake resource names. Hmm, I remember that Kubernetes, which Krake is related to, has specific naming rules. Let me think about those.

Kubernetes resource names usually follow the DNS subdomain rule. The pattern is lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. They can't start or end with a hyphen. So the regex should match that.

The DNS subdomain regex is something like ^[a-z0-9](-*[a-z0-9])*$, but maybe with a maximum length? Wait, Kubernetes has a maximum length of 253 characters for resource names. Oh right, and the entire name must be between 1 and 253 characters.

Putting that together, the regex would start with ^[a-z0-9] and then have a repeating group of hyphen and more alphanumeric, ending with another [a-z0-9] before the end. Also, the whole thing must be 1-253 characters long. So maybe ^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*?[a-z0-9])?$ but with the length constraint. Wait, but how to express the length in regex? Maybe using {1,253} but that applies to the previous element, so perhaps the entire pattern should be enclosed in a group with that.

Alternatively, maybe the regex is ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*?[a-z0-9])?(?:[-a-z0-9]*)$? Not sure. Let me check. The standard DNS subdomain regex is ^[a-z0-9](-*[a-z0-9])*(-[a-z0-9]*)*$? Hmm, perhaps better to use ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$ and also enforce the length.

Wait, the exact regex for Kubernetes names is ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ which ensures that each label (if it's a subdomain) is up to 63 characters, but maybe for the entire name it's 253. Alternatively, the overall name must be 1-253 characters, lowercase, numbers, hyphens, can't start/end with hyphen.

So the regex should be:

^([a-z0-9](-*[a-z0-9])*){1,253}$ ?

No, that might not be right. Wait, perhaps the correct regex is ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$ but also with the length check. Wait, maybe the regex is:

^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ 

Wait, I think the exact regex for DNS subdomains (which is what Kubernetes uses for most names) is:

^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ 

But that's for each label in a domain, but a full name can't exceed 253 characters. Hmm, perhaps the function should return a regex that enforces the name to start and end with a letter or number, contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, and be between 1 and 253 characters long.

So the regex would be:

^([a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?|)$ 

Wait, maybe I should construct it as:

The regex should be:

^([a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?|)$ 

Wait, perhaps the correct regex is:

^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ 

That allows the first character to be alphanumeric, then up to 61 characters (so total length of the segment can be 63?), but maybe that's for each component in a domain. Wait, the full name (like a pod name) must be a valid DNS label, which is up to 63 characters, but the entire name can't exceed 253. But perhaps for Krake's purposes, the regex is for a single label, not a full subdomain. Wait, the question says "name of the Krake resources". So the resource name must be a valid DNS label, which is the same as the rules I mentioned earlier.

So the regex would be:

^([a-z0-9](-*[a-z0-9])*)?$ but also ensuring the total length is between 1-63 (since DNS labels are up to 63 characters). Wait, but maybe Krake allows up to 253? Not sure, but perhaps the standard is 63 characters. Let me confirm.

Looking it up, Kubernetes names must be 63 characters or less, and conform to the DNS label format. So the regex should ensure that the name is between 1-63 characters, starts and ends with a letter or number, and contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

So the regex would be:

^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ 

The 61 in the middle allows for the first and last character to be alphanumeric, so total length is 2 + 61 = 63.

Therefore, the function should return this regex. So the code would be returning this as a string, perhaps with re.ASCII or other flags? Probably not, since the regex is straightforward.

Therefore, the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    return r"^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$"

Wait, but maybe Krake uses a slightly different regex? The question says to return the regex used to validate the name. Since the user is asking for the regex, perhaps that's the correct one. Let me see if there's any other constraints. Also, maybe the regex should be case-insensitive? No, because Kubernetes requires lowercase. So the regex is correct as above.

Alternatively, maybe the regex includes the length check with {1,63}, but the regex above already enforces that via the {0,61} in the middle. Let me see:

The first character is [a-z0-9], then the next part is [a-z0-9-]{0,61}, then another [a-z0-9], so total length is 1 + (0-61) + 1. So the total can be up to 63 (1 + 61 +1). That's correct. So yes, that regex works.

Therefore, the function should return this regex as a raw string.
