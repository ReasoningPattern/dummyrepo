Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _run_playbook function based on the provided signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the parameters. The function takes cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. The docstring says it runs the ansible cli with vars_dict as extra-vars. 

First, I should import any necessary modules. Since it's dealing with Ansible, maybe the subprocess module is needed to run commands. Wait, but Infrared's Workspace and Plugin objects might have their own methods. The parameters include an Infrared Workspace object and an InfraredPlugin object. So perhaps the function uses those objects to handle the environment.

The vars_dict needs to be passed as extra-vars to Ansible. Normally, that's done via --extra-vars or -e. Since it's a dictionary, I might need to convert it into a format that can be passed as command-line arguments. Maybe using json.dumps to serialize the dictionary. 

The cli_args are a list of command-line arguments. So the full command would be the cli_args plus the extra-vars part. The function should probably construct the full command list, then execute it using subprocess or something similar. But how does Infrared's Workspace and Plugin come into play here?

Wait, maybe the ir_workspace has methods to set up the environment, like setting the correct directory or handling dependencies. The ir_plugin might have the playbook path or other plugin-specific configurations. Alternatively, the function might use the plugin's run method. Let me think: Infrared plugins often have a run method that takes arguments. Maybe the ir_plugin.run() is the way to go here. 

So, perhaps the code would use the ir_plugin's run method, passing the cli_args and the vars_dict as extra_vars. Let me check the parameters again. The vars_dict is passed as Ansible extra-vars, so in Infrared, when you run a plugin, you can pass extra_vars. The cli_args are the list of command line arguments, so maybe they are passed as part of the args. 

Putting it together: the function would call ir_plugin.run with the cli_args, and the vars_dict as the extra_vars parameter. But also, maybe the ir_workspace is used to set the current workspace. Wait, the ir_workspace is an active workspace, so maybe it's already set, and we don't need to do anything with it here. 

Alternatively, the function might need to activate the workspace first, but since it's given as a parameter, perhaps it's already active. The main point is to run the Ansible playbook using the plugin's run method with the provided variables and CLI arguments. 

So the code would look something like:

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    return ir_plugin.run(cli_args, extra_vars=vars_dict)

Wait, but maybe the cli_args are part of the arguments passed to the plugin's run method. Let me think: In Infrared's plugin, the run method might take the command line arguments, so the cli_args list is passed as the first argument. The extra_vars would be passed as a keyword argument. 

Alternatively, the cli_args could be the list of arguments to pass to the Ansible command, so when combined with the extra vars. But using the plugin's API would abstract that. 

Therefore, the correct approach is to use the plugin's run method, passing the cli_args and the vars_dict as extra_vars. The return value would be the result from the plugin's run, which presumably is the ansible results. 

I should also make sure that the parameters are correctly handled. The cli_args is a list, so when passed to the plugin's run, maybe it's already in the correct format. The vars_dict is passed as a dictionary to the extra_vars parameter. 

So the code should be straightforward. The function just calls the plugin's run method with those parameters. The other parameters (ir_workspace and ir_plugin) are part of the function's inputs but may not be directly used in the call, unless the plugin requires the workspace. But since the workspace is already active, perhaps it's handled by the plugin's context. 

Therefore, the code would be as I thought before. Let me write that.
