Okay, I need to write a Python function called fix_namespace_prefix_w. The goal is to replace all occurrences of "w:st=" with "w-st=" in the given content. Let me think about how to approach this.

Hmm, the function takes a string called content. So the task is a string replacement. The simplest way is to use the replace() method. So I can return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st="). Wait, but are there any edge cases? Like, what if the string has parts that partially match, but that's probably not an issue here. The problem statement seems straightforward.

Wait, maybe the function should be case-sensitive? The example uses lowercase, so probably the replacement is exact. So the code is pretty simple. Just do the replacement.

So the code would be:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

That's it. I don't see any other considerations here. The function doesn't need to handle anything else as per the docstring's instruction. Let me double-check the docstring. Yep, it says exactly to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=". So that's all that's needed.
