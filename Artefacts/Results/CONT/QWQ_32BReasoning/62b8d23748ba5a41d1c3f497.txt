Okay, I need to implement the popitem method for a class that's supposed to remove and return the least frequently used (LFU) item. Hmm, so first, I should think about how the class is structured. Since it's about LFU, there's probably a way to track the frequency of each key's usage. 

Wait, maybe the class has a dictionary to store the keys and their counts. Like, a hash map where each key maps to its frequency. And another structure to keep track of the items grouped by their frequency, so that when you need the least frequent, you can find the minimum frequency and get an item from that group.

Oh right, like a typical LFU cache implementation. So maybe there's a 'freq_table' which maps frequencies to a list or a queue of keys at that frequency. And each key has a 'count' stored somewhere. Also, the actual values are stored in another dictionary.

So when popitem is called, the goal is to find the smallest frequency, then get any key from that frequency group, then decrease the frequency count, and if the count reaches zero, remove that key from the frequency group. Also, need to update the main storage.

Wait, but how exactly is the data structured here? Let me think of the possible instance variables. The class might have:

- A dictionary called 'counts' where counts[key] is the current frequency of that key.
- A dictionary called 'freq_groups' where freq_groups[freq] is a structure (like a deque) holding all keys with that frequency.
- The actual values are stored in a 'cache' dictionary: cache[key] = value.

So, when you popitem, you first find the minimum frequency present. The minimum frequency can be tracked, maybe with a variable like 'min_freq', but if that's not maintained, you have to find the minimum key in freq_groups each time. Hmm, maybe the min_freq is tracked so that you can quickly get the smallest frequency.

Once you have the min_freq, you take a key from the freq_groups[min_freq], say the first one. Then, you remove that key from the group. If the group becomes empty after removal, you might need to update the min_freq next time. Also, you need to get the value associated with that key from the cache, then remove the key from counts and the cache.

Wait, but the problem here is that the popitem method is supposed to return the (key, value) pair. So, the steps would be:

1. Find the current minimum frequency. Let's say min_freq is the smallest key in freq_groups.

2. Get the first key from the list in freq_groups[min_freq]. Let's say we use a deque, so popleft() is O(1).

3. Retrieve the value from the cache using that key.

4. Remove the key from the counts and the cache.

5. Also, check if the freq_groups[min_freq] is now empty. If so, we might need to remove that key from freq_groups, so that next time the min_freq is higher.

But how is the min_freq tracked? Maybe the class has a variable like self.min_freq, which is updated whenever necessary. For instance, when adding a new item, if the current min_freq was 1 and the new item's count becomes 0, then the min_freq would increase.

Alternatively, in the popitem method, if after removing the key from the group, the group is empty, then we can just increment the min_freq next time. Hmm, but in this case, when we remove the key, we need to check if the group is now empty.

So putting this into code, perhaps the steps are:

First, check if freq_groups is empty. If so, raise an error? But the method's docstring says to remove and return, so maybe it's assumed that there is at least one item.

But let's proceed.

In the code:

def popitem(self):

    # Find the min frequency. Let's say the keys of freq_groups are the frequencies. The min is the smallest key.

    min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())  # but this is O(n) if there are many frequencies. Hmm, maybe the class has a self.min_freq variable that's maintained.

    # Wait, perhaps in the class's design, there is a self.min_freq variable. So in the popitem method, we can use that.

    # But since I'm writing the code for popitem, I need to refer to the existing structure.

    # Let's assume that the class has the necessary variables. So:

    min_freq = self.min_freq

    # Now get the first key in the freq_groups[min_freq]

    key_list = self.freq_groups[min_freq]

    key = key_list.pop(0)  # Or pop from the front, like a deque's popleft()

    # Wait, maybe the freq_groups entries are deques. So:

    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].popleft()

    # Now get the value from the cache.

    value = self.cache[key]

    # Remove the key from counts and cache.

    del self.counts[key]

    del self.cache[key]

    # Now check if the freq group for min_freq is now empty.

    if not self.freq_groups[min_freq]:

        del self.freq_groups[min_freq]

        # Now, since this group is empty, the next min_freq would be higher. So we need to update self.min_freq.

        # But how? Maybe set it to min(self.freq_groups) again, but that's O(n). Alternatively, since we removed the min_freq group, the new min is the next possible.

        # Alternatively, if after deletion, the freq_groups is empty, but that can't be because we just popped an item, so there must be at least one?

        # Wait, no. Suppose the last item in the min_freq group was removed. Then the group is removed from freq_groups. So the next min_freq would have to be the next smallest in the remaining keys. But if the freq_groups is now empty, that would mean the cache is empty. But in that case, since we just popped the last item, that's okay.

        # So perhaps after removing the key, if the group is empty, we need to update the min_freq. But how?

        # Maybe set self.min_freq to min_freq +1, but that's not correct. For example, if the next available frequency is higher, but maybe there's a lower one?

        # Hmm, this suggests that the self.min_freq is not properly maintained here. Maybe the correct approach is to reset self.min_freq to the next minimum in the freq_groups, but that requires checking all keys again, which is O(n). Not ideal, but perhaps acceptable for this method.

        # Alternatively, maybe the class maintains self.min_freq properly in other methods (like when incrementing the frequency), so here, after removing the group, the next min_freq would be the next smallest available. But in the popitem method, perhaps the only way is to set self.min_freq to the next min if the current group is empty. 

        # Since this is part of the popitem method, perhaps the code would have to handle that. Let me think of an example.

        # Suppose the min_freq was 1, and after removing the last key in that group, then the next min_freq would be the next smallest in the remaining freq_groups. So, perhaps:

        if not self.freq_groups:

            self.min_freq = float('inf')  # or some default, but this might be handled elsewhere.

        else:

            self.min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())

    # Now return the key and value.

    return (key, value)

Wait, but in this code, there are a few assumptions about the instance variables. The code would require that the class has:

- self.freq_groups, a dictionary mapping frequency to a collection (like deque) of keys at that frequency.

- self.counts, a dictionary mapping keys to their current frequency.

- self.cache, a dictionary mapping keys to their values.

Additionally, the self.min_freq variable must be maintained. So when adding a new key, or updating frequencies, the min_freq is set appropriately. But in the popitem method, after removing a key from the min_freq group, we have to check if that group is now empty, and if so, update the min_freq to the next minimum.

But the problem is, how does the code for popitem know the next minimum? It would have to iterate through the keys of freq_groups again, which could be O(n). However, given that this is part of the method's logic, perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a different structure. For example, using a linked list or ordered structure for the frequencies. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is designed such that the min_freq is only tracked, and when the current min_freq group is emptied, the next min_freq is found by incrementing until a non-empty group is found. But that could take O(k) time where k is the number of possible frequencies between the old min and the next.

Hmm, perhaps in this code, the simplest way is to recalculate the min_freq after removing the group if it's empty.

So, the code would look like:

def popitem(self):

    # Find the current minimum frequency.

    min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())

    # Get the first key in the min_freq group.

    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].pop()

    # Or maybe using popleft if using deque. Let's assume it's a deque.

    # Wait, perhaps the code uses a deque, so:

    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].popleft()

    value = self.cache[key]

    del self.cache[key]

    del self.counts[key]

    if not self.freq_groups[min_freq]:

        del self.freq_groups[min_freq]

        # Now, find the new min_freq.

        if self.freq_groups:

            self.min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())

        else:

            self.min_freq = 0  # or some default, but maybe it's okay to set to infinity?

    return (key, value)

Wait, but in this case, the code would have to call min again, which might be slow if there are many frequencies, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a self.min_freq variable that's maintained. Let's say in the code above, after popping the key, if the group is empty, we check all the keys in freq_groups to find the new min_freq.

But in the code I'm supposed to write, I have to implement the method based on the given function signature and docstring. The problem is, without knowing the exact data structures used in the class, but since this is part of a class (the method is def popitem(self)), I have to make assumptions about the instance variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the class is a simple dictionary that tracks the frequency of each key's access, and when you popitem, you iterate through all keys to find the one with the smallest count. But that would be O(n) each time, which is not efficient but possible for a simple implementation.

Wait, but the question says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So maybe the code is for a class that already has the necessary data structures. The user expects that the code uses those structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that uses a Counter or similar, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the class is a simple LFU cache, and the code is supposed to implement the popitem method as described.

In any case, the code must be written based on the method's responsibility to remove and return the least frequently used item.

Assuming that the class has a frequency dictionary (like self.freq) and a min_freq variable, and a cache (self.cache), here's another approach.

Suppose:

- self.cache: key to value.

- self.freq: key to its frequency count.

- self.min_freq: the current minimum frequency.

Then, to find the least used item, you need to find any key with the min_freq, then among those, perhaps the oldest one (if considering LFU with a tiebreaker of LRU). But the problem's docstring doesn't mention tiebreakers, so maybe just any key with the lowest frequency.

So steps:

1. Find all keys with frequency equal to self.min_freq.

2. Choose any of them (maybe the first one encountered).

3. Remove that key from all structures, and decrease the min_freq if necessary.

Wait, but how do you track which key to pick?

Alternatively, perhaps the class has a dictionary for each frequency level, storing the keys at that frequency in a list or deque, ordered by insertion/access time. But without knowing the exact data structure, it's hard to code.

Hmm, perhaps the code is supposed to be part of a class that uses a linked list or something else. But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the code is for a class that uses a dictionary to track frequencies and a min-heap to track the least frequent items. The heap could store tuples of (frequency, timestamp, key), so that the least frequent and oldest is popped first.

In that case, the code would:

- The heap is stored as self.heap.

- When popping, you pop the smallest element (frequency, then timestamp), then check if that key's current frequency is still the same as the stored frequency. If not, skip it (since it might have been accessed again after being added to the heap).

But this requires checking and might need to re-heapify, which can be tricky.

Alternatively, the code might use a heap where each entry is (count, last_used_time, key), and when you pop, you check if the current count of the key matches the stored count. If not, skip and pop the next.

But that's getting complicated.

Hmm, perhaps the code is simpler. Let me think of the most straightforward approach, even if not the most efficient.

Suppose the class has a dictionary self.count storing the frequency of each key, and self.cache storing the key-value pairs.

Then, to find the least used:

- Iterate through all keys in self.cache to find the one with the smallest count. If multiple keys have the same min count, pick any (maybe the first one).

But this is O(n) each time, which is acceptable for small data.

So the code would be something like:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.cache:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): empty structure")
    min_freq = float('inf')
    lfu_key = None
    for key in self.cache:
        if self.count[key] < min_freq:
            min_freq = self.count[key]
            lfu_key = key
        elif self.count[key] == min_freq:
            # could pick the first occurrence, but here just keep the first found
            # so no change
            pass
    # Now, lfu_key is the key with the smallest count
    value = self.cache.pop(lfu_key)
    del self.count[lfu_key]
    # Also, check if the min_freq was this one's, and if there are no other keys with min_freq, then update min_freq?
    # But maybe not, since next time it will re-scan.
    return (lfu_key, value)

Wait, but this requires that the class has self.count and self.cache as instance variables.

But in this case, the code would work, but it's O(n) each time. The problem's docstring doesn't specify performance requirements, so maybe this is acceptable.

However, the problem might expect a more efficient implementation using a frequency-based structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that uses a defaultdict for frequencies and a variable to track the minimum frequency, along with a dictionary to track the keys for each frequency.

Like:

self.freq = { key: count }

self.freq_groups = { count: set_of_keys }

self.min_freq = the current minimal frequency.

Then, when you popitem:

1. Find the current min_freq (self.min_freq)

2. Get any key from freq_groups[min_freq]

3. Remove that key from freq_groups[min_freq], and also from freq and cache.

4. If the set for min_freq is now empty, remove it from freq_groups and set min_freq to the next smallest in freq_groups.

So in code:

def popitem(self):
    min_freq = self.min_freq
    # Get a key from freq_groups[min_freq]
    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].pop()
    # Or iterate through the set and pick one? Or use a different structure like a deque.
    # Suppose it's stored as a set, then you can just pop any element, but sets don't have order.
    # Alternatively, use a list or deque.
    # Let's assume that it's stored as a deque in freq_groups.
    # So:
    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].pop()  # or popleft()
    value = self.cache.pop(key)
    del self.freq[key]
    if not self.freq_groups[min_freq]:
        del self.freq_groups[min_freq]
        # Now find the new min_freq
        if self.freq_groups:
            self.min_freq = min(self.freq_groups)
        else:
            self.min_freq = 0  # or some default?
    return (key, value)

But this requires that the freq_groups are stored as something like deque or list, so that you can pop an element. If it's a set, you can't pop arbitrary elements easily, so perhaps a deque is better.

Alternatively, using a list and popping from the end.

But this requires that the code maintains the freq_groups correctly elsewhere.

Overall, the code would look something like that. Since I'm to write the code without knowing the exact data structures, but the problem expects the code to be written, I'll have to make an assumption.

Probably, the class uses a structure where for each frequency, there's a deque of keys. The min_freq is tracked. So the code would be something like:

def popitem(self):
    min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())
    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].popleft()
    value = self.cache[key]
    del self.cache[key]
    del self.count[key]
    if not self.freq_groups[min_freq]:
        del self.freq_groups[min_freq]
        if self.freq_groups:
            self.min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())
        else:
            self.min_freq = 0  # or some default
    return (key, value)

Wait, but this uses min each time, which could be O(n). But perhaps in the problem's context, this is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the self.min_freq is already tracked, so the code uses that instead of calculating min each time.

In that case:

def popitem(self):
    min_freq = self.min_freq
    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].popleft()
    value = self.cache.pop(key)
    del self.count[key]
    if not self.freq_groups[min_freq]:
        del self.freq_groups[min_freq]
        # Now find the next min_freq
        if self.freq_groups:
            self.min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())
        else:
            self.min_freq = 0  # or some other value
    return (key, value)

This assumes that the class has the necessary variables and that the min_freq is maintained.

Given that the problem requires generating the code based on the function signature and docstring, I'll proceed with this approach. The code must be written as a method in a class, so I'll have to make sure the instance variables are accessed correctly.

So the final code would look like this, using the assumed variables (freq_groups, cache, count, min_freq). The code uses popleft from a deque structure in freq_groups.

Wait, but how is the key stored in the freq_groups? Let me adjust:

Suppose that freq_groups is a defaultdict(deque), so each entry is a deque. Then:

def popitem(self):
    min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())
    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].popleft()
    value = self.cache[key]
    del self.cache[key]
    del self.count[key]
    if not self.freq_groups[min_freq]:
        del self.freq_groups[min_freq]
        if self.freq_groups:
            min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())
            self.min_freq = min_freq  # update the min_freq variable
        else:
            self.min_freq = 0
    return (key, value)

Hmm, but this uses min again. Alternatively, if the class has a self.min_freq variable that's tracked:

def popitem(self):
    min_freq = self.min_freq
    key = self.freq_groups[min_freq].popleft()
    value = self.cache.pop(key)
    del self.count[key]
    if not self.freq_groups[min_freq]:
        del self.freq_groups[min_freq]
        if self.freq_groups:
            self.min_freq = min(self.freq_groups.keys())
        else:
            self.min_freq = 0  # or some other default
    return (key, value)

This code uses self.min_freq, and when the current min_freq's group is empty, it recalculates the new min_freq from the remaining keys.

This seems plausible. I'll proceed with this.
