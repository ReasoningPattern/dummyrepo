Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _create_in_regex method based on the given docstring. Let's see. The method is supposed to return a compiled regular expression pattern for an "in-style" parameter. 

Hmm, what's an in-style parameter? Probably something like a parameter that matches values in a list, maybe like 'param IN (value1, value2)'. So the regex should capture that structure.

The docstring says it returns a Pattern object, which is from the re module. So I need to use re.compile with the appropriate regex pattern.

Let me think about the structure. The parameter name could be any word, maybe [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*. Then "IN" is probably case-insensitive, so I should make the regex case-insensitive with re.IGNORECASE. The values are in parentheses, separated by commas. So something like:

param_name followed by 'IN' (case-insensitive), then a space, then parentheses with comma-separated values.

So the regex pattern might look like r'(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]+)\)'. But the flags need to be re.IGNORECASE. Wait, the 'IN' part should match regardless of case, so adding the flag is important.

Breaking it down:

- \w+ captures the parameter name.
- \s+ for whitespace after the name.
- IN (case-insensitive due to the flag)
- \s+ more whitespace
- \( matches the literal parenthesis
- [^)]+ captures the values inside, but maybe better to split on commas later.

Alternatively, maybe the values can be captured as a group, splitting them into individual items. But the regex here just needs to match the entire structure. The actual capturing groups might be needed for extracting the parameter name and the list of values. 

Wait, the method's purpose is to create the regex for matching such parameters, so the pattern should correctly identify the parameter name and the list of values. The returned Pattern can then be used to search strings and extract those groups.

So the regex pattern would be r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]+)\)', but with the case-insensitive flag. The \s* allows for optional whitespace around IN and the parentheses. That might be better to make it more flexible.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

return re.compile(r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]+)\)', re.IGNORECASE)

Wait, but the closing parenthesis must be present. The [^)]+ ensures that it goes until the closing ), but the entire group should be captured. 

Yes, that should work. So the method compiles this regex and returns it. 

I think that's it. Let me make sure there's no mistakes. The regex groups: first group is the parameter name, second is the comma-separated values inside the parentheses. The flags are set for case insensitivity. So the code is correct.
