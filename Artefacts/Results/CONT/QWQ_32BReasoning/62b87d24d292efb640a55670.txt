Okay, I need to write the get_versions() function based on the given docstring. The function should obtain version information and return a default if it can't. Hmm, how do I get version info in Python? Maybe check common places like a VERSION file or a package's __version__.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify where the version is stored. Oh right, since it's a general function, maybe it's supposed to read from a file or use some standard method. Let's think of a typical setup. Often, versions are stored in a version.py file or in the package's __init__.py. Alternatively, maybe using importlib.metadata to get the package version.

But the function's docstring doesn't mention any specific source. Maybe the default is returned when an exception occurs. So perhaps try to read from a file first. Let's outline steps:

1. Try to open a version file, like 'VERSION' in the project root. Read its content.
2. If that fails (FileNotFoundError), maybe check the package's version via __version__ attribute.
3. If all methods fail, return the default value. What's the default? The doc says "the default value is returned" but doesn't specify. Maybe an empty string or 'unknown'? Let's assume 'unknown' as a common default.

Wait, the problem says to return the default if cannot obtain. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps the default is an empty string or a specific value. Let's go with 'unknown' as the default.

So code steps:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('VERSION', 'r') as f:
            version = f.read().strip()
        return version
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Maybe check the package's __version__?
        try:
            from . import __version__
            return __version__
        except (ImportError, AttributeError):
            pass
    # If all else fails
    return 'unknown'

Wait, but the function's name is get_versions() with an 's'â€”plural. Maybe it's supposed to return multiple versions? The docstring isn't clear. Hmm, maybe it's a single version. The user's docstring says "version information", which could be a string. Let me recheck the problem. The function's return isn't specified, but the doc says "version information". Since the user hasn't given more details, I'll proceed with the single version approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary of versions for different components. But without specifics, maybe the simplest approach is to read from a VERSION file, and default to 'unknown'.

Alternatively, maybe using pkg_resources to get the package version. Like:

import pkg_resources

def get_versions():
    try:
        return pkg_resources.require("my_package")[0].version
    except:
        return 'unknown'

But the package name isn't known. Since the problem is general, maybe the code should be generic. But without knowing where the version is stored, perhaps the code can't be precise. The user might expect a simple example that uses a try block and returns a default. Let's proceed with the file approach and then a default.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return a default of '0.0.0' or similar. But the problem says "the default value is returned" but doesn't specify. So maybe just return an empty string or 'unknown' as the default.

Putting it all together, the code would have a try block to read a file, and if that fails, return the default. Let me write the code accordingly.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary or a tuple. Since the function's name is get_versions (plural), perhaps it's expecting multiple versions. But without more info, maybe it's better to return a single string. Alternatively, maybe the default is a tuple like ('unknown', 'unknown') but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a project where the version is stored in a variable, and the code is supposed to retrieve that. Since the problem is vague, perhaps the code is expected to use a try-except to read a VERSION file and return that, else 'unknown'.

So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('VERSION') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except:
        return 'unknown'

Wait, but catching all exceptions might be too broad. Better to catch specific ones like FileNotFoundError. Because if there's a permission error, that's also an issue. Or maybe IOError. Let's adjust:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('VERSION', 'r') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except (FileNotFoundError, IOError):
        return 'unknown'

But maybe the default is 'unknown', and the function can also try other methods. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a default of '0.1' or similar. But the problem states the default is to be returned when cannot obtain, but the default's value isn't specified. So perhaps just return an empty string, but the user's example may prefer 'unknown'.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use a version from __version__ in the same module. For example, if the module has a __version__ variable, then return that. Otherwise, check a file, else default.

Hmm, perhaps the code can be structured as:

def get_versions():
    try:
        from . import __version__
        return __version__
    except ImportError:
        pass
    try:
        with open('VERSION') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    return 'unknown'

But this is getting more complex. Since the problem's docstring is minimal, maybe the intended solution is a simple try-except that reads a file and returns 'unknown' if it fails. Let me go with that.

Wait, but in the problem's function signature, the return type isn't specified. The doc says "version information", which could be a string. So the code should return a string. The default is 'unknown' when it can't be obtained.

So the final code would be:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('VERSION', 'r') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except:
        return 'unknown'

Wait, but catching all exceptions is bad practice. Maybe better to catch specific exceptions like FileNotFoundError. Let me adjust:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('VERSION', 'r') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except (FileNotFoundError, IOError):
        return 'unknown'

But maybe the VERSION file isn't present, leading to FileNotFoundError. The except block should handle that. Alternatively, using a more general exception but not catching everything. Alternatively, perhaps the code should use a try block and return the default on any exception.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a tuple of versions from different sources, but without more info, it's hard to say. Given the problem's brevity, I think the simplest approach is to read a VERSION file and return 'unknown' if it can't be read. So the code would be as above.

Wait, but in some projects, the version is stored in the package's __init__.py as __version__. So maybe the code should check that first. For example:

def get_versions():
    try:
        from . import __version__
        return __version__
    except ImportError:
        pass
    try:
        with open('VERSION') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    return 'unknown'

This tries the package's __version__ first, then the file, then defaults. But without knowing the package structure, this might not be portable. However, the problem states to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, so perhaps this approach is acceptable.

Alternatively, the problem might expect using a try block to get the version via some method and return a default. Since the exact method isn't specified, perhaps the code is supposed to return a default value of 'unknown' in all cases except when a version is found. But how to find it?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return sys.version or something, but that's unlikely. The doc says "version information" in general. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary of versions for dependencies, but without more info, that's hard to code.

Given the ambiguity, the best approach is to write a simple function that tries to read a VERSION file and returns a default if it can't. So here's the code:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('VERSION') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except:
        return 'unknown'

Wait, but catching all exceptions might include things like permission errors, which are also cases where the version can't be obtained. So the except block is okay here. Alternatively, better to specify the exceptions. Let me use:

except (FileNotFoundError, IOError):

But in Python 3, IOError is an alias for OSError, so maybe FileNotFoundError is more precise. The open can fail due to that. So:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('VERSION', 'r') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except (FileNotFoundError):
        return 'unknown'

But what if the file exists but can't be read (like permission denied)? Then it would raise a PermissionError, which is a subclass of OSError. So perhaps the except should catch OSError.

Alternatively, catch all exceptions and return the default. The problem's doc says if can't obtain, return default, so any exception in obtaining the version should trigger the default. So the broad except is acceptable here for simplicity.

But in production code, catching all exceptions is bad, but since the problem is to generate code based on the given info, perhaps it's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a default of an empty string. But the problem says "the default value is returned" without specifics, so 'unknown' is a safe choice.

So the final code would be as written.
