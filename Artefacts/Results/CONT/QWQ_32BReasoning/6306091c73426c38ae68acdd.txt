Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method validate_from_file based on the provided docstring and function signature. Let's see. The method is a class method since it has 'cls' as the first parameter. The goal is to load a YAML file, check if all required fields are present, and raise an exception if something's missing.

First, I should start by importing necessary modules. Since it's dealing with YAML, I'll need pyyaml's safe_load. Also, the docstring mentions raising an IRValidatorException, so that exception must be imported. Wait, but maybe the exception is defined elsewhere in the codebase, so I'll just reference it.

The parameters: the yaml_file can be None, but probably if it's None, we might need to use a default? Or maybe the function expects it to be provided. The docstring says to raise an exception when mandatory data is missing, so the main steps are:

1. Open the YAML file.
2. Load its contents into a dictionary.
3. Check if all required fields are present. But how do I know which fields are required? The docstring doesn't specify. Hmm, maybe the class (cls) has a list of required fields stored somewhere, like cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS or something similar. Since the method is part of a class, I assume that the required fields are defined as a class attribute. I'll have to include that assumption in the code.

So steps in code:

- Open the file, read it. So use open(yaml_file, 'r') and then safe_load. But need to handle file not found. Wait the docstring says to raise the specific exception when mandatory data is missing, but what about file not found? The docstring doesn't mention that. Maybe that's a different exception, like a FileNotFoundError, which the function doesn't catch, so it would propagate. But the user might need to handle that separately.

Once the data is loaded, check each required field. Iterate over the required fields (from cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS) and see if each is present in the data. If any are missing, collect them and raise the exception with a message.

Wait, but maybe the required fields are nested? The problem doesn't specify that, so I'll assume all required fields are top-level keys. So:

required = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
for field in required:
    if field not in data:
        missing.append(field)

Then if missing is not empty, raise IRValidatorException with a message like "Missing required fields: {}".format(missing)

Then return the data.

Putting it all together:

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    missing = []
    required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            missing.append(field)
    if missing:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {', '.join(missing)}")
    return data

Wait, but the function is a class method, so the first parameter is cls. So the code should use cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS directly instead of using getattr. But maybe the class might not have that attribute? To avoid an AttributeError, perhaps using getattr with a default is better. So maybe required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])

Alternatively, the code could assume that the class must have REQUIRED_FIELDS, but to be safe, perhaps the getattr is better. So I'll include that.

Also, need to import yaml and the exception. Since the code is part of a class, the imports would be at the top. But the problem says to only output the code for the function. So I don't need to include the imports in the method's code.

Wait, the code must be self-contained. Wait the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". The code should be the method's implementation. So the code would include the required steps, assuming that the exception and yaml are imported elsewhere.

Wait, but in the code, to use yaml.safe_load, I need to have imported yaml from pyyaml. So in the code, I should have imported yaml? But the problem states to output only the code for the function. So perhaps in the code, the function uses yaml.safe_load, assuming that 'yaml' is already imported.

Putting it all together, the code would look like:

Wait, also, the method is a class method, so it should be decorated with @classmethod. Oh right, the function signature starts with def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None): so the decorator is needed.

So adding the @classmethod decorator.

So the code:

from some_package import IRValidatorException
import yaml

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        ...

But the problem says to output only the code for the function. So the code should start with the @classmethod, then the def.

Wait the user's instruction says to output the code generated, in Python markdown format. But the user provided the function signature, so the code should be the method's code. So the code would be:

Wait the function is a class method, so the code must include the @classmethod decorator.

So the code would be:

@classmethod
def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
    missing = []
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            missing.append(field)
    if missing:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {', '.join(missing)}")
    return data

Wait but in the code, the 'yaml' module is referenced. Since the code is part of a larger module that would have imported yaml, but the problem's code should not include the imports. So that's okay.

Wait, but what if the yaml module is imported as yaml? The code uses yaml.safe_load, so that's correct.

Another thing: the function's docstring says to raise the exception when mandatory data is missing. So the code checks the required fields. But what if the YAML file is empty or invalid? The safe_load would return None, so data would be None, and then checking for keys would cause an error. So perhaps need to handle that case.

Wait, if the YAML is invalid, safe_load would throw an error. For example, if the YAML is not properly formatted, it would raise a yaml.YAMLError. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps it's up to the caller to handle that. The function's responsibility is only to check for missing required fields once the data is loaded.

So assuming that data is a dictionary (if the YAML is a valid mapping), but if it's a list or None, then the required fields check would fail. But the problem probably expects that the YAML file is a proper dictionary-like structure.

Another edge case: if the class doesn't have REQUIRED_FIELDS, then required_fields is empty, so no check is done. So the code allows any data as long as the file exists and is valid YAML. But that's probably intended, as the class can define its own required fields.

So the code seems okay. Now, to write it properly with the @classmethod decorator, and the required steps.
