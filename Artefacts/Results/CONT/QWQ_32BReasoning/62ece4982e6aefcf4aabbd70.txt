Okay, I need to write a Python function called os_is_mac that checks if the operating system is macOS. The function should return True if it's macOS, else False. Let me think about how to do this.

Hmm, in Python, the os module can help here. Oh right, the platform module might be more precise. Wait, the os module has os.name, but that gives 'posix' for both macOS and Linux, so that's not specific enough. Maybe I should use sys.platform instead. Right, sys.platform returns a string like 'darwin' for macOS. Because macOS uses Darwin as its core. So if sys.platform starts with 'darwin', then return True.

So the steps are: import sys, check if sys.platform starts with 'darwin' (case-insensitive? Or just check the exact string). Let me recall, on macOS, sys.platform is exactly 'darwin', right? So maybe just check if sys.platform == 'darwin'. That should work.

Wait, but maybe there are versions where it's different? Like, perhaps some virtual environments or different Python versions? Probably not, the standard is 'darwin' for macOS. So the code would be:

import sys

def os_is_mac():
    return sys.platform == 'darwin'

Yes, that's straightforward. The docstring is provided, so I just have to make sure the function does that. Let me double-check the function signature and the return description. The function has no parameters, returns a bool. Yep, that's exactly what this code does. So the code should be correct.
