Okay, so I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that takes a list of nodes and merges them. The docstring says to merge any node values with duplicate keys, and if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one stays. Hmm, right.

First, I should think about what a MappingNode is. Probably, it's a node that can contain other nodes, like a dictionary. So when merging, if two nodes have the same key, and both are MappingNodes, then we need to merge their contents recursively. But if one of them is not a MappingNode, then the last one in the list should take precedence.

Wait, the problem says "non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So for keys that have non-MappingNode types in some entries, the last node in the list with that key will overwrite the previous ones. But for keys where all the nodes are MappingNodes, we do a deep merge.

So the plan is to process each node in the nodes list in order, and for each key, check if the current accumulated value is a MappingNode and the new value is also a MappingNode. If so, merge them deeply. Otherwise, just take the new value (since the last one will replace previous entries).

Wait, but the order is important here. Since we process the nodes in the order given, and for each key, the later nodes can override earlier ones. So the approach is to iterate through each node in nodes, and for each key in the current node, check if it's already in the merged result. If it is, then check if both are MappingNodes. If so, merge them recursively. Otherwise, replace the existing value with the new one.

Wait, but how do I represent the nodes? Are the nodes dictionaries? Or some custom objects? The function's parameters are a list called nodes, but the exact structure isn't specified. Hmm, maybe I can assume that each node is a dictionary-like structure where each key has a value, and some of those values are themselves MappingNodes (maybe another dictionary?), and others are non-MappingNodes (like integers, strings, etc). So the function needs to handle merging these nodes.

Wait, perhaps the nodes are all instances of some Node class, and MappingNode is a subclass that can be merged. But without knowing the exact classes, maybe the problem expects me to treat any value that is a dictionary as a MappingNode, and others as non-Mapping. That might be a safe assumption here.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are all dictionaries, and the "MappingNode" is just a regular dictionary. So the function needs to merge the list of dictionaries in such a way that for each key, if all the entries for that key in the nodes are dictionaries, then they are merged deeply. Otherwise, the last node's value for that key is kept.

Wait, the problem says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result." So perhaps the nodes are structured such that each node is a dictionary, and when merging, for each key present in multiple nodes, if all the values are themselves MappingNodes (like another dictionary), then merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last one.

Hmm, okay. Let's think of the algorithm step by step.

Initialize the merged result as an empty dictionary.

Loop through each node in the nodes list in order.

For each key in the current node:

- Check if the key is already in the merged result.

- If it is not, add the key and its value to the merged result.

- If it is present:

   - Check if the existing value in merged is a MappingNode (i.e., a dictionary?), and the current node's value is also a MappingNode.

   - If both are MappingNodes, then perform a deep merge of the two.

   - Else, replace the existing value with the current node's value (since the last one wins in non-Mapping cases).

Wait, but how do I determine if a value is a MappingNode? Since the problem mentions "non-MappingNode values", perhaps a MappingNode is something that can be merged, like a dictionary. So perhaps, in code, we can check if the value is a dict instance. But maybe the problem expects that any MappingNode has a specific type, but since I don't have that info, I'll proceed with checking if the value is a dictionary.

So, in code:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in merged:
                existing = merged[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    # Need to merge these two dicts recursively
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    # Either one is not a dict, so take the new value
                    merged[key] = value
            else:
                merged[key] = value
    return merged

Wait, but wait. The function is called deep_merge_nodes, which takes a list of nodes. So in the recursive call, when merging two dictionaries (existing and value), we can pass them as a list [existing, value], and call deep_merge_nodes on that list. That should work because existing and value are each a "node" (a dict in this case), and the function would merge them as per the same rules.

Hmm, let me test this logic with an example. Suppose nodes are:

nodes = [
    {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 3}},
    {'a': 2, 'b': {'d': 4}},
    {'b': 5}
]

The first two nodes have 'b' as a dict, so merging them would combine 'c' and 'd' into a new dict. But the third node's 'b' is 5 (non-dict), so the final 'b' would be 5, since the last node's value is the one taken. The 'a' in first node is 1, then second node's a is 2, so the merged a would be 2. The third node doesn't have an 'a', so the final 'a' is 2.

So the merged result would be:

{'a': 2, 'b':5}

Wait, but according to the code above, when processing the third node's 'b' (5), existing is the merged value after first two nodes, which would be {'c':3, 'd':4}. So existing is a dict, and the new value (5) is not a dict. So in the 'if' condition, since one is a dict and the other is not, the code would set merged[key] = value (5). That's correct.

Another example where the last value is a dict. Let's say third node's 'b' is {'e':6}. Then the merged 'b' would be the merged of existing (from first two nodes: {'c':3, 'd':4}) and the third's {'e':6}, resulting in a dict with c, d, e. So that's correct.

Another case: if two nodes have the same key with non-dict values, the last one wins. Like nodes = [{'x': 10}, {'x':20}], the merged x would be 20.

So the code seems to handle that.

Wait, but what if a key has a mix of Mapping and non-Mapping values? Like:

nodes = [
    {'x': {'a':1}},
    {'x': 2}
]

The first node's x is a dict, second is non-dict. So when processing the second node, existing is the first's value (a dict), and the new value is 2 (non-dict). Since one is a dict and the other isn't, we replace existing with 2. So the final x is 2. Correct.

Another case where the first is non-dict and the second is a dict. Like nodes = [{'x': 1}, {'x': {'a': 2}}]. Then existing is 1 (non-dict), new is a dict. So the existing is non-dict, so the new value (dict) will replace it? Wait, no. Let's see:

In the first iteration (node1's x is 1), merged now has x:1.

Second node's x is a dict. So when processing the second node:

key 'x' is in merged. existing is 1 (non-dict), new value is a dict. Since one is non-dict and the other is a dict, the condition (both are dicts) is false, so we replace existing with the new value (the dict). So merged['x'] becomes the dict. So the final result is x: {'a':2}. That's correct, because the second node's value is a MappingNode, but the existing was not. So since the new value is a dict, but the existing was not, then they can't be merged, so the new value replaces the old. Since the second comes after first, it's kept, which is correct.

Hmm, so the code seems to handle that correctly.

Wait another edge case: three nodes with the same key, first is dict, second is non-dict, third is dict. Let's see:

nodes = [
    {'k': {'a':1}},
    {'k': 2},
    {'k': {'b':3}}
]

Processing first node: merged['k'] is {'a':1}

Second node: 'k' exists (a dict), new value is 2 (non-dict). So since existing is dict and new is not, replace with 2. Now merged['k'] is 2.

Third node's 'k' is a dict. existing is 2 (non-dict), so new is a dict but existing is not, so replace existing (2) with the new dict? Wait, no. Because existing (2) is non-dict, and the new value is a dict. The condition (both are dicts) is false, so merged['k'] becomes the new value (the dict). So the final 'k' is {'b':3}. Correct because the third is the last, so it's kept.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code seems to work.

Wait, but what about when the existing and new are both dicts? Then we need to do a deep merge. The code uses deep_merge_nodes([existing, value]), which is correct because existing and value are each nodes (dictionaries). So merging them in order, the second one's values would override the first's in case of non-dicts, and for dicts, they would be merged recursively. So that's correct.

Another test case where merging two dicts:

nodes = [
    {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': {'d': 2}}},
    {'a': {'b': 3, 'c': {'e':4}}}
]

The merged 'a' would be {'b':3, 'c': {'d':2, 'e':4}}.

Wait, let's see. The first node's 'a' is {'b':1, 'c':{'d':2}}, the second's 'a' is {'b':3, 'c':{'e':4}}.

Merging the two nodes (as in the recursive call), the existing is the first's a, and the new is the second's a.

For key 'b', existing is 1 (non-dict), new is 3 (non-dict). So since they are both non-dicts, the new (3) replaces existing. So 'b' becomes 3.

For 'c', existing is {'d':2} (a dict), new is {'e':4} (a dict). So they are merged into {'d':2, 'e':4}.

Thus the merged 'a' is correct.

So the code works here.

Hmm, I think this should handle all cases. The code uses recursion, so it's important that when merging two dictionaries (existing and value), they are passed as a list to the same function. So the code should work as intended.

Wait, but in the code, when we do:

merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])

That's correct because existing is the existing value (from the merged so far) and the current node's value is value. So the list is [existing, value], and merging them in order would take the second one as the later one, so that's correct.

Yes, because in the main loop, we are processing nodes in order. So for a key that exists, the existing is the merged result so far (from previous nodes), and the current node's value is the next one. So when merging existing and current value, the order [existing, value] would process existing first, then the current's value, so the current's value would override existing in case of conflicts. That's correct.

Therefore, the code should work as intended.
