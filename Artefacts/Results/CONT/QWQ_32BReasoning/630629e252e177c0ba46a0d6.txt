Okay, I need to write a Python function called retrieve_diaspora_host_meta that takes a host as an argument and returns an XRD instance. Let's see. The function's purpose is to get the host-meta document from a remote Diaspora pod. 

First, I should figure out how to make the HTTP request. The host is provided, so the URL would probably be https://host/xrd.xml or maybe /host-meta. Wait, Diaspora's host-meta is typically at /host-meta, I think. But sometimes it might be in a different location. The standard way to find it is by looking for the link in the HTML head of the site's root, but maybe the function is supposed to directly fetch the known path?

Alternatively, perhaps the host-meta is located at /host-meta, so the URL would be "https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta". Wait, I should check the specs. Oh right, the .well-known/host-meta is part of the XRD specification. So the correct URL is https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta.

So the function needs to make an HTTP GET request to that URL. Then, parse the response into an XRD object. But how to do that in Python?

Wait, the return is an XRD instance. So I need to have a way to parse the XML into that class. Maybe using a library like requests to get the data, and then using an XRD parsing library. But which one? The xrd module perhaps? Or maybe the python3-xrd package? Alternatively, maybe the code should use a library like lxml or ElementTree, but the user expects an XRD instance. 

Assuming that there's an XRD class available, perhaps from a third-party library. The user might be expecting the function to use such a library. Let's proceed under the assumption that we can import the necessary classes. 

Wait, but the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, without any explanations. So I need to write the code that does the HTTP request, gets the data, parses it into an XRD object, and returns it. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Import the necessary modules. Like requests for HTTP, and the XRD parser. But since the user didn't mention any specific libraries, maybe I should use a standard approach. Wait, perhaps the XRD is part of a specific library. Hmm. Maybe the code will look like this:

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct parsing method. Let's assume that there's an XRD class that can be instantiated from a string. Alternatively, maybe using the xrdlib library. 

Alternatively, maybe the code will look like:

import requests
from xrd import XRD  # or some other import

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f"https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta"
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()  # throw an error if request failed
    return XRD.parse(response.text)  # or however the parsing is done

But I need to make sure that the XRD is parsed correctly. The exact method might depend on the library. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll have to make an educated guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the XRD is parsed using some other method. Let's see. The host-meta file is in the XRD format, which is XML. So perhaps the code uses an XML parser and constructs the XRD object manually, but that's more complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the 'rdflib' or another library, but I think the most straightforward way is to use a library that can parse XRD documents. 

Assuming that there's a library called xrd which has a parse function, or the XRD class has a parse method. 

Alternatively, maybe the code uses the 'aenum' or another package, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses the 'requests' library to get the data, then parses the XML using ElementTree or similar, but constructs an XRD object. Since the return type is XRD, perhaps the code uses a library that provides that. 

In any case, the code structure would involve making the request and parsing the response. 

Wait, but perhaps the host could be passed as http or https? Maybe the function should try both, but the standard is to use https. 

Also, handling exceptions: if the host is invalid, or the URL isn't found, the function should probably raise an error. Since the docstring says returns an XRD instance, perhaps the function is expected to raise exceptions if there's an error, but the user hasn't specified handling, so perhaps just let requests raise exceptions. 

Putting it all together:

The code would:

- Construct the URL as https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta
- Use requests.get to fetch it
- Check the response (maybe .raise_for_status())
- Parse the content into XRD and return it.

Now, the code would need to import the necessary modules. So:

import requests
from xrd import XRD  # assuming the XRD class is imported from a module called xrd

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f'https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta'
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return XRD.parse(response.text)

Wait, but maybe the XRD parsing is done differently. Like maybe the XRD class has a from_string method. Or maybe the parse is a class method. Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a different library. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses the 'python3-xrd' package, which has an XRD class with a parse method. Let me check in my mind: the xrd library's documentation. Oh, perhaps the code would be:

from xrd import XRD

Then XRD.parse(response.content) ?

Alternatively, maybe the XRD is built from an XML string. 

Alternatively, maybe the code uses the 'aenum' library? No, that's for enumerations. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses the 'requests' library and the 'lxml' to parse the XML and then create an XRD instance. But that would require more code. 

But given the problem's constraints, I have to write the code as per the given function signature. The user didn't mention any specific third-party libraries, but the return is an XRD instance, so I have to assume that the XRD class is available. 

Therefore, the code would look like the above. 

Wait, but maybe the URL is http instead of https? No, because Diaspora pods typically use HTTPS. 

Another consideration: some hosts might have a different path. But the standard is .well-known/host-meta, so that's the correct path. 

Therefore, the code would be as I outlined. 

So the final code would be:

import requests
from xrd import XRD  # or some other import, but the user's code may have that

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f'https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta'
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return XRD.parse(response.text)

Wait, but if the XRD.parse is a class method, then that's correct. Otherwise, maybe it's a function in the xrd module. Like xrd.parse(response.text) and return that. 

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the code should use the 'rdflib' library, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the XRD is part of the 'python3-xrd' package, which has a parse function. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use the 'requests' library and return the parsed XML as an XRD object using some other method. 

Well, given the information, I think this is the best approach. The code uses requests to get the data, checks the response, then parses it into an XRD instance using the parse method. 

So that's the code I'll write.
