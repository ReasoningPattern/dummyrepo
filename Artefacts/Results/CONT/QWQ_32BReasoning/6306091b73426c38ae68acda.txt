Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the plugins_manager class method based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function signature is def plugins_manager(cls): and the docstring says it gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

Hmm, so first, the method is a class method since it takes cls as the parameter. The goal is to retrieve the plugin manager by using the _get_service method of the class, passing the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER constant.

Wait, I should make sure that ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER is the correct enum or constant here. But since the user didn't specify, I'll assume that ServiceName is a predefined enumeration or a class with such an attribute. 

The code should probably look like this: inside the method, call cls._get_service() with the argument ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. Then return that result. 

So putting it all together, the method would be:

@classmethod
def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

Wait, but I need to make sure that the import for ServiceName is present. However, the problem statement doesn't mention imports, so I guess I can ignore that part since the code is supposed to be based solely on the given signature and docstring. 

Let me check the docstring again. It says "Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So the key steps are using that service name in the _get_service method. 

I think that's all. The code should be straightforward. Just the class method returning the result of _get_service with that specific service name.
