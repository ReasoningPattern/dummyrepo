Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_logical_path_map based on the given docstring. The function takes inventory and version as parameters and returns a dictionary of file paths for the states in the inventory.

Hmm, the docstring says it's about returning file paths of states in a dict. But what's the structure of the inventory? Since it's not specified, maybe I have to assume a common structure. Typically, an inventory might have states with some attributes like 'name' and 'path', possibly dependent on the version.

Wait, the version parameter might influence how the paths are determined. Maybe for different versions, the path formatting changes. Like, maybe older versions use a different directory structure.

The function needs to process each state in the inventory. Let's think of a possible structure. Suppose the inventory is a list of state objects or dictionaries. For each state, we need to generate a path. The key in the resulting dictionary could be the state's name, and the value is the constructed path.

Let me outline steps:
1. Iterate over each state in the inventory.
2. For each state, create a path based on the version.
3. Store the state name as the key and the path as the value in a dictionary.

But how exactly does the version affect the path? Maybe the version is part of the path. For example, the path could be something like "/versions/{version}/states/{state_name}.state" or similar. Without more info, I'll have to make a reasonable assumption here.

Alternatively, maybe the version is used to determine the directory structure. Let's assume that the path is constructed by combining the version and the state's identifier. Let's say each state has an 'id' or 'name' and maybe other attributes. Let's proceed with the state having a 'name' attribute.

So, the code structure would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        # construct path using version and state's name
        path = f"/some/base/path/{version}/{state['name']}.file"  # example
        path_map[state['name']] = path
    return path_map

But since the exact structure isn't given, perhaps the problem expects a generic approach where the path is simply a combination of version and state name. Alternatively, maybe the inventory's states have a 'path' attribute that's version-dependent, but without more data, I need to proceed with a basic example.

Another thought: maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state name, and the value is another dict containing details. Or maybe each state in the inventory list has a 'name' and 'path_template' that uses the version. But since the problem states to return the paths based on the inventory and version, perhaps the path is built by combining version and state name in a standard way.

Alternatively, maybe the path is something like "states/{state_name}/v{version}/data.txt".

Since the problem is vague, I'll have to make a simple assumption. Let's assume each state in the inventory has a 'name' key, and the path is formatted as f"version/{version}/state_{state['name']}.txt".

Thus the code would loop through each state in the inventory list, take the name, and create the path using the version. The result is a dictionary mapping state names to their paths.

Wait, but what if the inventory is a list of objects? The code uses dictionary access, so perhaps the inventory is a list of dictionaries. The function should work with that.

Putting it all together:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state['name']: f'/path/to/{version}/{state["name"]}.state' for state in inventory}

But maybe that's too simplistic. The problem says "the file paths of the states in the inventory", so perhaps the actual path is stored in each state, and the version modifies it. But without knowing the inventory's structure, the code has to make some assumptions. Since the user didn't provide more details, perhaps the answer expects a dictionary comprehension that maps each state's name (assuming each has a 'name' key) to a path that includes the version. 

Alternatively, maybe the path is constructed by combining the version with the state's existing path. Like, if each state has a 'base_path', then the full path is version + base_path. But again, without specifics, I need to go with a simple example.

The code I wrote earlier should suffice. Let me check again. The function takes inventory (probably a list of state dicts) and version (string), returns a dict mapping state names to paths. The example uses an f-string with version and state['name'].

Yes, that's the best approach given the information. So the final code would be a dictionary comprehension as above.
