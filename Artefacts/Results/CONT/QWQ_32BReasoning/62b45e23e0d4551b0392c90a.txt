Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method validate_version_inventories based on the given docstring. Let's start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The doc says each version should have an inventory up to that point. So for each version directory in version_dirs, I need to check if the inventory exists. Also, we need to keep track of any content digests that differ from the root inventory so they can be checked later.

Hmm, the parameters are self and version_dirs, which is an array of version directories in order. So the method is part of a class, probably with some existing attributes or methods related to inventories and content digests.

First, I should loop through each version directory in version_dirs. For each version, maybe check if the inventory file exists. But how? The exact path might depend on how the directories are structured. Since the method is part of a class, perhaps there's a base path or some other attribute to construct the inventory path. Since I don't have that info, maybe the code will use some method or attribute like self.get_inventory_path(version_dir) or something similar. But since I have to write the code without additional info, maybe I can assume that each version_dir has an associated inventory file, perhaps named 'inventory.txt' or similar. Alternatively, maybe the inventory is stored in a dictionary or another structure. The exact implementation might be tricky without more context, but I'll proceed with what's given.

The second part is to track content digests different from the root inventory. The root inventory's digests might be stored in a variable like self.root_inventory_digests. For each version's inventory, compare its digests. If any are different, add them to a list or a set for later validation.

Wait, the doc says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So perhaps for each version, we check its inventory's digests against the root's, and collect those that are different. Then, when validating the content, those can be checked.

But how exactly is this done? Let's think step by step.

First, the method might start by initializing a list or a set to hold the differing digests. Let's say self.differing_digests = set() or something. But since it's a method, maybe it's supposed to return something or store it in the instance. The doc says "keep a record", so perhaps the class has an attribute for this.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to return a list of differing digests, but the doc doesn't specify return type. The function signature just says def validate_version_inventories, so maybe it's a void method that raises an error if something is wrong, and collects the differing digests in an instance variable.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

1. Iterate over each version directory in version_dirs in order.

2. For each version, check that its inventory exists. If not, raise an error or record an error. The doc says "SHOULD have an inventory", so maybe it's required, so perhaps raise an exception if missing.

But the exact handling isn't clear. The problem might be to just check existence and track differing digests.

3. For each version's inventory, compare its content digests with the root's. If any digest is different, add it to a collection.

Assuming that each inventory has a method to get the digests, perhaps self.get_inventory_digests(version_dir) returns a set or list of digests for that version's inventory.

The root inventory's digests would be from self.root_inventory.digests or similar.

So the steps would be:

Initialize a set to hold differing digests.

Loop through each version_dir in version_dirs:

   Check if the version has an inventory. Maybe by checking if a certain file exists. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps this is abstracted by a helper function. Let's say there's a method called has_inventory(version_dir) which returns a boolean. If not, raise an error.

   Then get the current version's digests.

   Compare each digest in the current version's inventory with the root's. Wait, no: the root's digests are the reference. So any digest in the version's inventory that is not in the root's should be recorded? Or maybe the other way around?

Wait the doc says "any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So perhaps the version's inventory may have some digests not present in the root. Or maybe the root is the first version's inventory, and each subsequent version adds to it. But the exact logic might be tricky.

Alternatively, the root inventory is the initial one, and each version's inventory should include all up to that point. But the differing digests are those that are present in the version's inventory but not in the root, or vice versa?

Wait the wording is "different from those in the root inventory". So any digest that exists in a version's inventory but is not in the root's? Or any digest that differs in some way?

Alternatively, perhaps each version's inventory should include all the content up to that version. So the root is the first version's inventory. Each subsequent version's inventory should include all previous content plus new. Therefore, the digests in each version's inventory should be a superset of the root's. But the problem is to track any that are different, which might mean those not present in the root?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key points are:

- For each version directory, check that it has an inventory. So, if the inventory is missing, that's an error.

- Then, collect any content digests from each version's inventory that are not in the root's inventory. Or perhaps, any digest in the version's inventory that is different from the root's?

Alternatively, maybe the root inventory is the first one, and each subsequent version's inventory should include all previous content, so the digests should be a superset. The differing ones would be those that are in the version's inventory but not in the previous ones. But the problem states to compare against the root's inventory.

Wait the doc says "different from those in the root inventory". So the root is the base, and any digest in any version's inventory that is not in the root's is recorded. So for each version's inventory, we check each digest in it: if it's not present in the root's digests, add it to the list.

Wait, but maybe the root is the first version's inventory. For example, version 1's inventory is the root. So versions 2,3 etc. have their own inventories which should include all previous content. So their digests would include all from the root plus new ones. Thus, the differing digests would be those added in later versions, which are not in the root. So we need to track those so that when validating content, we can check those digests exist in the content files.

Alternatively, perhaps the root is the top-level inventory, and each version's inventory is supposed to have all the content up to that point. So the root's digests are all the content, but each version's inventory may have some that are different?

Hmm, the exact relationship isn't entirely clear, but the main points are:

- Check each version has an inventory.

- Collect any digests from the version's inventory not in the root's, to check later.

So, in code:

Maybe something like this:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):

    # Assuming root_inventory_digests is a set from the root inventory

    differing_digests = set()

    for version_dir in version_dirs:

        # Check inventory exists for this version

        inventory = self.get_inventory(version_dir)  # hypothetical method

        if not inventory:

            raise SomeError(f"Inventory missing for {version_dir}")

        # Get the digests for this version's inventory

        current_digests = inventory.get_digests()

        # Compare with root's digests

        for digest in current_digests:

            if digest not in self.root_inventory_digests:

                differing_digests.add(digest)

    # Maybe store the differing_digests in the instance?

    self.differing_digests = differing_digests

But I need to make sure to use the given parameters and follow the docstring. The method's parameters are self and version_dirs. The doc mentions that version_dirs are in sequence 1,2,3 etc.

But in the code, I don't have access to the actual methods like get_inventory or root_inventory_digests. Since this is a generated code based on the docstring, perhaps I should use some placeholders or assume that there are methods to retrieve the necessary data.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class where the root's digests are stored in self.root_digests, and each version_dir has an inventory file that can be read via some method.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to be generic, but the exact implementation depends on the class's existing structure.

Given that I have to write the code without knowing the exact class structure, I'll make some assumptions.

Another approach: The method may iterate through each version directory, check if the inventory exists (maybe by checking a file path), and then compare the digests. For the differing digests, collect them into a list or set.

So here's a possible code outline:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):

    root_digests = self.get_root_inventory_digests()  # assume this is a method

    differing = set()

    for version_dir in version_dirs:

        inventory_path = self.get_inventory_path(version_dir)  # another method

        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):

            raise ValueError(f"Inventory missing for version {version_dir}")

        current_digests = self.get_version_digests(version_dir)  # method to get digests

        for digest in current_digests:

            if digest not in root_digests:

                differing.add(digest)

    self.differing_digests = differing  # store for later

But since I don't know the exact methods, perhaps the code will have to use some generic functions, but the problem states to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring. The doc mentions that version_dirs are in sequence, so perhaps the first version (version 1) is the root, but the root's inventory is fixed.

Alternatively, the root inventory is a separate structure, not part of the version directories.

Alternatively, the root's inventory is the first version's inventory. So for version 1, its inventory is the root, so all digests there are part of the root. Then for version 2, its inventory should include all from version 1 plus new ones. But in that case, the differing digests would be those added in each version beyond the root.

But according to the problem's doc, the root's inventory is the reference. So any digest in any version's inventory not present in the root's is recorded.

The code must be written without knowing the exact class attributes, so maybe the method uses some helper functions that the class has.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is more abstract and just outlines the steps, using placeholder functions.

Alternatively, maybe the method just checks that each version has an inventory and tracks the differing digests by comparing each version's inventory to the root's, but the actual implementation details are left to the class's other methods.

In any case, the code should:

Loop over each version_dir in version_dirs.

For each, ensure that its inventory exists (so maybe check a file or call a method to get it).

Then, get the digests of that version's inventory.

Compare each digest to the root's inventory's digests.

If a digest is not in the root's, add to the differing set.

Finally, store the differing digests somewhere (maybe in self.differing or similar).

Assuming the class has a method to get the root's digests, perhaps called root_inventory_digests, or a property.

Putting it all together, here's a possible code:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    root_digests = self.root_inventory_digests  # assume this is a class attribute
    differing_digests = set()
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory = self.get_inventory(version_dir)  # checks existence, maybe
        if not inventory:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing inventory for version {version_dir}")
        current_digests = inventory.get_digests()
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.add(digest)
    self.differing_digests = differing_digests

But the exact methods (like get_inventory, get_digests) may vary, but the structure would be similar.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a helper function to check each version's inventory, and then collect differing.

Another possibility is that the root inventory is the first element in version_dirs. But the doc says the version_dirs are in sequence, so maybe the first is version 1, which is the root. So the root's digests are from the first version's inventory.

Wait the doc says "each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point". The first version (version 1) would have an inventory of all content up to that version, which is the root. So the root's inventory is the first version's.

Thus, perhaps the code first gets the root's digests from the first version's inventory.

Wait that complicates things. Let me read the doc again:

"Each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point."

So for version 1, inventory includes all content up to version 1 (the initial state). Version 2's inventory includes all up to version 2, etc. The root inventory is perhaps the initial one (version 1), so the root's digests are from version 1's inventory. Then, any digest in later versions not in the root's would be added to the differing list.

In that case, the code would first get the first version's inventory to get the root digests.

But the version_dirs list may not necessarily start at 1, but the code can assume it's in order. So the first element is version 1, etc.

So the steps would be:

- Check that each version has an inventory.

- Get the first version's inventory to get root_digests.

- Then, for each subsequent version's inventory, compare their digests to root_digests, and collect any that are different.

Wait but the doc says "any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So the root is fixed as the first version's inventory. So the code would first process the first version to get root_digests, then process the rest.

Wait but the first version's inventory is part of the version_dirs, so in the loop:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    if not version_dirs:
        raise ValueError("No versions provided")

    # Get the root's digests from the first version's inventory
    first_version = version_dirs[0]
    first_inventory = self.get_inventory(first_version)
    if not first_inventory:
        raise ValueError(f"First version {first_version} has no inventory")
    root_digests = first_inventory.get_digests()

    differing_digests = set()
    for version_dir in version_dirs[1:]:  # skip the first one already processed
        inventory = self.get_inventory(version_dir)
        if not inventory:
            raise ValueError(f"Inventory missing for {version_dir}")
        current_digests = inventory.get_digests()
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.add(digest)
    self.differing_digests = differing_digests

Wait but the doc says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So even the first version's own digests are part of the root, so only the subsequent versions' digests not in the first's are recorded.

But according to this approach, the first version's inventory's digests are the root, so any digest in later versions not in that set would be added to differing.

However, the problem's doc says "Each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point." So each version's inventory must exist, which the code checks.

But the first version's inventory is necessary to get the root's digests, so it must exist.

This approach would work if the root is the first version's inventory.

But the problem's doc might have the root as a separate inventory, not part of the versions. In that case, the code would need to get root_digests from somewhere else.

Since the problem's doc isn't entirely clear, but the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the given docstring, perhaps the first approach is better, assuming that the root's digests are known via another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the code doesn't need to get the root's digests from the first version, but it's a separate known set.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the first approach where the root's digests are a class attribute, and the code loops through all versions to check their inventories and collect differing digests.

The generated code must not have any markdown formatting, just the code in a Python code block.

Wait the user said to output ONLY the code generated, in Python markdown format. Wait, the user's instruction says:

"Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. /think"

Wait, Python markdown format? Maybe they mean code in a code block with triple backticks, but without any explanation.

Wait the user's exact instruction: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Ah, probably they want the code wrapped in triple backticks as markdown code block.

So the code should be enclosed in ```python ... ```.

But I need to write the code for the method, so the code would be:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    root_digests = self.root_inventory.get_digests()  # assuming root_inventory is an attribute
    differing = set()
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory_path = self.get_inventory_path(version_dir)
        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
            raise ValueError(f"Missing inventory file for {version_dir}")
        with open(inventory_path, 'r') as f:
            current_digests = f.read().splitlines()  # assuming each line is a digest
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing.add(digest)
    self.differing_digests = differing

But this assumes specific methods like get_inventory_path and that the root's digests are from another inventory. However, without knowing the class structure, this is a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a helper function to read the inventory:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    root_digests = self._get_root_digests()  # some helper method
    differing = []
    for version in version_dirs:
        inv = self._get_inventory(version)
        if inv is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Inventory missing for {version}")
        current = inv.get_digests()
        for d in current:
            if d not in root_digests:
                differing.append(d)
    self.differing = differing

But again, this depends on helper methods.

Given the problem's constraints, perhaps the best approach is to write code that loops through each version directory, checks for an inventory (maybe by existence of a file), and collects any digests not present in the root's set.

Assuming that the root's digests are stored in self.root_digests, and that each version's inventory is a file in the version directory named 'inventory.txt', the code might look like this:

import os

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    root_digests = self.root_digests  # assumed to be a set
    differing_digests = set()
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory.txt')
        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
            raise ValueError(f"Inventory not found for version {version_dir}")
        with open(inventory_path, 'r') as f:
            current_digests = f.read().split()
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.add(digest)
    self.differing = differing_digests

But this uses os.path and assumes the inventory file is named 'inventory.txt', which may not be the case. But without more info, this is a possible implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses some other method to get the digests, but given the problem's constraints, I'll proceed with a code structure that loops through each version, checks for inventory existence, and collects differing digests.

Another possible approach is to have the method return the differing digests, but the doc doesn't specify a return type. So perhaps the method stores it in an instance variable.

Putting it all together, here's a possible code that follows the docstring's requirements:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    root_digests = self.root_inventory.get_content_digests()  # assuming a method
    differing = set()
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inv = self.get_version_inventory(version_dir)
        if not inv:
            raise ValueError(f"Inventory missing for {version_dir}")
        current_digests = inv.get_content_digests()
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing.add(digest)
    self.differing_digests = differing

This assumes that get_version_inventory returns an inventory object for the version, which has a method to get its digests, and the root's digests are obtained via another method.

In any case, the code must loop through the version directories, check inventories exist, and collect differing digests.

Since I have to choose one, I'll proceed with a code that uses a helper method to get the inventory's digests and checks against root's.

The final code would look something like this enclosed in triple backticks as markdown.
