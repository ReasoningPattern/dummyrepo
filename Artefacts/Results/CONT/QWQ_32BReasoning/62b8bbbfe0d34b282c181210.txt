Okay, I need to write a Python function called append_text_to_file. Let's see the parameters: file_name, text_buffer, encoding, and overwrite which is a boolean with default False. The docstring says it writes the data from the text buffer to a file. 

Hmm, so first, I should think about how to handle the file. If overwrite is True, then we should open the file in write mode, which truncates it first. If it's False, then we should append, so use append mode. But wait, the function is called append_text_to_file, so maybe the default is append? But the parameter overwrite suggests that when True, it overwrites, else appends.

So the modes would be 'w' if overwrite is True, else 'a'. But wait, the 'a' mode appends, but in text mode, so we need to make sure that the file is opened with the correct encoding.

Also, since the user specifies the encoding, the open function should use that. So the code would be something like:

with open(file_name, mode, encoding=encoding) as f:
    f.write(text_buffer)

But what about the mode? Let's set mode as 'w' if overwrite else 'a'. So:

mode = 'w' if overwrite else 'a'

Then, proceed to open the file with that mode. 

Wait, but the function's name is append_text_to_file, but when overwrite is True, it's actually overwriting. So the function can both append or overwrite based on the flag.

I think that's all. The parameters are straightforward. The text_buffer is the string to write. So the code structure would be:

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    mode = 'w' if overwrite else 'a'
    with open(file_name, mode, encoding=encoding) as f:
        f.write(text_buffer)

Wait, but should we check if the text_buffer is a string? Probably not necessary, since the function's doc says it's a text buffer, so assuming it's a string. Also, in Python, the write method expects a str when using text mode, which the encoding implies. So this should work.

I think that's all. Let me make sure there are no errors. Oh, right, when opening in append mode, the write pointer is at the end of the file, so it appends. Yes. So the code should be as above.
