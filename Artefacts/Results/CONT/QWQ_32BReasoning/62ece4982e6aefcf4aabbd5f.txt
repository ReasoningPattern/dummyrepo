Okay, I need to write a Python function called paging that takes a response list and a max_results integer, and returns a generator that splits the response into chunks of max_results size. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should iterate over the response list and yield chunks of the specified size. So, the basic idea is to loop through the list in steps of max_results. For example, if the list has 10 elements and max_results is 3, the generator should yield [0,1,2], then [3,4,5], then [6,7,8], and finally [9], right?

So how do I do that in Python? I can use a loop that starts at 0 and increments by max_results each time. For each start index, I take a slice from start to start + max_results. The end of the slice can go beyond the list, but Python handles that by just taking until the end.

Wait, the parameters are response and max_results. The response is a list. So the steps would be:

Initialize a starting index at 0. Then, while the start index is less than the length of the response, take a slice from start to start + max_results and yield that. Then add max_results to start and repeat.

Yes. So in code terms:

def paging(response, max_results):
    start = 0
    while start < len(response):
        yield response[start:start + max_results]
        start += max_results

Wait, but the function's return type is a generator, which this does because of the yield keyword. The docstring says it returns a generator object with the split pages. So that should work.

Let me test this logic with an example. Suppose response is [1,2,3,4,5] and max_results is 2. The first iteration would yield [1,2], then start becomes 2. Next iteration, slice from 2:4 â†’ [3,4], start becomes 4. Then slice 4:6 is [5], start becomes 6. Now 6 >=5 (length is 5), so loop ends. That's correct.

Another test case: if max_results is 0? Wait, but the problem says max_results is an int. Oh, but what if it's 0? The function would have a division by zero? Wait no, in the code, if max_results is 0, then start starts at 0, and the condition 0 < len(response) is true, but the slice would be 0:0, which is an empty list. Then start increments by 0, so it stays 0, leading to an infinite loop. So the function must ensure that max_results is a positive integer. But according to the problem's docstring, the args are as given. So maybe the function should check for max_results being positive? But the problem doesn't mention handling invalid inputs. The docstring says max_results is an int, so perhaps we can assume it's a positive integer. So in the code, as written, if max_results is 0, it's an error. But the user probably expects that the function works when given a valid positive integer. So the code is okay as long as the inputs are correct.

So the code I wrote should work. Let me check again the function signature. The parameters are response and max_results. The docstring says response is a list. So the code is correct. The function is a generator, so when called, you can loop over it to get each page.

Yes, I think that's the correct solution.
