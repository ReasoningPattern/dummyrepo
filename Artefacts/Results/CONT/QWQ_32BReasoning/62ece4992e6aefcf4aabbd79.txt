Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's read the problem again carefully. The function is called make_find_paths and takes a sequence of paths. The goal is to transform each path into a glob pattern, but leave existing patterns untouched. Hmm, wait, how do I distinguish between a regular path and an existing glob pattern?

Wait, the doc says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So maybe the input could have some paths that are already glob patterns, and those should stay as they are. But others should be converted into glob patterns? Or perhaps the function is supposed to ensure that all elements in the input are treated as glob patterns. Maybe the existing patterns are those that already contain glob characters like * or ?, so we leave them as is, and for the others, maybe add a * or something? Or perhaps the transformation is to convert a simple path into a glob pattern by adding wildcards where necessary?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to convert each path into a glob pattern by adding a wildcard at the end if it's not already a pattern. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the function's return: it returns a tuple of transformed paths. The key is that existing glob patterns are left untouched. So perhaps the function is supposed to check each path in the input sequence. If it's already a glob (contains a wildcard character like *, ?, etc.), then leave it as is. Otherwise, convert it into a glob pattern somehow. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to turn all paths into globs by adding a /* or similar, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting to use the glob module? Or perhaps the transformation is to make each path into a glob pattern by appending /* or something. Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to take each path and if it doesn't have a wildcard, it becomes a glob pattern by adding a * at the end. For example, a path like "/dir/file" becomes "/dir/*", but if the path is already a glob like "/dir/*.py", then it stays the same.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to treat each element as a glob pattern, so if the path doesn't have any glob characters, it's turned into a pattern that matches exactly that path. But that would not change anything. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the docstring.

The doc says: "Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So the input is a sequence of paths, and we need to turn each into a glob pattern, but leave those that are already patterns as they are. So the question is, what is the transformation for a path that is not a glob pattern?

Maybe the idea is that if the path is a simple path (without any wildcards), then it should be converted into a glob that matches exactly that path. But that would not change anything, so that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is to make it so that the path is treated as a directory glob. Like, adding a /* at the end? For example, if the path is "dir", then it becomes "dir/*" to match all files in that directory. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to ensure that each path is a glob pattern, so if it doesn't have any wildcards, add a * at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the glob module's has_magic function to check if the path is a pattern. Wait, maybe I can use the fnmatch module's functions. Let me think. The fnmatch module has a function called fnmatch, but also, perhaps a way to check if a pattern is a glob. Alternatively, maybe the approach is to check if the path contains any of the glob characters like *, ?, [.

So the plan could be: for each path in find_paths, check if it contains any glob characters. If it does, leave it as is. If not, then convert it into a glob pattern. But what's the conversion? Maybe adding a * at the end? For example, turning "/home/user/file.txt" into "/home/user/*", but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is to treat the path as a directory and add a /* to match all files inside? Or maybe the path is a file and the glob is the same as the path, but that would not require any change.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that all paths are treated as globs, so even if they don't have wildcards, they are considered exact matches, so the function just returns the input as a tuple. But that can't be right because the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns", implying some transformation.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to prepend the path with a **/ for recursive matching, but that's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob that matches exactly that path, but that's redundant.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of examples. Suppose the input is a list like ["/etc/passwd", "/var/log/*.log", "/tmp/*"]. The first path is a regular file, so maybe it's converted into a glob pattern by adding a *? No, that would change it to /etc/passwd*, which is not right. Alternatively, maybe the first path is left as is, but the function's purpose is to ensure that all are treated as globs. Wait the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So perhaps the transformation is to add a * if it's not already a glob. So for a regular path without any wildcards, adding a * at the end? For example, "/home/user" becomes "/home/user/*", but perhaps the idea is to match all files in that directory. Alternatively, maybe the function just returns each path as is, but wraps them in some glob syntax if they are not already. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and if it's not a glob, then it becomes a glob that matches exactly that path. But how? Like, if the path is "/file.txt", then the glob is exactly the same. So perhaps the function is just returning the paths as a tuple, but that would not make sense.

Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the docstring again. The function's purpose is to transform all paths into glob patterns. Existing patterns are left untouched. So, perhaps the idea is that any path that doesn't contain any glob characters (like *, ?, etc.) is converted into a glob by adding a * at the end. For example, a path like "dir" becomes "dir/*", but a path like "dir/*.txt" is left as is. Or maybe the path is just treated as a glob, so even if it doesn't have wildcards, it's considered a glob pattern. But then the transformation would be to return all elements as-is, but the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns", implying some change.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to ensure that each path is a valid glob pattern, so if it's a directory, add a /*, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the glob module's escape function? No, that's for escaping.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the function just returns the input as a tuple, but that can't be right. There must be some transformation. Maybe the function is supposed to prepend "**/" to enable recursive globs, but again, that's a guess.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a path and if it's a simple directory path (without wildcards), turn it into a glob that matches all files within that directory. So for example, "dir" becomes "dir/*", and "dir/subdir" becomes "dir/subdir/*". But if the path has a wildcard, like "dir/*.txt", then it's left as is. That seems plausible.

So the steps for each path in find_paths would be:

Check if the path contains any glob characters (*, ?, [). If it does, leave it as is. If not, append "/*" to make it a glob pattern that matches all files in that directory.

Wait, but then for a file path like "/etc/passwd", adding "/*" would make it "/etc/passwd/*", which is invalid. So that approach might not work. Maybe instead, for paths that are not already glob patterns, we just add a * at the end, but that might not make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to treat each path as a glob pattern, so the transformation is to ensure that any path that is not a pattern (no wildcards) is converted to a pattern that matches exactly that path. But that's redundant. So maybe the function is simply returning the input as a tuple, but the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns". Maybe the function is supposed to return the paths as a tuple, but ensure that they are treated as glob patterns. So perhaps the transformation is just to leave them as strings, but maybe the input can have strings that are paths (without wildcards) and convert them into glob patterns by adding a * at the end. But how to decide?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that any path that does not contain a wildcard is converted into a pattern that matches exactly that path, but that requires no change. So perhaps the function just returns the input as a tuple. But then the docstring's explanation would be confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the function takes each path and if it is a directory, then the glob is the directory with /*, but that requires checking if it's a directory, which is system-dependent and not feasible in code without os.path.isdir, which might not be the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of possible code.

The function must process each element in find_paths. For each path, if it's already a glob (contains a wildcard), leave it. Otherwise, turn it into a glob. How?

Maybe the simplest approach is to check if the path has any of the characters that make it a glob (like *, ?, [). If not, then append a '*' to the end. Wait, but that would turn a directory into a glob that matches the directory name with an extra star. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is to add a '*' at the end of the path if it's not already a glob. For example, turning "/home/user/file.txt" into "/home/user/file.txt*" which is a glob matching any files starting with that. But that might not be the intended behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that any path that is not a pattern is treated as a directory and the glob is the directory path with a /* appended. Like, "dir" becomes "dir/*", "file.txt" becomes "file.txt/*" which might not be correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that all paths are treated as globs, so the function just returns the input as a tuple. But the problem states "transform all path into glob patterns", so there must be some change.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that any path that does not have a wildcard is converted to a glob that matches exactly that path, so no change. Hence, the function just returns the tuple of the input paths. But that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to wrap each path in a glob pattern. For example, adding **/ at the beginning for recursive matching. But without knowing, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that any path that does not have a wildcard is converted into a pattern that matches exactly that path, so adding nothing. But then the function is just returning the tuple of paths. That seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to check each path for the presence of any glob characters. If it has any, leave it as is. If not, then append a '*' to the end. Wait, but that would turn a directory into a glob that includes the directory name plus a star. Not sure if that's right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that any path that is not a glob is treated as a directory, so adding a / and * to the end. For example, "mydir" becomes "mydir/*", and "file.txt" becomes "file.txt/*", but that might not make sense for files. Maybe only directories?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the path is converted into a glob that matches exactly itself, which would be the same as the path, so no change. So the function just returns the paths as a tuple, but the docstring is a bit confusing. But maybe the problem is expecting that the function returns the input as a tuple. But that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to make sure that all paths are globs by adding a * if necessary, but only if the path is a directory. But how to determine that?

Hmm, maybe I should look for the standard way to convert a path into a glob pattern. Maybe the function is supposed to return each path as a glob pattern, so that even if it's a normal file path, it's considered a glob. So the transformation is just passing through, but the problem's wording is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the function is a no-op, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the function takes each path and converts it into a glob by adding a * at the end if it doesn't have any wildcards. Let's try to code that.

First, for each path in find_paths:

Check if it contains any of the glob characters. For example, if any of the characters in the path is *, ?, [.

How to check that?

We can use the fnmatch module's fnmatchcase or has_magic? Wait, maybe the fnmatch module has a function called has_magic that returns whether a pattern contains any metacharacters. Wait, according to the Python documentation, the fnmatch module's has_magic function returns True if the string contains any of the globbing characters that would require the use of a regular expression to match.

So, perhaps the approach is:

For each path in find_paths:

if has_magic(path):

    leave it as is

else:

    convert it to a glob pattern, like adding a * at the end?

Wait but what's the conversion?

Alternatively, perhaps the conversion is to add a * so that it matches any files with that name as a prefix. Or maybe the path is treated as a directory and we want to match all files in that directory, so adding a /*.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants to treat all paths as globs by adding a * at the end if they don't have any wildcards. Let's try that.

So code:

from fnmatch import has_magic

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    result = []
    for p in find_paths:
        if has_magic(p):
            result.append(p)
        else:
            # transform to a glob pattern
            result.append(p + '*')
    return tuple(result)

Wait but adding a * to the end of a path like "/etc/passwd" would make it "/etc/passwd*", which is a glob for files starting with that. But maybe that's what the problem wants. Alternatively, maybe it's better to append "/*" to the path if it's a directory, but how to know?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to append "/*" to paths that are directories. But without knowing if it's a directory, perhaps the code is supposed to just add a * at the end.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects to just return the paths as a tuple, so the code is:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    return tuple(find_paths)

But that would not do any transformation, which contradicts the docstring. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting that if the path is not a glob pattern (no wildcards), then it becomes a glob that matches exactly that path. But that would mean no change. So maybe the function is just returning the tuple of the input paths. But then why the transformation?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that all paths are treated as globs by adding a wildcard at the end. For example, any path without a wildcard gets a * added. That's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the function wraps each path in a glob that matches it exactly, which requires no change. So the function is just converting the sequence into a tuple. But the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns", so maybe that's the case. Maybe the function's purpose is to ensure that all elements are strings (as opposed to other types?), but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to return a tuple of the paths, so the code is simply returning the input as a tuple, but the function's name is make_find_paths. So:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    return tuple(find_paths)

But that would not do any transformation, which contradicts the docstring. So that's not right.

Hmm. Maybe I should think differently. The problem says "transform all path into glob patterns". Maybe the function is supposed to replace any non-glob paths with a pattern that matches exactly that path. But that would be the same as the original path. So no change. So the function is just returning the paths as a tuple. But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that exact path by escaping any glob characters, but that's the opposite of what the problem states. The problem says to leave existing patterns untouched. So perhaps the function is supposed to do nothing except return the paths as a tuple. But then why the docstring mentions transforming?

Alternatively, maybe the problem's intention is that the function takes a list of paths (strings) and converts them into a list of glob patterns, where a path without any glob characters is converted to a pattern that matches that exact path. But that's the same as the original path. So the function just returns the paths as a tuple.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to prepend a wildcard or something else. Maybe the function is supposed to add a **/ at the beginning to enable recursive searching. But that's a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to replace any backslashes with forward slashes or something, but that's not related to glob patterns.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the minimal code that fits the docstring. The function must return a tuple of transformed paths. The transformation is to turn paths into glob patterns, but leave existing patterns alone.

Perhaps the code is to check if the path has any of the characters that make it a glob, and if not, add a * at the end. Let's proceed with that, even if the logic is a bit unclear.

The code would need to check for the presence of any of the glob characters. Let's use the fnmatch module's has_magic function.

Wait, but in Python's fnmatch module, the has_magic function is available in some versions? Let me check.

Yes, in Python 3.7+, the fnmatch module has has_magic(). So assuming that's available, the code can use that.

So here's the code:

import fnmatch

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    result = []
    for p in find_paths:
        if fnmatch.has_magic(p):
            result.append(p)
        else:
            result.append(p + '*')
    return tuple(result)

Wait but this would add a * to paths that don't have any wildcards. For example, a path like "/home/user/file.txt" would become "/home/user/file.txt*", which matches files starting with that name. Is that the intended transformation? The problem says "transform all path into glob patterns". So if the original path wasn't a glob pattern, then it's turned into one by adding a *.

Alternatively, maybe the transformation is to add a * at the end of the directory path. Like, if the path is a directory, then add a /*. But without knowing if it's a directory, perhaps the code adds a * to the end of any non-glob path.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants to ensure that all paths are treated as globs, so any path without wildcards is made into a glob that matches exactly that path, but that requires no change. So the code is just returning the tuple. But then the transformation is not done.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with the code that uses has_magic and appends a * if not a pattern. That's the best I can think of given the problem description.
