Okay, I need to implement the pop method for a dictionary-like class. The function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):. The docstring explains that if the key is found, it removes it and returns the value. If not found, it returns the default if provided, otherwise raises a KeyError.

Hmm, first, I should check if the key exists in the dictionary. Since this is a method of a class that's supposed to behave like a dict, maybe the actual data is stored in a regular dictionary as an instance variable, like self.data or something similar. I'll assume that the class has a dictionary stored, perhaps named something like self.items.

So, the steps are: check if key is in self.items. If it is, remove it using del and return the value. If not, then check if a default was provided. If default is not __marker, return it. Otherwise, raise KeyError.

Wait, the default parameter has a default value of __marker. So when the user calls D.pop(k), without a default, then if the key isn't present, we have to raise KeyError. But if they provided a default, then we use that.

So inside the method:

First, check if key in self's data structure. Let's say self._storage is the underlying dict.

If key in self._storage:
    value = self._storage.pop(key)
    return value
else:
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)

But I need to make sure that the __marker is the same as the one used in the function definition. Since in the problem, the function's default is default=__marker, that implies that __marker is a unique object, probably like in the standard dict's pop method. So the code should use that.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the function is part of a class, so maybe the __marker is defined somewhere in the class. Alternatively, perhaps in the code, the __marker is a private variable. But the user hasn't provided that. Hmm, perhaps the code should use object() as a sentinel. Wait, but in the function signature, the default is set to __marker, so the code must refer to that variable. So maybe in the class, __marker is defined as a class-level variable or something. But maybe the code should just use the same __marker as the one in the function's default.

Wait, the problem's code starts with the function definition using default=__marker, so probably __marker is a variable that's been defined in the outer scope. Maybe in the standard library's dict, they have something like _marker = object(). So perhaps in this code, the __marker is already defined. But since I can't see the surrounding code, I have to proceed with the given function signature.

Therefore, in the code, the method can proceed as follows.

Assuming that the class has a dictionary stored as self.data (or similar), here's the code steps:

Check if key in self.data:

if key in self.data:
    return self.data.pop(key)
else:
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError('Key not found')

Wait, but the error message should probably include the key. So the KeyError should be raised with the key as the argument.

Putting it all together:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.data:
        return self.data.pop(key)
    elif default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)

But I need to make sure that the class actually has a data structure. Since the problem is about writing the pop method, I have to assume that the class has some internal storage, like self.items or self.dict. The exact name isn't given, so maybe I should use a common name like self.items. Alternatively, perhaps the class is a subclass of dict, but then the pop method would already exist. Since the user is writing a custom class, perhaps they have a dictionary stored in self.storage or similar. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should use self.items for the underlying dictionary. Let's go with that.

Wait, but in the code, the user hasn't provided any context about the class's structure. So perhaps the code should use a variable named something like self._data. But since the problem is to write the pop method based on the given signature and docstring, I have to proceed with the assumption that the class has a dictionary stored in some attribute. Let's choose self._storage as the name for the underlying dictionary. Alternatively, maybe it's just called self.dict. Hmm, maybe the standard approach would be to use self.items, but perhaps in the problem, the class is a subclass of dict, but that's not stated. Wait, but if it's a subclass of dict, then the existing pop method would be used. So probably the class is a custom one, so the code must access its internal data structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use __getitem__ and such, but for the pop method, you need to modify the internal state, so it's better to have a direct reference.

In any case, the code will have to refer to the internal dictionary. Since the problem doesn't specify, I have to choose a name. Let's go with self._data as the internal dictionary. So the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """Docstring here..."""
    if key in self._data:
        return self._data.pop(key)
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but in the first check, using key in self._data is O(1) for a dict, so that's okay. Then, if it's not present, check the default.

Alternatively, could use a try-except block, but the current approach is more straightforward.

Wait, another approach: try to pop the key, and handle the KeyError. But that's perhaps less efficient, but maybe shorter code. But the current method is better.

So putting it all together, the code is as above, assuming the internal dict is self._data. But perhaps in the problem's context, the actual name is different. Since the problem didn't specify, I'll proceed with that.

Wait, but maybe the user expects the code to use a dictionary stored in self. So perhaps the code is part of a class that wraps a dictionary, so the code uses self._storage or similar. Since the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring," I have to proceed with whatever is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be written in a way that the class has a dictionary, and the code refers to that. So I'll proceed with that.

Thus, the code would be as written above. Let me check again the docstring. The doc says D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value. So the steps are correct.

Testing edge cases:

Case 1: key exists. Pop it, return value. Correct.

Case 2: key does not exist, and default is provided. Return default.

Case3: key does not exist, no default: raise KeyError.

Yes, the code handles that.

Now, the problem says to output the code in Python markdown format. Wait, the user's instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Wait, perhaps that means put it in a code block with triple backticks? Or maybe just the code itself, but in the answer.

Wait, the user's exact instruction says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, perhaps "python markdown format" refers to putting the code inside a code block with the appropriate syntax. Like:

```python
def pop(...):
    ...
```

So I need to present the code within a code block using triple backticks. But the user also says "Output ONLY the code generated". So the code should be the only thing, without any other text.

Wait, but in the problem, the user starts with "You are a Python software engineer." and then gives the function signature and docstring, then the /think and the answer.

So, the code should be the def pop method, using the correct internal data structure. Assuming that the class has a dictionary stored in self._storage, but perhaps the actual variable is called something else. Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a subclass of dict, so that the data is stored in the instance's __dict__, but that's unlikely. Since the problem is to write the method, the code must refer to the internal data structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be written in such a way that it's part of a class that has a dictionary as an attribute. Since the problem doesn't specify, the code must use a variable that's accessible in the class's instance. Let me choose self.data as the name for the internal dictionary.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to use a dictionary stored in self, so the code would look like:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but that would require the class to implement __contains__, __getitem__, and __delitem__ in a way that accesses the underlying data. But if this is a subclass of dict, then this code would work, but then the built-in pop would already exist. Since the user is writing a custom pop method, perhaps the class is a subclass of dict and they are overriding the method? Or maybe it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is for a class that's a dictionary-like object, but not a subclass of dict. In that case, the code would have to use an internal dictionary. Let's assume that the class has a __storage attribute, which is a regular dictionary. So the code would use:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.__storage:
        return self.__storage.pop(key)
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    raise KeyError(key)

But then the __storage would be a private attribute. Alternatively, perhaps it's called something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a dictionary stored as self.data. Let me proceed with that, since it's a common name.

Wait, but how does the class's __getitem__ and __delitem__ work? Maybe that's beyond the scope here. Since the problem only requires the code for the pop method, given the function signature and docstring, I can assume that the class has a dictionary stored in self.data, so the code can use that.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised."""
    if key in self.data:
        return self.data.pop(key)
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but the user's docstring has a specific format, so I should make sure to include that exactly. The triple quotes and the text as given. So the code's docstring should match exactly what the user provided.

Yes. Now, the problem says to output the code in Python markdown format. So I need to present it within triple backticks as a code block. But the user's instruction says to output "ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the final answer should be:

```python
def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """
    D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
    If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
    """
    if key in self.data:
        return self.data.pop(key)
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    raise KeyError(key)
```

Wait, but I need to make sure that the __marker is the same as the one in the function's default parameter. Since in the function definition, the default is set to __marker, the code must use that variable. So assuming that __marker is a variable defined in the outer scope (like in the class or module), the code correctly uses default is not __marker.

Alternatively, if __marker is not defined, but in the problem's context, it's okay because it's part of the function's parameters. The code is correct as long as __marker is defined somewhere. Since the problem provides the function signature with default=__marker, that implies that __marker is a valid identifier in the current scope. So the code is okay.

Therefore, the code is as above. But perhaps the class uses a different name for the internal dictionary. Since I can't know, I have to make an assumption. The code uses self.data, which is a common name. Alternatively, maybe self.items or self._dict. But without more info, self.data is a safe choice.
