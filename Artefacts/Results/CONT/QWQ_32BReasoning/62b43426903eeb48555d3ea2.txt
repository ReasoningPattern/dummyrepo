Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method _create_converter based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function is part of a class, so it's an instance method. The return type is _converting._Converter, which suggests that there's a module named _converting with a class _Converter.

The docstring says it returns the parameter style converter. The returns section mentions the class _converting._Converter. So the method should create an instance of that class and return it.

Hmm, but how is the converter created? Since the method is called _create_converter, maybe it's initializing some parameters. The parameter style converter probably depends on the database's parameter style, like using ? or %s placeholders. But the details might be abstracted in the _Converter class.

Wait, maybe the _Converter class is part of the _converting module, so I need to import it. But the function's code is supposed to be written here. The user didn't mention any other code, so I should assume that the _converting module is already imported. Like perhaps from ._converting import _Converter? But in the code, the return type is given as _converting._Converter, so maybe the code just instantiates it.

The method's body needs to return an instance of _Converter. Maybe it's as simple as returning _converting._Converter() or something. But since the method is part of a class, perhaps there's some configuration needed. Like maybe the converter uses an attribute from self, such as a parameter style.

Wait, the docstring mentions "parameter style", so perhaps the converter is based on the database's parameter style, like qmark or format. So maybe the _Converter is initialized with a parameter style string. But since the code isn't provided, maybe the actual implementation is straightforward, like returning an instance without arguments. Or maybe the class is a singleton, so just return a new instance each time.

Alternatively, maybe the _Converter is a class that's part of the module, and the method just creates an instance. So the code would be something like:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    return _converting._Converter()

But I need to make sure that the import is correct. Since the return type is annotated as _converting._Converter, perhaps the module is imported as _converting. So the code would need to have from somewhere import _converting, but since the problem doesn't mention that, maybe the code is written assuming that the module is already imported.

Therefore, the code should be as simple as returning an instance of that class. Unless there are parameters needed, but the docstring doesn't mention any. The method doesn't take any arguments except self, so the converter is probably created without parameters. 

So the final code would be:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    """
    Create the parameter style converter.

    Returns the parameter style converter (:class:`._converting._Converter`).
    """
    return _converting._Converter()

Wait, but maybe the _Converter is a class inside the _converting module, so the correct syntax is _converting._Converter. So the code is correct. I think that's all. I'll write that.
