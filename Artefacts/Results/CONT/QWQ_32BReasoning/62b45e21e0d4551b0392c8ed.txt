Okay, I need to write a Python function called find_path_type that takes a path as an argument and returns a string indicating what type of thing is at that path. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, the os and os.path modules have functions to check file system objects. Like, os.path.isdir() checks if it's a directory, os.path.isfile() for a regular file. There's also os.path.islink() for symlinks, but maybe the problem doesn't require that. The question is, what are the possible types we need to identify here?

The docstring says "indicating the type of thing at the given path". The possible options are probably things like 'directory', 'file', or maybe something else if it's a symlink, device file, etc. But maybe the problem expects the basic ones: if it's a file, return 'file'; if a directory, 'directory'; and if neither, maybe 'unknown' or something else?

Wait, but what about other cases like a symlink pointing to a file? The os.path.isfile() follows symlinks, I think. So maybe the function should first check if the path exists. Because if the path doesn't exist, then we can return 'nonexistent' or similar.

Hmm, the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that. Maybe the expected behavior is to return 'unknown' if the path doesn't exist or is something else. Let me outline steps:

1. Check if the path exists. If not, return 'nonexistent' or 'unknown'? Let me see the problem's requirements again. The example docstring says "indicating the type of thing at the path". If the path doesn't exist, there's no thing there. So maybe return 'nonexistent'? But perhaps the problem expects to check only if it's a file or directory, and for other cases (like a symlink, a block device, etc.), return 'unknown'.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should return 'file' if it's a regular file, 'directory' if a directory, and for other types (like symlink, socket, etc.), return 'other' or 'unknown'.

So the steps would be:

- First, check if the path exists. If not, return 'nonexistent'.

Wait, how do I check that? Using os.path.exists(path). But os.path.exists returns True for both files and directories, but also for symlinks pointing to existing things. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps start by checking if it's a directory first, since a directory is a type of file in Unix, but the functions distinguish them.

The steps could be:

if os.path.isdir(path): return 'directory'

elif os.path.isfile(path): return 'file'

else: check if it's a symlink? Maybe return 'symlink' if islink is true, but maybe the problem doesn't require that. The problem's example might just have three options: 'file', 'directory', or 'unknown'.

Alternatively, perhaps the else case is 'unknown'.

So putting it all together:

import os

def find_path_type(path):
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        return 'nonexistent'
    if os.path.isdir(path):
        return 'directory'
    elif os.path.isfile(path):
        return 'file'
    else:
        return 'unknown'

Wait, but os.path.exists returns True even for symlinks pointing to existing files? Let me think. Suppose there's a symlink 'link' pointing to 'file.txt', which exists. Then os.path.exists('link') is True, and isfile would return True for the symlink. But if the symlink is broken (points to a non-existing file), then os.path.exists would return False. So in that case, the first check would catch it as 'nonexistent'.

So the code above would handle that.

But what about other types like a named pipe, device file, etc.? Those would fall into the else clause and return 'unknown'.

I think that's the right approach here. The problem's docstring doesn't specify all possible cases, so this should be sufficient. Let me make sure I import os at the top. Oh right, the function needs to have the correct imports.

Wait, the user didn't mention any imports. So I need to include the import statement in the code. So the code would start with import os, then the function.

Yes. So putting it all together, the code would be:

import os

def find_path_type(path):
    """
    Return a string indicating the type of thing at the given path
    """
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        return 'nonexistent'
    if os.path.isdir(path):
        return 'directory'
    elif os.path.isfile(path):
        return 'file'
    else:
        return 'unknown'

Hmm, maybe the order matters. Like, what if a path is both a file and a directory? Wait, that can't happen. Because a directory is a different type. So the order of checking is okay.

Another possible edge case: if the path is a symbolic link to a directory, but the code uses isdir, which follows symlinks. For example, if 'link_dir' is a symlink to a directory, then os.path.isdir(link_dir) would return True. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if someone wants to distinguish symlinks, but the problem's docstring doesn't mention that, so probably not needed here.

Therefore, this code should work.
