Okay, I need to write the Python function _normalizeargs based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function is supposed to normalize declaration arguments. The doc says that normalization arguments might contain Declarations, tuples, or single interfaces. Anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.

Hmm. So the input is a sequence, which could be a list or tuple of various items. The output is an optional list to append to, defaulting to a new list. The goal is to process each element in the sequence, expanding any non-basic elements into their components.

Wait, what's considered an individual interface? Probably objects that are instances of a Declaration class, or maybe something else. The function needs to recursively expand elements that are not "leaf" nodes. Like, if an element is a tuple, we need to process each item in the tuple. If it's a Declaration, maybe we extract its interfaces? Or perhaps Declarations themselves are to be expanded into their contained items. The doc is a bit vague here, but I'll have to make some assumptions.

The function should take each element in the input sequence. For each element:

- If it's a tuple, iterate through its elements and process them similarly. So tuples are unpacked and each item is processed.
- If it's a Declaration (assuming that's a class), perhaps we need to get its interfaces and process those? Or maybe Declarations are treated as needing expansion into their contents. Alternatively, maybe the Declaration has an __iter__ method, so we can just treat it like any iterable.
- Any other type (like individual interfaces) are added to the output list as-is.

Wait the doc says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So, if an element is an interface (like a string or some object representing an interface), it's added directly. But if it's a Declaration or a tuple, those are expanded by processing their elements recursively.

So the plan is: for each item in the input sequence, check if it's a Declaration (or some composite type) or a tuple. If so, recurse on that item's elements. If not, add to the output list.

Wait, the output is an optional list. So the function should collect all the normalized elements into the output list, which is passed in or created if None.

Wait, the function signature has output as an optional parameter. So the base case would be to start with output being a new list if it's not provided. But in the function, we have to handle that.

Wait, the parameters are (sequence, output=None). So in the function, if output is None, we create a new list. But perhaps the function is designed to be called recursively, appending to the same output list. So the first call initializes output, and then each recursive call uses the same list.

So here's how to proceed:

Initialize output if it's None. Then, loop over each element in the sequence:

For each element in sequence:

- if the element is a tuple or a Declaration (or any other composite type that needs expanding), then we need to process each item in that element's components. Wait, how to get the components? For a tuple, it's just the elements of the tuple. For a Declaration, maybe it has an __iter__ method, so we can iterate over it like a list. Alternatively, perhaps the Declaration has a method to get its contained elements. Since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll have to assume that any object that is an instance of a Declaration (or perhaps any non-basic type) should be treated as an iterable. Alternatively, perhaps the Declaration is a class that can be checked, and then we process its attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. The function should treat any element that is an instance of a Declaration or a tuple as a composite that needs to be broken down into its elements. So for each element in the sequence:

if it's a tuple, process each element in the tuple.

if it's a Declaration, perhaps process its interfaces (maybe the Declaration has an 'interfaces' attribute that's a list?), but without knowing, maybe we can just iterate over the Declaration as an iterable (like if it's a subclass of a list or has __iter__ implemented).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that any element that is not a string (assuming interfaces are strings) or an implements specification (maybe a specific type) needs to be expanded. But the problem's wording is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function treats any element that is an instance of a Declaration as needing to be expanded into its contained elements, and similarly for tuples. So, for each element:

if it's a tuple, then process each element of the tuple recursively.

if it's a Declaration, then process each element in the Declaration's list (like, perhaps the Declaration has an __iter__ method, so we can treat it as an iterable).

Other types (like strings or other objects) are added to the output.

Wait, the problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So, the "individual interfaces" are the base case. So, perhaps an interface is a string (like "InterfaceA"), and an implements spec is a specific structure (maybe a tuple with certain keywords?), but I'm not sure. The problem may not require checking types beyond checking if the element is a tuple or a Declaration-like object.

So, to proceed:

The function loops over each element in the input sequence.

For each element:

- if it's a tuple, then we need to process each item in the tuple as part of the sequence, so call _normalizeargs on that element (the tuple) with the current output.

Wait, but that would be a recursive call. Wait, but in that case, the current element (the tuple) is passed as the new sequence, and the same output list is used.

Alternatively, perhaps for each element in the current sequence, we check if it is a tuple or a Declaration. If it is, then we need to process its elements. So for example, if the element is a tuple, then we loop through its elements and process them. So:

Wait, the code structure would be something like:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):

    if output is None:
        output = []

    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, (tuple, Declaration)):  # assuming Declaration is a known class
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)

    return output

But wait, the problem's docstring mentions "Declarions" (maybe a typo for Declarations?), so I have to assume that there is a Declaration class. But since the code is supposed to be self-contained, perhaps the function doesn't need to import anything, so maybe the check is just for tuples and any other composite types, but since we can't know, perhaps the code should only check for tuples and iterables?

Alternatively, perhaps the Declaration is a type that is part of the system, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the code should only handle tuples and ignore other structures, but that's conflicting with the docstring.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to handle any iterable except for strings (since strings are iterable but are individual interfaces). So, for any item that is an iterable (like lists, tuples, etc.), except strings, we need to process each element recursively.

Wait, the problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So, individual interfaces are the base case, and anything else (like a Declaration or a tuple) is expanded.

Assuming that an interface is a non-iterable type (like a string or an object that's not an iterable), then the code could check if the item is an iterable (excluding strings) and process it recursively.

But in Python, strings are iterable, so perhaps we need to check for that. So:

for item in sequence:

    if isinstance(item, str):
        output.append(item)
    elif hasattr(item, '__iter__') or isinstance(item, tuple):  # maybe?
        # process each element in the iterable
        _normalizeargs(item, output)
    else:
        output.append(item)

Wait, but the problem mentions tuples specifically. So perhaps the code should check if the item is a tuple, or a Declaration (but since we don't have that class, maybe it's omitted, so the code only handles tuples and other iterables?).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the only composite types are tuples and Declaration instances. Since the code can't import a Declaration class, perhaps the function is supposed to process any iterable except for strings, but the problem's example may require only handling tuples.

Hmm, the problem's docstring says "Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces". So maybe Declarions are a type that needs to be expanded, but without knowing, perhaps the code will process tuples and any other iterables except for strings. But since the code can't reference Declaration, perhaps the code should only handle tuples and other iterables, but the problem may have intended that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to treat any element that is not a string or an implements spec (maybe a specific type) as needing expansion, but without more info, the safest approach is to handle tuples and other iterables (excluding strings) by expanding them.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the code to only handle tuples. Let's think of an example:

Suppose the input is a list like [ ('a', 'b'), 'c', ( 'd', 'e' ) ]

Then the normalized output would be [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' ]

So the function would recursively go into each tuple in the sequence and flatten them.

So the code would be something like:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):

    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but that would work for tuples. What about the Declaration case? Since the problem mentions them, but we can't check for them in the code (unless they are a base type). Maybe the problem expects that the code will process any iterable except for strings, so maybe using a more general approach.

Wait, perhaps the Declaration is an instance of a class that is an iterable. So, in that case, the code can treat any iterable (except strings) as needing to be expanded. So:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):

    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, str):
            output.append(item)
        elif hasattr(item, '__iter__'):
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Hmm, but checking for __iter__ might be a way to see if it's an iterable. But this could include things like lists, tuples, etc.

Wait, but the problem's docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So, perhaps an "individual interface" is a non-iterable (like a string) or maybe a specific object. So, if the item is an iterable (like a list, tuple, or Declaration), then expand it. So the code would check if it's an iterable and not a string, then process it recursively.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to treat any element that is not a string as needing expansion if it's an iterable. So:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):

    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, str):
            output.append(item)
        elif isinstance(item, (tuple, list)) or hasattr(item, '__iter__'):
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but this might include things like dictionaries, which are iterables (they iterate over keys). So perhaps we should be more careful. Alternatively, perhaps the problem only requires handling tuples and other sequences, but without more info, perhaps the code should handle tuples and any other iterables except strings.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the code only processes tuples, and any other composite types (like Declarations) would be handled via their own __iter__ methods. So, the code can just check if it's an iterable (excluding strings) and process it.

Alternatively, maybe the problem's mention of Declarions is a red herring, and the code only needs to handle tuples. Let's think of the example given in the problem's docstring. Suppose the input is a list containing a Declaration, a tuple, and an interface. The Declaration would be expanded into its contents, which might be a list of interfaces. The tuple would be expanded into its elements. So the code would need to process any iterable except individual interfaces (strings).

But without knowing the exact types, perhaps the correct approach is to process any iterable (excluding strings) by expanding them recursively.

So, the code would be something like:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, str):
            output.append(item)
        elif hasattr(item, '__iter__'):
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but what about other types that are not strings but are iterable, like a list of numbers? Suppose the input is [ [1,2], 3 ], then the code would process the list [1,2], so the output would be [1,2,3]. But maybe in the context of the problem, such numbers are considered interfaces. But the problem's example might not require that. The problem says "individual interfaces or implements specs" are not expanded, so perhaps any non-string, non-iterable is okay? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to flatten all iterables except for strings, so the code above would work.

Alternatively, maybe the function should check if the item is a tuple or a list, but not a string, and then process it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the code only processes tuples and ignores other iterables. Let's see:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

This would handle tuples but not other iterables like lists. But the problem's docstring mentions Declarions and tuples, so maybe Declarions are treated as iterables. But without knowing, perhaps the code should handle any iterable except for strings. Let me go with the first approach where any iterable (except strings) is expanded.

Wait, but what about the case where an item is a list? Suppose the input is [ ['a', 'b'], 'c' ], then the normalized output would be ['a','b','c'], which is correct.

So the code using __iter__ would work. But in Python, strings have __iter__ too, so we need to exclude them.

Wait, in the code:

if isinstance(item, str):

then append, else check if it's an iterable.

Wait, but for a list, it has __iter__, so it would be processed recursively. But the problem's example includes lists as needing expansion? The problem's docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So if a list is an "implements spec" or not?

Hmm, perhaps the problem's "implements specs" are specific structures, but without knowing, maybe the code should treat all iterables except strings as needing expansion. So the code would work as:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, str):
            output.append(item)
        elif hasattr(item, '__iter__'):
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but what about other iterables like dictionaries? They have __iter__, but iterating over them gives keys. So if someone passes a dictionary, it would be expanded into its keys, which might not be intended. But perhaps in the context of the problem, the inputs are only lists, tuples, or Declarions (which are iterables), so this code is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that only tuples and Declarions (which are treated as iterables) are expanded, and other iterables like lists are not. But since we can't check for Declarions, perhaps the problem expects the code to handle only tuples.

Hmm. Let me re-read the problem's docstring again.

"Normalize declaration arguments

Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
interfaces.

Anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded."

Ah, so Declarions and tuples are the composite types to be expanded. Implements specs are not to be expanded. So perhaps "implements specs" are things like a tuple with certain keywords, but I'm not sure. The key is that anything that is not an individual interface (like a string) or an implements spec (maybe a specific object) needs to be expanded. But without knowing the exact types, the code can only handle the cases it can check.

If Declarions are a known type, then the code should check for that. Since we can't assume that in the code (as it's not imported), perhaps the problem expects that Declarions are treated as iterables, so the code should check for tuples and any other iterable. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the code only processes tuples and ignores other structures, so the code can be written to handle only tuples.

In that case, the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

This would flatten all tuples in the sequence, but not lists or other iterables. However, the problem mentions Declarions, so perhaps the code needs to handle those. Since we can't check for Declarions in the code (as they are not defined here), maybe the problem expects that the code uses a different approach, such as checking for any iterable except strings.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's "Declarions" are just an example, and the code should treat any iterable (except strings) as needing expansion. So the first approach is better.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the input is:

sequence = ( ('a', 'b'), 'c', ('d', 'e'), [ 'f', 'g' ] )

The desired output would be ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'] ?

If so, then the code using __iter__ would handle lists as well. But if the problem expects lists not to be expanded, then perhaps only tuples and Declarions (unknown) are to be expanded. But since I can't know, perhaps the problem expects the code to handle any iterable except strings, so the first approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's "implements specs" are the ones not to expand, but I can't tell. Maybe the code should just expand tuples and Declarions, but since Declarions are not a type I can check here, perhaps the code is intended to just handle tuples and other iterables. 

Another approach: maybe the function is supposed to process any element that is a sequence (like a tuple, list, etc.) except for strings. So using isinstance(item, str) to exclude them. 

Thus, the code would be as follows. I'll proceed with that.

Wait, but in the problem's function signature, the output is an optional parameter. The function should return the output list. So in the code, after processing all elements, return output.

So putting it all together:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, str):
            output.append(item)
        elif hasattr(item, '__iter__'):
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but checking for hasattr(item, '__iter__') includes things like dictionaries, which might not be intended. But perhaps in the problem's context, the inputs are only tuples, lists, Declarions (which are iterables), and strings. So this code would work.

Alternatively, to avoid processing dictionaries, maybe check if it's a list-like type. But perhaps the problem doesn't require that, so the code above is acceptable.

Another possible issue is that the __iter__ check includes things like generators. But perhaps the problem doesn't care.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check if it's a tuple or a list, but that's more restrictive. Let me think of the problem's example again. The docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So if an item is a list (not an individual interface or implements spec), then it should be expanded. So the code's approach is correct.

Therefore, I'll write the code accordingly.
