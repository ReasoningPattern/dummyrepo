Okay, I need to write a Python function called split that takes a string s and a platform parameter. The platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. The function should split the string according to the platform's path splitting rules. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, if the platform is 'this', I need to auto-detect the current platform. On Windows, the path separator is backslash, but in Python, when using split, maybe I should use os.path.split or something similar. Wait, but the problem says to split the input string according to the platform's style. So for POSIX (platform 1), the separator is '/', and for Windows (platform 0), it's '\'.

But wait, in Python, when splitting strings, using split('/') would split on forward slashes, which is correct for POSIX. For Windows, splitting on backslashes, but since backslashes are escape characters in strings, I need to use either a raw string or double backslashes. However, when using the split method, the separator is a single backslash, but in Python, you need to write it as '\\' or use a raw string.

Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to split the string into parts based on the path separators. For example, on POSIX, splitting '/home/user' would give ['', 'home', 'user'], but maybe the function should split on the separator and remove empty strings? Or maybe not. The problem says to return the splitting result, but the example isn't given. Let me check the docstring again.

The docstring says that the function returns a list of splitting str. So for example, if the input is 'a/b/c' on POSIX, splitting would give ['a', 'b', 'c'], but if it's 'a\b\c' on Windows, splitting would give ['a', 'b', 'c'].

Wait, but how to split the string. For POSIX, split on '/', for Windows, split on '\'. However, in Python, the split method would split on the separator. So for example, 'a/b/c'.split('/') gives ['a', 'b', 'c'], which is correct. For 'a\\b\\c'.split('\\') gives ['a', 'b', 'c'].

But how to handle the platform detection. If platform is 'this', then check the current OS. On Windows, use Windows style, else use POSIX. So, perhaps using os.name or sys.platform. For example, os.name is 'nt' for Windows, and 'posix' for Unix-like systems. So, if platform is 'this', then determine the current platform and set the separator accordingly.

So the steps would be:

1. Determine the separator based on the platform parameter.
   - If platform is 1: separator is '/'
   - If platform is 0: separator is '\'
   - If platform is 'this': check the current OS. If it's Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then separator is '\', else '/'.
2. Split the input string s using the determined separator.
3. Return the list of parts.

Wait, but how to split the string. For example, if the string is 'C:\\Users\\Name', splitting on '\\' would give ['C:', 'Users', 'Name'].

But what about cases where the separator is part of a filename? For example, in Windows, 'C:\Users\Name\file.txt' would split into ['C:', 'Users', 'Name', 'file.txt'].

But the function's purpose is to split the string into parts based on the platform's path separator. So the split is straightforward.

Now, the code. Let's outline:

Import re? The user mentioned imported packages include re, but maybe it's not needed here. The function may not need regular expressions. Let me check the problem again. The user provided that the imported packages include re, but maybe the split can be done with the split method.

But perhaps the problem is more complex. For example, in Windows, the path separator is backslash, but in Python, when splitting, you have to use '\\' as the separator. So, for example, s.split('\\') would split on backslashes.

But in code, if the platform is 0, then the separator is '\\' (since in a string, a single backslash is written as two backslashes). Wait, no. In Python, the string 'a\\b' represents a single backslash. So when splitting, if the separator is a single backslash, then the split would be done on each backslash. So for example, 'a\\b\\c'.split('\\') would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'].

So the code can be:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'nt':
            sep = '\\'
        else:
            sep = '/'
    elif platform == 1:
        sep = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        sep = '\\'
    else:
        # handle invalid platform? But the docstring says platform is 'this', 1, or 0. So maybe assume valid input.
        pass
    return s.split(sep)

Wait, but what about the case where the platform is 'this' but the current OS is something else? Like, on a Mac, which is POSIX. So the code would use '/' as the separator.

But then, the function would split the string using the separator. However, the problem says that when platform is 0, use Windows/CMD style. So splitting on backslashes. But in Python, the split method would split on each occurrence of the separator.

But what about leading or trailing separators? For example, if the input is '/home/user/', splitting on '/' would give ['', 'home', 'user', ''].

But the problem's docstring doesn't specify whether to filter out empty strings. The example isn't given. The original function's behavior may depend on the split method's default behavior, which includes empty strings.

But the user hasn't provided examples, so perhaps the code should just split the string using the separator as determined, and return the list as is.

So, the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'nt':
            sep = '\\'
        else:
            sep = '/'
    elif platform == 1:
        sep = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        sep = '\\'
    else:
        # invalid platform? But according to the docstring, platform is one of 'this', 1, 0.
        # So perhaps raise an error? But the problem doesn't mention it. So maybe assume valid input.
        pass
    return s.split(sep)

Wait, but the problem says that the imported packages include re. But in this code, re is not used. Maybe the original intention was to use regular expressions? For example, splitting on multiple separators or something else. But the problem says that the function is to split the input string under the given platform. So perhaps the split is straightforward.

But maybe the problem expects to split on the path separators, but also handle cases where the path may have different separators. For example, on Windows, paths can have both backslashes and forward slashes. But according to the problem statement, when platform is 0, use Windows/CMD style, which uses backslashes. So the split is done on backslashes.

But the code above uses the split method, which splits on every occurrence of the separator. So that's correct.

But what about the case when the platform is 'this' and the current OS is Windows. Then, the code uses backslash as the separator. So splitting the string on backslashes.

But in Python, when you split a string with s.split('\\'), you need to pass a single backslash as the separator. However, in Python, the string '\\' is a single backslash. So the code is correct.

So the code seems to handle that.

But the user mentioned that the imported packages include re. However, in this code, re is not used. Maybe the original problem intended to use re.split, but the user's code doesn't need it. But according to the problem statement, the code should be generated based on the given function signature and docstring, and the imported packages are re. But maybe the code doesn't need re.

So the code would be as above, but with the import os. However, the user's context says that imported packages are re, but within the file, perhaps the code is allowed to import os. But the user's context says that within the file, there's nothing. So the code would need to import os.

But the user's context says that imported packages are re. So maybe the code is supposed to use re. But why?

Wait, perhaps the split is not just splitting on the separator, but also handling more complex cases. For example, in Windows, the path may have different separators, or maybe the split should consider different possible separators. But according to the problem statement, when platform is 0, use Windows/CMD style. So the split is on backslashes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about splitting the string into parts similar to how os.path.split works, but that's more complex. However, the problem says to return the splitting result, which is a list of splitting str. So the code as written would be correct.

But perhaps the problem expects that when platform is 0, the split is done using the Windows path separator, which is backslash, and for POSIX, forward slash. So the code is correct.

So the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'nt':
            sep = '\\'
        else:
            sep = '/'
    elif platform == 1:
        sep = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        sep = '\\'
    else:
        # handle invalid platform? But according to the docstring, platform is one of 'this', 1, 0.
        # So perhaps assume valid input.
        pass
    return s.split(sep)

But the user's context says that imported packages are re. However, in this code, re is not used. Maybe there's a mistake here. But according to the problem statement, the code is to be generated based on the function signature and docstring. The imported packages are re, but maybe the code doesn't need it. So the code is correct as written.

But perhaps the problem expects to use re.split with a regular expression. For example, in Windows, the path may have multiple backslashes, but splitting on any number of them. However, the split method in Python splits on each occurrence of the separator. For example, 'a\\b\\c'.split('\\') gives ['a', 'b', 'c'], which is correct.

Therefore, the code is correct as written.
