Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the workspace_manager function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to get the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

First, I need to make sure I understand the context. The imported packages are os, sys, infrared. The file contains several methods like self._get_service, setup, plugins_manager, etc. The workspace_manager is part of this class, and it's supposed to retrieve a service using the _get_service method.

The function signature is def workspace_manager(cls):, which is a class method. The docstring says it uses ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER. So, the code should call cls._get_service with that service name.

Wait, the user mentioned that within the class, there's a method self._get_service(cls, name). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Normally, _get_service would be an instance method, but here it's written as self._get_service(cls, name). Maybe that's a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, in Python, if it's a class method, it would take cls as the first parameter. But the way it's written here, maybe the _get_service is a class method?

Alternatively, maybe the _get_service is an instance method, and the cls parameter is a mistake. But given the context, the user provided that within the class, there's self._get_service(cls, name). Hmm, perhaps the _get_service is a static method or a class method. But in any case, the workspace_manager is supposed to call cls._get_service with ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER.

So the code inside the workspace_manager function would be returning cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER). But wait, the parameters for _get_service in the context are (cls, name). Wait, the user wrote within the class: self._get_service(cls, name). That seems odd because normally, instance methods take self as the first parameter. Unless _get_service is a class method, which would take cls as the first parameter. So maybe _get_service is a class method.

So, the workspace_manager is a class method, and it calls cls._get_service, passing ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER as the name. Therefore, the code would be:

return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But the function is defined as def workspace_manager(cls):, so it's a class method. But in Python, class methods are defined with @classmethod. However, the user didn't mention any decorators. Maybe the function is intended to be a class method, but the code might not have the decorator. However, the user's context shows that within the class, there's self._get_service(cls, name), which might imply that _get_service is a class method. But this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_service is an instance method, and the cls parameter is a mistake. But given the user's context, I have to go with what's provided. The function workspace_manager is supposed to call cls._get_service with the service name. So the code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But wait, the parameters for _get_service in the context are (cls, name). So the first parameter is cls, then name. So when calling cls._get_service, the first argument is cls, but in the code above, we're passing ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER as the first argument. That would be incorrect. Wait, no. If _get_service is a class method, then it's called on the class, and the first parameter is cls. So, for example, if you have a class method:

@classmethod
def _get_service(cls, name):
    ...

Then, when you call cls._get_service(...), the first argument is cls, and the second is name. So in the workspace_manager function, the code should be:

return cls._get_service(cls, ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

Wait, but that would pass cls as the first argument (which is the class itself) and the service name as the second. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the _get_service is an instance method, and the cls parameter is a mistake. But given the user's context, the code for _get_service is written as self._get_service(cls, name), which suggests that when called on an instance, it's passing the class as the first argument. That's unusual. Maybe it's a static method?

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the context description, and the _get_service is an instance method that takes 'self' as the first parameter, and then 'name' as the second. But the user wrote self._get_service(cls, name), which would be incorrect. But given that, perhaps the correct code is:

return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

Assuming that _get_service is a class method that takes the service name as its only argument. But the user's context says that within the class, the method is self._get_service(cls, name), which would imply that the method is called with two parameters: cls and name. So maybe the _get_service is a static method, and the code is written as:

def _get_service(cls, name):
    ...

But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that _get_service is an instance method, and the code is written incorrectly. But given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that the workspace_manager is supposed to call cls._get_service with the service name as the argument, and that the _get_service method is a class method that takes the service name as its only parameter. Therefore, the code would be:

return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER is defined somewhere. Since the user mentioned that the imported packages include infrared, perhaps ServiceName is from that module. But the user didn't specify, so I'll assume that ServiceName is available in the context.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But wait, the original function signature doesn't have a return statement. However, the docstring says it "gets" the workspace manager, implying that it returns it. So adding the return statement is necessary.

But the user's existing code in the context includes methods like self.setup, self.plugins_manager, etc., which might be instance methods. However, the workspace_manager is defined as a class method (since it takes cls as the first parameter). So the code should be correct as written.
