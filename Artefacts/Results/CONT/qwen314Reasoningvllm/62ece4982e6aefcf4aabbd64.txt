Okay, I need to write a Python function called strip_root that takes a path and a root, and removes the root from the path. If it can't do that, it should throw an exception. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to remove the root from the path. So, for example, if the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home', the result should be 'user/file.txt'. But how do I handle different cases? Like if the path starts with the root, or if it's a subdirectory.

Maybe I can check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then I can slice the path to remove the root part. But I need to be careful with trailing slashes. Like, if the root is '/home/' and the path is '/home/user/', then stripping the root would leave '/user/'.

Wait, but the problem says if it fails, throw an exception. So what counts as a failure? Probably if the path doesn't start with the root. So, if the path doesn't begin with the root, then we can't strip it, so raise an exception.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception.
2. If it does, then remove the root from the beginning of the path.
3. Return the resulting path.

But how to handle cases where the root is a prefix but with different slashes? Like, maybe the root is 'home' and the path is '/home/user'? Well, the function's parameters probably assume that the root is a directory path, so maybe it's intended to be a prefix.

So, in Python, to check if a string starts with another string, we can use the startswith() method. So, path.startswith(root). But what about if the root is longer than the path? Like, if the path is 'file.txt' and the root is '/home'? Then startswith would return False, which is correct.

So, the code would be something like:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with the specified root.")
    return path[len(root):]

Wait, but what if the root ends with a slash and the path has a slash after? Like root is '/home/' and path is '/home/user/'. Then path starts with root, and slicing would give 'user/'.

But what if the root is not a directory? Like, if the root is a file path. But the function's responsibility is just to remove the root from the path, regardless of whether it's a directory or not. So the function doesn't need to check if the root is a directory; it's just a string.

But the problem says to throw an exception if it fails. So the only failure case is when the path does not start with the root. So the code would be as above.

Wait, but maybe there's a case where the root is a substring somewhere in the path, but not at the beginning. But the function is supposed to remove the root from the path, which implies that the root is a prefix. So the function is designed to work when the root is a prefix of the path.

Therefore, the code seems correct. Let me test some examples.

Example 1:
path = '/home/user/file.txt', root = '/home'
path starts with root, so return path[5:] which is '/user/file.txt'.

Wait, but the root is '/home' (length 5?), let's see: '/home' is 5 characters (including the slash). So path[len(root):] would be from index 5 onwards. So yes.

Another example: path is 'home/user', root is 'home' → returns '/user'? Wait, no. If the path is 'home/user' and root is 'home', then path starts with root. So slicing would give '/user'? Wait, 'home/user' is the path. The root is 'home', so len(root) is 4. So path[4:] is '/user'.

But if the path is 'home/user' and the root is 'home/', then the startswith would check if 'home/user' starts with 'home/', which it does. Then slicing would give 'user'.

But what if the path is exactly the root? Like path is '/home' and root is '/home' → returns empty string?

Yes. So the function would return an empty string in that case, which is correct.

But what if the path is '/home/user' and the root is '/home'? Then the result is '/user'.

But maybe the user expects to have the leading slash removed? Like, if the path is '/home/user' and root is '/home', then the result is 'user', not '/user'. But that depends on how the function is intended to work.

Wait, the problem says "remove root from path". So if the path is '/home/user' and the root is '/home', then removing the root would leave '/user'? Or 'user'?

This depends on whether the root is considered as a prefix including the trailing slash. For example, if the root is '/home', then the path starts with '/home', so stripping it would leave '/user'.

But if the root is '/home/' (with a trailing slash), then the path '/home/user' does not start with '/home/', so the function would raise an exception. But if the path is '/home/user/', then it starts with '/home/', and stripping would leave 'user/'.

So the function's behavior depends on how the root is provided. The function is designed to remove the root as a prefix, exactly as given.

So the code as written would work.

But what about cases where the path is not a string? Well, the function parameters are path and root, which are expected to be strings. The code doesn't handle other types, but the problem doesn't mention that, so we can assume that the inputs are strings.

So the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with the specified root.")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is an empty string? Then path.startswith('') is always True, and the function would return path[0:], which is the entire path. But according to the problem statement, maybe the root is supposed to be a non-empty string. However, the problem doesn't specify, so the code would handle that case.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So, perhaps if the root is empty, it's considered a failure? Or is it allowed?

The problem statement isn't clear. But given that the function's purpose is to remove the root, perhaps the root is intended to be a non-empty string. However, the code as written would allow empty root, and in that case, return the original path. But maybe that's considered a failure? For example, if the root is empty, then stripping it would leave the path as is. But maybe the function is supposed to require that the root is a non-empty string.

But the problem's docstring doesn't mention that. So perhaps the code as written is correct.

Another possible edge case: path is empty. Then, if root is also empty, it returns empty. But if root is non-empty, then path.startswith(root) would be False, and exception is raised.

But again, the problem doesn't specify, so the code as written is correct.

So the code seems to fulfill the requirements. The function checks if the path starts with the root. If not, it raises a ValueError. Otherwise, it returns the path with the root stripped off.

So the final code is as above.
