Okay, I need to generate Python code for the isoparse method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is supposed to parse an ISO-8601 datetime string into a datetime object. The docstring mentions various supported date and time formats, including common and uncommon ones like ISO weeks. Also, time zones are handled with specific formats.

First, I'll check the context provided. The imported packages are functools, re, calendar, datetime, six. The class has several helper methods like _parse_isodate, _parse_isotime, _calculate_weekdate, parse_tzstr, etc. The separator is stored in self._sep, and there are regex patterns like _FRACTION_REGEX.

The isoparse method needs to split the input string into date and time parts, parse each part using the appropriate helper functions, handle time zones, and combine everything into a datetime object.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Split the input string into date_part and time_part using the separator (probably 'T' as per ISO standard).
2. Parse the date_part using _parse_isodate, which might call _parse_isodate_common or _parse_isodate_uncommon depending on the format.
3. Parse the time_part using _parse_isotime, which handles different time formats including fractional seconds.
4. Handle time zones by parsing the tz_str with parse_tzstr, which returns a tzinfo object.
5. Combine the parsed date, time, and timezone into a datetime object.

Wait, the docstring says that incomplete date formats (like YYYY-MM) can't be combined with a time. So if the date part is incomplete (like YYYY-MM) and there's a time part, that's invalid. Need to check that.

Also, the date formats include common ones like YYYY-MM-DD and uncommon ones like YYYY-Www-D. The _parse_isodate method probably checks for these formats.

Looking at the helper methods, _parse_isodate_common would handle the common date formats, and _parse_isodate_uncommon handles the ISO week formats. The _calculate_weekdate method would convert the week and day into a date.

For the time parsing, _parse_isotime would handle the different time formats, including fractional seconds. The _FRACTION_REGEX might be used to capture the fractional part.

Time zones are parsed with parse_tzstr, which returns a tzoffset or tzutc object.

Putting it all together, the isoparse method would:

- Split the input string into date and time parts.
- Check if the date part is valid and compatible with having a time part.
- Parse date and time separately.
- Parse the timezone if present.
- Combine into a datetime object with the parsed components and timezone.

Now, considering the code structure, the method would use regular expressions to split the string, call the helper methods, and handle exceptions or invalid formats.

I need to make sure that the code uses the helper methods mentioned in the context. For example, self._parse_isodate, self._parse_isotime, self.parse_tzstr, etc.

Also, note that the separator could be 'T' or another character, but according to the docstring, the separator is a single character, which is 'T' in the standard. However, the code might allow other separators if the class is initialized with a different one (self._sep).

Wait, in the context, there's self._DATE_SEP and self._TIME_SEP. Maybe the date and time parts are separated by self._sep, which is set during initialization. So the code should split the input string using self._sep as the separator.

So, the code would split dt_str into date_str and time_str using self._sep. Then, check if the date_str is valid and if the time_str is present, ensuring that the date is complete (if time is present).

For example, if the date is YYYY-MM (incomplete) and time is present, that's invalid. The code should raise an error in that case.

Then, parse the date_str with self._parse_isodate, which would return a date object. Similarly, parse the time_str with self._parse_isotime, returning a time object. Then, combine them into a datetime object.

Handling time zones: after splitting, check if there's a timezone part. The timezone could be at the end of the string, possibly after the time part. For example, "2023-10-05T12:30:00Z" or "2023-10-05T12:30:00+02:00".

So, after splitting date and time, check if the time_str ends with a timezone. Maybe the code would split the time_str into time_part and tz_str, or check the entire dt_str for a timezone.

Alternatively, the code might first split into date and time parts, then check if the time part has a timezone. But that might be complicated. Another approach is to split the entire string into date, time, and tz parts.

Alternatively, after splitting date and time, check if the time part has a timezone. But perhaps the code uses a regex to capture the entire datetime string, including the timezone.

But given that the helper methods exist like parse_tzstr, perhaps the code first splits the string into date and time parts, then checks for a timezone in the time part or after.

This is getting a bit complex. Let me look for patterns in the helper methods. The _parse_isodate and _parse_isotime methods are probably responsible for parsing their respective parts, and the tz parsing is handled by parse_tzstr.

So, the code for isoparse might be structured as:

def isoparse(self, dt_str):
    # Split into date and time parts using self._sep
    parts = dt_str.split(self._sep, 1)
    if len(parts) == 1:
        # No time part, only date
        date_str = parts[0]
        time_str = None
    else:
        date_str, time_str = parts
        # Check if date is complete (if time is present)
        # For example, if date is YYYY-MM, time is present, invalid
        # How to check that? Maybe the _parse_isodate method returns a date object, and if it's incomplete, but time is present, raise error.

    # Parse date
    date = self._parse_isodate(date_str)
    # Parse time if present
    time = None
    tz = None
    if time_str:
        # Split time_str into time and tz
        # Check if time_str ends with a timezone
        # Maybe use a regex to split time and tz
        # For example, match time part and tz part
        # Assuming that the time_str can have a timezone at the end
        # So, split time_str into time_part and tz_str
        # Use regex to capture time and tz
        # For example, using re.match to find the time part and possible tz
        # But since the helper method parse_tzstr exists, perhaps the code first parses the time, then the tz
        # But how to separate them?

        # Maybe split time_str into time_part and tz_str using a regex
        # For example, match the time part and then check for tz
        # But this requires knowing the regex patterns used in the helper methods.

        # Alternatively, the code could split the time_str into time_part and tz_str by checking for the presence of a timezone at the end.

        # For example, check if the time_str ends with Z, +HH:MM, etc.
        # But this could be error-prone. Alternatively, use the parse_tzstr method on the time_str.

        # Wait, the parse_tzstr method is probably used to parse the timezone from the end of the string.

        # So, perhaps after splitting into date and time parts, the code then checks if the time_str has a timezone, and splits it into time_part and tz_str.

        # Let's assume that the code uses a regex to split the time_str into time_part and tz_str.

        # For example, using a regex that captures the time part and the optional timezone.

        # But without knowing the exact regex, I'll have to make an assumption.

        # Maybe the code first tries to parse the time_str as a time, and if that fails, tries to parse the timezone.

        # Alternatively, the code uses a regex to split the time_str into time_part and tz_str.

        # Let's proceed with splitting the time_str into time_part and tz_str using a regex.

        # For example, using re.match to find the time part and then the tz.

        # Assuming that the time_str can be split into time_part and tz_str.

        # Then, parse the time_part with _parse_isotime, and parse the tz_str with parse_tzstr.

        # So, in code:

        # Split time_str into time_part and tz_str
        # Using a regex that matches the time format and optional tz
        # For example:

        # time_match = re.match(r'^(.*?)([+-]?\d{1,2}(:?\d{2})?|Z)$', time_str)
        # if time_match:
        #     time_part = time_match.group(1)
        #     tz_str = time_match.group(2)
        # else:
        #     time_part = time_str
        #     tz_str = None

        # But this is just an example. The actual regex would depend on the helper methods.

        # Since the helper methods exist, perhaps the code uses them to parse the time and tz.

        # So, after splitting date and time, the code would parse the time_str into time and tz.

        # For example:

        # Split time_str into time_part and tz_str
        # Then parse time_part with _parse_isotime
        # Then parse tz_str with parse_tzstr

        # But how to split time_str into time_part and tz_str?

        # Maybe the code uses a regex that captures the time part and then the tz.

        # Let's proceed with that approach.

        # Assuming that the code uses a regex to split time_str into time_part and tz_str.

        # For example:

        # tz_match = re.search(r'[+-]?\d{1,2}(:?\d{2})?$|Z$', time_str)
        # if tz_match:
        #     tz_str = tz_match.group(0)
        #     time_part = time_str[:tz_match.start()]
        # else:
        #     tz_str = None
        #     time_part = time_str

        # But again, this is speculative.

        # Alternatively, the code could check if the time_str ends with a timezone, and split accordingly.

        # For the sake of writing the code, I'll proceed with splitting the time_str into time_part and tz_str using a regex that matches the timezone at the end.

        # Then, parse the time_part with _parse_isotime, and the tz_str with parse_tzstr.

        # Once parsed, combine date, time, and tz into a datetime object.

    # After parsing date and time, combine them into a datetime object.

    # Also, handle the timezone.

    # So, putting it all together, the code would:

    # Split dt_str into date and time parts.
    # Parse date.
    # If time part exists, parse time and tz.
    # Combine date, time, and tz into a datetime.

    # Also, handle cases where the date is incomplete and time is present, which is invalid.

    # Now, implementing this in code.

    # Also, note that the date_str may be in uncommon formats like YYYY-Www-D, which are handled by _parse_isodate_uncommon.

    # The code for isoparse would be something like:

    import re
    from datetime import datetime

    def isoparse(self, dt_str):
        # Split into date and time parts
        if self._sep in dt_str:
            date_str, time_str = dt_str.split(self._sep, 1)
        else:
            date_str = dt_str
            time_str = None

        # Parse date
        date = self._parse_isodate(date_str)

        # Check if date is complete when time is present
        # For example, if date is YYYY-MM (incomplete) and time is present, it's invalid
        # How to check that? Maybe the _parse_isodate method returns a date with certain components
        # For example, if the date has a day component, it's complete. If not, and time is present, it's invalid.

        # Assuming that the _parse_isodate method returns a date object, and if it's incomplete, but time is present, raise error.

        # For example:
        if time_str is not None:
            # Check if the date is complete
            if not date.day:  # Assuming that if day is not set, it's incomplete
                raise ValueError("Incomplete date with time component")

        # Parse time and tz
        time = None
        tz = None
        if time_str:
            # Split time_str into time_part and tz_str
            tz_match = re.search(r'[+-]?\d{1,2}(:?\d{2})?$|Z$', time_str)
            if tz_match:
                tz_str = tz_match.group(0)
                time_part = time_str[:tz_match.start()]
            else:
                tz_str = None
                time_part = time_str

            # Parse time_part
            time = self._parse_isotime(time_part)

            # Parse tz_str
            if tz_str:
                tz = self.parse_tzstr(tz_str, zero_as_utc=True)

        # Combine date, time, and tz into a datetime
        # Assuming that date is a date object and time is a time object
        # But in Python, combining them requires creating a datetime object with date and time components.

        # However, the _parse_isodate and _parse_isotime methods may return datetime components or separate date and time parts.

        # Wait, the helper methods may return a datetime object or separate date and time. Need to check.

        # Assuming that _parse_isodate returns a date object, and _parse_isotime returns a time object. Then, combining them into a datetime.

        # So:

        if time is not None:
            dt = datetime.combine(date, time, tzinfo=tz)
        else:
            dt = datetime.combine(date, datetime.min.time(), tzinfo=tz)

        return dt

But this is a rough sketch. However, the actual code may have more details, like handling fractional seconds, different date formats, etc.

Also, the code needs to handle the case where the date is parsed as an ISO week (YYYY-Www-D), which is handled by _parse_isodate_uncommon and _calculate_weekdate.

Another thing is that the date_str may have a separator other than 'T', but the code uses self._sep for splitting.

Also, the code should handle the case where the time_str has a timezone, which is parsed with parse_tzstr.

But I'm not sure about the exact implementation details of the helper methods. However, based on the context provided, the code should use the helper methods as mentioned.

Another point is that the date_str may be in a format that requires the _parse_isodate_common or _parse_isodate_uncommon methods. The _parse_isodate method would call these based on the format of the date_str.

In conclusion, the code for isoparse would split the input string into date and time parts, parse each with the appropriate helper methods, handle time zones, and combine them into a datetime object.
