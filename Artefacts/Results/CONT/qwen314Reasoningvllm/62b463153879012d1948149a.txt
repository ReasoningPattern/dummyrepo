Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _group_files_by_xml_filename function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it groups files by xmls and returns data in a dict format. 

So the parameters are source, xmls, and files. The source is probably the directory or zip file where the files are located. The xmls might be a list of XML filenames, and files is a list of all the files found. The goal is to group the files based on their association with each XML file.

Looking at the context, there are helper functions like select_filenames_by_prefix, match_file_by_prefix, explore_source, and others. Maybe the function uses these to find which files correspond to each XML.

Wait, the function's name suggests that for each XML filename in xmls, it groups the files that are related to it. How are the files related? Maybe the files have a prefix that matches the XML filename. For example, if an XML is 'document.xml', then files like 'document_page1.jpg' or 'document_data.csv' would be grouped under that XML.

So the approach could be: for each XML in xmls, find all files in 'files' that have a prefix matching the XML's base name. Then group those files under the XML's key in the dictionary.

The helper function select_filenames_by_prefix might take a prefix and a list of files and return those that start with that prefix. But how is the prefix determined from the XML filename? Maybe the prefix is the XML filename without the .xml extension. For example, if the XML is 'report.xml', the prefix is 'report', and files starting with 'report_' or 'report' would be grouped.

So the steps for the function could be:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the grouped files.
2. Iterate over each XML filename in the xmls list.
3. For each XML, extract the base name (without the .xml extension).
4. Use the select_filenames_by_prefix function with this base name and the files list to get matching files.
5. Add an entry to the dictionary with the XML filename as the key and the list of matching files as the value.
6. Return the populated dictionary.

Wait, but the parameters include 'source' as well. Maybe the source is needed to determine the correct files, but the files parameter is already a list of files. Perhaps the source is used in the helper functions, but in this function, the files are already provided. So maybe the source isn't directly used here, but the helper functions that are called might use it.

But according to the parameters, the function is given 'files', which is probably the list of all files found in the source. So the function doesn't need to explore the source again. It just needs to group the existing files based on the XMLs.

Another thing: the function might need to handle cases where multiple XMLs have the same base name. But the xmls list is probably unique, or the function is designed to handle that.

So putting this together, the code would look something like:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    grouped = {}
    for xml in xmls:
        prefix = os.path.splitext(xml)[0]  # Remove .xml extension
        matched_files = select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files)
        grouped[xml] = matched_files
    return grouped

But wait, the select_filenames_by_prefix function is mentioned in the context. So that function is supposed to select files that start with the given prefix. However, the parameters for select_filenames_by_prefix are (prefix, files), which matches what I'm doing here.

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct helper functions. Also, the files parameter is a list of file paths. So the select_filenames_by_prefix would check if each file's name starts with the prefix.

Another thing to consider: the XML filenames might have different extensions, but the code uses os.path.splitext, which splits on the last dot. So if the XML is 'data.xml', the prefix is 'data'. If there's an XML named 'datafile.xml', the prefix is 'datafile'.

This seems reasonable. So the code would loop through each XML, generate the prefix, find matching files, and group them.

I think that's the approach. Now, writing the code accordingly.
