Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_request_el that checks if an object has both 'fill' and 'request' attributes. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes an object 'obj' as a parameter. The goal is to check if this object has both attributes. So, I need to verify the presence of 'fill' and 'request' in the object's attributes.

In Python, to check if an object has a certain attribute, I can use the hasattr() function. So, for each attribute, I'll use hasattr(obj, 'attribute_name').

But wait, the function is supposed to check for both attributes. So, I need to make sure that both exist. That means using two hasattr calls, one for 'fill' and another for 'request', and then returning True only if both are True.

So the code would be something like:

return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request')

But wait, the function is named is_fill_request_el. Maybe the 'el' in the name is a typo or stands for something? But the docstring says to check for fill and request attributes, so probably the name is correct as given.

I should make sure that the function returns True only when both attributes are present. So the logic is straightforward.

I don't need to import anything because hasattr is a built-in function. So the code should be simple.

Let me test this logic. Suppose an object has both attributes: returns True. If one is missing, returns False. That's correct.

So the code inside the function is just the return statement with the two hasattr checks.
