Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the addignored function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to use git to get file names, filter the ignored ones, sort them, and return as a comma-separated string.

First, I need to figure out how to execute the git command. The subprocess module is imported, so I'll use subprocess.run. The git command to list ignored files is 'git status --ignored --short', maybe? Wait, I remember that 'git status --ignored' shows ignored files, but the --short option gives a shorter format. Alternatively, 'git ls-files --ignored' might be more direct. Let me check. Oh right, 'git ls-files --ignored' lists all ignored files in the repository. That's probably the right command here.

So, I'll run that command using subprocess. The output will be the list of ignored files. Then I need to process that output. Each line is a filename. So I'll split the output into lines, strip any whitespace, and collect them into a list.

Wait, but the git command's output might have paths with spaces. So splitting by newlines and stripping each line should handle that. Then, I need to sort the list of filenames. The docstring says to sort the list for only ignored files. Wait, maybe the git command already gives the ignored files, so the list is already filtered. So the sorting is just to order them alphabetically.

Once sorted, join them with commas. Then return that string.

So putting it all together: use subprocess to run the git command, capture the output, split into lines, strip each, sort, then join.

But need to handle possible errors. However, the problem statement doesn't mention error handling, so maybe assume that the command runs successfully. Also, the function is supposed to return the string, so if there are no ignored files, it returns an empty string.

Now, code steps:

- Use subprocess.run with the git command, capture stdout.
- Decode the output from bytes to string.
- Split into lines, strip each line, filter out any empty strings (in case of trailing newlines).
- Sort the list.
- Join with commas.

So the code would be:

def addignored(ignored):
    result = subprocess.run(['git', 'ls-files', '--ignored'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    files = result.stdout.splitlines()
    files = [f.strip() for f in files if f.strip()]
    files.sort()
    return ','.join(files)

Wait, but the parameter 'ignored' is passed to the function but not used. The docstring says "Turn the file names into a list, sort the list for only ignored files". Wait, maybe the 'ignored' parameter is supposed to be a list of files, and the function is supposed to add them to the ignored list? But the docstring says "Use the git command to obtain the file names", which suggests that the 'ignored' parameter might not be used. But the function signature has 'ignored' as a parameter. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the original problem. The user provided the function signature def addignored(ignored): and the docstring says "Use the git command to obtain the file names. Turn the file names into a list, sort the list for only ignored files return those files as a single string...". So perhaps the 'ignored' parameter is not used, and the function is supposed to ignore it. Or maybe it's a mistake. But according to the problem statement, the code should be generated based on the given function signature and docstring, so perhaps the 'ignored' parameter is a red herring, and the function is supposed to ignore it. Or maybe the docstring is incorrect. But given the context, the function is supposed to use git to get the ignored files, so the 'ignored' parameter might not be used. So the code I wrote earlier would be correct, ignoring the 'ignored' parameter. But that's odd. Maybe the function is supposed to add the given 'ignored' files to the git ignored list? But the docstring says to use git to get the file names, which suggests that the function is retrieving the ignored files from git, not adding any. So perhaps the 'ignored' parameter is not used, and the function is supposed to return the list of ignored files from git. Therefore, the code I wrote earlier is correct, and the 'ignored' parameter is not used. That seems odd, but perhaps that's the case. The user might have made a mistake in the function signature, but according to the problem, we need to generate code based on the given signature and docstring. So proceed as such.
