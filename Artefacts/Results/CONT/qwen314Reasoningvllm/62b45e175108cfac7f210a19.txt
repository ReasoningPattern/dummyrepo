Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_fixity method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the method validates the fixity block in an inventory. It checks the structure of the fixity block and ensures that only files listed in the manifest are referenced. If there's an error, it returns error() from the class.

First, I need to think about the parameters. The method takes 'fixity' and 'manifest_files'. The 'fixity' is probably a data structure (like a dictionary) containing information about the fixity checks, and 'manifest_files' is a list or set of files that are in the manifest.

The steps I need to perform:

1. Check the structure of the fixity block. What's the expected structure? Maybe it's a dictionary with keys like 'digests' or 'files'? The exact structure isn't specified, so I'll have to make assumptions based on typical fixity checks. For example, maybe the fixity block has a list of files and their digests.

2. Ensure that all files referenced in the fixity block are present in the manifest_files. So, iterate over each file in the fixity block and check if it's in manifest_files. If any file is not found, that's an error.

3. Also, check if the fixity block has the correct keys. For example, maybe it should have 'digests' and 'algorithm' keys. If not, that's a structural error.

4. Use the digest_regex method from the class to validate the digest formats. The digest_regex might return a regex pattern that the digests in the fixity block must match.

5. If any of these checks fail, call self.error with an appropriate code.

Now, looking at the context provided, there are several methods mentioned like self.check_digests_present_and_used, which might be used to check if the digests are present and correctly used. Also, self.digest_regex is a method that returns the regex for digests.

So, putting this together:

- First, check if the fixity block has the required structure. For example, check if 'digests' is a key and it's a dictionary. Also, check for the digest algorithm.

- Then, for each file in the fixity's digests, check if it's in manifest_files. If not, error.

- Also, validate each digest against the regex from digest_regex.

- Use self.check_digests_present_and_used to ensure that the digests are present and used correctly.

Wait, the docstring mentions that the method checks the structure and that only manifest files are referenced. So maybe the main checks are:

- Structure: fixity must be a dictionary with certain keys.

- All files in fixity's digests must be in manifest_files.

- Digests must match the regex.

So, the code might look like:

def validate_fixity(self, fixity, manifest_files):
    # Check structure of fixity
    if not isinstance(fixity, dict):
        self.error("FIXITY_NOT_DICT")
        return
    if 'digests' not in fixity:
        self.error("FIXITY_MISSING_DIGESTS")
        return
    digests = fixity['digests']
    if not isinstance(digests, dict):
        self.error("FIXITY_DIGESTS_NOT_DICT")
        return
    # Check digest algorithm
    if 'algorithm' not in fixity:
        self.error("FIXITY_MISSING_ALGORITHM")
        return
    algorithm = fixity['algorithm']
    # Check if algorithm is supported
    if algorithm not in self.digest_algorithm:
        self.error("FIXITY_UNSUPPORTED_ALGORITHM")
        return
    # Check each digest in digests
    for file, digest in digests.items():
        # Check if file is in manifest_files
        if file not in manifest_files:
            self.error(f"FIXITY_FILE_NOT_IN_MANIFEST: {file}")
            return
        # Check digest format
        if not re.match(self.digest_regex(), digest):
            self.error(f"FIXITY_INVALID_DIGEST: {digest}")
            return
    # Check if all manifest files are accounted for? Or just that referenced files are in manifest?
    # The docstring says "only files listed in the manifest are referenced", so the check is that fixity's files are subset of manifest_files. So the above loop does that.
    # Also, maybe check that all manifest files are in fixity? But the docstring doesn't say that. It says "only files listed in the manifest are referenced", which implies that fixity can reference a subset, but not files outside the manifest. So the check is that all files in fixity are in manifest.
    # Then, maybe call check_digests_present_and_used?
    # The context mentions self.check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used)
    # So perhaps after collecting the digests, we need to check if they are present and used.
    # But the parameters for that method are manifest_files and digests_used. Wait, the method is called check_digests_present_and_used, which might check that the digests are present in the manifest and used correctly.
    # Maybe the code should call self.check_digests_present_and_used(manifest_files, digests)
    # But I'm not sure. The original code may have that step.

Wait, the user provided a list of methods in the context, including self.check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used). So perhaps after validating the structure and individual digests, we need to call this method.

So, putting it all together:

def validate_fixity(self, fixity, manifest_files):
    # Check structure
    if not isinstance(fixity, dict):
        self.error("FIXITY_NOT_DICT")
        return
    if 'digests' not in fixity:
        self.error("FIXITY_MISSING_DIGESTS")
        return
    digests = fixity['digests']
    if not isinstance(digests, dict):
        self.error("FIXITY_DIGESTS_NOT_DICT")
        return
    if 'algorithm' not in fixity:
        self.error("FIXITY_MISSING_ALGORITHM")
        return
    algorithm = fixity['algorithm']
    if algorithm not in self.digest_algorithm:
        self.error("FIXITY_UNSUPPORTED_ALGORITHM")
        return
    # Check each digest
    for file, digest in digests.items():
        if file not in manifest_files:
            self.error(f"FIXITY_FILE_NOT_IN_MANIFEST: {file}")
            return
        if not re.match(self.digest_regex(), digest):
            self.error(f"FIXITY_INVALID_DIGEST: {digest}")
            return
    # Check digests present and used
    self.check_digests_present_and_used(manifest_files, digests)
    # If all checks passed
    return

But wait, the check_digests_present_and_used might be doing additional checks, like ensuring that the digests are present in the manifest and that they are used correctly. However, the parameters for that method in the context are (self, manifest_files, digests_used). So perhaps the 'digests_used' is the digests from the fixity block. So in this case, passing digests (the dictionary of file to digest) as the second argument.

But I'm not sure. The exact implementation of check_digests_present_and_used is not given, but assuming that it does some validation, like ensuring that the digests are present in the manifest files, but maybe that's redundant with the earlier check. However, perhaps that method checks that the digest is present in the manifest's digest information.

Alternatively, maybe the check_digests_present_and_used is for ensuring that the digests are present in the manifest and that they are used in the correct way (like, each file has a digest, etc.).

In any case, the code should call that method after validating the structure and individual files and digests.

Also, the error codes are arbitrary, but the method should return self.error with some code. The exact codes are not specified, so I can use placeholder codes like "FIXITY_NOT_DICT", etc.

So, the code would include the structure checks, the file presence checks, digest format checks, and then call check_digests_present_and_used.

Another thing: the 'digest_regex' method is called as self.digest_regex(), which returns a regex pattern. The re.match is used with that pattern and the digest.

Putting all this together into code.
