Okay, I need to generate the Python function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function should do.

The function takes a URL and an optional document_path. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary with info like url and document_path. Looking at the context, there's a NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH variable and other generate functions. Maybe this function is part of creating a NodeInfo document, which is a well-known URL for web services.

The well-known document is usually accessed via /.well-known/nodeinfo, so maybe the document_path defaults to that. The function might need to generate the document using generate_nodeinfo2_document, which is mentioned in the context.

So, the steps could be: check if document_path is provided, else use the default. Then, create a dictionary with the url and document_path. Also, maybe generate the actual NodeInfo content and include it in the dictionary. But the docstring mentions including url and document_path, so perhaps the main task is to structure that info.

Wait, the function's purpose is to return a formatted dictionary with those keys. So the code would construct a dict with 'url' and 'document_path' keys. If document_path is None, use NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH. Also, maybe the function is part of a larger system where other functions like generate_nodeinfo2_document are used to create the actual content, but the current function just prepares the metadata.

So the code would be something like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = NODEINFO_DOCUMENT_PATH
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But wait, the context mentions imported packages like json, base64, etc. Maybe the function is supposed to generate the actual document content, not just the metadata. However, the docstring says it returns a dictionary with url and document_path. So maybe it's just returning the metadata, not the full document. The other functions like generate_nodeinfo2_document might handle the content generation.

So the code is straightforward: set the document_path to the default if not provided, then return the dict with the given url and document_path. That's probably all that's needed here.
