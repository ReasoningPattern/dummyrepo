Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function process_text_links based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it processes links in text by adding some attributes and linkifying textual links. 

First, I should figure out what "linkifying textual links" means. That probably means turning plain text URLs into actual HTML anchor tags. Also, adding attributes might involve adding things like target="_blank" or rel="nofollow" to the links.

The imported packages are typing, urllib, re, and bleach. Wait, urllib is for URL handling, re is for regular expressions, and bleach is for sanitizing HTML. So maybe the function uses bleach to linkify the text and then add attributes.

Bleach has a linkify function that can convert text URLs into links. But by default, it might not add attributes. So perhaps I need to use the callbacks feature of bleach to add attributes to the links. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to set attributes when using linkify.

Wait, looking at bleach's documentation, the linkify function can take a callback to modify the generated links. So the plan is: use bleach.linkify on the text, and then use a callback to add attributes like target="_blank" or others.

But first, I need to import the necessary modules. The user mentioned imported packages: typing, urllib, re, bleach. So I can use those.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Use re to find all URLs in the text. Wait, but maybe bleach's linkify does that. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to process existing links and add attributes, and also linkify any textual links that aren't already links.

Wait, the function's purpose is to process links in text, adding attributes and linkifying textual links. So maybe the text contains both existing links (like <a href="...">) and plain text URLs. The function needs to:

- For existing links, add some attributes (like target="_blank").
- For plain text URLs, convert them into links with those attributes.

So the approach would be:

- Use bleach.linkify to convert text URLs into links. But when doing that, use a callback to add attributes.
- Also, process existing <a> tags in the text to add attributes if they don't already have them.

But how to do that? Bleach's linkify function can be used with a callback to modify the generated links. However, for existing links, maybe we need to use bleach's clean function with a callback to modify the <a> tags.

Alternatively, maybe the function is only responsible for linkifying textual links and adding attributes to them, not modifying existing links. But the docstring says "process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links." So maybe existing links are modified to add attributes, and text URLs are converted into links with those attributes.

So the plan is:

1. Use bleach to linkify the text, converting text URLs into <a> tags with certain attributes.
2. Also, ensure that existing <a> tags have those attributes added if they don't already have them.

But how to do that with bleach? Bleach's linkify function can be used with a callback to modify the generated links. For existing links, maybe we need to use a different approach, like using a regex to find <a> tags and add attributes, but that could be error-prone. Alternatively, perhaps the function is only concerned with linkifying text URLs and not modifying existing links. But the docstring says "process links in text", which might imply both.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to add attributes to all links, whether they are existing or newly created. So, for example, if there's an existing <a href="...">, add target="_blank" if it's not present.

But how to do that with bleach? Bleach's clean function can take a callback to modify tags. So perhaps:

- First, use bleach.clean with a callback to add attributes to existing <a> tags.
- Then, use bleach.linkify with a callback to add attributes to the newly created links.

But the order might matter. Let me think. Suppose we first clean the text, adding attributes to existing links, then linkify the text, adding attributes to the new links. That could work.

So, the steps would be:

1. Clean the text with bleach, using a callback to add attributes to existing <a> tags.
2. Then, linkify the text, using a callback to add attributes to the new links.

But how to implement the callbacks?

For the clean step, the callback would check if the tag is 'a', and then add the desired attributes. For example, adding target="_blank" and rel="nofollow".

For the linkify step, the callback would modify the generated <a> tags to include those attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the linkify function can be configured to add those attributes by default. But I think the linkify function in bleach doesn't support adding attributes directly, so a callback is needed.

Let me check the bleach documentation. The linkify function can take a callback that is called with the URL and returns the HTML for the link. So, for example, the callback could generate the <a> tag with the desired attributes.

So, putting it all together:

def process_text_links(text):
    # Process existing <a> tags to add attributes
    def add_attributes_to_links(tag, name, value, **kwargs):
        if tag == 'a':
            # Add attributes if not present
            if 'target' not in value:
                value['target'] = '_blank'
            if 'rel' not in value:
                value['rel'] = 'nofollow'
        return value

    # Clean the text, modifying existing <a> tags
    cleaned_text = bleach.clean(text, tags=['a'], attributes={'a': ['href', 'target', 'rel']}, callbacks=[add_attributes_to_links])

    # Linkify the text, adding attributes to new links
    def linkify_callback(url, text):
        return f'<a href="{url}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{text}</a>'

    processed_text = bleach.linkify(cleaned_text, callbacks=[linkify_callback])

    return processed_text

Wait, but the bleach.clean function's callbacks are a bit different. The callback for clean is a function that takes the tag name, the attribute name, the value, and returns the value. Or maybe it's a function that modifies the attributes. I might need to check the exact signature.

Alternatively, maybe the callbacks for clean are used to modify the attributes of existing tags. For example, the callback could be a function that takes the tag name, the attribute name, the value, and returns the new value. So in the case of the 'a' tag, we can add the target and rel attributes if they are not present.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the attributes parameter in bleach.clean to specify allowed attributes, and then using a callback to add default attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps using the bleach.linkify function with a callback to generate the links with the desired attributes.

Another approach: use bleach.linkify with the autoescape=True and the callback to generate the links with attributes. Then, for existing links, use a regex to add the attributes if they don't have them.

But that might be complicated. Maybe the initial approach is better.

But given that the user provided the imported packages, including urllib, re, and bleach, perhaps the code should use those.

Another thing to consider: the function might need to parse URLs. For example, using urllib.parse to check if a URL is valid. But maybe that's not necessary here.

Putting all together, here's a possible code:

import re
import urllib.parse
import bleach
from typing import Any, Callable

def process_text_links(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    # Function to add attributes to existing <a> tags
    def add_attributes(attrs: dict, new_attr: str, new_value: str) -> dict:
        if 'target' not in attrs:
            attrs['target'] = '_blank'
        if 'rel' not in attrs:
            attrs['rel'] = 'nofollow'
        return attrs

    # Clean existing links, adding attributes
    cleaned = bleach.clean(
        text,
        tags=['a'],
        attributes={'a': ['href', 'target', 'rel']},
        callbacks=[add_attributes],
        strip=True
    )

    # Linkify text URLs, adding attributes
    def linkify_callback(url: str, text: str) -> str:
        return f'<a href="{url}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{text}</a>'

    processed = bleach.linkify(
        cleaned,
        callbacks=[linkify_callback],
        parse_email=False
    )

    return processed

Wait, but the add_attributes function in the bleach.clean callback might not be the right approach. The bleach.clean callbacks are functions that take the tag name, the attribute name, the value, and return the value. Or perhaps the callback is a function that modifies the attributes. I'm not entirely sure about the exact usage here.

Alternatively, maybe the callbacks for bleach.clean are used to modify the attributes of the tags. For example, the callback could be a function that takes the tag name, the attribute name, the value, and returns the new value. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the bleach.linkify function with a callback that generates the <a> tags with the desired attributes. For existing links, maybe they are left as-is, but the function is only responsible for linkifying text URLs. However, the docstring says "process links in text, adding some attributes", which might imply that existing links are also modified.

But given the uncertainty, perhaps the code should focus on linkifying text URLs and adding attributes to them, and not modify existing links. However, the docstring says "process links in text", which could include existing ones.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to add attributes to all links, whether they are existing or newly created. So, for example, if there's an existing <a href="...">, add target="_blank" and rel="nofollow" if they are not present.

In that case, using bleach's clean function with a callback that adds those attributes to existing <a> tags, and then using linkify to add them to new links.

But how to implement that.

Another approach: use bleach's clean function to allow <a> tags with href, target, and rel attributes. Then, use a callback to ensure that target and rel are added if missing. Then, use linkify to add those attributes to new links.

But I'm not sure about the exact implementation. Given time constraints, perhaps the code I wrote earlier is acceptable, even if there are some uncertainties about the bleach callbacks.

So, the final code would import the necessary modules, define the function with the given signature, and use bleach's clean and linkify functions with callbacks to add the attributes.
