Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _convert_non_cli_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function casts arguments to the correct types by modifying the values_dict. All values are strings by default. The parameters are parser_name and values_dict. 

Looking at the context provided, there are several other methods mentioned, like self.resolve_custom_types, self.validate_min_max_args, etc. But the specific method here is _convert_non_cli_args. Since the task is to generate code for this method, I need to figure out how to cast the arguments.

The function's purpose is to convert non-CLI arguments (probably those that are not passed via command line but maybe from other sources like config files or environment variables) into their correct data types. Since the values are initially strings, the method should iterate through the values_dict and convert each value based on some criteria.

But how to determine the correct type? The context mentions resolve_custom_types, which might be a method that handles custom types. Maybe this method uses that. Also, there's a mention of spec_defaults and validate_arg_sources, which might relate to the specifications of the arguments.

Wait, the function is part of a class that has a resolve_custom_types method. So perhaps in _convert_non_cli_args, we need to call resolve_custom_types on each value in values_dict. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the values_dict contains keys that correspond to argument names, and each argument has a specified type in the spec. The method would then check the spec for each argument's type and convert the string value accordingly.

But without knowing the exact structure of the spec_dict or how the types are determined, I need to make assumptions. Since the user provided the context, perhaps the resolve_custom_types method is responsible for converting the values. So the _convert_non_cli_args method might loop through the values_dict and apply resolve_custom_types to each value.

Wait, looking at the context, the method self.resolve_custom_types is present. So maybe in _convert_non_cli_args, we need to call resolve_custom_types for each value in values_dict. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to handle specific types, like integers, booleans, etc. For example, if a value is 'true', convert it to True, or if it's a number, convert to int or float.

But without more information, I need to make an educated guess. The function's name suggests that it's converting non-CLI arguments, which might be from answer files or environment variables. The resolve_custom_types method might be the one that does the actual conversion.

So perhaps the code would iterate through the values_dict, and for each key-value pair, apply resolve_custom_types to the value. But how is that method called? Maybe the resolve_custom_types method takes the parser_name and the value, or some other parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to check for certain types based on the parser name. For example, if the parser is 'main', certain conversions apply, while for 'virsh' others do.

But without more details, I need to create a generic implementation. Let me think of a possible approach:

Loop through each key in values_dict. For each value, check if it's a string and needs conversion. Then, based on some rules (maybe from the spec_dict or defaults), convert it to the appropriate type. For example, if the argument is expected to be an integer, convert the string to int.

But how to know what type each argument should be? Maybe the spec_dict (from the __init__ method) contains this information. However, the function parameters don't include the spec_dict. So perhaps the method has access to it via self.

Assuming that the class has a spec_dict attribute, which contains the specifications for each argument, including their types. Then, for each key in values_dict, we can look up the expected type in the spec_dict and convert the value accordingly.

But the function's parameters are parser_name and values_dict. The parser_name might correspond to a subcommand or a specific parser, which would have its own spec.

Alternatively, maybe the resolve_custom_types method is responsible for handling the conversion based on the spec. So in _convert_non_cli_args, we can call resolve_custom_types for each value in values_dict.

Wait, looking at the context, the method self.resolve_custom_types is present. The parameters for that method are not given, but perhaps it takes the value and the spec, or something similar.

Putting it all together, here's a possible implementation:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    for key, value in values_dict.items():
        # Assuming resolve_custom_types can handle the conversion
        converted_value = self.resolve_custom_types(value)
        values_dict[key] = converted_value

But this is a very simplistic approach. However, without knowing the exact logic of resolve_custom_types, this is a guess. Alternatively, maybe resolve_custom_types requires more parameters, like the parser name or the key.

Another possibility is that the method uses the parser_name to determine the spec, then for each argument in values_dict, it checks the spec for the type and converts accordingly.

But again, without knowing the structure of the spec_dict, it's hard to code. However, given the context, the method might be using resolve_custom_types which is part of the class.

Another angle: the function's name is _convert_non_cli_args, which suggests that these are arguments not coming from the CLI, perhaps from answer files or environment variables. The method might be converting them based on the same logic as CLI arguments, which is handled by resolve_custom_types.

So, the code could be looping through the values_dict and applying resolve_custom_types to each value. The resolve_custom_types method might be designed to take a string and convert it to the appropriate type based on the spec.

Therefore, the code would be as follows:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    for key in values_dict:
        values_dict[key] = self.resolve_custom_types(values_dict[key])

But I need to make sure that resolve_custom_types is called with the correct parameters. If resolve_custom_types requires more arguments, like the parser name or the key, then this code would be incorrect. However, given the information available, this is a plausible approach.

Another possibility is that resolve_custom_types is a method that takes the value and the spec for that argument. But since the spec might be stored in the class's spec_dict, perhaps the code would look up the spec for the key and pass it to resolve_custom_types.

But again, without knowing the exact parameters of resolve_custom_types, this is speculative. However, given the context, this is the best approach I can take.
