Okay, I need to write a Python function called replace_dots that takes two arguments, value and arg. The goal is to replace all the dots in the value string with the arg string. Let me think about how to approach this.

So, the function's docstring says it replaces all '.' with arg. So, for example, if value is "hello.world" and arg is "x", the result should be "helloxworld". Wait, no, wait. Wait, the function is supposed to replace all '.' with arg. So if value is "a.b.c" and arg is "X", then the output is "aXbXc". Right.

So the straightforward way is to use the string's replace method. Like, value.replace('.', arg). But wait, the replace method replaces all occurrences. So that's exactly what's needed here.

Wait, but what if arg contains a dot? Like, if arg is "a.b", then replacing each '.' in value with "a.b" would insert that string each time. But the problem statement says that the function is supposed to replace each '.' with the arg. So regardless of what arg is, each '.' in value is replaced by the entire arg string.

So the code should be as simple as returning value.replace('.', arg). But let me check the parameters. The function parameters are value and arg. So the code would be:

def replace_dots(value, arg):
    """
    Replaces all values of '.' to arg from the given string
    Args:
        value: old string
        arg: new string to replace '.'
    Returns:
        str, the replaced string
    """
    return value.replace('.', arg)

Wait, but what if value is not a string? The docstring says that value is a string, but maybe the function should handle cases where it's not? But according to the context, there are no imported packages, and the function is supposed to work with the given parameters. The docstring says value is a string, so we can assume that the input is a string. So the code is straightforward.

So the generated code is just using the replace method. That's all. No edge cases mentioned, so this should work.
