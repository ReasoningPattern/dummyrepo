Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the deep_merge_nodes function based on the given docstring and context. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function's purpose is to merge nodes, handling duplicate keys by combining their values. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one should remain. So, I need to handle both MappingNode and non-MappingNode cases.

First, I should check if the nodes are MappingNodes. If they are, I need to merge their contents recursively. For non-MappingNodes, if there's a collision, the last value takes precedence.

I remember that in ruamel.yaml, MappingNode represents a dictionary. So, I'll need to check the type of each node. The function should iterate through each node and merge them into a result.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Initialize a result dictionary.
2. Iterate over each node in the input list.
3. For each node, check if it's a MappingNode.
4. If it is, recursively merge its items into the result.
5. If it's not, check if the key already exists in the result. If it does, replace it with the current value (since the last one should remain).
6. Return the merged result.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, so the merging should be done recursively for nested structures. So, for each key in a MappingNode, we need to check if the existing value in the result is also a MappingNode. If so, we merge them recursively. Otherwise, we take the last value.

Let me think about the code structure. Using a loop over the nodes, and for each node, process its items. For each key-value pair in the node, if the key is already in the result, check if both the existing value and the new value are MappingNodes. If they are, merge them recursively. Otherwise, replace the existing value with the new one.

But wait, the function's parameter is 'nodes', which is a list of nodes. Each node could be a MappingNode or not. So, perhaps the function is supposed to merge all the nodes into a single structure, where each node contributes its key-value pairs. But how are the nodes structured? Are they individual nodes that might have their own keys?

Wait, maybe the nodes are a list of MappingNodes. For example, each node is a dictionary-like structure. So, the function needs to merge all these nodes into one, combining their keys. If two nodes have the same key, the value from the later node (in the list) is kept, unless both values are MappingNodes, in which case they are merged recursively.

So, the approach is to iterate through each node in the nodes list. For each node, iterate through its key-value pairs. For each key, if it's already in the result, check if both the existing value and the new value are MappingNodes. If yes, merge them recursively. Otherwise, replace the existing value with the new one.

But how to check if a node is a MappingNode? In ruamel.yaml, the nodes have a node_type attribute. So, perhaps checking if the node's node_type is ruamel.yaml.nodes.MappingNode.

Wait, the context mentions that the function is part of a codebase that includes ruamel. So, I can import ruamel.yaml.nodes and check the node_type.

So, the code would look something like:

from ruamel.yaml.nodes import MappingNode

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        if not isinstance(node, MappingNode):
            continue  # or handle non-MappingNodes as per the problem statement?
        # Wait, no. The nodes list might contain nodes that are not MappingNodes. But according to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, perhaps each node in the list is a MappingNode, but maybe not. Hmm, maybe the nodes are individual key-value pairs? Or perhaps each node is a MappingNode, and the function is merging multiple MappingNodes.

Wait, the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, and the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So, the nodes are probably a list of nodes (each being a MappingNode or not), and each node contributes key-value pairs. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each node is a MappingNode, and the function is merging all of them into a single MappingNode. But the function returns the merged result, which could be a dictionary or another structure.

This is a bit unclear. Let me think again.

The docstring says: "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains."

So, when there's a collision (same key in different nodes), if the values are non-MappingNodes, the last one is kept. If they are MappingNodes, they are merged recursively.

Therefore, the function is taking a list of nodes (each node is a key-value pair?), or perhaps each node is a MappingNode containing multiple key-value pairs. Wait, perhaps the nodes are individual key-value pairs, but that seems unlikely. More likely, each node is a MappingNode (like a dict) and the function merges them all into one.

So, the function is supposed to merge multiple MappingNodes into a single one, handling duplicates by merging if possible, or taking the last value otherwise.

So, the approach is:

Initialize an empty dict as the result.

For each node in the nodes list:

   For each key, value in the node's items:

      If the key is already in the result:

          If both the existing value and the new value are MappingNodes:

              Recursively merge them.

          Else:

              Replace the existing value with the new value (since it's the last one).

      Else:

          Add the key-value pair to the result.

But how to get the items from the node? If the node is a MappingNode, then in ruamel.yaml, you can access its items via node.items() or something similar. However, the exact method might depend on how the nodes are structured.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge them. But the problem mentions that nodes are of type MappingNode, which suggests that they are ruamel nodes.

But given that the code is using ruamel, perhaps the nodes are instances of ruamel.yaml.nodes.MappingNode, and their items can be accessed via node.value.items() or similar.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are the actual Python dictionaries, but that's unclear.

This is a bit ambiguous. However, given the context that the function is part of a codebase that includes functions like load_configuration and include_configuration, which likely deal with YAML parsing, the nodes are probably ruamel nodes.

Assuming that each node is a MappingNode, and that the function needs to merge them into a single MappingNode, but the return type is a Python dictionary or similar.

But the function returns the merged result. So, perhaps the function returns a Python dictionary, and the merging is done recursively.

So, the code would look like:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        if not isinstance(node, MappingNode):
            # Handle non-MappingNode? According to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. But if the node itself is not a MappingNode, how does it contribute key-value pairs?
            # Maybe each node is a key-value pair? Or perhaps the nodes are all MappingNodes, and this check is unnecessary. Maybe the function is only called with MappingNodes.
            # Given the ambiguity, perhaps proceed under the assumption that all nodes are MappingNodes.
            continue
        # Get the items from the node. For example, node.value is a dict-like object.
        # Assuming that node.value is a dict.
        for key, value in node.value.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(value, MappingNode):
                    # Recursively merge
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    # Take the last value
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but the nodes parameter is a list of nodes. So, for each node in the list, we process its key-value pairs. However, in the code above, the function is called recursively with [existing, value], which are both MappingNodes. But existing is a MappingNode, and value is a MappingNode. So, the function is called with a list of two MappingNodes, and the function processes them again, merging their key-value pairs.

But this approach may not be correct. Because in the initial call, nodes is a list of MappingNodes. For each node, we iterate through its key-value pairs and merge them into the result. However, if two nodes have the same key, and both are MappingNodes, then we need to merge their contents recursively.

But in the code above, when a key is found in the result, and both existing and new value are MappingNodes, we call deep_merge_nodes with a list containing existing and value. However, existing is a MappingNode, and value is a MappingNode. But the function expects a list of nodes. So, perhaps the function is designed to take a list of nodes (each being a MappingNode) and merge them into one.

But in the recursive call, existing and value are MappingNodes. So, the code would call deep_merge_nodes([existing, value]), which would process those two nodes. But in that case, the function would iterate through each node in the list (existing and value), and for each node, process their key-value pairs. However, existing and value are MappingNodes, so their .value is a dict-like structure. So, the code would merge the two nodes into a single dict.

But this approach may not be correct. Because the existing value is a MappingNode, and the new value is a MappingNode. The function is supposed to merge them, which would involve combining their key-value pairs. However, the code as written would take the list [existing, value], which are two MappingNodes, and merge them into a single dict. But that's not the same as merging the two MappingNodes into one. Because the existing and value are both MappingNodes, their key-value pairs would be merged, with the same logic as before.

This seems plausible.

But how to get the items from the node? Assuming that node.value is a dict-like object, which is the case in ruamel.yaml. For example, when you load a YAML document, the nodes' value is a dict for MappingNodes.

So, the code would need to access node.value.items().

But in the code above, the function is written to process each node in the nodes list, and for each node, iterate through its items. However, in the recursive call, the nodes are existing and value, which are MappingNodes. So, the code would process their items.

But the initial code has a problem: the function is called with a list of nodes, but in the recursive call, the code is passing a list of two MappingNodes. However, the function is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. So, perhaps the function should process all nodes in the list, not just the first one. Wait, the initial code for the function is:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        if not isinstance(node, MappingNode):
            continue
        for key, value in node.value.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(value, MappingNode):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But this code would process each node in the nodes list. For example, if nodes is a list of two MappingNodes, node1 and node2. For each node, it processes their items. Suppose both have the same key. The first node's key is added to result. Then, when processing the second node's key, it checks if existing is a MappingNode and value is a MappingNode, and merges them recursively.

But in this approach, the function is merging all nodes in the list, not just two. However, the code above would process each node in the list, and for each key in each node, merge into the result. But this approach may not be correct because the order of processing nodes matters. For example, if two nodes have the same key, the later node's value would overwrite the earlier one, unless both are MappingNodes and merged recursively.

But in the code above, when processing the first node, the key is added to the result. When processing the second node, the same key is found, and if both values are MappingNodes, they are merged recursively. Otherwise, the second value replaces the first.

This seems correct.

But the problem is that the nodes parameter is a list of nodes, and the function is supposed to merge them all. However, in the code above, the function is processing each node in the list, and for each node, processing its items. So, for example, if nodes is [node1, node2], then node1's items are processed, then node2's items are processed. For each key in node2, if it's already in result, it's handled as per the logic.

This approach should work.

But the code as written would not handle the case where a node is not a MappingNode. According to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, if a node is not a MappingNode, but contains key-value pairs (but how?), perhaps the code should handle that. However, if the node is not a MappingNode, then perhaps it's a scalar value, and the function is supposed to treat it as a single key-value pair? But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are individual key-value pairs, but that doesn't fit with the function's name. This is getting complicated.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is intended to merge a list of MappingNodes, and the code should proceed under that assumption.

Another point: the function returns the merged result. But in the code above, the result is a Python dictionary. However, the original nodes are MappingNodes. But the function's return type may not need to be a MappingNode; perhaps it's just a Python dict.

But the problem says to return the result, and the context includes functions that may use this merged result.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import ruamel.yaml.nodes

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        if not isinstance(node, ruamel.yaml.nodes.MappingNode):
            continue
        for key, value in node.value.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, ruamel.yaml.nodes.MappingNode) and isinstance(value, ruamel.yaml.nodes.MappingNode):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but the code is using node.value.items(). However, in ruamel.yaml, the value of a MappingNode is a dict-like object. So, for example, if you have a YAML mapping, the node.value would be a dict. So, node.value.items() would give the key-value pairs.

But what if the value is not a dict? Well, according to the code, if the node is a MappingNode, then its value should be a dict-like structure. So, this code should work.

But there's a problem: the function is called with a list of nodes, and in the recursive call, it's passing [existing, value], which are both MappingNodes. But existing is a MappingNode, and value is a MappingNode. However, in the code, when processing these nodes, the code would iterate through their items, which are the key-value pairs of the existing and value nodes.

This seems correct.

But in the initial code, the nodes are passed as a list, and the function processes each node in the list. However, when merging two MappingNodes (existing and value), the function is called with [existing, value], which are two nodes. The function would process each of these nodes, and merge their items into the result. So, the recursive call would merge the two MappingNodes into a single dict.

This approach should work.

But there's another edge case: if a node is not a MappingNode, but is part of the nodes list. According to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. However, if the node itself is not a MappingNode, how does it contribute to the key-value pairs? Perhaps the nodes are all MappingNodes, and the check for isinstance(node, MappingNode) is just to skip non-MappingNodes. But that may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are key-value pairs, and each node is a single key-value pair. But that doesn't align with the term 'MappingNode'.

This is getting a bit stuck. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code as outlined, assuming that all nodes are MappingNodes, and that the function is intended to merge them into a single dict, with the specified collision handling.
