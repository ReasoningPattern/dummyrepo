Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _include_groups method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do. The docstring says it resolves the include dict directive in the spec files. So, probably, the parser_dict contains some include directives that need to be processed.

Looking at the context provided, there are several methods mentioned like self.get_parser_option_specs, self._get_all_options_spec, and others. Maybe _include_groups is supposed to iterate over the parsers and include their options into the parser_dict. 

The method's name suggests that it's including groups, which might be groups of options from other parsers. So perhaps the parser_dict has an 'include' key that points to other parser specs. The code would need to process those includes, recursively or otherwise, and merge the options into the current parser_dict.

I should check if there's any existing code structure. Since the user mentioned imported packages like copy and infrared, maybe they are using deepcopy to avoid modifying the original structures. Also, the method might be part of a class that handles command-line option parsing, similar to argparse but custom.

So, the steps might be: iterate over each parser in the parser_dict, check if there's an 'include' directive, then for each included parser, get its options and merge them into the current parser_dict. But how exactly? Maybe using self._get_all_options_spec to collect all options from included parsers.

Wait, the context mentions self._get_all_options_spec(parser_dict). Maybe that method is responsible for gathering all options from the parser_dict and any included ones. So _include_groups could be calling that method to process the includes.

Alternatively, the _include_groups method might be responsible for expanding includes by looking up other parser specs and merging them. For example, if the current parser_dict has an 'include' key with a list of parser names, it would fetch each of those parsers' specs and merge them into the current parser_dict.

But without seeing the actual existing code, I have to make assumptions. Let's think of a possible implementation. The method could loop through the parser_dict's include directives, retrieve the corresponding specs, and then merge them into the parser_dict. Using deepcopy to prevent mutations of the original specs.

So, the code might look something like this:

def _include_groups(self, parser_dict):
    """
    Resolves the include dict directive in the spec files.
    """
    includes = parser_dict.get('include', [])
    for include in includes:
        included_parser = self.get_parser_option_specs(include)
        # Merge included_parser into parser_dict
        # Maybe using update or some custom merge logic
        parser_dict.update(included_parser)
    # Also, maybe process nested includes recursively?
    # But the method name suggests it's for groups, so perhaps not recursive.

Wait, but the method might be part of a larger process where includes are handled recursively. However, the docstring doesn't mention recursion. Alternatively, the _get_all_options_spec might handle that.

Another angle: the method might be part of a system where each parser can include other groups, so it's expanding those groups into the current parser's options. So, for each include in the parser_dict, it adds the options from that included group.

But how to implement this? The code would need to access the included specs. Maybe using self.get_parser_option_specs to get the specs for the included parser name. Then, merge those into the current parser_dict.

But the parameters for get_parser_option_specs are unclear. The context mentions self.get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name), so perhaps it's a method that retrieves the option specs for a given command name. So if the include is a command name, then get_parser_option_specs would return its options.

Putting it all together, the _include_groups method might be iterating over the includes in the parser_dict, getting each included parser's options, and merging them into the current parser_dict. Using deepcopy to avoid modifying the original included specs.

So, the code could be:

import copy

def _include_groups(self, parser_dict):
    """
    Resolves the include dict directive in the spec files.
    """
    includes = parser_dict.get('include', [])
    for include in includes:
        included = self.get_parser_option_specs(include)
        parser_dict.update(copy.deepcopy(included))

But wait, maybe the includes are not command names but something else. Or maybe the include is a reference to another parser_dict. Also, the method might need to handle nested includes, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, the method could be using self._get_all_options_spec, which might handle includes. But the context shows that _include_groups is called before _get_all_options_spec. So maybe _include_groups is responsible for expanding the includes first, and then _get_all_options_spec collects everything.

Another possibility is that the parser_dict has an 'include' key that points to other parser_dicts, and this method is merging them. For example:

def _include_groups(self, parser_dict):
    """
    Resolves the include dict directive in the spec files.
    """
    if 'include' in parser_dict:
        for include in parser_dict['include']:
            included_parser = self._get_all_options_spec(include)
            parser_dict.update(copy.deepcopy(included_parser))

But this is speculative. Given the limited information, I'll proceed with an implementation that assumes the parser_dict has an 'include' key with a list of parser names, and for each, retrieves their specs via get_parser_option_specs and merges them into the current parser_dict using deepcopy to avoid mutation issues.
