Okay, let me try to figure out how to generate the Python code for the pretty method based on the given function signature and docstring.

First, looking at the function definition: def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):. The docstring mentions returning a pretty formatted representation. The example code in the docstring shows some logic for obj, using f-strings and checking if self.obj is a string. Then it constructs a string with indent and the class name, along with debug_details and obj.

Wait, the docstring's example code has a line: obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj). So that's handling the obj variable. Then, the return statement is (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})".

But wait, where does debug_details come from? The parameters include debug=False, but the docstring's code uses debug_details. Maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps debug_details is a variable that's computed based on the debug flag. Maybe the original code intended to include debug information if debug is True.

Looking at the context provided: the class has attributes like self.sort_order, self.dual, self.FALSE, self.iscanonical, etc. Maybe debug_details is constructed by checking these attributes when debug is True.

So, the original code in the docstring might have a typo, and debug_details is supposed to be something like a string that includes debug information. For example, if debug is True, maybe it adds something like f", debug={debug}" or includes other attributes.

But the user's provided docstring has a line that says return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})". So the variable debug_details is used here. However, in the parameters, there's a debug flag. So maybe debug_details is a string that's built based on the debug flag. For example, if debug is True, it might include some debug information, otherwise, it's an empty string.

So, putting it all together, the code for the pretty method would need to:

1. Determine the obj string, handling strings specially.
2. Determine the debug_details string based on the debug parameter.
3. Combine these into the formatted string with the given indent.

But the original docstring's code seems incomplete. For example, the line return ... has debug_details which isn't defined. So perhaps the user intended that debug_details is constructed based on the debug flag. Maybe something like:

debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""

Or maybe including other attributes when debug is True. Since the class has attributes like sort_order, dual, etc., maybe when debug is True, those are included.

But without more context, it's a bit tricky. However, the user's provided code in the docstring seems to have a line that's incomplete. The original code in the docstring may have been a draft, and the actual code needs to be filled in.

Looking at the user's provided code in the docstring, the return line is:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But debug_details isn't defined. So perhaps the user intended that debug_details is a string that is built based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, maybe it adds something like ", debug=True" or includes other attributes.

Alternatively, maybe debug_details is a typo and should be debug. But that would not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the original code had a variable named debug_details that's computed.

Given that the user's code example in the docstring is incomplete, but the task is to generate code based on the function signature and the docstring, perhaps the correct approach is to reconstruct the code as per the docstring's example, even if there are missing parts.

Wait, the user's docstring has:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But the code in the docstring seems to be part of the function. So the code inside the pretty method would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ... # something here
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But the problem is that debug_details is not defined. So maybe the user intended that debug_details is a string that is constructed based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details could be something like ", debug=True", otherwise, it's an empty string.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is supposed to be a representation of the object's debug attributes. Since the class has attributes like sort_order, dual, iscanonical, etc., maybe when debug is True, those are included in the string.

But without more context, it's challenging. However, given that the user's docstring includes the line with debug_details, perhaps the code should include that variable, and the user expects that the code is filled in accordingly.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring's code seems to have a line that is incomplete. However, the user may have intended that the code is generated as per that example, even if it's missing parts.

Wait, the user's provided code in the docstring may have a typo. For example, maybe the line is supposed to be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But debug_details is not defined. However, perhaps the original code had a line that computed debug_details. For example:

debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""

But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the original code had a typo and the debug_details is supposed to be debug. But that would not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the code in the docstring is incomplete and the user expects that the code is filled in with the correct logic.

But given the information provided, perhaps the correct approach is to generate the code as per the docstring's example, assuming that debug_details is a variable that is computed based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then include some debug information, else not.

But since the user hasn't provided that part, perhaps the code should be generated with the assumption that debug_details is an empty string when debug is False, and some debug info when True.

But without knowing exactly what debug_details should be, it's hard to proceed. However, looking at the context provided, the class has attributes like sort_order, dual, iscanonical, etc. Maybe when debug is True, those attributes are included in the string.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code intended that debug_details is a string that includes the debug parameter's value. For example:

debug_details = f", debug={debug}"

But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the original code had a typo and the line is supposed to be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})"

But that would use the debug parameter directly, which is a boolean. That doesn't make sense in the string.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code had a variable named debug_details that is constructed based on the debug flag. For example:

debug_details = ""
if debug:
    debug_details = f", debug={debug}, sort_order={self.sort_order}, dual={self.dual}"

But again, this is speculative.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user expects that the code is filled in with the obj part, and the debug_details is left as a placeholder, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring and the line should be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

But that would ignore the debug parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a typo for debug, and the code should be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})"

But that would not make sense since debug is a boolean.

Alternatively, maybe the original code intended to have debug_details be a string that includes debug information, such as the class's attributes when debug is True.

But without more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the debug_details is a string that is empty when debug is False, and includes some debug info when True. For example:

debug_details = ""
if debug:
    debug_details = f", debug={debug}, sort_order={self.sort_order}, dual={self.dual}"

But since the user hasn't provided that part, perhaps the code should be generated with the obj part and the debug_details as a placeholder, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code in the docstring is incomplete, and the user expects that the code is generated with the obj part and the return line as given, even if debug_details is undefined. However, that would result in a NameError.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring's code seems to have a line that is incomplete. However, the user may have intended that the code is generated as per that, assuming that debug_details is defined elsewhere.

But given that the user provided the context that the class has attributes like self.sort_order, self.dual, etc., perhaps the debug_details is constructed using those attributes when debug is True.

So, putting it all together, here's a possible implementation:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ""
    if debug:
        debug_details = f", debug={debug}, sort_order={self.sort_order}, dual={self.dual}"
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But this is just a guess. However, given the information, this seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is simply ", debug=True" if debug is True, otherwise empty.

But again, without knowing the exact intention, it's hard to be certain. However, the user's docstring example shows that debug_details is used in the return statement, so the code must include that variable.

So, the final code would include the obj calculation, then compute debug_details based on the debug parameter, then construct the return string.
