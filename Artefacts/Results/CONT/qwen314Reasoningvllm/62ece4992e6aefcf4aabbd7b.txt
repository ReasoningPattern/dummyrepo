Okay, I need to write the Python function write_configuration based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what needs to be done.

First, the function takes config_filename, rendered_config, mode, and overwrite. The mode is 0o600 by default, which is octal for read and write by owner only. The overwrite parameter determines whether to overwrite an existing file or not.

The docstring says that if the file exists and overwrite is False, we should abort before writing. So I need to check if the file exists first. Using os.path.exists might be the way to go. But wait, maybe using os.path.isfile is better to check if it's a regular file?

Wait, the function says if the file already exists and overwrite is False, abort. So, if the file exists, and overwrite is False, return None without writing. Otherwise, proceed.

So steps:

1. Check if the file exists.
2. If it exists and overwrite is False, return None.
3. Else, write the rendered_config to the file with the given mode.

But how to handle the writing? Open the file in write mode. But what about the mode parameter? The mode here is the file permissions. So when opening the file, we need to set the mode. However, in Python, the open function's mode parameter is a string like 'w', and the os module's functions might be needed for setting permissions.

Wait, the mode parameter in the function is 0o600, which is a permission mask. So after creating the file, we need to set its permissions using os.chmod. But when opening the file, the mode is handled by the open function. However, the open function's mode (like 'w') determines whether it's read, write, etc. But the file permissions are set separately.

So the steps would be:

- Check if the file exists. If it does and overwrite is False, return.
- Else, open the file in write mode ('w'), then write the rendered_config (which is a YAML, probably a string) to it.
- Then, set the file's permissions using os.chmod with the given mode.

Wait, but when you open a file in 'w' mode, it truncates the file if it exists. But if overwrite is True, that's okay. But if overwrite is False, we would have already checked and returned. So perhaps the check is correct.

But wait, the function's parameters include 'mode' which is the permission. So after writing, we need to set the file's permissions. However, when you create a file via open, the permissions are set based on the umask. So maybe using os.open would be better to set the permissions directly. Alternatively, open the file, then use os.chmod.

But for simplicity, perhaps open the file in 'w' mode, then use os.chmod to set the permissions. However, the mode parameter in the function is 0o600, which is the desired permission. So after creating the file, we need to set its permissions to that.

But what about when the file is opened? For example, when you open a file in 'w' mode, the permissions might be set to 0o666 (or similar) minus the umask. But using os.chmod after creating the file would override that.

So the steps in code:

Check if the file exists. If exists and not overwrite, return.

Else, open the file in 'w' mode, write the rendered_config (assuming it's a string), then close it. Then set the permissions using os.chmod.

But how to handle the writing? Maybe using with open(...) as f: to ensure it's closed properly.

Wait, but the rendered_config is a YAML, which is probably a string. So writing it as is.

So code outline:

import os

def write_configuration(...):
    if os.path.exists(config_filename) and not overwrite:
        return
    with open(config_filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(rendered_config)
    os.chmod(config_filename, mode)

Wait, but what about the mode parameter? The function's mode is 0o600 by default. So yes, that's passed to os.chmod.

But wait, when you open the file with 'w' mode, the initial permissions might be different. For example, on Unix systems, the open() function's mode is ignored if you're using the standard open() function, and the permissions are determined by the umask. So using os.chmod after creating the file is necessary to set the correct permissions.

But what if the file is opened with 'w' and then chmod is called? That should work.

But what about if the file already exists and we are overwriting it? The check is done before, so if overwrite is True, we proceed to write, which will truncate the file, and then set the permissions.

But what about the case where the file exists, but overwrite is True? Then we proceed to write, which is correct.

Another thing: the function says "if the file does not exist, create it." So the code handles that by opening in 'w' mode, which creates the file if it doesn't exist.

So the code seems correct.

But wait, what about the mode parameter in the open function? The 'w' mode is for writing, which is correct. The permissions are handled by os.chmod.

So the code would be:

import os

def write_configuration(config_filename, rendered_config, mode=0o600, overwrite=False):
    if os.path.exists(config_filename) and not overwrite:
        return
    with open(config_filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write(rendered_config)
    os.chmod(config_filename, mode)

But wait, what if the file is a directory? The os.path.exists would return True, but trying to open it as a file would fail. However, the function's docstring says "if the file does not exist, create it." So perhaps the function assumes that config_filename is a regular file. But the code as written would fail if the path exists as a directory. However, the problem statement doesn't mention handling that case. The context says that the imported package is os, and within the file, but no other code. So perhaps the function is intended to work with files, and the caller is responsible for ensuring that the path is a regular file. So the code as written is acceptable.

Another thing: the function returns None, which is handled by the return statement when the file exists and overwrite is False. Otherwise, after writing, it returns None as well. So the function returns None in all cases, which matches the docstring.

So this code should meet the requirements.
