Okay, I need to generate Python code for the cachedmethod function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it returns a decorator that can call a result from the cache. So, this is likely a decorator factory that creates a method decorator using a cache.

First, the parameters: cache is probably the cache object, key is a function to generate the key (defaulting to hashkey, which I assume is a function from somewhere, maybe from functools?), and lock is an optional lock for thread safety.

The decorator should be used on methods, so the function returned by cachedmethod should be a decorator that can wrap a method. The decorated method would check the cache using the key function. If the result is present, return it; otherwise, compute it and store it in the cache.

Wait, but how does the cache work? Maybe the cache is something like a dictionary. The key function would take the instance and the arguments, maybe, to generate a unique key for the cache.

So the steps are: create a decorator that, when applied to a method, will use the cache. The decorator might need to handle instance methods, so the key function might need to include the instance's identity.

Wait, the default key is hashkey. I remember that in some contexts, like in the functools module, there's a function called hashkey that creates a hashable key from arguments. But maybe here, the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the method's arguments and the instance.

So the decorator would look like this: when the method is called, it generates a key using the key function (probably passing the instance and the arguments), then checks the cache. If present, returns the cached value; else, computes the method's result, stores it in the cache, and returns it.

But since it's a method decorator, the function being decorated is a method of a class. So the decorator needs to handle the instance (self) and the arguments.

So the structure would be something like:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            # generate key using key function, maybe with self, args, kwargs
            # check cache, if present return
            # else compute, store in cache, return
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the key function's default is hashkey. So maybe the key function is supposed to take the instance, args, and kwargs. But how is hashkey defined? Maybe it's from somewhere else, like functools. But the user hasn't imported it, so perhaps the code expects that hashkey is available, maybe from the functools module. However, the user's context says that within the file, there are no imports. So maybe the code should include importing hashkey? But the user hasn't mentioned that. Hmm, but the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, not to include explanations. So perhaps the code will use hashkey as a default, assuming it's available.

Another thing: the lock parameter. If lock is provided, perhaps the code should use it to synchronize access to the cache. So, when accessing the cache, acquire the lock, check the key, and release it. But how to handle that? Maybe using a with statement if lock is present.

Putting it all together:

The decorator function would generate a key using the key function, which by default is hashkey. The key function might take the instance, args, and kwargs. Then, the wrapper function would check the cache for that key. If found, return the value. If not, compute the result by calling the original function, store it in the cache, and return it.

But how to handle the key function? The key is passed as a parameter to cachedmethod. So the key function would be called with the instance, args, and kwargs. For example, key(self, *args, **kwargs).

Wait, the default key is hashkey. Let's assume that hashkey is a function that takes the instance, args, and kwargs and returns a hashable key. So in the code, when generating the key, we call key(self, *args, **kwargs).

So inside the wrapper:

def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
    k = key(self, *args, **kwargs)
    if lock is not None:
        with lock:
            if k in cache:
                return cache[k]
            else:
                result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
    else:
        if k in cache:
            return cache[k]
        else:
            result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
            cache[k] = result
            return result

Wait, but that's not quite right. Because if there's a lock, we need to acquire it before checking the cache and storing. Otherwise, multiple threads might check the cache at the same time and compute the same result multiple times. So the lock ensures that only one thread can check and update the cache at a time.

But the code above would check the cache under the lock. However, in the case where the key is not present, the code would compute the result, store it, and return. But in a multi-threaded environment, even with the lock, this is safe.

But the code as written would have a problem: if two threads check the cache at the same time, and the key is not present, the first thread would compute the result, store it, and return. The second thread would then see the key is present and return the cached value. So the lock is necessary to prevent race conditions.

So the code for the wrapper would be:

def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
    k = key(self, *args, **kwargs)
    if lock is not None:
        with lock:
            if k in cache:
                return cache[k]
            result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
            cache[k] = result
            return result
    else:
        if k in cache:
            return cache[k]
        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
        cache[k] = result
        return result

Wait, but in the case of the lock, the code checks if the key is in the cache, and if not, computes the result. But what if another thread added the key to the cache between the check and the computation? Well, with the lock, that can't happen. Because the lock is held during the entire process. So the code is safe.

But in the code above, the 'with lock' block is entered, then check if the key is present. If not, compute the result, store it, and return. So that's correct.

But the code as written would have the same logic for both cases (with and without lock). So perhaps the code can be refactored to avoid duplication.

But for the purpose of writing the code, perhaps the code can be written as:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            k = key(self, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if k in cache:
                        return cache[k]
                    result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the key function's default is hashkey. However, in Python, if the user doesn't provide a key function, then the default is hashkey. But where is hashkey defined? The user hasn't imported it. So perhaps the code expects that hashkey is available, maybe from functools. But the user hasn't mentioned importing anything. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code should just use hashkey as the default, assuming it's available.

Another thing: the key function may need to be called with the instance, args, and kwargs. So the key function should accept those parameters. For example, if the default is hashkey, which is a function that takes *args and **kwargs and returns a hashable key. But how is that used here?

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to be a function that generates a key based on the method's arguments. For example, the default key function could be something like functools.partial(functools.hashkey, ...), but that's unclear.

But given the problem statement, the code should be written as per the function signature and docstring. So the code will have the key parameter with default hashkey, and the code uses it as key(self, *args, **kwargs).

Another possible issue: the cache is passed in, but what type is it? It's expected to be a dictionary-like object that supports __contains__ and assignment. So the code assumes that cache is a mutable mapping.

Putting all this together, the code would look like the above.

But wait, the code uses 'key' as a parameter. So the default is hashkey. So in the code, when the key is called, it's passed self, *args, **kwargs. So the key function is expected to generate a key based on the instance and the arguments.

So the generated code would be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            k = key(self, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if k in cache:
                        return cache[k]
                    result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. For example, the 'key' function's default is hashkey. But if hashkey is not defined, this would raise a NameError. However, the problem says that the user has provided the context of imported packages, but in the context, it's stated that within the file, there are no imports. So perhaps the code is supposed to assume that hashkey is available, maybe from functools. But the user hasn't imported it. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, not to include explanations. So the code would proceed as written.

Another thing: the lock is used as a context manager. So lock must be an object that supports the 'with' statement, like a threading.Lock.

So the code seems correct. Now, the problem says to output only the code in Python markdown format. So the final code would be:

```python
def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            k = key(self, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if k in cache:
                        return cache[k]
                    result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

But wait, the original function signature has the parameters as (cache, key=hashkey, lock=None). So the code uses key=hashkey as the default. But if hashkey is not defined, this would cause an error. However, the user's context says that within the file, there are no imports. So perhaps the code is supposed to have an import statement for hashkey. But the problem says not to include any explanation, and the user hasn't mentioned importing anything. So maybe the code is correct as is, assuming that hashkey is available in the scope.

Alternatively, maybe the hashkey is a function from functools, and the code should import it. But the user's context says that within the file, there are no imports. So perhaps the code is written without importing, and the user is expected to have hashkey available. So the code proceeds as written.
