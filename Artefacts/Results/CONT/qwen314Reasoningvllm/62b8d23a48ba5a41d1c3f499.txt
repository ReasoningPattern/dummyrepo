Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The context mentions that the class is related to a cache, possibly using the collections module. The method is supposed to remove and return the least recently used (LRU) key-value pair.

First, I remember that in an LRU cache, the least recently used item is typically the one that hasn't been accessed for the longest time. The popitem method in such a structure would need to identify that item. 

Looking at the context, there's a self.__order attribute, which might be a data structure keeping track of the order of usage. Maybe it's a deque or a linked list. Also, there's a self.pop method, which could be used to remove items. 

The __order might store the keys in the order they were accessed. So, the first element in __order would be the LRU item. When popitem is called, we need to remove that first element. But wait, in some implementations, the order is maintained such that the most recently used is at the end. So, popping from the front would give the LRU.

But how to handle the actual removal from the cache? The class might have a dictionary to store the items. So, the steps would be:

1. Check if __order is not empty.
2. Get the first key from __order (the LRU key).
3. Remove that key from the cache's dictionary.
4. Remove the key from __order.
5. Return the (key, value) pair.

But wait, the __order might be a deque. So, using popleft() would get the LRU key. Then, we need to delete that key from the cache's data structure. Also, the method should return the key and value.

Wait, the docstring says "Remove and return the (key, value) pair least recently used." So, the method needs to return that pair. 

Assuming that the cache's data is stored in a dictionary, say self.cache, then:

key = self.__order.popleft()
value = self.cache.pop(key)
return (key, value)

But need to make sure that __order is a deque and that the cache is properly maintained. Also, if the cache is empty, maybe raise a KeyError? But the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe it's assumed that the cache isn't empty when popitem is called.

Looking at the context, there's a self.popitem(self) method, which suggests that the current method is part of a class that manages a cache. The __order is probably a deque that keeps track of the access order. So, the code would involve popping from the left of __order and then removing the corresponding key from the cache.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
    """
    key = self.__order.popleft()
    value = self.cache.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But wait, the context mentions that the class has a __init__ that includes maxsize and getsizeof. Also, there's a __update method. However, the exact structure of the class isn't given. But based on the standard LRU cache implementation, this seems plausible.

Another thing to consider: if the __order is a deque, then popleft() is O(1). Also, the cache is probably a dictionary. So the code should work. However, the actual implementation might vary. But given the context and the standard approach, this seems correct.
