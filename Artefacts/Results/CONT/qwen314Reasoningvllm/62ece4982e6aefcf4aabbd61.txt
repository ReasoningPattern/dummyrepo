Okay, I need to write a Python function called _dictsum that takes a list of dictionaries and sums the values for the same keys. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's parameter is 'dicts', which I assume is a list of dictionaries. The goal is to combine all these dictionaries by adding their values for matching keys. If a key exists in multiple dictionaries, their values are summed. If a key is only in one dictionary, it's included as is.

So, how do I do that? Maybe start with an empty dictionary to accumulate the sums. Then, iterate over each dictionary in the input list. For each dictionary, iterate through its items. For each key-value pair, add the value to the corresponding key in the accumulator dictionary. If the key isn't present yet, initialize it with the value.

Wait, but what if there are multiple dictionaries with the same key? Like, if dict1 has 'a':1 and dict2 has 'a':5, then the sum should be 6. So the accumulator starts as empty. For each dict in dicts, loop through each key. For each key, add its value to the accumulator's key. If the key isn't in the accumulator, set it to the value. Otherwise, add to it.

So the steps are:

Initialize a result dictionary as empty.

For each dictionary in dicts:
    For each key, value in the dictionary.items():
        If key is in result:
            result[key] += value
        Else:
            result[key] = value

Then return the result.

But wait, what if the input is not a list of dictionaries? Well, the function's responsibility is to handle the input as per the given signature. The docstring example shows two dictionaries, but the function's parameter is 'dicts', which suggests it's a list of dictionaries. So the code should assume that.

Testing the example: dict1 {'a':1, 'b':2}, dict2 {'a':5, 'b':0}. The sum would be {'a':6, 'b':2}.

So the code would process each dict in the list. Let's say dicts is [dict1, dict2]. Then, processing dict1 first: result becomes {'a':1, 'b':2}. Then processing dict2: 'a' is already there, so 1+5=6. 'b' is 2+0=2. So the result is correct.

What about if there are more than two dictionaries? Like three dicts with same keys. The code should sum all of them.

Now, implement this in Python.

So the code would be:

def _dictsum(dicts):
    result = {}
    for d in dicts:
        for k, v in d.items():
            if k in result:
                result[k] += v
            else:
                result[k] = v
    return result

Wait, but what if the dictionaries have different keys? Like one has 'a' and another has 'c'. Then all keys are included.

Yes, that's correct. The code handles that.

I think that's the correct approach. Let me check the example. The sample input would be [ {'a':1, 'b':2}, {'a':5, 'b':0} ] and the output is {'a':6, 'b':2}, which matches.

So the code should work. Now, write that in Python.
