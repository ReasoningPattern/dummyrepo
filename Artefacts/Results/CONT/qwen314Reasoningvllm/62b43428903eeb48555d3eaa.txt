Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the formatmany method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me look at the parameters and return type. The method takes 'sql' which is an AnyStr, and 'many_params' which is an iterable of either dicts or sequences. The return is a tuple of AnyStr and a list of either dicts or sequences.

The docstring says it converts sql using self._converter.convert_many. So the main task is to call this converter method. But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. Also, the method is part of a class that has various attributes like _converter, _in_regex, etc. 

Looking at the context, there's a mention of self._create_converter, self.format, self.formatmany, and others. The _converter is probably an object that has a convert_many method. The parameters for convert_many might require the SQL and the many_params. 

Wait, the function's return type includes the same sql as the first element of the tuple. So maybe the converter doesn't modify the SQL, just processes the parameters. Or perhaps the SQL is modified based on the parameters. But according to the docstring, it's converting the SQL using the converter's convert_many method. 

So the code inside formatmany would likely be something like: return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params). But wait, the return type is a tuple of the sql and the converted parameters. Wait, the return is Tuple[AnyStr, ...], so maybe the first element is the modified SQL and the second is the processed parameters. But the docstring says "convert sql using self._converter.convert_many", which might imply that the SQL is transformed, and the parameters are processed. 

Alternatively, maybe the convert_many method returns both the modified SQL and the parameters. But the function signature shows that formatmany returns a tuple where the first element is the same sql (AnyStr) and the second is the list of params. Wait, the return type is Tuple[AnyStr, ...], so the first element is the sql, and the second is the processed many_params. 

Wait, the original function's return is a tuple where the first element is AnyStr (probably the same sql) and the second is a list of dicts or sequences. So maybe the converter's convert_many method is processing the parameters and returning them, while the SQL remains the same. Or perhaps the SQL is being formatted with placeholders, and the parameters are being expanded. 

But given the context, there's also self.expand_tuples and self._expand_tuples. Maybe the converter is responsible for expanding tuples in the parameters. However, the exact implementation of _converter is not provided, so I have to assume that convert_many takes sql and many_params and returns the processed parameters. 

Wait, the return type of formatmany is a tuple of the sql and the processed parameters. So the code would be something like:

return (sql, self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params))

But I need to check the parameters. The convert_many method's parameters might be different. However, since the user hasn't provided the details of _converter, I have to rely on the function signature. 

Alternatively, maybe the convert_many method returns the modified SQL and the parameters. But the function's return type shows that the first element is the same sql. So perhaps the SQL isn't modified, and the parameters are processed. 

In any case, the code should call self._converter.convert_many with the given sql and many_params, and return a tuple with the sql and the result. 

So the code would be:

def formatmany(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:
		"""
		Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many
		"""
		return (sql, self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params))

But I need to make sure that the types match. The return type is a tuple where the first element is AnyStr (same as input sql), and the second is a list of either dicts or sequences. The convert_many method should return that list. 

I think that's the correct approach. So the code is as above.
