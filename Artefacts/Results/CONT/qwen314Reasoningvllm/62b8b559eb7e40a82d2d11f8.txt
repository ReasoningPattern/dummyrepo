Okay, I need to write a Python function called minimalBases that takes a list of classes and returns those that don't have any subclasses. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's goal is to find all classes in the input list that are not subclasses of any other class in the same list. Wait, no, the docstring says "without subclasses", so it's the classes that don't have any subclasses in the list. Wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the docstring says "Returns all classes without subclasses as a list." So, the classes that do not have any subclasses. So, for each class in the input, check if there are any other classes in the input that are subclasses of it. If not, include it in the result.

But how to check if a class has a subclass in the list. Let's think. For each class in the list, we need to check if any other class in the list is a subclass of it. If none are, then it's a minimal base.

So the steps would be:

1. Iterate over each class in the input list.
2. For each class, check if there exists another class in the list that is a subclass of it.
3. If no such subclass exists, include the class in the result list.

But how to check if a class is a subclass of another. In Python, we can use issubclass(). But we have to be careful with the order. For example, if class A is a subclass of class B, then issubclass(A, B) returns True. So for each class C in the list, we need to check if there's any class D in the list (other than C itself?) where issubclass(D, C) is True. Wait, no. Wait, if D is a subclass of C, then C is a base class of D. So, if we want to find classes that have subclasses in the list, then for a given class C, if any D in the list is a subclass of C, then C is not a minimal base. So, the minimal bases are those classes that are not a base class of any other class in the list.

So the algorithm would be:

result = []
for class in classes:
    has_subclass = False
    for other_class in classes:
        if class != other_class and issubclass(other_class, class):
            has_subclass = True
            break
    if not has_subclass:
        result.append(class)
return result

But wait, what about multiple inheritance? Well, issubclass checks if the other_class is a subclass of class, considering all inheritance paths. So that should handle that.

But what about the case where a class is in the list, and another class in the list is a subclass of it. For example, if classes = [A, B], and B is a subclass of A. Then A would have a subclass (B) in the list, so A is not included in the result. B would be checked: are there any classes in the list that are subclasses of B? Since there's only A and B, and A is not a subclass of B (unless B is a subclass of A, which it is, but in that case, B is a subclass of A, so when checking B, we look for classes that are subclasses of B. So if there's no other class in the list that is a subclass of B, then B would be included. So in the example, A would not be in the result, B would be in the result.

But what if the list contains multiple classes, some of which are in a hierarchy. For example, classes = [A, B, C], where B is a subclass of A, and C is a subclass of B. Then, A has B as a subclass, so A is not minimal. B has C as a subclass, so B is not minimal. C has no subclasses, so it is included. So the result would be [C].

But what about if a class is a subclass of another class not in the list? For example, if there's a class D that is a subclass of A, but D is not in the list. Then, since D is not in the list, the check for A's subclasses only considers the classes in the list. So A would be considered as having no subclasses in the list, so it would be included in the result. That's correct because the function is only considering the classes provided in the input list.

So the code seems correct.

Now, implement this in Python. The function is called minimalBases, takes a list of classes. So the code would be:

def minimalBases(classes):
    result = []
    for cls in classes:
        has_subclass = False
        for other in classes:
            if cls is other:
                continue
            if issubclass(other, cls):
                has_subclass = True
                break
        if not has_subclass:
            result.append(cls)
    return result

Wait, but what about when a class is a subclass of itself? Well, issubclass(cls, cls) returns True. But in the code above, when checking other in classes, if cls is other, we skip. So for example, when checking if cls has any subclasses, we skip comparing against itself. So, for a class that is not a base class of any other class in the list, it will be included.

But what if a class is in the list, and another class in the list is a subclass of it. For example, if classes = [A, B], and B is a subclass of A. Then, when checking A, we look for other classes (B) and check if issubclass(B, A) which is True. So A is not added. B is checked: are there any other classes in the list that are subclasses of B? Only A, but issubclass(A, B) is False. So B is added. So the result is [B], which is correct.

Another example: classes = [A, B, C], where B is a subclass of A, and C is a subclass of A. Then, A has subclasses B and C, so A is not included. B and C are checked. For B, are there any classes in the list that are subclasses of B? Only C if C is a subclass of B. But if C is a subclass of A, not of B, then no. So B would be included. Similarly for C. So the result would be [B, C], assuming they are not subclasses of each other.

But if B and C are both subclasses of A, and not of each other, then they are both minimal bases.

So the code seems to handle that.

But what about when a class is a subclass of multiple classes in the list? For example, if D is a subclass of both A and B, which are in the list. Then, both A and B would have D as a subclass, so they are not included in the result. But D would be checked: are there any classes in the list that are subclasses of D? If not, then D is included.

So the code seems correct.

Now, implement that. Also, note that the code uses 'cls' as the loop variable, which is a common convention. Also, the code uses 'issubclass' from the built-in functions, so no need to import anything. The code should work as long as the classes are properly defined.

Potential edge cases: empty list, single class, classes that are not in a hierarchy.

If classes is empty, returns empty list. If classes has one class, then it's added to the result, since there are no other classes to be its subclass.

So the code should handle that.

Therefore, the generated code should be as written above.
