Okay, let's see. I need to write the identify_request function based on the given docstring. The function takes a request of type RequestType. The goal is to check if the request body, when loaded as JSON, contains events. If yes, return True. Otherwise, check if the XML from the request body has the tag Magic_ENV_TAG. If that's true, return True. Else, return False.

First, I need to figure out how to access the request body. Assuming that the request object has a body attribute, maybe as a string or bytes. But the problem says "loaded using JSON" and "XML loaded from the request body". So perhaps the request.body is a string that can be parsed as JSON or XML.

So step one: try to parse the request body as JSON. If that's successful, check if it has 'events' key. If yes, return True.

If JSON parsing fails, then try to parse it as XML. Check if the root tag is MAGIC_ENV_TAG. If yes, return True. Else, return False.

But how to handle exceptions? For example, if the JSON is invalid, we should catch that exception and proceed to check XML. Similarly, if XML parsing fails, maybe we just return False.

So the steps in code:

1. Try to parse the request body as JSON.
   - Use json.loads on request.body.
   - If successful, check if 'events' is present. Return True if yes.
   - If JSON parsing fails (like ValueError), catch it and proceed.

2. If JSON parsing failed, try to parse as XML.
   - Use lxml's etree.fromstring, perhaps. But need to make sure the body is a string. Also, maybe the XML is in a specific format. The tag needs to be checked.

Wait, the docstring says "the tag of the XML loaded from the request body is Magic_ENV_TAG". So the root element's tag should be MAGIC_ENV_TAG.

So, for XML parsing:

- Parse the request.body as XML. If parsing fails (like invalid XML), then return False.
- Once parsed, check the root element's tag. If it matches MAGIC_ENV_TAG, return True. Else, return False.

But how to handle cases where the body is neither valid JSON nor valid XML? Well, according to the docstring, if neither condition is met, return False.

So code outline:

def identify_request(request: RequestType):
    try:
        # Try JSON
        json_data = json.loads(request.body)
        if 'events' in json_data:
            return True
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        # Not valid JSON, try XML
        pass

    try:
        # Try XML
        xml_root = etree.fromstring(request.body.encode('utf-8'))
        if xml_root.tag == MAGIC_ENV_TAG:
            return True
    except (etree.XMLSyntaxError, UnicodeEncodeError):
        # Invalid XML, return False
        pass

    return False

Wait, but what about the encoding? The request.body might be a string, so encoding to bytes with utf-8. Also, need to import etree from lxml.

But the user mentioned that the imported packages include lxml. So assuming that etree is available.

But in the code, need to make sure that the XML is parsed correctly. Also, handling exceptions for both JSON and XML parsing.

Also, what if the request.body is not a string? Like, maybe it's bytes. But the problem says "loaded using JSON" and "XML loaded from the request body", so perhaps the body is a string. But maybe need to handle that. However, the function's parameters are given as RequestType, which is probably a type that has a body attribute. Assuming that request.body is a string.

Another thing: the function is part of a class? The context says "Within class: " but no details. But the function is written as a standalone function, not a method. So maybe the code is in a module, not a class.

Also, the logger is mentioned in the context, but the function doesn't use it. The docstring doesn't mention logging, so maybe no need to add that.

So the code would need to import json and lxml.etree. But the user says that the imported packages include lxml, json, etc. So the code can assume those are available.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

import json
from lxml import etree

def identify_request(request: RequestType):
    """
    Check whether the request body loaded using JSON contains events. If yes, True is returned, otherwise, check whether the tag of the XML loaded from the request body is Magic_ENV_TAG, if yes, return True. If neither of the preceding conditions is met, return False.
    """
    try:
        json_data = json.loads(request.body)
        if 'events' in json_data:
            return True
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        pass

    try:
        xml_root = etree.fromstring(request.body.encode('utf-8'))
        if xml_root.tag == MAGIC_ENV_TAG:
            return True
    except etree.XMLSyntaxError:
        pass

    return False

Wait, but what about the case where the request.body is not a string? For example, if it's bytes, then encode would fail. But the problem says that the request body is loaded as JSON or XML, so perhaps the body is a string. Alternatively, maybe the request.body is bytes, and we need to decode it first. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the code as written assumes that request.body is a string. If it's not, then the code may raise an error. But given the problem statement, this is the best approach.

Also, the exception handling for JSON: json.loads can raise ValueError (if the string is not valid JSON) or TypeError if the input is not a string (like if it's bytes). So catching those exceptions.

For XML parsing, etree.fromstring expects bytes, so encoding the string to bytes. If the body is not a string, this would fail. But again, assuming that the request.body is a string.

So the code should handle those cases.
