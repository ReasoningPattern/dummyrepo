Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_valid and takes an identifier as an argument. The docstring says that in the base implementation, it should always return True. 

So the user wants me to write the code that just returns True. The function is part of a class, but the context doesn't mention any specific class details. The imported packages are not listed here, but since the function is simple, maybe no imports are needed.

Wait, the user said not to include any explanation, just the code. But I need to make sure the code is correct. The function is a method of a class because it has 'self' as the first parameter. The base implementation always returns True, so the code should be straightforward.

So the code would be:

def is_valid(self, identifier):
    """
    Return True if identifier is valid. In this base implementation, always return True.  (D)
    """
    return True

That's all. No other logic is needed. The user didn't mention any specific conditions or validations, so just return True as per the docstring.
