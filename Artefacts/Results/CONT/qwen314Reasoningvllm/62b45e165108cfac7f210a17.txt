Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_logical_path_map based on the given signature and docstring. The function takes an inventory and a version and returns a dictionary of file paths for the states in the inventory.

First, I should figure out what the inventory structure looks like. Since the function is supposed to return file paths, maybe the inventory is a list or a dictionary containing state information. The version parameter might be used to filter or select specific states based on their version.

The docstring says it returns the file paths in a dict. So perhaps each state has a 'path' attribute or a key that holds the file path. The function needs to iterate over the inventory items, check their version, and collect the paths.

Wait, the parameters are inventory and version. So maybe the inventory is a list of objects, each with a version and a path. The function would loop through each item in the inventory, check if its version matches the given version, and then add the path to the dictionary. But the docstring doesn't mention filtering by version. Hmm, maybe the version is part of the state's identifier in the inventory.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where keys are versions and values are lists of states. Then, the function would retrieve the list of states for the given version and extract their paths. But without knowing the exact structure, I have to make assumptions.

Looking at the function's purpose again: it returns the file paths of the states in the inventory. So perhaps each state in the inventory has a 'path' attribute. The version might be used to select which states to include. For example, if the inventory is a list of state objects, each with a version and path, then the function would filter those with the given version and collect their paths into a dictionary. But the dictionary's keys might be state names or IDs, and the values are the paths.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state name, and the value is a dictionary containing 'version' and 'path' keys. Then, the function would iterate through the inventory, check if the state's version matches the input version, and include those in the result dict with their paths.

Since the problem doesn't provide specific details about the inventory structure, I need to make a reasonable assumption. Let's assume that the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each representing a state with 'version' and 'path' keys. The function would then filter these entries by the given version and return a dictionary mapping state identifiers (maybe the keys from the inventory items) to their paths. However, if the inventory is a list, the keys might not be present. Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state name, and the value is a dictionary with 'version' and 'path'.

Another possibility: the inventory is a list of objects, and each object has attributes like version and path. The function would loop through each object, check if its version matches, and collect the paths. But without knowing the actual structure, it's challenging.

Since the user hasn't provided context about the inventory structure, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where the inventory is expected to have a certain format. For example, in some systems, inventory might be a list of state objects, each with a version and path. The function would then filter those by version and return a dict of paths.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where the keys are versions, and the values are lists of paths. Then, the function would simply return the list of paths for the given version. But the return type is a dict, so maybe the keys are state names and the values are paths.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to assume that the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with 'version' and 'path' keys, and the function returns a dictionary where the keys are the state names (maybe from another key like 'name') and the values are the paths, but only for items with the matching version.

Wait, but the docstring says "the file paths of the states in the inventory". So maybe each state in the inventory has a path, and the version is used to select which states to include. For example, if the inventory is a list of states, each with a version and path, then the function would filter by version and collect the paths into a dict, perhaps using some identifier as the key.

Alternatively, maybe the version is not used for filtering but is part of the path. For example, the path includes the version, like "states/v{version}/state1.py". But that's speculative.

Since the problem is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring without additional context, perhaps the intended code is to return a dictionary where the keys are the state names (or some identifier) and the values are the paths, but how to get that from the inventory and version?

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary that maps versions to a list of paths. Then, the function would return the list of paths for the given version as a dictionary. But that's unclear.

Another approach: look for similar functions. For example, if this is part of a configuration management system, the inventory might be a list of state files, each with metadata including version. The function would then return a map of logical paths (maybe the original paths) based on the version.

But without more context, it's challenging. However, since the user provided that the code should be generated based on the given signature and docstring, perhaps the code is expected to be a placeholder or a skeleton that can be filled in later. However, the user probably expects a functional example.

Wait, the user says "Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I need to write the code that fits the function signature and docstring, even if it's a placeholder.

But the function needs to return a dictionary of file paths. So perhaps the code would be something like:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    return {item['name']: item['path'] for item in inventory if item['version'] == version}

But this assumes that each item in the inventory is a dictionary with 'name', 'version', and 'path' keys. However, without knowing the actual structure, this is a guess.

Alternatively, if the inventory is a list of objects with attributes version and path, then:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    return {item.name: item.path for item in inventory if item.version == version}

But again, this depends on the actual structure.

Since the user hasn't provided context about the inventory structure, perhaps the intended answer is to return a dictionary where the keys are the versions and the values are the paths, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where the keys are versions and the values are paths. Then the function would return {version: inventory[version]} if version is in inventory. But that's a stretch.

Given the lack of context, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that returns a dictionary mapping each state's identifier (like name) to its path, filtering by version. So assuming that each item in the inventory has a version and a path, and maybe a name, the code would be as I wrote earlier.

But since the user hasn't provided any context, maybe the code is supposed to be a simple example. For example, if the inventory is a list of dictionaries with 'path' and 'version' keys, then:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    return {item['path']: item['version'] for item in inventory}

But that doesn't use the version parameter in a way that filters. Alternatively, maybe the version is part of the path.

Alternatively, the function could return a dictionary where the keys are the versions and the values are lists of paths. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Given that the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the context says Imported Packages: Within file: Within class: (empty), perhaps the code is supposed to be a simple example that returns a dictionary of paths, possibly using the version as a key.

But I think the most plausible answer, given the lack of context, is to assume that the inventory is a list of state objects, each with a version and path, and the function returns a dictionary mapping state identifiers (like their names) to their paths, filtered by the given version. So the code would be something like:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    return {state.name: state.path for state in inventory if state.version == version}

But if the inventory items are dictionaries, then:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    return {item['name']: item['path'] for item in inventory if item['version'] == version}

But without knowing the actual structure, this is speculative. However, given the information, this is a reasonable assumption.
