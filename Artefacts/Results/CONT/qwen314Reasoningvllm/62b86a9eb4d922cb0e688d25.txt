Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _get_resource_name_regex function based on the given context. Let me look at the context provided.

The function is supposed to return a regular expression used to validate Krake resource names. From the context, there's a mention of _resource_name_pattern and _resource_name_regex. Maybe those are defined elsewhere in the code. Since the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, it's likely that it returns the regex pattern stored in _resource_name_regex.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the actual definitions of those variables. However, looking at the context, the function is part of a set of validation functions. The _resource_name_pattern might be a string that defines the regex, and _resource_name_regex could be a compiled regex object. But the function's purpose is to return the regex, so perhaps it's just returning the compiled pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the function constructs the regex using the pattern. But since the context includes _resource_name_pattern and _resource_name_regex, maybe the function simply returns the pre-defined regex.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact code for those variables, I have to infer based on standard practices. Typically, such functions return a compiled regex. So the code might look like:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    return _resource_name_regex

But I need to check if _resource_name_regex is defined elsewhere. The context mentions that within the file, _resource_name_regex is present. So the function is just returning that variable. Therefore, the code would be as simple as that. No need for complex logic here. Just return the predefined regex.
