Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function directlyProvidedBy(object) based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it returns the interfaces directly provided by the given object, and the value is an IDeclaration from zope.interface.

First, I should recall how Zope interfaces work. The directlyProvides function is part of the zope.interface module. The directlyProvidedBy function would likely be retrieving the interfaces that are directly provided by the object, not including those inherited from superclasses.

Looking at the context provided, there are several functions and variables mentioned, like implementedBy, classImplements, and others. But the key here is to find how to get the directly provided interfaces. In Zope, each object has a __provides__ attribute, which is an interface declaration. However, sometimes this might be managed through descriptors or other mechanisms.

Wait, the function directlyProvides is mentioned in the context. Maybe directlyProvidedBy is related to that. The directlyProvides function is used to set the interfaces directly provided by an object. So, perhaps directlyProvidedBy is a getter function that retrieves those interfaces.

In the Zope interface implementation, the directly provided interfaces are stored in the __provides__ attribute of the object. However, if the object is a class, it might be handled differently. But the function is for any object.

So, the code for directlyProvidedBy might be accessing the __provides__ attribute of the object. However, if the object doesn't have this attribute, it might default to something else, like the interfaces implemented by the class.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the interfaces directly provided, not those implemented. So maybe it's checking the __provides__ attribute. However, in some cases, the object might not have this attribute, so we need to handle that.

Alternatively, looking at the Zope source code, the directlyProvides function is implemented using a descriptor. The directlyProvidedBy function might be retrieving the interfaces from the object's __provides__ attribute, which is an IDeclaration.

So, the code could be something like:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return getattr(object, '__provides__', None)

But wait, that might not be sufficient. Because in some cases, the object might not have a __provides__ attribute, and we need to fall back to the interfaces implemented by the class. However, according to the docstring, the function returns the directly provided interfaces, which are set via directlyProvides. So if the object hasn't had directlyProvides called on it, then it might not have any directly provided interfaces.

Alternatively, maybe the function is using the _provides_ attribute from the zope.interface module. Let me think about how Zope's directlyProvides works. When you call directlyProvides(obj, interface), it adds the interface to the obj's __provides__ attribute. So, directlyProvidedBy would return that.

Therefore, the function would check the object's __provides__ attribute. If it exists, return it; otherwise, return an empty declaration.

But how is this implemented in the existing code? The context includes functions like _implements_name, _implementedBy_super, etc. But maybe the directlyProvidedBy function is using the _provides_ attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of the zope.interface module and is implemented using the _provides_ descriptor. For example, in Zope, the directlyProvides is a descriptor that manages the __provides__ attribute. So, directlyProvidedBy would be accessing that.

But without looking at the actual Zope code, I need to infer based on standard practices. The function should return the interfaces directly provided by the object, which are stored in the __provides__ attribute. So, the code would be:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return getattr(object, '__provides__', None)

But wait, the return type is an IDeclaration. So, if the object doesn't have __provides__, maybe it returns an empty declaration. However, in Zope, the default is an empty declaration. So perhaps the code is:

from zope.interface import IDeclaration

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return IDeclaration(object.__provides__)

But that might not be correct. Alternatively, the __provides__ attribute is an instance of IDeclaration. So, if the object has it, return it, else return an empty one.

Wait, in Zope, the directlyProvides function is a descriptor that manages the __provides__ attribute. So, when you access obj.__provides__, it's actually a descriptor that returns the interfaces. So, perhaps directlyProvidedBy is simply returning the __provides__ attribute of the object.

But how is that handled in the code? Let me think. The function directlyProvides is a function that sets the interfaces, and directlyProvidedBy would retrieve them. So, perhaps the code is:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return object.__provides__

But if the object doesn't have __provides__, this would raise an AttributeError. However, in Zope, every object has a __provides__ attribute, even if it's empty. So maybe it's safe to access it directly.

Alternatively, the code might use the _provides_ attribute from the zope.interface module. For example, the _provides_ is a descriptor that manages the provides for an object. So, the directlyProvidedBy function would be accessing that.

But without seeing the actual code, I need to make an educated guess. Given that the function is part of the zope.interface module, and the context includes functions like directlyProvides, which is a descriptor, the directlyProvidedBy function is likely retrieving the __provides__ attribute of the object.

So, the code would be:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return object.__provides__

But I need to make sure that this is correct. However, in Python, accessing __provides__ directly might not be the right approach if it's a descriptor. For example, if __provides__ is a property, then accessing it as an attribute might not trigger the descriptor protocol. But in Zope, the directlyProvides function is a descriptor, so perhaps the __provides__ is a property that is managed by the descriptor.

Alternatively, maybe the directlyProvidedBy function is implemented using the _provides_ attribute from the module. For example, in Zope, there's a _provides_ function that returns the provides for an object. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering that the function is part of the zope.interface module, and given that the context includes functions like _implements_name, _implementedBy_super, etc., perhaps directlyProvidedBy is using the _provides_ attribute.

But I think the most straightforward answer is that directlyProvidedBy returns the __provides__ attribute of the object. Therefore, the code would be:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return object.__provides__

But to handle cases where the object doesn't have __provides__, perhaps it's better to use getattr with a default. However, according to Zope's design, every object should have a __provides__ attribute, even if it's empty. So, maybe it's safe to access it directly.

Therefore, the final code is as above.
