Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _parse_image_ref function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function takes an image_href string and returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). The docstring mentions using urllib, so I should import that. The parameters are the href, and it raises ValueError.

First, I need to parse the image_href. Hrefs can be URLs, so maybe using urllib.parse.urlparse would help. Let me recall: urlparse splits a URL into components like scheme, netloc, path, etc.

So, let's start by parsing the image_href with urlparse. Then, extract the netloc, which is the network location part (like the domain). The image_id might be in the path. For example, if the URL is https://example.com/images/12345, the image_id could be '12345'.

But how to extract the image_id from the path? The path might have multiple parts. Maybe splitting on '/' and taking the last part. But need to handle cases where the path is empty or has trailing slashes.

Also, the use_ssl is a boolean indicating if the URL uses SSL (https). So check if the scheme is 'https'.

Wait, the function returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So:

- image_id: probably the last part of the path after splitting by '/'. But need to handle cases where the path is like '/images/12345' or 'images/12345'. So, split the path into parts and take the last non-empty part.

- netloc: from the parsed URL's netloc attribute. But sometimes, the netloc might include port numbers, like 'example.com:8080'. Should I include that? The problem says to return netloc as part of the tuple, so probably just take it as is.

- use_ssl: check if the scheme is 'https'.

But what if the URL is not properly formatted? The function raises ValueError. So need to handle cases where the URL is invalid. However, the docstring doesn't specify exactly when to raise, but the function is supposed to parse the href, so perhaps if the URL can't be parsed, it raises ValueError.

So steps:

1. Import urllib.parse and maybe urlparse from there. Wait, in Python 3, urlparse is in urllib.parse, and the function is called urlparse. So I need to import that.

But the user mentioned that the imported packages include urllib. So the code will have import urllib, but maybe they meant urllib.parse? Or perhaps the code should import from urllib.parse.

Wait, the user wrote in the context: Imported Packages: urllib. But in Python, to use urlparse, you need to import from urllib.parse. So maybe the code should have from urllib.parse import urlparse.

But the original code might have imported urllib, but that's not sufficient. So perhaps the code should include the necessary imports.

Wait, the user says: "Imported Packages: urllib" but within the file, perhaps the code is using urllib.parse. So the code should include the necessary imports.

So, in the generated code, I need to import urlparse from urllib.parse.

But the user's context says that within the file, there's nothing, so the code should include the necessary imports.

So, the code will start with:

from urllib.parse import urlparse

But the original code's context says that the imported packages are urllib. Maybe the user intended to use urllib's functions, but in Python, urlparse is in urllib.parse. So perhaps the code should import that.

Now, the function:

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:

So, inside the function, first parse the image_href with urlparse.

parsed = urlparse(image_href)

Then, check if the parsed URL has a scheme. If not, maybe raise ValueError.

But the docstring says it raises ValueError, but the exact conditions aren't specified. So perhaps if the URL is invalid, like missing scheme or netloc, then raise.

But for the purpose of this code, perhaps assume that the URL is valid. However, the function may need to validate that the URL has a netloc and a scheme.

But the problem says to generate the code, so proceed.

Now, extract the netloc: parsed.netloc.

For the image_id, the path is parsed.path. Split it into parts by '/', and take the last non-empty part.

For example, if parsed.path is '/images/12345', splitting gives ['', 'images', '12345'], so the last part is '12345'.

But if the path is 'images/12345/', splitting gives ['images', '12345', ''], so again, the last non-empty part is '12345'.

So code to get image_id:

path_parts = [p for p in parsed.path.split('/') if p]
image_id = path_parts[-1] if path_parts else ''

But what if the path is empty? Like, the URL is 'https://example.com'? Then parsed.path is '/', which splits into ['', ''], so path_parts is empty. Then image_id would be empty string. But that's probably not desired. However, the problem may assume that the image_href is a valid image URL with an image ID in the path.

But the function is supposed to parse it, so perhaps in such cases, it's acceptable to return empty string, but maybe the function should raise ValueError if the image_id is empty. However, the docstring doesn't specify that, so perhaps proceed as per the code.

Then, use_ssl is whether the scheme is 'https'.

use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'

But need to check if the scheme is present. For example, if the URL is 'http://example.com', then scheme is 'http', so use_ssl is False.

Now, putting it all together.

But what about cases where the URL is not properly formatted? For example, missing scheme or netloc. The function may raise ValueError in such cases. So perhaps check if parsed.netloc is empty, or if the scheme is not http or https.

But the problem says that the function raises ValueError, but the exact conditions are not given. So perhaps the code will assume that the URL is valid, but in practice, if the parsed URL has no netloc, then the code would return an empty string for netloc, which may not be desired. However, the problem may not require handling that, as per the given context.

So, the code:

from urllib.parse import urlparse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: missing netloc")
    path_parts = [p for p in parsed.path.split('/') if p]
    image_id = path_parts[-1] if path_parts else ''
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the original code's context says that the imported packages are urllib. However, in Python, urlparse is in urllib.parse, so the code needs to import from there. So the code should have 'from urllib.parse import urlparse'.

But the user's context says that the imported packages are urllib, but perhaps they meant that the code is in a file that has imported urllib. However, in Python, importing urllib alone doesn't get the urlparse function. So the code must import urlparse from urllib.parse.

Therefore, the generated code must include that import.

But the user's instruction says that the code should not include any explanation, so the code must have the necessary imports.

But the original code's context says that within the file, there's nothing. So the generated code should include the necessary imports.

So the code will start with:

from urllib.parse import urlparse
from typing import Tuple

But the user's function signature uses Tuple, so the code must import Tuple from typing.

So the code should include those imports.

But the user's context says that within the file, there's nothing. So the generated code must include these imports.

So putting it all together, the code is:

from urllib.parse import urlparse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: missing netloc")
    path_parts = [p for p in parsed.path.split('/') if p]
    image_id = path_parts[-1] if path_parts else ''
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, what if the URL has a query string or fragment? For example, 'https://example.com/images/12345?param=value#frag'. The path is '/images/12345', so the code would split into ['', 'images', '12345'], and image_id is '12345', which is correct.

Another test case: image_href is 'http://example.com/images/abc123', returns ('abc123', 'example.com', False).

Another case: 'https://img.example.org/pics/456', returns ('456', 'img.example.org', True).

What if the path is empty? Like 'http://example.com'? Then parsed.path is '/', split into ['', ''], path_parts is empty, image_id is ''. But the function returns that. However, maybe the function should raise an error in that case. But the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's acceptable.

But the function's docstring says it raises ValueError. So perhaps the code should check if the image_id is empty and raise an error. However, the original problem doesn't specify that, so maybe not. The current code as written would return empty string for image_id in such cases.

But the problem says that the function is supposed to parse the image href into composite parts, so maybe the image_id is expected to be present. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The current code as per the initial logic is as above.

Another thing: the original code's docstring says to import urllib. But in the generated code, we have imported urlparse from urllib.parse, which is correct.

So the generated code should include the necessary imports and the function as written.
