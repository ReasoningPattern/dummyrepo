Okay, I need to write a Python function called vertex3tuple that takes a list of vertices and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain three points: the vertex itself and the two adjacent vertices. But if the adjacent vertices are out of bounds, I should use index 0 for those.

First, let me think about how to handle the indices. For each vertex at position i, the previous vertex would be i-1, and the next would be i+1. But if i is 0, then i-1 would be -1, which is the last element. Wait, no, the problem says if the subscript is out of bounds, take index 0. So for example, if the list has 3 vertices, for the first vertex (index 0), the previous would be index 0 (since 0-1 is -1, which is out of bounds), and the next is index 1. Wait, no, maybe the vertices are in a polygon, so it's a closed loop. So for the first vertex, the previous would be the last one, and the next is the second. But the problem says if the index is out of bounds, use 0. Hmm, maybe the problem is not considering the polygon as a loop. Let me recheck the docstring.

The docstring says, "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". So for example, if we have a list of vertices, and for a given i, when we look for i-1, if that's less than 0, we use 0. Similarly, if i+1 is beyond the length, we use 0. Wait, but that might not make sense for a polygon. Wait, maybe the vertices are in a list, and for each vertex, we need to get the previous and next in the list, but if the index is out of bounds, use 0. So for example, if the list is [v0, v1, v2], then for v0 (i=0), previous is i-1 = -1, which is out of bounds, so use 0 (v0). Next is i+1 = 1 (v1). So the tuple would be (v0, v0, v1). For v1 (i=1), previous is 0 (v0), next is 2 (v2). So tuple is (v1, v0, v2). For v2 (i=2), next is 3 which is out of bounds, so use 0 (v0). So tuple is (v2, v1, v0). 

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. But according to the problem statement, that's what we need to do. So the function needs to take each vertex, and for each, get the previous and next, with wrap-around only if the index is out of bounds. Wait, no, the problem says if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. So for example, when accessing i-1, if that's less than 0, use 0. Similarly, if i+1 is >= len(vertices), use 0. So for the first element (i=0), previous is 0 (since -1 is out of bounds), next is 1. For the last element (i = len(vertices)-1), next is 0. 

So the approach is: for each vertex at index i, get prev_index = i-1 if i-1 >=0 else 0. next_index = i+1 if i+1 < len(vertices) else 0. Then, the tuple is (vertices[i], vertices[prev_index], vertices[next_index]).

Wait, but the problem says "include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So maybe the vertex is in the middle, and the two adjacent points. But in a polygon, the first vertex's previous is the last, and the last's next is the first. However, according to the problem's instruction, if the index is out of bounds, use 0. So perhaps the problem is not considering the polygon as a loop, but rather, for indices that are out of bounds, just take 0. So for example, if the list is [v0, v1], then for i=0, previous is 0 (since -1 is out of bounds), next is 1. For i=1, next is 0 (since 2 is out of bounds). So the tuples would be (v0, v0, v1) and (v1, v0, v0). 

So the code needs to loop through each vertex in the vertices list. For each i in range(len(vertices)), compute prev_index and next_index as described. Then, collect the three elements into a tuple. 

So the steps are:

- Iterate over each index i in vertices.
- For each i, calculate prev_i = i-1 if i-1 >=0 else 0.
- Calculate next_i = i+1 if i+1 < len(vertices) else 0.
- Take vertices[i], vertices[prev_i], vertices[next_i] as the tuple.
- Append this tuple to the result list.

Now, implement this in Python. The function is called vertex3tuple, takes vertices as an argument. The vertices is a list, presumably of points (like tuples or lists). The return is a list of tuples, each with three elements.

So code:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    result = []
    n = len(vertices)
    for i in range(n):
        prev_i = i - 1 if i - 1 >= 0 else 0
        next_i = i + 1 if i + 1 < n else 0
        triple = (vertices[i], vertices[prev_i], vertices[next_i])
        result.append(triple)
    return result

Wait, but what if vertices is empty? Well, the problem probably assumes that vertices is a non-empty list, but perhaps we should handle that. However, the problem's docstring says "vertices to be converted" but doesn't specify. But since the code is supposed to handle out of bounds, perhaps the code is okay. For example, if vertices is empty, len is 0, then the for loop doesn't run, returns empty list. But that's probably acceptable.

Testing with sample input. Let's say vertices = [A, B, C]. Then:

i=0: prev_i=0 (since -1 is out of bounds), next_i=1. So (A, A, B)
i=1: prev_i=0, next_i=2. (B, A, C)
i=2: next_i=0. So (C, B, A)

So the output would be [(A,A,B), (B,A,C), (C,B,A)].

Another example: vertices = [A, B]. Then:

i=0: prev_i=0, next_i=1 → (A, A, B)
i=1: prev_i=0, next_i=0 → (B, A, A)

So output is [(A,A,B), (B,A,A)].

That seems to fit the problem description. So the code should be correct.
