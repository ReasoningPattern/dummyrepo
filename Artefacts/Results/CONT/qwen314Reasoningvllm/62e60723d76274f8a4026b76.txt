Okay, let's see. I need to generate the Python code for the from_ticks method based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is supposed to create a Time object from ticks, which are nanoseconds since midnight. The parameters are ticks (int) and an optional tz (datetime.tzinfo). The return type is Time, and it raises a ValueError if ticks are out of bounds.

First, I need to check the bounds. The docstring says 0 <= ticks < 86400000000000. So 86400 seconds in a day, multiplied by 1e9 for nanoseconds gives 86400000000000. So if ticks is less than 0 or >= that value, raise an error.

Then, the method is a class method, so it should use @classmethod. The parameters are cls, ticks, tz. The code needs to create a Time instance. Looking at the context, there's a __new__ method in the class that takes hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo. So maybe we need to convert the ticks into those components.

Wait, ticks are nanoseconds since midnight. So to get hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds, we can do some calculations. For example:

- total_seconds = ticks // 1e9
- nanoseconds = ticks % 1e9

But since ticks is an integer, perhaps using integer division and modulo.

But wait, 1e9 is 1,000,000,000. So:

total_seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000
nanoseconds = ticks % 1_000_000_000

Then, break down total_seconds into hours, minutes, seconds.

total_seconds = (total_seconds)
hours = total_seconds // 3600
remaining_seconds = total_seconds % 3600
minutes = remaining_seconds // 60
seconds = remaining_seconds % 60

But need to make sure that these values are within valid ranges. For example, hours should be 0-23, minutes and seconds 0-59.

But since the ticks are within 0 to 86399999999999 (since the upper bound is exclusive), the maximum total_seconds would be 86399.999999999 seconds, which is 23:59:59.999999999, so the breakdown should be correct.

Once we have hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, we can create the Time instance using the __new__ method. The __new__ method in the class is defined as __new__(cls, hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo). So we need to pass those parameters.

But wait, the __new__ method in the context is also mentioned as __new(cls, ticks, hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo). Wait, maybe there's an overload? Or perhaps the __new__ method can take either ticks or the components. But the user's context might have a __new__ that takes hour, minute, etc., so we need to use that.

So, putting it all together:

In the from_ticks method, after validating the ticks, compute the hour, minute, second, nanosecond, then call the __new__ method with those values and the tz.

But wait, the __new__ method's parameters in the context are: __new__(cls, hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo). So we need to split the ticks into those components.

So code steps:

- Check if ticks is within 0 <= ticks < 86400000000000. If not, raise ValueError.

- Compute total_seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000

- nanoseconds = ticks % 1_000_000_000

- Then compute hours, minutes, seconds from total_seconds.

But how to handle that? Let's code:

total_seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000
nanoseconds = ticks % 1_000_000_000

Then:

hours = total_seconds // 3600
remaining_seconds = total_seconds % 3600
minutes = remaining_seconds // 60
seconds = remaining_seconds % 60

But need to ensure that these are within valid ranges. However, since ticks is validated, these should be okay.

Once we have those values, create the instance using the __new__ method. So:

return cls.__new__(cls, hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, tz)

Wait, but in the __new__ method's parameters, the order is hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo. So yes.

But wait, the __new__ method in the class is defined as __new__(cls, hour, minute, second, nanosecond, tzinfo). So the parameters are in that order.

So the code would be:

if ticks < 0 or ticks >= 86400000000000:
    raise ValueError("ticks out of bounds")

total_seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000
nanoseconds = ticks % 1_000_000_000

hours = total_seconds // 3600
remaining_seconds = total_seconds % 3600
minutes = remaining_seconds // 60
seconds = remaining_seconds % 60

return cls.__new__(cls, hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, tz)

But wait, the __new__ method might have some validation steps. For example, in the context, there are methods like __normalize_hour, __normalize_minute, etc. But since the from_ticks method is creating the instance, perhaps it's assumed that the values are already normalized. However, the code might need to normalize them again. But given that the ticks are within the valid range, the breakdown into hours, minutes, etc., should be correct.

But perhaps the __new__ method expects the parameters to be normalized. For example, if the ticks are 86399999999999, then total_seconds is 86399.999999999 seconds, which is 23:59:59.999999999, so hours=23, minutes=59, seconds=59, nanoseconds=999999999. Which is valid.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the code should be written as a class method. So:

@classmethod
def from_ticks(cls, ticks, tz=None):
    if not (0 <= ticks < 86400000000000):
        raise ValueError("ticks out of bounds")
    total_seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000
    nanoseconds = ticks % 1_000_000_000
    hours = total_seconds // 3600
    remaining_seconds = total_seconds % 3600
    minutes = remaining_seconds // 60
    seconds = remaining_seconds % 60
    return cls.__new__(cls, hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, tz)

But wait, the __new__ method's parameters in the class might be different. For example, in the context, there's a __new__ method that takes ticks, hour, minute, etc. Wait, looking back at the context:

Within class: self.__new__(cls,hour,minute,second,nanosecond,tzinfo) ; self.__new(cls,ticks,hour,minute,second,nanosecond,tzinfo) 

Hmm, there's a __new__ method that takes ticks as a parameter. Wait, maybe there are multiple __new__ methods? Or perhaps it's a typo. But the user's context shows:

Within class: self.__new__(cls,hour,minute,second,nanosecond,tzinfo) ; self.__new(cls,ticks,hour,minute,second,nanosecond,tzinfo) 

So perhaps there's a __new__ that takes ticks as the first argument. But that would be conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the context. But given that, perhaps the __new__ method that is used here is the one that takes hour, minute, etc. Because in the from_ticks method, we need to create the instance with the components, not with ticks. So the __new__ that takes hour, minute, etc., is the one to use.

But in the context, there's also a __new__ that takes ticks as the first parameter. However, that might be for another constructor. But in the from_ticks method, we need to split the ticks into components and use the __new__ that takes those components.

So the code above should be correct.

Another thing: the tz parameter is optional. So in the __new__ method, the tzinfo is passed as tz. That's correct.

So the code should be as written.
