Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the is_file_exist function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function's purpose is to check if a file exists. In Python, the standard way to check if a file exists is using os.path.isfile. But wait, the user mentioned some imported packages: os is one of them. So I can use os.path.isfile.

Wait, but maybe they want to use something else? The context mentions other methods like self.get_file_size, which might use os.path.getsize, but for existence, isfile is the right approach.

So the function should return True if the file exists and is a regular file, False otherwise. Let me write that.

The function is part of a class, given that in the context there's self.get_file_size and other methods. So the function is likely part of a class, but the signature provided is a standalone function. Wait, the user provided the function signature as def is_file_exist(file_name):, but in the context, it's used as self.is_file_exist(file_name). So maybe the function is actually a method of a class. But the user's code shows the function as a standalone. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the problem, I should generate code based on the given signature.

Wait, the user says: Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. The function signature is def is_file_exist(file_name):, which is a standalone function, not a method. However, in the context, it's called as self.is_file_exist, implying it's a method. But perhaps the user wants the function to be a method. But the given signature is not a method. Maybe there's a discrepancy here.

But the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature. So I should stick to that. However, the context might give hints. Let me check again.

In the context, within the class, there's self.is_file_exist(file_name), which suggests that the function is a method of a class. But the given function signature is not a method. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature. But since I have to follow the given signature, maybe the function is intended to be a standalone function, but in the context, it's used as a method. That's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the user provided the function signature as a method but forgot the 'self' parameter. Let me check the original problem again.

Original function signature: def is_file_exist(file_name):. No 'self' parameter. But in the context, it's called as self.is_file_exist(file_name). That suggests that the function is a method, so it should have 'self' as the first parameter. But the user provided the signature without it. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature. But the instruction says to generate code based on the given signature. So maybe I should proceed with the given signature, even if it's conflicting with the context. But that might lead to errors.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended the function to be a method, and the signature is missing 'self'. In that case, I should adjust the signature to include 'self' as the first parameter. But the user explicitly provided the signature as def is_file_exist(file_name):. So perhaps the user is using a different approach, maybe the function is part of a class but not a method? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class, but the user omitted the 'self' parameter in the signature. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature. So perhaps I should proceed with the given signature, even if it's conflicting with the context.

But then, in the code, when called as self.is_file_exist, it would require the method to have 'self' as the first parameter. So there's a contradiction here. However, the user might have made a mistake in the function signature. But since I have to follow the given signature, I'll proceed.

So, the function is supposed to check if the file exists. Using os.path.isfile. So the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, the imported packages mentioned are codecs, os, logging, pysolbase. So os is already imported. So the code would be correct.

But in the context, there's a logger. Maybe the function should log something? The docstring says to check if the file exists, but the original code might need to log an error or something. However, the docstring doesn't mention logging, so perhaps not. The user's context mentions that within the file, there's a logger, but the function's responsibility is just to check existence.

Therefore, the code is straightforward: return os.path.isfile(file_name). That's the standard way.

But wait, maybe the user wants to use the logger? For example, if the file doesn't exist, log a message. But the docstring doesn't mention that. The original function's docstring is just to check existence. So the function should return a boolean, not perform logging. Unless the context implies that.

But the user hasn't provided any code for the logger usage in this function. So I think the correct code is simply using os.path.isfile.

So the generated code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But the user mentioned that the imported packages are codecs, os, logging, pysolbase. So the code should include the necessary imports. However, the function may not need to import anything else. The os module is already imported, so the code is okay.

But the user's code may have the imports at the top. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code should include the function definition. The imports may be part of the code, but the user's context says that the imported packages are already present. However, the user may expect that the code includes the necessary imports. But in the given problem, the user says "Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, the user says to output the code in Python markdown format. But the code would need to have the function. However, the original code may need to import os. But the user's context says that os is imported. So perhaps the code doesn't need to import os again. But in the generated code, the function uses os.path.isfile, so the code must have imported os. So the generated code should include the import statement.

But the user's context says that the imported packages are already present. However, the code generated must be self-contained. Therefore, the generated code should include the necessary import statements.

So the correct code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

Yes, that's the correct code. The function uses os.path.isfile to check if the file exists. That's the standard approach. The docstring is as given. The code is simple and meets the requirements.
