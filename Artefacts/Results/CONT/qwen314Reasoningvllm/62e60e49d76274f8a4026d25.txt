Okay, I need to generate a Python function called unit_of_work that returns a decorator. The decorator should have metadata and timeout attributes. Let me think about how to structure this.

First, the function unit_of_work takes metadata and timeout as parameters. The goal is to create a decorator that can be applied to other functions. So, the decorator should be a class or a function that wraps the target function.

Wait, decorators in Python can be implemented as functions or classes. Since the decorator needs to have attributes (metadata and timeout), maybe using a class-based decorator would be better because it's easier to attach attributes to instances.

So, the unit_of_work function will return a decorator class. When someone uses @unit_of_work(...), it creates an instance of this decorator class, which then wraps the target function.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Define the unit_of_work function with metadata and timeout parameters.
2. Inside unit_of_work, define a decorator class that takes the function to be decorated.
3. The decorator class should have __init__ method to store the function and the metadata/timeout.
4. Implement __call__ method so that when the decorated function is called, it executes the original function.
5. Also, maybe include __get__ method if the decorator needs to handle instance methods, but maybe that's overcomplicating for now.

Wait, but the decorator might need to be a function that returns a wrapper. Alternatively, using a class-based decorator might be more straightforward for attaching attributes.

Alternatively, the decorator could be a function that returns a wrapper function. But how to attach metadata and timeout to the decorator itself?

Wait, the problem says the decorator should have metadata and timeout attributes. So when you apply the decorator, like @unit_of_work(metadata=..., timeout=...), the resulting decorator object (the instance) should have those attributes.

So, the unit_of_work function returns a decorator, which is a class. When you apply @unit_of_work(...), it creates an instance of that class, which then wraps the function.

So, inside unit_of_work, return a class that acts as the decorator. Let me try writing that.

The code would look something like this:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    class Decorator:
        def __init__(self, func):
            self.func = func
            self.metadata = metadata
            self.timeout = timeout

        def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return self.func(*args, **kwargs)
    return Decorator

Wait, but then when you use @unit_of_work(...), the Decorator class is created with the given metadata and timeout. Then, when the decorated function is called, it uses the __call__ method of the Decorator instance.

But maybe the Decorator should also handle the function wrapping properly. Also, in Python, when you use a class as a decorator, the instance is created with the function as the first argument. So the __init__ method receives the function.

Yes, that's correct. So the code above should work. But perhaps the Decorator class needs to have the metadata and timeout attributes set based on the parameters passed to unit_of_work.

Wait, in the code above, the Decorator class's __init__ method takes 'func' as the first argument, and then the metadata and timeout are set to the ones passed into unit_of_work. That's correct.

So when someone does:

@unit_of_work(metadata={'key': 'value'}, timeout=10)
def my_function():
    pass

Then, the Decorator instance for my_function will have metadata={'key': 'value'} and timeout=10.

This seems to meet the requirements. The docstring says that the decorator has metadata and timeout attributes, which are set based on the parameters passed to unit_of_work.

But maybe the Decorator should also allow for the metadata and timeout to be set when the decorator is applied. Wait, the parameters to unit_of_work are metadata and timeout, which are passed to the decorator. So the code as written is correct.

Therefore, the generated code should be as follows.
