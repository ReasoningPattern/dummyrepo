Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_spec_defaults method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me look at the context provided to see what's available.

The method's docstring says it resolves arguments' values from the spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). So the main task is to call this helper method.

Looking at the context, there's a self._get_defaults method mentioned, which probably returns the default values. The get_spec_defaults method might need to return the result of calling this helper.

Wait, the user mentioned that the function signature is def get_spec_defaults(self):, so I need to implement this method. The docstring says it uses self._get_defaults(), so maybe the method just returns the result of that call.

But I should check if there are any other steps. The context includes other methods like validate_arg_sources, generate_answers_file, etc., but the get_spec_defaults is supposed to resolve arguments from the spec and other sources. However, the docstring specifically mentions using self._get_defaults(), which is a helper method.

So the most straightforward implementation would be for get_spec_defaults to call self._get_defaults() and return its result. There's no mention of additional processing in the docstring, so I don't need to add anything else.

Therefore, the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

I need to make sure that there are no other parameters or steps. The function doesn't take any parameters except self, and the docstring says it uses the helper method. So this should be correct.
