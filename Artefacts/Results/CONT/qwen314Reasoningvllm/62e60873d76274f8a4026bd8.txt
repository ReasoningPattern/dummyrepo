Okay, let's see. I need to generate the Python code for the protocol_handlers method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user provided the context of imported packages and existing class methods.

First, the function is a class method, so it should have 'cls' as the first parameter. The docstring says it returns a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers keyed by version tuples. If a protocol version is provided, the dict will have zero or one items depending on support. Otherwise, all versions are returned.

The parameters include protocol_version, which can be a tuple or None. The function needs to check if protocol_version is a tuple, raising TypeError if not. Then, it should collect the supported versions. The existing code mentions self.PROTOCOL_VERSION, which might be a class attribute holding the supported versions.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if protocol_version is not None and not a tuple. If so, raise TypeError.
2. If protocol_version is provided, check if it's in the supported versions. If yes, return {version: handler}, else empty dict.
3. If not provided, return all supported versions mapped to their handlers.

But how are the handlers determined? The context shows methods like self.get_handshake, which might be related. Maybe the handlers are determined by the protocol versions supported by the class. The PROTOCOL_VERSION could be a list of supported versions.

Wait, the function is called protocol_handlers on the class, so perhaps the class has a class-level attribute that lists the supported versions. For example, maybe cls.SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS is a list of tuples. Then, for each version in that list, we need to map it to a handler class.

But the docstring says "available Bolt protocol handlers", so each version has a corresponding handler class. How are these handlers determined? Maybe each version corresponds to a specific handler class, like a subclass or a mapping in the code.

Alternatively, the handlers could be generated based on the protocol version. For example, if the version is (3,5), the handler might be BoltProtocolHandlerV3_5.

But without more context, I need to make assumptions. The existing code has self.get_handshake, which might return the handshake data for the protocol. Maybe the handlers are determined by the protocol versions supported by the class.

So, the code might look like this:

- Check the protocol_version parameter.
- If protocol_version is provided, check if it's in the supported versions.
- For each supported version, create a mapping to a handler class.

Assuming that the class has a class attribute like SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS, which is a list of tuples. Then, for each version in that list, the handler could be determined by some logic, perhaps a class method that returns the handler for that version.

But how to get the handler class? Maybe the class has a method that returns the handler based on the version. For example, a class method like get_handler_for_version(version) that returns the appropriate handler class.

Alternatively, the handlers could be stored in a dictionary as a class attribute. For example, HANDLERS = { (3,5): BoltProtocolHandlerV3_5, ... }

But given the existing code, the user's class might have a way to get the handler for a version. Since the user's code includes self.get_handshake, maybe that's part of determining the handler.

Alternatively, perhaps the protocol handlers are determined by the PROTOCOL_VERSION attribute. Wait, the context mentions self.PROTOCOL_VERSION, which might be the version the instance is using. But the function is about available handlers, not the current one.

This is a bit unclear. However, the function's purpose is to return a dict of available handlers. So, the code needs to generate that dict based on the protocol versions supported by the class.

Assuming that the class has a class-level attribute that lists the supported versions, like SUPPORTED_VERSIONS. Then, for each version in that list, map it to a handler.

But how to get the handler? Maybe the handler is the class itself, or a subclass based on the version. Alternatively, the code might have a way to generate the handler class for each version.

Alternatively, the function could be using the get_handshake method to determine supported versions. But that's unclear.

Another approach: The docstring says that if no protocol version is provided, all available versions are returned. So the function needs to know all the versions that are supported by the class. The PROTOCOL_VERSION in the context might be the current version, but perhaps the class has a way to list all supported versions.

Wait, looking back, the user's context includes a method called self.version_list(cls, versions, limit). Maybe that's a helper function to list the versions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the function could be using the class's PROTOCOL_VERSION as a list of supported versions. For example, if PROTOCOL_VERSION is a list of tuples, then iterate over those.

But the function is a class method, so perhaps the class has a class-level attribute that holds the supported versions. For example, cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS.

Putting it all together, here's a possible implementation:

Check if protocol_version is provided. If it's not a tuple, raise TypeError. Then, check if it's in the supported versions. If yes, return {protocol_version: handler}, else empty dict. If no protocol version is given, return a dict mapping all supported versions to their handlers.

But how to get the handler for each version? Maybe the handler is determined by the version, perhaps using a factory method or a mapping.

Assuming that for each version, the handler is the same class, or perhaps a different class. But without more info, perhaps the code uses a dictionary that maps versions to handler classes, which might be a class attribute.

So, the code could be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    # Determine supported versions
    supported_versions = cls.SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS  # Assuming this exists
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if protocol_version in supported_versions:
            # Get the handler for this version
            handler = cls.get_handler(protocol_version)  # Hypothetical method
            return {protocol_version: handler}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        handlers = {}
        for version in supported_versions:
            handler = cls.get_handler(version)
            handlers[version] = handler
        return handlers

But this is speculative. The actual code might have different ways to get the handlers. Given the context, the user's code may have a way to determine the handler based on the protocol version. For example, the get_handshake method might be involved.

Alternatively, the handlers could be determined by the PROTOCOL_VERSION attribute. But that's unclear.

Another possibility: The function returns a dictionary where each key is a version, and the value is the handler class. The handler classes might be determined by the version, perhaps using a module or a registry.

But given the limited context, I need to make a best guess. The code should check the protocol_version type, then return the appropriate handlers based on supported versions. The exact way to get the handler is unclear, but perhaps the class has a method or attribute that provides it.

In the absence of more information, perhaps the code uses a dictionary that maps versions to handler classes, which is a class-level attribute. For example, HANDLERS = { (3,5): BoltProtocolHandlerV3_5, ... }

So, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    # Assume cls.HANDLERS is a dictionary mapping versions to handler classes
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return {protocol_version: cls.HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)} if protocol_version in cls.HANDLERS else {}
    else:
        return cls.HANDLERS.copy()

But this is assuming the existence of cls.HANDLERS, which may not be present in the context.

Alternatively, the function may be using the PROTOCOL_VERSION attribute of the class. For example, if the class has a PROTOCOL_VERSION that's a list of supported versions, then:

supported_versions = getattr(cls, 'PROTOCOL_VERSION', [])

But that's just a guess.

Given the uncertainty, the code should include the type check and then return the appropriate dictionary. The exact mapping of versions to handlers is unclear, but the code must follow the docstring's instructions.

Another angle: The function is part of a class that handles Bolt protocol, so perhaps each protocol version has a corresponding handler class, and the function returns those. For example, if the class is Bolt, then for version (3,5), the handler is BoltV3_5.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, it's hard to code.

In conclusion, the code will:

- Check if protocol_version is a tuple or None.
- If not None, check if it's supported and return the handler.
- If None, return all supported versions.

The actual handler retrieval is not clear, but perhaps the code uses a class-level mapping. So, here's a possible implementation:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    # Assume that cls has a class attribute called SUPPORTED_VERSIONS
    supported_versions = getattr(cls, 'SUPPORTED_VERSIONS', [])
    handlers = {}
    for version in supported_versions:
        # Assume that the handler is determined by some method, e.g., a class method
        handler = cls.get_handler_for_version(version)
        handlers[version] = handler
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return {protocol_version: handlers.get(protocol_version, None)}
    return handlers

But again, this is speculative. Since the user's context includes a method called get_handshake, maybe that's used to determine supported versions. However, without more info, I'll proceed with the code that includes the type check and returns the appropriate dictionary based on the supported versions, assuming that the class has a way to get the handlers for each version.
