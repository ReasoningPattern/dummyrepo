Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_from_content method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is supposed to validate that the YAML content has all required fields. If not, it raises an IRValidatorException. It returns a dictionary with the data loaded from the spec file.

First, the parameters: spec_content is the content of the spec file. The function is a class method, so 'cls' is the first parameter. The docstring mentions that it raises an exception when mandatory data is missing.

Looking at the context, there's a mention of imported packages: os, jsonschema, six, infrared. Also, within the class, there are methods like validate_from_file and validate_from_content. Wait, the user provided that within the class, there's self.validate_from_file and self.validate_from_content. But the current function is validate_from_content, which is a class method. Hmm, maybe the existing code has a class with these methods.

But the task is to generate the code for validate_from_content. The existing code might have some structure. Let me think about what needs to be done here.

The function needs to validate the spec_content. Since it's YAML content, perhaps it's parsed into a Python dictionary. The validation would involve checking for required fields. The exception is IRValidatorException, which I assume is a custom exception defined elsewhere.

So, the steps for the function:

1. Check if spec_content is provided. If not, maybe raise an error? Or perhaps it's optional, but the function expects it to be present. The docstring says "when mandatory data is missing in spec file", so maybe the spec_content is expected to be a dictionary, and we check for required keys.

Wait, the function's return is a dictionary with data loaded from the spec. So maybe the spec_content is the raw YAML content, which needs to be parsed first. But the function's parameter is spec_content, which might already be a dictionary. Or maybe it's a string that needs to be parsed.

Wait, the function is called validate_from_content, which suggests that the content is already loaded. So perhaps the spec_content is a dictionary, and we need to validate that it contains all required fields.

But how do we know what the required fields are? The function probably uses a schema defined elsewhere. Since the imported packages include jsonschema, maybe the validation is done using jsonschema's validate function.

So, the code might load a schema (maybe from a file or a predefined structure) and then validate the spec_content against that schema. If it fails, raise the exception.

But the user hasn't provided the schema details. However, the existing code might have a schema defined in the class or elsewhere. For example, maybe there's a class-level schema that's used for validation.

Alternatively, the function might check for specific required keys. For example, if the spec must have 'name', 'version', etc.

But without more context, perhaps the code uses jsonschema to validate against a predefined schema. Let me think of a possible structure.

The function might look something like:

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    if spec_content is None:
        raise some error?
    # load schema
    schema = cls.get_schema()  # hypothetical method
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=spec_content, schema=schema)
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(str(e))
    return spec_content

But the exact implementation depends on how the schema is structured. However, the user hasn't provided that info. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check for certain keys directly.

Another possibility: the function is part of a class that has a list of required fields. For example, the class might have a class variable like REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2'].

Then, the code would check if all required fields are present in spec_content.

But again, without knowing the exact required fields, it's hard to code that. However, the user's context mentions that within the class, there's a validate_from_file method, which probably calls validate_from_content. So maybe validate_from_content is responsible for validating the content once it's loaded.

Another angle: the function's return is the data loaded from the spec. So maybe the spec_content is a string (YAML content), and the function first parses it into a dictionary, then validates it.

So, steps:

1. Parse spec_content (assuming it's a YAML string) into a Python dict.
2. Validate that dict against a schema.
3. Return the parsed dict if valid.

But how to parse YAML? The context says imported packages include 'infrared' and 'six', but maybe 'yaml' is also imported. Wait, the user said imported packages are os, jsonschema, six, infrared. So maybe the code uses the yaml module from infrared? Or perhaps it's using PyYAML.

Assuming that the spec_content is a YAML string, the code would need to parse it. However, the function's parameter is spec_content, which might already be parsed. But the function's name suggests that it's taking the content (maybe a string) and validating it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate the content after parsing. For example, if the content is a YAML string, the code would parse it first.

But the function's docstring says that it returns a dictionary with data loaded from the spec. So perhaps the function is responsible for parsing the YAML content into a dict and then validating it.

So, the code might look like:

import yaml

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("spec_content is required")
    try:
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML: {e}")
    # validate data
    # check required fields
    required_fields = ['field1', 'field2']  # example
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

But again, without knowing the exact required fields, this is speculative. However, the user's context mentions that the function is part of a class that has other validation methods. Also, the function is supposed to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing.

Another possibility is that the function uses a JSON schema defined in the class, and uses jsonschema to validate against it.

So, perhaps:

import jsonschema

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("No content provided")
    # Assume that the class has a schema
    schema = cls.SCHEMA  # hypothetical class variable
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=spec_content, schema=schema)
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(str(e))
    return spec_content

But again, without knowing the exact schema, this is a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check for certain keys. For example, if the spec must have a 'metadata' section with certain keys.

But given the limited information, perhaps the correct approach is to write code that parses the YAML content (if it's a string), validates against a schema (using jsonschema), and returns the parsed data.

But the user's context says that within the class, there's a validate_from_file method which probably calls validate_from_content. So maybe validate_from_content is called with the parsed content, not the raw YAML string.

In that case, the function would assume that spec_content is already a dictionary, and just validate it.

So, the code would check for required fields. For example:

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("No content provided")
    required_fields = cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS  # assuming a class variable
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in spec_content:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return spec_content

But again, without knowing what the required fields are, this is a guess.

However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the context provided. The context mentions that within the class, there are methods like validate_from_file and validate_from_content. The validate_from_content function is supposed to validate the spec content.

Given that the user's code is part of a class, perhaps the function is supposed to use a schema that's part of the class. For example, the class might have a schema attribute.

Putting it all together, the code might look like:

import jsonschema

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    """
    validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

    :param spec_content: content of spec file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data
    is missing in spec file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
    """
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("No spec content provided")
    # Assuming the class has a schema
    schema = cls.SCHEMA  # example
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=spec_content, schema=schema)
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(str(e))
    return spec_content

But again, this is speculative. However, given the information, this seems plausible. The code would use jsonschema to validate against a schema, which is presumably defined in the class.

Alternatively, if the spec_content is a YAML string that needs to be parsed first, then the code would parse it and then validate.

But the function's return is the data loaded from the spec, which suggests that parsing is part of this function.

So, integrating YAML parsing:

import yaml
import jsonschema

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    """
    validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

    :param spec_content: content of spec file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data
    is missing in spec file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
    """
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("No spec content provided")
    try:
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")
    # Validate data
    schema = cls.SCHEMA  # assuming class has a schema
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=data, schema=schema)
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(str(e))
    return data

But again, this depends on the class having a SCHEMA attribute. However, the user hasn't provided that info. But given the context, this seems like a possible approach.

In conclusion, the generated code would involve parsing the YAML content (if it's a string), validating against a schema (using jsonschema), and returning the parsed data. If the spec_content is already a dictionary, then parsing is skipped. The exact implementation depends on the class's structure, but based on the given info, this is a plausible approach.
