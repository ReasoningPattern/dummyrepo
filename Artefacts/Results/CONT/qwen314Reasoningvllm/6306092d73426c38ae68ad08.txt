Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the _get_conditionally_required_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is supposed to list arguments that have a required_when condition matched. 

First, I need to understand what the parameters are. The command_name is the name of the command, options_spec is the list of command spec options, and args are the received input arguments. The return value is a list of argument names that meet the required_when condition.

Looking at the context provided, there are several other methods mentioned, like self.resolve_custom_types, self.validate_min_max_args, etc. But the key here is to figure out how the required_when condition is checked. Since the function is part of a class, it's likely that the options_spec contains information about each argument's conditions.

I think the options_spec might be a list of dictionaries, each representing an option with possible keys like 'name', 'required_when', etc. The required_when could be a condition that depends on the presence of other arguments. For example, if an argument is required when another argument is present.

The args parameter is probably a dictionary of the received arguments. So, for each option in options_spec, we need to check if the required_when condition is met based on the args. If it is, then add the argument's name to the result list.

But how exactly to evaluate the required_when condition? The problem is that the required_when could be a string or some structure that needs evaluation. Maybe it's a key in the args, or a boolean condition. Without more context, I'll have to make an assumption here.

Assuming that required_when is a key that, if present in args, makes the argument required. Or perhaps it's a function or a condition that can be evaluated using the args. However, since the code is part of a larger system, maybe the required_when is a string that refers to another argument's presence. For example, if required_when is 'arg1', then the argument is required if 'arg1' is present in args.

So, the approach would be to iterate over each option in options_spec. For each option, check if it has a 'required_when' key. If it does, check if the condition is met by looking into the args. If the condition is met, then include the option's name in the result list.

But how to check the condition? If required_when is a string, maybe it's the name of another argument. So, if that argument is present in args, then the current argument is required. Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex condition, but without more info, this is a starting point.

So, the code would look something like:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in option:
            condition = option['required_when']
            # Check if the condition is met based on args
            if self._check_condition(condition, args):
                required_args.append(option['name'])
    return required_args

But then I need to implement _check_condition. However, since that's not part of the given function, maybe the condition is simply the presence of another argument. For example, if required_when is 'arg1', then check if 'arg1' is in args.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a boolean that's determined by some other logic. But given the limited context, I'll proceed with the assumption that required_when is the name of an argument that, if present, makes this argument required.

So, the _check_condition function could be checking if the condition (another argument's name) exists in args.

But since the code needs to be self-contained, perhaps the check is done directly. So, modifying the code:

for option in options_spec:
    if 'required_when' in option:
        condition_arg = option['required_when']
        if condition_arg in args:
            required_args.append(option['name'])

But this is just a guess. However, the problem is that the original code might have more complex conditions. But without more information, this is the best approach.

Another thing to consider: the options_spec might be structured differently. For example, each option might have a 'required_when' key that's a function or a lambda. But again, without knowing the actual structure, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the required_when is a list of arguments that need to be present. But again, not sure.

In the absence of more information, the code would have to make an assumption. So, the generated code would iterate through each option in options_spec, check for required_when, and if that condition is met (like the presence of another argument), add the name to the list.

Another possible consideration: the args might be a namespace object, so accessing args.arg_name. But if args is a dictionary, then checking if the key exists.

So, the code would be:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in option:
            condition = option['required_when']
            # Assuming condition is the name of an argument that must be present
            if condition in args:
                required_args.append(option['name'])
    return required_args

But this is a very simplistic approach. However, given the lack of context, this might be the best possible approach.

Another possibility is that required_when is a function that takes args and returns a boolean. But then, how is that function accessed? The code would need to call it, but without knowing how it's stored, it's hard to implement.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a string that represents a condition, like "arg1 and not arg2", and the code needs to evaluate that. But that would require parsing the string into a condition, which is more complex.

Given the time constraints and the lack of specific information, I'll proceed with the first approach, assuming that required_when is the name of another argument that must be present in args for this argument to be required.
