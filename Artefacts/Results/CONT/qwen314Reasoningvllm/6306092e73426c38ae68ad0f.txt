Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function get_nested_custom_and_control_args based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function splits input arguments into control, nested, and custom arguments. Control arguments affect IR behavior and aren't in the spec yml. Nested are for Ansible playbooks and go into the spec. Custom are alternative variables to nested.

So the function takes a list of args and returns two dictionaries: control_args and nested_args. Wait, the return is (dict, dict), but the docstring mentions custom arguments too. Hmm, maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args or handled separately? Wait, the return is (control_args, nested_args), but the custom are mentioned as a third category. Wait, maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to separate control, nested, and custom, but the return only includes control and nested. The docstring says the return is (control_args, nested_args), so maybe custom are part of nested? Or perhaps the custom arguments are handled in another way.

Looking back at the docstring: "Custom arguments: Custom ansible variables to be used instead of the normal nested usage." So maybe custom args are a subset of the nested args, but used in place of them. But the return is only two dicts. So perhaps the function separates control args (which are not in the spec) and the rest (nested and custom) into nested_args. Or maybe the custom args are part of the nested_args, but with some processing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control_args (which are control arguments), nested_args (which are the nested ones for the spec), and custom_args (which are custom variables). But the return is only two dicts. Wait, the return is (dict, dict): flat dicts (control_args, nested_args). So the custom arguments might not be part of the return, or maybe they are included in nested_args. The docstring might have a typo, but according to the return, it's only two dicts. So perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but processed differently.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split into control_args and then the rest into nested and custom. But the return is only two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but with some keys. Or perhaps the custom arguments are a separate category but not returned here. Wait, the function's name is get_nested_custom_and_control_args, which suggests that it's handling all three, but the return is two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are merged into the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to separate control_args, and then split the remaining into nested and custom. But the return is only two dicts. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to separate the arguments into control (which are not in the spec) and the rest (which are either nested or custom). But how to differentiate between nested and custom? Maybe the custom arguments are those that are marked as custom, perhaps by a certain prefix or a flag. For example, maybe arguments that start with a certain prefix, like 'custom_'.

Looking at the context given, the class has methods like resolve_custom_types, generate_answers_file, etc. Maybe the resolve_custom_types method is involved in identifying which arguments are custom. So perhaps the function uses some logic to determine which arguments are control, nested, or custom.

But without more specific information on how to distinguish them, I need to make assumptions. Let's think of possible ways to split the arguments.

Assuming that control arguments are those that start with a certain prefix, like 'control_', and custom arguments start with 'custom_'. Then, the rest are nested. But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the control arguments are those that are not supposed to be in the spec, so they are filtered out, and the rest are split into nested and custom based on some criteria.

But since the code is part of a larger class with methods like resolve_custom_types, perhaps that method is used to identify custom arguments.

So the steps for the function could be:

1. Iterate over the input args.
2. Separate control arguments (maybe those that are marked as control, perhaps via a certain key or prefix).
3. For the remaining arguments, determine which are nested and which are custom. Maybe custom arguments are those that are explicitly marked as custom, perhaps by a certain key or prefix.
4. Return the control_args and nested_args (with custom_args possibly merged into nested or handled separately).

But the return is (control_args, nested_args), so custom args might be part of the nested_args. Or maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combination of nested and custom args. However, the docstring says that custom args are used instead of the normal nested usage. So perhaps custom args are a subset of the nested args, but with different handling.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate control arguments, and then split the rest into nested and custom. But the return is only two dicts. So maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but with a specific key or something.

But without more specific code context, I need to make an educated guess. Let's proceed with the following approach:

- Assume that control arguments are those that are marked with a certain prefix, like 'control_'.
- Custom arguments are those marked with 'custom_'.
- The rest are considered nested.

But the function's return is (control_args, nested_args), so custom arguments might be excluded from the return, or perhaps they are part of the nested_args. Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are merged into the nested_args, but with some processing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to separate control arguments (which are not in the spec) and then split the remaining into nested and custom. But the return is two dicts, so maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but with a different structure.

Another possibility is that the function uses some internal logic, such as checking if the argument is a custom type, which is resolved by self.resolve_custom_types. So perhaps the code uses that method to determine which arguments are custom.

So here's a possible approach:

- Iterate through the arguments.
- For each argument, check if it's a control argument (maybe based on some criteria).
- Check if it's a custom argument using resolve_custom_types.
- The rest are nested.

But how to implement this? Let's think of code structure.

The function would process each argument in args. Maybe args is a dictionary. For each key in args:

- If it's a control argument, add to control_args.
- Else, check if it's a custom argument (using resolve_custom_types?), then add to custom_args.
- Else, add to nested_args.

But the return is only (control_args, nested_args). So maybe custom_args are merged into nested_args, or perhaps they are part of the nested_args with some modification.

Alternatively, the custom arguments are considered as part of the nested_args but with a different key, like 'custom_...' being stored under a different key in the nested_args.

But without more context, it's challenging. Let's proceed with a sample code that splits the arguments into control and non-control, then further splits non-control into nested and custom based on some criteria.

Assuming that control arguments are those that start with 'control_', and custom arguments start with 'custom_', then:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[key] = value
        elif key.startswith('custom_'):
            # Custom args are handled differently, maybe merged into nested?
            # Or perhaps they are part of nested_args with a different structure
            nested_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just a guess. However, the actual implementation might be more complex, involving checking the argument types or using the resolve_custom_types method.

Alternatively, the function might use the resolve_custom_types method to determine which arguments are custom. For example:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if self.is_control_arg(key):  # hypothetical method
            control_args[key] = value
        elif self.resolve_custom_types(key):  # assuming this returns True for custom args
            # handle custom args, maybe as part of nested?
            nested_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But again, without knowing the exact logic, this is speculative.

Another angle: the function's return is two dicts, and the docstring mentions that control arguments are not in the spec, while nested and custom are. So perhaps the nested and custom are both part of the spec, but custom are used instead of the normal nested ones. So maybe the function separates control, and then for the rest, determines if they are custom or nested. But the return is only two dicts, so perhaps the custom are part of the nested_args.

Alternatively, the function might return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom, but that's not clear.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the correct approach is to write code that separates control arguments (based on some criteria) and the rest as nested, with custom being part of the nested. But since the docstring mentions custom arguments, maybe the code needs to separate them, but the return only includes control and nested. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a dict that includes both nested and custom arguments, but the docstring's return description is incomplete. However, the user provided the exact return as (dict, dict): flat dicts (control_args, nested_args). So the custom arguments are not part of the return, which is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes both the normal nested and custom arguments. But how?

In the absence of more specific information, I'll proceed with the initial approach of splitting based on prefixes, assuming that control arguments are those starting with 'control_', and the rest are either nested or custom. But since the return is only two dicts, perhaps the custom arguments are merged into nested_args. So the code would be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this doesn't account for custom arguments. However, the docstring mentions that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage. So maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but with a different key or structure. For example, if a custom argument is identified, it's stored under a different key in nested_args.

Alternatively, perhaps the custom arguments are determined by the resolve_custom_types method. For example:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if self.is_control_arg(key):  # hypothetical method
            control_args[key] = value
        elif self.resolve_custom_types(key):
            # Handle custom args, maybe as part of nested
            nested_args[f'custom_{key}'] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But again, without knowing the exact implementation of resolve_custom_types, this is guesswork.

Given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to write code that separates control arguments (assuming they have a certain prefix) and the rest as nested, even if it doesn't fully address custom arguments. However, since the function's name includes 'custom', it's likely that the code must handle them. Perhaps the function is supposed to split into control, nested, and custom, but the return is only two dicts. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a dict that contains both nested and custom arguments. But the docstring says the return is (control_args, nested_args). So perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. Therefore, the code would process the args into control and the rest, and the rest are considered as nested, including custom. But how to differentiate between nested and custom in that case?

Perhaps the custom arguments are identified by a certain key in the args, like 'custom_...', and the code would split them into a separate dict, but the return only includes control and nested. This is unclear.

Given the time constraints and the need to produce code, I'll proceed with the initial approach, assuming that control arguments are those with a specific prefix, and the rest are considered as nested, even if it doesn't fully account for custom arguments. Alternatively, perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, and the function's name is misleading. But the user provided the function signature and docstring, so I need to follow that.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to separate the arguments into control, nested, and custom, but the return is only two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are merged into the nested_args. So the code would process all non-control arguments into nested_args, and custom arguments are part of that. But how to differentiate them? Maybe the custom arguments are those that are not in the spec, but the docstring says they are used instead of the normal nested usage. This is confusing.

At this point, I think the best approach is to write code that separates control arguments (based on a prefix) and the rest into nested_args, even if it doesn't fully address the custom part. The user might have intended that the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, and the function's return includes them. Therefore, the code would look like this:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this doesn't account for custom arguments. However, the docstring might have a typo, or perhaps the function's name is incorrect. Alternatively, the custom arguments are handled elsewhere, and this function only splits into control and nested.

Given that the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the context includes methods like resolve_custom_types, maybe the code uses that method to determine custom arguments. For example:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if self.is_control_arg(key):
            control_args[key] = value
        elif self.resolve_custom_types(key):
            # Custom args are handled differently, maybe stored in nested_args with a prefix
            nested_args[f'custom_{key}'] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But again, without knowing what is_control_arg does, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the function may use the presence of certain keys or values to determine the categories. Since the user hasn't provided the exact logic, I'll proceed with the first approach, assuming that control arguments are those with a 'control_' prefix, and the rest are nested, even if it doesn't fully address the custom part. The user might have intended that the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, and this function's purpose is to split control from the rest, which includes both nested and custom.
