Okay, I need to write a Python function called gaussian that takes an input x and computes the Gaussian function centered at mu=0.2 with sigma=0.1. Let me think about the formula for a Gaussian distribution. The standard formula is (1/(sigma * sqrt(2*pi))) * exp(- (x - mu)^2 / (2*sigma^2)). 

So, the parameters here are mu=0.2 and sigma=0.1. The function should calculate this for the given x. Since the user mentioned that numpy is imported as np, I can use np.sqrt and np.exp for the calculations. 

Wait, but what about the input x? Is it a single value or an array? The function probably expects x to be a numpy array or a scalar. Using numpy functions will handle both cases, so that's good.

Let me structure the code. The function will compute the exponent part first: -(x - 0.2)**2 / (2*(0.1)**2). Then multiply by the coefficient 1/(0.1 * sqrt(2*pi)). 

Wait, let me check the denominator in the exponent. The variance is sigma squared, so 0.1 squared is 0.01. So the exponent is -(x - 0.2)^2 / (2 * 0.01) which simplifies to -(x - 0.2)^2 / 0.02. 

Calculating the coefficient: 1 divided by (0.1 * sqrt(2 * pi)). Let me compute that. Let's see, 2*pi is about 6.283, sqrt of that is around 2.5066. So 0.1 * 2.5066 is 0.25066. Then 1 / 0.25066 is approximately 3.989. But I should use numpy's pi and sqrt functions to keep it precise.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def gaussian(x):
    mu = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))
    exponent = - (x - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2)
    return coefficient * np.exp(exponent)

Wait, but the user's docstring says "Calculate Gaussian centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1." So that's correct. I should make sure that the variables are correctly named. Also, using np.exp and np.sqrt is necessary here. 

I think that's all. Let me check for possible errors. If x is a numpy array, this should work element-wise. If x is a scalar, it should still compute correctly. The function returns the Gaussian value(s) as expected. Yeah, that should do it.
