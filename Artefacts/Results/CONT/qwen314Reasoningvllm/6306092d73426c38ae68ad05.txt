Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_option_spec method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method should do.

The docstring says that it gets the specification for a specified option name. It mentions using self.get_parser_option_specs() to get options of the given command_name. So, the method probably needs to retrieve the parser's option specs for the command, then find the specific argument_name within those specs.

First, I should call self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name) to get the options for that command. Then, look up the argument_name in that dictionary. But wait, maybe there's a need to handle cases where the argument isn't found? The docstring doesn't mention error handling, so maybe just return None or the value directly.

Wait, the method is supposed to return the specification. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Get the parser options for the command_name using get_parser_option_specs.
2. Check if the argument_name exists in that options dictionary.
3. Return the corresponding value if it exists, otherwise maybe return None or raise an error?

The original code might have a default return, but since the user hasn't provided existing code, I need to infer. The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the method returns the value from the options dict, or None if not found.

So the code would be something like:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    return options.get(argument_name)

But wait, the docstring mentions that get_parser_option_specs is a method that returns the options. So, the code would call that method, then retrieve the argument_name from the resulting dictionary.

I should make sure that the method is correctly using the get_parser_option_specs method. Also, considering possible errors, but since the user hasn't specified, the code is straightforward.

So the final code would be as simple as that. Let me write it.
