Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_key function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what's required here.

The function is supposed to validate a key against a regular expression. From the context provided, there's a mention of _label_key_pattern, _label_key_regex, and other similar variables. So probably, the validation is done using a regex that's already defined elsewhere.

Looking at the imported packages, 're' is included, which is the regular expressions module. So the function will likely use re.match or re.fullmatch to check if the key conforms to the pattern.

The function's name is validate_key, and it takes a 'key' parameter. The docstring says it validates against the corresponding regex. The context mentions _label_key_pattern and _label_key_regex. Maybe _label_key_regex is the compiled regex pattern.

So the code would use re.fullmatch (or match, depending on whether the pattern includes anchors) to check if the key matches the regex. If it doesn't, it should raise a ValueError or some exception.

Wait, the user didn't specify the exact regex pattern, but the variables _label_key_pattern and _label_key_regex are present. So the code probably uses _label_key_regex to validate the key.

So the function would look something like:

def validate_key(key):
    """
    Validate the given key against the corresponding regular expression.
    """
    if not _label_key_regex.fullmatch(key):
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid key: {key}")

But I need to make sure that the regex is correctly applied. Also, maybe the regex is defined as a compiled pattern. So the code would check if the key matches the regex, and if not, raise an error.

I think that's the general approach. The exact error message might vary, but the core logic is using the predefined regex to validate the key.
