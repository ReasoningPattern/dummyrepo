Okay, I need to write a Python function called _legacy_mergeOrderings that takes a list of orderings and combines them into a single list without duplicates, preserving the order of first occurrence. Let me think about how to approach this.

So, the input is multiple lists. For example, if orderings is [[a, b], [b, c], [c, a]], the merged list should be [a, b, c], right? Because a comes first in the first list, then b in the first list, then c in the second list. But wait, the first list has a and b. The second list has b again, but we need to skip duplicates. So the merged list should have elements in the order they first appear across all the lists.

The challenge is to maintain the order of first occurrence. So, I need to iterate through each list in order, and for each element in the list, add it to the result list only if it hasn't been added before.

How to do that? Maybe create a set to keep track of elements we've already added. Then, for each list in orderings, loop through each element. If the element is not in the set, add it to the result list and the set. Otherwise, skip it.

Yes, that makes sense. So the steps are:

Initialize an empty list for the result and an empty set for tracking seen elements.

Loop through each list in the orderings:

   For each element in the current list:

      If the element is not in the seen set:

          Add it to the result list

          Add it to the seen set

So, the code would look something like:

def _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings):
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for lst in orderings:
        for item in lst:
            if item not in seen:
                seen.add(item)
                result.append(item)
    return result

Wait, but what about the order of the lists? The problem says "in the sequence of occurrence", so the order of the lists in orderings matters. For example, if the first list has [b, a], and the second has [a, c], then the merged list would be [b, a, c], since a is first encountered in the first list.

Yes, the code above handles that because it processes the lists in the order given, and within each list, processes elements in their order.

So that should work. Let me test with some examples.

Test case 1: orderings = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]] → result [1,2,3,4]

Test case 2: orderings = [[2,1], [1,3], [3,2]] → result [2,1,3]

Yes. The code would process each list in order, adding elements as they first appear.

So the code seems correct. Now, I need to write this in Python, making sure that the function is properly defined with the given name and docstring.

The docstring says "Combine multiple lists in the sequence of occurrence into a list with no duplicate elements." Which matches the code's behavior.

I think that's all. The code should be straightforward.
