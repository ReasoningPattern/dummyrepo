Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function check_digests_present_and_used based on the given signature and docstring. The context provided includes a list of imported packages (re and digest) and various methods and attributes within the class.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it checks if all digests in the manifest that are needed are present and used, and returns an error if there's an issue. So, the function probably needs to verify that each digest in the manifest_files is present in digests_used, or vice versa, depending on the logic.

Looking at the context, there's a self.digest_regex which might be a regex pattern to validate digests. Also, methods like self.error are available to return errors. The function parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. 

I need to loop through each manifest file and check if their digests are present in digests_used. If a digest is missing, an error should be raised. Also, maybe check if there are digests in digests_used that aren't in the manifest, but the docstring mentions "needed" so perhaps only checking that all required digests are present.

Wait, the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So maybe the manifest_files contain the required digests, and we need to ensure they are present in digests_used. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. But the function's name suggests that the digests in the manifest should be present and used.

So, for each digest in manifest_files, check if it's in digests_used. If not, call self.error. Also, maybe validate the format of the digests using self.digest_regex.

But how are manifest_files structured? Are they a list of files, each with a digest? Or is manifest_files a dictionary mapping files to digests? The variable name is a bit unclear. Assuming that manifest_files is a collection of digests that need to be checked against digests_used.

Alternatively, maybe manifest_files is a list of file paths, and each file has a digest that needs to be checked. But without more context, it's a bit tricky. However, looking at the context, there's a self.validate_manifest method, which might process the manifest files. Also, there's a self.validate_fixity method that takes fixity and manifest_files. Maybe manifest_files is a list of digests or something similar.

Assuming that manifest_files contains the digests that are supposed to be used, and digests_used is a set or a collection of digests that are actually used. The function needs to check that all digests in manifest_files are present in digests_used. If any are missing, an error is raised.

So, the code would iterate over each digest in manifest_files, check if it's in digests_used. If not, call self.error with an appropriate code. Also, maybe check if the digest matches the regex pattern from self.digest_regex.

Wait, the context mentions self.digest_regex(self), which might be a method that returns the regex pattern. So, perhaps the code should validate each digest against that regex first. If a digest doesn't match the regex, that's an error too.

Putting this together, the steps would be:

1. For each digest in manifest_files:
   a. Check if it matches the digest regex. If not, error.
   b. Check if it's present in digests_used. If not, error.

But wait, the function's name is check_digests_present_and_used. So maybe the manifest_files are the ones that need to have their digests present in digests_used. So, for each digest in manifest_files, ensure it's in digests_used. Also, maybe check that all digests in digests_used are accounted for in the manifest, but the docstring says "needed are present and used," which might imply that the manifest's digests are the ones that need to be present in digests_used.

Alternatively, maybe the function is ensuring that all digests that are supposed to be used (digests_used) are present in the manifest_files. But the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Another angle: the function is part of a validation process. The manifest_files could be the list of files in the manifest, each with their digests. The digests_used could be the set of digests that are actually used in the system. The function needs to ensure that all digests in the manifest are present in digests_used. If any are missing, that's an error.

So, code steps:

Loop through each item in manifest_files. For each, get the digest. Check if it's in digests_used. If not, error. Also check digest format with regex.

But how to get the digest from manifest_files? If manifest_files is a list of file objects or paths, perhaps each has a 'digest' attribute or a method to get it. But without knowing the structure, this is guesswork. However, given that the user provided the context, perhaps manifest_files is a list of digests, or a structure where each entry has a digest.

Alternatively, maybe manifest_files is a list of file paths, and the digests are extracted from them. But again, without more info, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check that all digests that are present in the manifest (manifest_files) are also present in digests_used. So, for example, if manifest_files is a list of digests, then check each against digests_used.

Assuming that manifest_files is a list of digests, then:

for digest in manifest_files:
    if not self.digest_regex.match(digest):
        self.error(...)
    if digest not in digests_used:
        self.error(...)

But the exact error codes and messages are not specified, so using placeholders.

But the user's code example has self.error(), which probably is a method that raises an error with a code. So, in the code, when a problem is found, call self.error with an appropriate code.

Putting this into code:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    """
    Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class.
    """
    for digest in manifest_files:
        if not self.digest_regex.match(digest):
            self.error('digest_format_invalid')
        if digest not in digests_used:
            self.error('digest_missing_in_used')

But wait, maybe manifest_files is not a list of digests but a list of file objects. For example, if each file has a 'digest' attribute, then:

for file in manifest_files:
    digest = file.digest
    ...

But without knowing the structure, this is speculative. However, given the context, there's a self.validate_manifest method, which might process the manifest files. Also, the function's name suggests that the digests in the manifest (manifest_files) need to be checked against digests_used.

Another possibility: manifest_files is a dictionary where keys are file paths and values are digests. Then, iterate over the values.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, given that the user provided the context, perhaps the code can be written assuming that manifest_files is an iterable of digests.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files. But the docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So the manifest's digests are the ones that need to be present in digests_used.

So, the code would check for each digest in manifest_files that it is present in digests_used.

So, the code would be:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    """
    Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class.
    """
    for digest in manifest_files:
        if not self.digest_regex.match(digest):
            self.error('digest_format_invalid')
        if digest not in digests_used:
            self.error('digest_not_used')

But again, the exact error codes are not specified, so placeholders are used.

Also, perhaps the function should check that all digests in digests_used are present in manifest_files, but the docstring says "needed are present and used," implying that the manifest's digests are the ones that need to be present in digests_used. So the code would check that each digest in manifest_files is in digests_used.

So the code would be as above.

Another thing: the function is part of a class, and the user mentioned that self.digest_regex is a method. So, perhaps self.digest_regex() returns the regex pattern. So, the code would call self.digest_regex() to get the regex, then use it to match the digest.

So, the code would be:

import re

class SomeClass:
    def digest_regex(self):
        # Assume this returns a compiled regex pattern
        pass

    def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
        """
        Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class.
        """
        regex = self.digest_regex()
        for digest in manifest_files:
            if not regex.match(digest):
                self.error('digest_format_invalid')
            if digest not in digests_used:
                self.error('digest_missing_in_used')

But the user's context says that the imported packages are re and digest. Wait, 'digest' is not a standard Python package. Maybe it's a typo or a custom module. But assuming that the code uses re for regex and digest for something else, but in this function, the regex is handled via self.digest_regex().

So, the code would be as above, but with the actual implementation of digest_regex.

But since the user didn't provide the exact implementation of digest_regex, the code would use it as a method.

So, the final code would be as follows, with the for loop checking each digest in manifest_files against the regex and presence in digests_used.
