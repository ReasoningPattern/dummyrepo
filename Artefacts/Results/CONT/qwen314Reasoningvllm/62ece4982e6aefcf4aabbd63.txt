Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_none_string that checks if a given value is a string that represents 'none'. Let me think about the requirements.

The function's docstring says it should return True if the type of val is a string and its lowercase version equals 'none'. So first, I need to check if the input is an instance of str. Then, convert it to lowercase and compare to 'none'.

Wait, what about different cases? Like 'None', 'NONE', etc. The lowercase check should handle that. So, the steps are: check if val is a string, then check if val.lower() == 'none'.

So the code would be something like:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

Wait, but what about if val is not a string? Then isinstance returns False, so the whole expression is False. That's correct according to the docstring.

Testing some examples: if val is 'none', returns True. If val is 'None', lower becomes 'none', so True. If val is 'nOne', same result. If val is a number, like 5, then isinstance returns False. If val is a string but 'NoneValue', then lower is 'nonevalue' which isn't 'none', so False.

That seems to cover all cases. So the code should be straightforward. No need for any imports since it's using built-in functions. The parameters are correctly typed as 'any' and return a bool. Looks good.
