Okay, I need to generate the popitem method for a class that's using the cachetools library. The function's docstring says it should remove and return the most recently used (key, value) pair. 

First, I remember that in caching implementations, especially with LRU or MRU strategies, the popitem method often deals with removing the least or most recently used items. Since the docstring mentions "most recently used," maybe this is an MRU cache. But wait, the standard Python OrderedDict has a move_to_end method and popitem that can be last or first. However, the user mentioned the cachetools package, which is a third-party library for caching.

Looking at the context provided, the class has methods like __init__, pop, popitem, __update, __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, and __order. The __order might be a data structure keeping track of the order of keys, perhaps a linked list or something similar. The cachetools library's LRUCache might have similar methods.

Wait, the user's function is called popitem, which in some contexts removes the least recently used item. But the docstring here says "most recently used." That's a bit conflicting. Maybe the cache is using an MRU strategy instead of LRU. So, when you popitem, you remove the most recently used item. 

In the case of cachetools, the LRUCache's popitem method removes the least recently used item. But if this is an MRU cache, then the popitem would remove the most recently used. However, the user's code might be a custom implementation. 

Looking at the context, the class has a __order attribute. Maybe that's a deque or a linked list that keeps track of the order. For MRU, the most recently used would be at the end of the deque. So, when popping, we remove the last element. 

But how to implement this? Let's think about the steps. The popitem method needs to remove the most recently used item. So, if __order is a deque, the last element is the most recent. We can pop that, then remove the key from the cache, and return the key-value pair.

Wait, but the __order might be a list or another structure. Also, the __setitem__ method might be adding items to the end of __order when they're accessed. So, when you popitem, you take the last element from __order, delete it from the cache, and return it.

But how to handle the actual storage? The class might have a dictionary (like self._cache) that stores the key-value pairs. So, the popitem would get the last key from __order, delete it from the dictionary, and return the pair.

But the user's code might be using a different structure. Since the user mentioned that the class has a __init__ with maxsize, getsizeof, and methods like __update, which might be updating the order.

Alternatively, maybe the __order is a linked list, and the popitem removes the tail (most recently used). 

Putting this together, the popitem method would:

1. Check if the cache is empty. If so, raise KeyError.
2. Get the most recently used key from __order (maybe the last element).
3. Remove that key from the cache (self._cache).
4. Remove the key from __order.
5. Return the (key, value) pair.

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct attributes. Since the user's context includes self.__order, perhaps that's a list or deque. For example, if __order is a deque, then:

key = self.__order.pop()
value = self._cache.pop(key)
return key, value

But I need to make sure that __order is properly maintained. Also, the __setitem__ might be adding to the end of __order when the item is accessed. 

But the user's code might have a specific structure. Since the user hasn't provided the full code, I have to make assumptions based on the context.

Another thing to consider: in the cachetools library, the LRUCache's popitem method removes the least recently used item. If the user's code is a custom MRU cache, then the popitem would be different. 

So, putting it all together, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError('cache is empty')
    key = self.__order.pop()
    value = self._cache.pop(key)
    return key, value

But I need to make sure that __order is a structure that allows popping from the end. If __order is a deque, then pop() would get the rightmost element. If it's a list, then pop() from the end is O(1).

But the user's code might have __order as a list, and when items are accessed, they are moved to the end. So, the last element is the most recently used. Therefore, popping the last element would be correct.

So the code would look like that. Also, need to handle the case when the cache is empty, raising KeyError as per the standard.

I think that's the correct approach here.
