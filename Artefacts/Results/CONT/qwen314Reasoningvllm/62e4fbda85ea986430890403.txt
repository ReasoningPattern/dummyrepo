Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _shuffled function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to shuffle a sequence of strings using a fixed random seed. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a Sequence[str] as input and returns a list[str]. The key here is that the shuffle must be deterministic, which means using a fixed seed. The FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is mentioned in the context, so I should use that.

In Python, the random module's shuffle function can shuffle a list in place. But to make it deterministic, I need to set the seed before shuffling. However, the function is supposed to return a new list, not modify the original. So maybe I should create a copy of the input sequence first.

Wait, the input is a Sequence, which could be something like a list or a tuple. So I'll need to convert it to a list to shuffle. Then, I'll set the random seed using FIXED_RANDOM_SEED, shuffle the list, and return it.

But wait, the function's name is _shuffled, which suggests it returns a new shuffled list. So the steps would be:

1. Convert the input sequence to a list (since sequences can be immutable, like tuples).
2. Create a copy to avoid modifying the original.
3. Set the random seed with FIXED_RANDOM_SEED.
4. Shuffle the copied list.
5. Return the shuffled list.

Wait, but the seed is fixed, so every time this function is called, it will produce the same shuffled order. That makes sense for deterministic testing or reproducible results.

So the code would look something like:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    seq_list = list(seq)
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    random.shuffle(seq_list)
    return seq_list

But wait, the context mentions that FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is defined elsewhere. So I don't need to define it here. Also, the imports: the user mentioned that the imported packages include 'random', so that's already handled.

But the function is inside a module that has FIXED_RANDOM_SEED defined. So the code should reference that variable.

I think that's all. The function converts the sequence to a list, seeds the random number generator with the fixed seed, shuffles the list, and returns it. That should meet the requirements.
