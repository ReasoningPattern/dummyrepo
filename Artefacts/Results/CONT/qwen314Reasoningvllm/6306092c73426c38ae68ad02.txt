Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_arg_deprecation method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method should do.

The method's purpose is to validate and print deprecated arguments from both CLI and answer file arguments. The parameters are cli_args and answer_file_args, which are dictionaries. 

First, I should check if there are any deprecated arguments. The context mentions a method called get_deprecated_args, which probably returns a list or set of deprecated argument names. So maybe I need to call self.get_deprecated_args() to get those names.

Once I have the deprecated arguments, I need to check if they exist in either cli_args or answer_file_args. For each deprecated arg, if it's present in either dict, I should log a message. The context mentions a LOG variable, so I'll use that to log warnings.

Wait, the docstring says "prints the deprecated arguments," but in the context, there's a LOG variable. Maybe the logging is done via LOG.warning or similar. So for each deprecated argument found in cli_args or answer_file_args, I should log a warning message indicating that the argument is deprecated.

Also, the method might need to check both cli_args and answer_file_args. So loop through each deprecated argument, check if it's in cli_args or answer_file_args. If yes, log the message.

But how to structure this? Let me outline steps:

1. Retrieve the list of deprecated arguments using self.get_deprecated_args().
2. Iterate over each deprecated argument.
3. For each, check if it exists in cli_args or answer_file_args.
4. If found, log a warning message.

But wait, maybe the get_deprecated_args method returns a list of args that are deprecated. So for each arg in that list, check presence in either dict.

So the code could look like:

deprecated_args = self.get_deprecated_args()

for arg in deprecated_args:
    if arg in cli_args or arg in answer_file_args:
        LOG.warning(f"Deprecated argument '{arg}' found in CLI or answer file.")

But maybe the method needs to handle more complex cases, like checking if the argument is present in either source. Also, perhaps the answer_file_args are processed differently, but the function parameters suggest they are passed as is.

I should make sure to use the LOG variable as mentioned in the context. Also, the method is part of a class, so self is used.

I need to make sure that the code doesn't have any syntax errors. Also, the function is supposed to validate and print, so the logging is the way to "print" the deprecation warnings.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def validate_arg_deprecation(self, cli_args, answer_file_args):
    deprecated_args = self.get_deprecated_args()
    for arg in deprecated_args:
        if arg in cli_args or arg in answer_file_args:
            LOG.warning(f"Deprecated argument '{arg}' found in CLI or answer file.")

But wait, the context shows that there's a method called validate_arg_deprecation, and within the class, there's a reference to self.get_deprecated_args. So the get_deprecated_args method is likely returning the list of deprecated arguments.

This seems straightforward. I think that's the correct approach. Let me check if there's any other context that might affect this. The imported packages include 'collections', 'six', 'infrared', but I don't think that affects this method. The LOG is presumably a logger instance.

So the generated code should be as above.
