Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _reset_logging method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method should do.

The docstring says it's to reset the logging system. So, probably, it's going to reconfigure the logging module. The logging module in Python can be reset by removing all handlers and then re-adding them, or maybe by reinitializing the root logger.

First, I should import the logging module. Wait, the context says that the imported packages include logging, so that's already handled. The method is a class method, as indicated by the 'cls' parameter. So, it's probably part of a class that manages logging.

To reset logging, common steps are:

1. Get the root logger.
2. Remove all existing handlers from it.
3. Possibly set the logging level again.
4. Add new handlers if necessary, but maybe the reset is just about clearing existing configurations.

But the exact implementation depends on what the class expects. Since the method is named _reset_logging, it might be part of a class that sets up logging in some way. The method might be called when the logging configuration needs to be reset, perhaps to avoid duplicate handlers or to change settings.

So, the code could look like this:

- Access the root logger using logging.getLogger().
- Remove all handlers from the root logger.
- Maybe set the level back to a default, like NOTSET or DEBUG.

Wait, but sometimes when you remove handlers, you might want to add new ones. However, the method's purpose is to reset, so maybe it's just about clearing existing configurations. Alternatively, the class might have its own handlers that it adds again after resetting.

But since the docstring is very brief, I need to make an educated guess. The standard way to reset logging is to remove all handlers and then reconfigure. However, without knowing the specific setup of the class, I'll assume that the reset involves clearing the current handlers and possibly resetting the level.

So, the code inside the method would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    root_logger = logging.getLogger()
    for handler in root_logger.handlers[:]:
        root_logger.removeHandler(handler)
    root_logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)

Wait, but why logging.NOTSET? Maybe the class has a specific level it wants to set. Alternatively, maybe it's better to set it to a default level like WARNING or INFO. However, without more context, using NOTSET is a common approach because it allows child loggers to have their own levels.

Alternatively, maybe the original setup sets a certain level, and resetting would revert to that. But since the method is part of a class, perhaps the class has a configuration that's being reset. However, without more info, I'll proceed with removing handlers and resetting the level to NOTSET.

Another thing: the method is a class method, but in Python, class methods are defined with @classmethod. However, the given function signature doesn't have that decorator. Wait, the user provided the function signature as def _reset_logging(cls):, which implies it's a class method. So, the code should include the @classmethod decorator.

Wait, the user's code has the function signature as def _reset_logging(cls):, but in Python, that would be a method that takes the class as the first argument. However, unless it's a class method, which requires the @classmethod decorator. But the user didn't include that in the function signature. Hmm, maybe it's a static method or just a regular method. But given that the first parameter is 'cls', it's likely intended to be a class method. However, the user's code may not have the decorator. But the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature. So, if the user provided the function signature without the @classmethod decorator, then the generated code should not include it. But that would be a problem because in Python, a method with 'cls' as the first parameter without the decorator is not a class method. However, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to follow their given signature.

Wait, the user provided the function signature as:

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    

So, the code they want is a function that takes 'cls' as the first parameter. But in Python, that would be a class method, which requires the @classmethod decorator. However, the user's code may not have that. But maybe the method is part of a class and is intended to be a class method. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition. So, perhaps the generated code should just have the function as written, without the decorator. But that would be a regular method, which would require an instance. However, given the context, perhaps the method is intended to be a class method. But the user hasn't included the decorator. So, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the given signature.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code should be exactly as per the signature. Therefore, the generated code will have the function as written, without the @classmethod decorator. However, that would be a regular method, which would take 'cls' as the first argument, which is not standard. But perhaps in the context of the class, it's being used as a class method without the decorator. That's possible if the method is called via the class, but in Python, that's not the standard way. However, the user's code may have other mechanisms, so I'll proceed as per the given function signature.

So, the code inside the function would be to reset the logging. The steps I thought of earlier: remove all handlers from the root logger and reset the level.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    root_logger = logging.getLogger()
    for handler in root_logger.handlers[:]:
        root_logger.removeHandler(handler)
    root_logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)

But wait, the logging module's root logger's level is usually set once. Resetting it to NOTSET might be necessary if the class is managing the logging configuration. However, this is a common approach.

Another thing to consider: sometimes, when you remove handlers, you might want to close them, but the code above just removes them. Also, the logging module's configuration might have other aspects, like formatters, but the method's purpose is to reset, so perhaps that's beyond the scope here.

Therefore, the generated code should be as above.
