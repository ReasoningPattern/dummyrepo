Okay, I need to generate Python code for the load_configurations function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function should do.

The function takes config_filenames, which is a sequence of filenames. It also has optional overrides and resolve_env parameters. The goal is to load and validate each config file. If there's an error reading or parsing, log it. Then return a tuple: a dict mapping filenames to parsed configs, and a list of LogRecord instances for errors.

First, I'll need to import logging. The function uses logging.LogRecord, so that's already in the imported packages.

I'll start by initializing the result dictionary and the errors list. Then, iterate over each filename in config_filenames.

For each file, I need to try to open and read it. But how to parse the configuration? The problem doesn't specify the format, but common ones are JSON, YAML, etc. Since the user didn't specify, maybe assume it's JSON? Or maybe use a generic approach. Wait, the docstring mentions parsing errors, so perhaps the function is supposed to parse the file as a configuration, maybe using something like configparser for INI files, or json.load for JSON.

But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the actual parsing is handled by another function. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature. So perhaps the code should include the parsing logic. But the user hasn't provided details. Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to read the file, parse it (maybe using json or yaml), and handle exceptions.

Wait, the user's context says imported packages include logging. So the code will need to handle exceptions when reading the file, like FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and parsing errors like JSONDecodeError.

So for each filename:

- Try to open the file. If there's a permission error or file not found, log that as an error.
- Read the content, then parse it. If parsing fails (like JSON decode error), log that.
- If successful, add the parsed config to the result dict.

But how to parse the config? Let's assume that the configuration files are in JSON format. So using json.load. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use a generic method. But without more info, I'll proceed with JSON.

So, inside the loop:

Try to open the file. Use with open(..., 'r') as f: to read.

Then, parse the content. For JSON, json.load(f).

But what about the overrides? The overrides parameter is a dict. Maybe the overrides are used to update the configuration. For example, if a key exists in overrides, it replaces the value in the config. So after parsing, merge the overrides into the config.

Wait, the function's parameters include overrides=None. So perhaps after parsing the config, apply the overrides. So for each config, do something like config.update(overrides) if overrides is not None.

But the docstring says "overrides" is a parameter. So the function should merge the overrides into each configuration. But how? Maybe the overrides are applied after loading the config file. So for each config, after parsing, we do config = {**config, **overrides} or similar.

But the order might matter. If the overrides are supposed to take precedence, then yes.

But the problem says that the function's purpose is to load and validate each configuration file. The overrides might be for overriding certain values in the config. So the code should merge the overrides into the parsed config.

So, inside the loop, after parsing the config, if overrides is not None, then update the config with the overrides.

But how to handle that? For example, if the config is a dict, then config.update(overrides) would do that. But if the config is a different structure, maybe not. However, the problem doesn't specify, so assuming that the config is a dictionary.

Now, handling errors. For each file, if there's an error during reading or parsing, create a LogRecord. How to create a LogRecord? Well, the logging module's LogRecord is created when a logger logs a message. But to create a LogRecord instance directly, perhaps using logging.makeRecord, but that's a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to collect the errors as LogRecord instances, which would be generated when logging occurs. However, that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to capture the exceptions and create LogRecord instances manually. But how?

Wait, the docstring says that the errors are recorded in the error log. So perhaps the function logs the errors using the logging module, and then collects those LogRecord instances. However, capturing LogRecord instances is not straightforward because they are generated when a log message is emitted. So maybe the function is supposed to create LogRecord instances manually, perhaps using the logging module's functions.

Alternatively, maybe the errors are logged, and the function returns the LogRecord instances that were generated. But how to capture them? That's tricky. Perhaps the function is supposed to create LogRecord instances directly, without actually logging them. But that seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to collect the exceptions as LogRecord instances. For example, when an exception occurs, create a LogRecord with the exception's message and details.

But this is unclear. However, given the docstring says that the error log will be recorded, and the function returns the LogRecord instances, perhaps the code should generate LogRecord instances for each error.

But how to do that? Let me think. The LogRecord has attributes like name, level, message, etc. So perhaps, for each error, create a LogRecord with the appropriate details.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to log the errors using the logging module, and then collect those LogRecord instances. However, in practice, that would require accessing the logging system's internal records, which isn't straightforward.

This is a problem. The user's docstring says that the error log will be recorded, and the function returns the LogRecord instances. But how to collect them?

Maybe the user expects that the function uses the logging module to log the errors, and then the LogRecord instances are collected somehow. However, without a logger instance, this is not possible. So perhaps the function should create a logger, log the errors, and then somehow capture those records. But that's not feasible in a normal function.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate LogRecord instances manually. For example, when an error occurs, create a LogRecord with the message and level.

But how to do that? The LogRecord class is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, you use the logging module's functions. However, perhaps the user expects that the code creates a LogRecord instance with the appropriate details.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring, and the function is supposed to return the exception messages or something else, but the docstring says LogRecord instances. This is a bit of a problem.

But given the user's instruction, I need to proceed. Let's assume that the code is supposed to create LogRecord instances for each error. For example, when a file can't be read, create a LogRecord with level=logging.ERROR, message indicating the error.

But how to create a LogRecord? The logging module has a makeRecord function. Let's see:

import logging

record = logging.makeRecord('mylogger', logging.ERROR, 'message', ... )

But to create a LogRecord, you need to know the logger name, level, message, etc. So perhaps for each error, create a LogRecord with the logger name as 'config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, message as the error message.

But this is a bit of a stretch, but perhaps that's what the user expects.

So, in the code, when an error occurs, create a LogRecord instance with the appropriate details and add it to the errors list.

So, putting it all together:

Initialize the result dict and errors list.

For each filename in config_filenames:

    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        config = parse_config(content)  # Assuming a function to parse the content
        if overrides:
            config.update(overrides)
        result[filename] = config
    except (IOError, PermissionError, etc.) as e:
        # Create LogRecord for this error
        log_record = logging.makeRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, ..., ...)
        errors.append(log_record)
    except Exception as e:
        # parsing error
        log_record = ...
        errors.append(log_record)

But the problem is that the code needs to parse the configuration. Since the user hasn't specified the format, perhaps the function is supposed to use a generic method. However, without knowing the format, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the ConfigParser module for INI files. But again, the user hasn't specified.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the file as a JSON object. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So, inside the try block:

import json

content = f.read()
config = json.loads(content)

But then, if there's a JSON decoding error, that would be caught in the except clause.

So, the code would be:

import logging
import json

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    result = {}
    errors = []
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
            config = json.loads(content)
            if overrides:
                config.update(overrides)
            result[filename] = config
        except (IOError, PermissionError) as e:
            # Log the error
            log_record = logging.makeRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, None, None, str(e), None, None, {})
            errors.append(log_record)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            log_record = logging.makeRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, None, None, f"JSON decode error in {filename}: {e}", None, None, {})
            errors.append(log_record)
        except Exception as e:
            log_record = logging.makeRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, None, None, f"Unexpected error loading {filename}: {e}", None, None, {})
            errors.append(log_record)
    return result, errors

But wait, the logging.makeRecord function requires several parameters. The parameters are:

makeRecord(self, name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func, sinfo)

But in the code above, I'm passing some placeholders. For example, the 'fn' is the filename, but in the code above, I have None. This might not be correct, but given that the user's docstring says to return LogRecord instances, perhaps this is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the errors are logged using the logging module, and the LogRecord instances are collected via some other means. However, in practice, this is not straightforward. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring, and the function is supposed to return the exception messages or something else. But given the user's instruction, I have to proceed with the given docstring.

Another thing: the resolve_env parameter is present in the function signature but not used in the code. The docstring mentions that if resolve_env is True, maybe environment variables are resolved. However, the user's code doesn't include that logic. Since the user hasn't provided details on how to resolve environment variables, perhaps that's beyond the scope of this function, or it's a placeholder. But since the function signature includes resolve_env, but the code doesn't use it, that's a problem.

Wait, the function signature includes resolve_env=True. The docstring says that if resolve_env is True, perhaps environment variables are resolved. However, the code generated so far doesn't use this parameter. So I need to include that.

But how? Maybe the config files have placeholders that need to be replaced with environment variables. For example, if the config has ${VAR}, and resolve_env is True, replace that with the value of the environment variable.

But how to implement that? For example, using os.environ.get, but that's more complex. However, the user hasn't provided details on how to resolve the environment variables, so perhaps this is beyond the current scope. However, the function signature includes this parameter, so the code should include it, even if it's a no-op.

Alternatively, maybe the resolve_env parameter is for some other processing, but without more info, it's hard to say. Since the user hasn't provided any context on that, perhaps the code can ignore it for now, but that's not ideal.

But the function's parameters include resolve_env, so the code should handle it. However, since the user hasn't provided any details on how to resolve environment variables, perhaps the code can leave it as a placeholder, or assume that it's not used in this version.

But the user's docstring says that the function is supposed to load and validate each configuration file. The resolve_env parameter might be for resolving environment variables in the config, but without knowing the specifics, it's hard to implement. So perhaps the code can ignore it for now, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the resolve_env is a flag that, when True, the code should replace environment variables in the config. For example, if the config has a key like 'DATABASE_URL' with a value like 'localhost:${PORT}', then replace ${PORT} with the environment variable PORT.

But how to do that? Using a library like python-dotenv or some string substitution. However, without knowing the exact method, it's hard to code. But perhaps the code can include a simple substitution using os.environ.get.

For example, if resolve_env is True, then after parsing the config (as a dict), iterate through the keys and values, and replace any ${VAR} with the corresponding environment variable.

But again, this is speculative. However, given that the function signature includes resolve_env, the code should include it. So perhaps in the code, after parsing the config, if resolve_env is True, then process the config to replace environment variables.

But how to implement that? Let's think. For each key-value pair in the config, if the value is a string, replace any ${VAR} with the value of the environment variable VAR.

But this is a simple approach. However, the code would need to import os.

So, adding:

import os

Then, in the code:

if resolve_env:
    for key, value in config.items():
        if isinstance(value, str):
            # Replace ${VAR} with environment variables
            # This is a simple approach, but may not handle all cases
            config[key] = value.format(**os.environ)

But this is a possible approach. However, using the str.format method with **os.environ would replace any {VAR} with the environment variable. But the user's parameter is resolve_env, which might expect ${VAR} syntax. So perhaps using a different method.

Alternatively, using a regex to find ${VAR} and replace with os.environ.get(VAR, '').

But again, without knowing the exact syntax, it's hard. However, the code can include this logic as part of the resolve_env parameter.

So, integrating this into the code:

After parsing the config, if resolve_env is True:

for key in config:
    if isinstance(config[key], str):
        # Replace ${VAR} with environment variable
        # Using a simple substitution
        # This is a basic example
        config[key] = config[key].replace('${', '{').format(**os.environ)

But this is not a robust solution. However, given the ambiguity, this is a possible approach.

But the user's original problem didn't mention this, so perhaps the resolve_env is not used in the current code, but the function signature includes it. However, the user's docstring says that the function is supposed to load and validate each configuration file. The resolve_env parameter might be for resolving environment variables in the config files, but without more info, it's hard to proceed.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should include the resolve_env parameter but not use it, or use it in a way that's plausible. However, the user's code may expect that the resolve_env is handled.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the code can include the resolve_env parameter but not use it, or use it in a way that's a placeholder. However, that's not ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolve_env is a flag that, when True, the code should resolve environment variables in the config. For example, using the python-dotenv library, but that's an external dependency. However, the user's context says that imported packages include logging, but not dotenv. So perhaps the code should not use that.

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should include the resolve_env parameter but not use it, or use it in a basic way. However, since the user's docstring doesn't mention how resolve_env is used, perhaps the code can ignore it for now, but that's not correct.

But the function signature includes resolve_env=True, so the code should include it. However, without knowing how to resolve environment variables, it's hard to proceed. Therefore, perhaps the code can include a placeholder comment or a no-op.

But given that the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, and the docstring doesn't mention resolve_env, perhaps the code can ignore it, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe resolve_env is a flag that affects how the config is parsed, but without more info, it's hard to know.

Given the time I've spent on this, perhaps I should proceed with the code that handles the loading and parsing, and includes the resolve_env parameter but doesn't use it, or uses it in a basic way.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

import logging
import json
import os

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    result = {}
    errors = []
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
            config = json.loads(content)
            if resolve_env:
                # Replace environment variables in the config
                for key in config:
                    if isinstance(config[key], str):
                        config[key] = config[key].format(**os.environ)
            if overrides:
                config.update(overrides)
            result[filename] = config
        except (IOError, PermissionError) as e:
            log_record = logging.makeRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, None, None, str(e), None, None, {})
            errors.append(log_record)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            log_record = logging.makeRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, None, None, f"JSON decode error in {filename}: {e}", None, None, {})
            errors.append(log_record)
        except Exception as e:
            log_record = logging.makeRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, None, None, f"Unexpected error loading {filename}: {e}", None, None, {})
            errors.append(log_record)
    return result, errors

But I'm not sure about the logging.makeRecord parameters. The parameters are:

makeRecord(self, name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func, sinfo)

In the code above, I'm passing None for fn, lno, etc. This might not be correct, but without more info, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the errors are logged using the logging module's logger, and the LogRecord instances are captured via a logger's handlers. But that's more complex and would require setting up a logger and capturing the records, which is beyond the scope of this function.

Given the time I've spent and the ambiguity, I think this is the best approach I can take. The code reads the config files, parses them as JSON, applies overrides, resolves environment variables if resolve_env is True, and logs errors as LogRecord instances.
