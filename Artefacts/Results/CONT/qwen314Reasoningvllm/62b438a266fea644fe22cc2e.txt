Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the parse_arguments function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it parses command-line arguments and returns a dict mapping subparser names (or "global") to argparse.Namespace instances. 

First, I remember that argparse in Python is used for parsing command-line arguments. The function takes *unparsed_arguments, which are the arguments passed to the script. The goal is to parse these into a structured format.

The context mentions imported packages like argparse, collections, and borgmatic. Also, there are references to SUBPARSER_ALIASES, parse_subparser_arguments, make_parsers, and parse_arguments. So maybe the code uses subparsers, which are part of argparse for handling different commands.

The function needs to create a parser, possibly with subparsers. The SUBPARSER_ALIASES might be a dictionary mapping aliases to subparser names. The parse_subparser_arguments function might handle parsing the arguments for a specific subparser.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a subparser name or "global", and the value is the parsed Namespace. So, the global arguments would be those not associated with a specific subparser, and the subparsers would be the ones handled by their respective parsers.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create the main argument parser.
2. Add subparsers to it. Each subparser corresponds to a command, and maybe the aliases are handled here.
3. Parse the arguments.
4. Determine which subparser was used (if any).
5. For the global arguments, collect those that aren't specific to a subparser.
6. For the subparser arguments, parse them using the appropriate subparser's parser.
7. Return a dictionary with "global" and the subparser name as keys.

But how to structure this? Maybe the make_parsers() function creates the main parser and subparsers. Then, parse_subparser_arguments would handle parsing the arguments for a specific subparser.

Wait, the function parse_arguments is called with *unparsed_arguments. So, perhaps the code first creates the main parser and subparsers, then parses the arguments, checks which subparser was used, and then parses the arguments again for that subparser, along with the global ones.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses the argparse's parse_known_args to separate the arguments for the subparser and the rest.

But the docstring says that the function returns a dict mapping subparser names to their parsed arguments. So, for example, if the user runs the script with 'subcommand arg1 arg2', then the subcommand's arguments are parsed into its own Namespace, and the global arguments (if any) are in the 'global' key.

Hmm. Let me think about how argparse works with subparsers. Normally, when you have subparsers, the first argument is the subcommand, and the rest are arguments for that subcommand. The main parser would have the global arguments, and the subparsers would have their own.

But in this case, the function is supposed to parse all arguments, separate the global ones and the subparser ones. So maybe the approach is:

- Create a main parser with global arguments.
- Add subparsers to it.
- Parse the arguments, which would include the subcommand and its arguments.
- Then, check which subcommand was used.
- If a subcommand was used, parse the arguments again for that subcommand, separating the subcommand's arguments from the global ones.

But how to do that? Because when you parse with argparse, it automatically routes the arguments to the appropriate subparser. However, if you want to get both the global arguments and the subparser arguments, perhaps you need to parse the arguments twice: once for the main parser to get the subcommand, then parse again for the subcommand's parser.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses the parse_known_args method to separate the arguments. For example, first parse the global arguments, then pass the remaining arguments to the subparser.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

1. Create the main parser (with global arguments) and subparsers.
2. Parse the arguments, but using parse_known_args to separate the subcommand and its arguments.
3. Then, for the subcommand, create its specific parser and parse the remaining arguments.
4. Combine the global arguments and the subcommand arguments into the dictionary.

But the code might be more complex. Let me check the context again. The context mentions parse_subparser_arguments(unparsed_arguments, subparsers). Maybe that function is responsible for parsing the arguments for a specific subparser.

Alternatively, the code might be structured as follows:

In the parse_arguments function:

- Create the main parser and subparsers.
- Parse the arguments, which would determine which subparser was used.
- Then, for that subparser, parse the arguments again, perhaps using the subparser's parser.
- The global arguments would be those that are not part of the subparser's arguments.

But how to handle the global arguments? Maybe the main parser has some arguments that are global, and the subparsers have their own. When the user runs the script, the main parser is used to parse the arguments, and the subparser's arguments are parsed separately.

Alternatively, the code might use the argparse's add_subparsers method, and then for each subparser, add their arguments. Then, when parsing, the subcommand is determined, and the arguments are parsed accordingly.

But the function's goal is to return a dict with "global" and the subparser's Namespace. So, perhaps the code does:

- Create a main parser with global arguments.
- Add subparsers to it, each with their own arguments.
- Parse the arguments, which would include the subcommand and its arguments.
- Then, the parsed arguments would have the subcommand's arguments in the subparser's namespace, and the global arguments in the main parser's namespace.

But how to separate them? Maybe the main parser's namespace contains the global arguments, and the subparser's namespace contains the subcommand's arguments. However, argparse's default behavior is that when you have subparsers, the parsed arguments are in the subparser's namespace, not the main one. So perhaps the code needs to parse the arguments twice: once to get the subcommand, then again for the subcommand's arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses the Borgmatic library, which is mentioned in the imported packages. Borgmatic is a tool for managing Borg backups, and perhaps it has some argument parsing utilities. But I'm not sure about that.

Given that the user provided the context of imported packages and functions, perhaps the code uses the parse_subparser_arguments function, which is mentioned in the context. The function parse_arguments would call parse_subparser_arguments with the unparsed arguments and the subparsers.

Putting this together, here's a possible code structure:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='subcommand')
    # Add subparsers here, but perhaps this is done in make_parsers()
    # Assuming make_parsers() creates the parsers and subparsers
    # Then, parse the arguments
    args, remaining_args = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    # Determine which subparser was used
    subcommand = args.subcommand
    # Then, parse the remaining arguments for the subparser
    # Assuming parse_subparser_arguments is a function that does this
    # But the exact implementation is unclear
    # Maybe the code uses the SUBPARSER_ALIASES to map aliases to subparser names
    # Then, return a dict with 'global' and the subparser's args
    # However, without knowing the exact structure of make_parsers and parse_subparser_arguments, it's challenging
    # But given the context, perhaps the code is something like:

    # Create the main parser and subparsers
    main_parser, subparsers = make_parsers()
    # Parse the arguments
    parsed_args = main_parser.parse_args(unparsed_arguments)
    # Check if a subcommand was used
    if parsed_args.subcommand:
        # Parse the subcommand's arguments
        subparser_args = parse_subparser_arguments(unparsed_arguments, subparsers)
        # Return a dict with 'global' and the subcommand's args
        return {
            'global': parsed_args,
            parsed_args.subcommand: subparser_args
        }
    else:
        # No subcommand, return global args
        return {'global': parsed_args}

But this is speculative. The exact code depends on how make_parsers() and parse_subparser_arguments() are implemented. However, given the limited information, I need to generate code that fits the function signature and docstring.

Another approach: the function uses argparse to parse the arguments, then separates the global arguments and the subparser arguments. For example, if the first argument is a subcommand, then the rest are parsed by that subcommand's parser.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the code is as follows:

import argparse
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    """
    Given command-line arguments with which this script was invoked, parse the arguments and return
    them as a dict mapping from subparser name (or "global") to an argparse.Namespace instance.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='subcommand')
    # Assuming that make_parsers() adds the subparsers
    # But since the context mentions make_parsers(), perhaps it's called here
    # However, the code provided in the context is not given, so this is a guess
    # For the sake of example, let's assume that SUBPARSER_ALIASES is a dict mapping aliases to subparser names
    # and that parse_subparser_arguments is a function that parses the arguments for a specific subparser
    # But again, without knowing the exact code, this is challenging

    # Let's proceed with a basic structure
    main_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = main_parser.add_subparsers(dest='subcommand')
    # Add some example subparsers
    for name, aliases in SUBPARSER_ALIASES.items():
        subparser = subparsers.add_parser(name, aliases=aliases)
        # Add arguments to the subparser
        # This part would be handled by make_parsers()

    # Parse the arguments
    parsed_args = main_parser.parse_args(unparsed_arguments)
    subcommand = parsed_args.subcommand

    # If a subcommand was used, parse the arguments for that subcommand
    if subcommand:
        subparser = subparsers.choices[subcommand]
        # Re-parse the arguments for the subparser
        subparser_args = subparser.parse_args(unparsed_arguments)
        return {
            'global': parsed_args,
            subcommand: subparser_args
        }
    else:
        return {'global': parsed_args}

But this is not correct because the main_parser's parse_args would already have parsed the arguments, including the subcommand. However, the subparser's parse_args would need to be called with the arguments that are specific to that subcommand.

Alternatively, the code might use parse_known_args to separate the subcommand and its arguments from the rest.

Another approach is to first parse the global arguments, then parse the subcommand's arguments. For example:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    main_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    # Add global arguments to main_parser
    # Then add subparsers
    subparsers = main_parser.add_subparsers(dest='subcommand')
    # Add subparsers with their arguments
    # Assuming make_parsers() does this

    # Parse the arguments, separating the subcommand and its arguments
    args, remaining_args = main_parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    subcommand = args.subcommand

    # If a subcommand is present, parse the remaining arguments for that subcommand
    if subcommand:
        subparser = subparsers.choices[subcommand]
        sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining_args)
        return {
            'global': args,
            subcommand: sub_args
        }
    else:
        return {'global': args}

This seems plausible. The main_parser is used to parse the global arguments and determine the subcommand. Then, the remaining arguments are parsed by the subcommand's parser.

But in this case, the main_parser's parse_known_args would return the parsed global arguments and the remaining arguments (which include the subcommand and its arguments). Wait, no. The parse_known_args method splits the arguments into those that are parsed by the main parser and those that are not. However, if the first argument is a subcommand, then the main_parser would parse the subcommand as the 'subcommand' argument, and the remaining arguments would be passed to the subparser.

But I think that when using subparsers, the main_parser's parse_args would automatically route the arguments to the appropriate subparser. However, parse_known_args might not do that. This is getting complicated.

In any case, the code needs to return a dictionary with 'global' and the subparser's arguments. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that uses parse_known_args to separate the arguments, then parse the subcommand's arguments separately.

So, the final code would look something like this, incorporating the imports and the context mentioned:

import argparse
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    """
    Given command-line arguments with which this script was invoked, parse the arguments and return
    them as a dict mapping from subparser name (or "global") to an argparse.Namespace instance.
    """
    main_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = main_parser.add_subparsers(dest='subcommand')
    # Assuming make_parsers() adds the subparsers and their arguments
    # For example:
    # make_parsers(main_parser, subparsers)
    # But since the exact code is not given, this is a placeholder

    # Parse the arguments to get the subcommand
    args, remaining_args = main_parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    subcommand = args.subcommand

    result = {'global': args}

    if subcommand:
        # Get the subparser for the subcommand
        subparser = subparsers.choices[subcommand]
        # Parse the remaining arguments for the subparser
        sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining_args)
        result[subcommand] = sub_args

    return result

But this code assumes that make_parsers() has already added the subparsers to the main_parser. However, the context mentions that parse_arguments is called, and within the file there's make_parsers(), so perhaps the code inside parse_arguments calls make_parsers() to create the parsers.

But without knowing the exact implementation of make_parsers(), it's hard to say. However, given the function signature and the context, the code should be structured to create the main parser, add subparsers, parse the arguments, and return the dictionary.

Another thing to consider: the SUBPARSER_ALIASES might be used to map aliases to subparser names. So, perhaps the code uses that to handle alternative names for subcommands.

But given the time, I'll proceed with the code that creates the main parser, adds subparsers, parses the arguments, and returns the dictionary as described.
