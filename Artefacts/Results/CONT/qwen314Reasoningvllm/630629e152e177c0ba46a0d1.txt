Okay, let's see. I need to generate the Python code for the try_retrieve_webfinger_document function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document without raising an exception if it fails. 

First, I'll check the imported packages. The user mentioned that 'requests' is imported, so I can use that library to make HTTP requests. The function parameters include a handle, which is a string. Webfinger typically involves querying a URL based on the handle, like https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com.

So the first step is to construct the correct URL. The handle is probably in the format of a username@domain, so I need to parse that. Using the 're' module might help here. Let me think about splitting the handle into local part and domain. For example, splitting on '@' to get the domain.

Once I have the domain, the webfinger URL would be https://domain/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:handle. Wait, but the handle might already include the domain. So maybe the resource parameter is the handle itself. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', the resource would be 'acct:user@example.com'.

So the URL construction would be something like: f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}".

But wait, maybe the handle is already in the format of acct:...? Or maybe not. The function's parameter is just a handle, which could be a username or an email. But according to RFC7033, the resource is typically an acct URI. So perhaps the code should format the resource as 'acct:' + handle if it's not already in that format. But maybe the handle is provided as the full URI. Hmm, maybe the function expects the handle to be the full acct URI, or maybe it's just the username@domain part. The problem statement isn't clear, but given the function's name, it's likely that the handle is the username@domain part, and the code needs to construct the resource as 'acct:' + handle.

So, first, parse the handle to get the domain. Let's split on '@' to get the domain part. For example, if handle is 'user@example.com', the domain is 'example.com'. Then construct the URL as https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com.

But what if the handle doesn't have an '@'? Maybe it's just a username, and the domain is inferred from some other source? Or perhaps the function is designed to handle handles that are already in the acct format. This is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the function is called try_retrieve_webfinger_document, perhaps the handle is the full acct URI. But that's not certain. Alternatively, maybe the handle is the username part, and the domain is part of the URL. But without more context, I'll proceed with the assumption that the handle is in the format of username@domain, and the resource is 'acct:' + handle.

So, the first step is to split the handle into local and domain parts. Let's use a regex to check if the handle has an '@' and split accordingly. If there's no '@', maybe the domain is not provided, but that's unclear. However, the function is supposed to not raise on failure, so perhaps it's better to handle cases where the handle is invalid by just returning None.

Once the URL is constructed, the next step is to make a GET request to that URL using the requests library. But the code needs to handle exceptions without raising them. So, wrap the request in a try-except block. Also, check if the response status code is 200. If not, return None. Also, check the content type to ensure it's application/jrd+json, as per RFC7033. If not, maybe return None as well.

But looking at the imported functions, there's a fetch_document function. Wait, the user mentioned that within the file, there are functions like fetch_document, fetch_content_type, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to use those helper functions instead of directly using requests. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, and the imported packages include 'requests', but the existing code may have other helper functions.

Wait, the context says that within the file, there are functions like fetch_document, fetch_content_type, etc. So maybe the code should use those functions. But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the implementation of those functions, so I need to proceed with the available information.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to use the requests library directly. Let me think again. The function's name is try_retrieve_webfinger_document, which suggests that it's attempting to retrieve the document and returns None on failure. So, using requests.get, handling exceptions, checking the status code, and content type.

But the user's context includes functions like fetch_document, which might be a helper. However, without knowing their exact implementation, perhaps the code should use the requests library directly. Let's proceed with that approach.

So, the steps would be:

1. Parse the handle to get the domain. Split on '@' to get the domain part. If there's no '@', maybe return None? Or assume that the domain is part of the handle? This is unclear, but let's proceed with splitting on '@' and take the domain as the part after the '@'.

2. Construct the URL as https://domain/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:handle.

3. Make a GET request to that URL using requests.get, with appropriate headers (like User-Agent, which is defined as USER_AGENT in the context).

4. Handle exceptions (like connection errors, timeouts) by returning None.

5. Check the response status code. If it's 200, proceed. Else, return None.

6. Check the content type. If it's application/jrd+json, return the text. Else, return None.

But the docstring says that the function does not raise if it fails. So, all exceptions should be caught, and the function returns None in case of any failure.

So, putting this together in code:

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        # parse handle to get domain
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        domain = handle.split('@')[1]
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"
        headers = {'User-Agent': USER_AGENT}
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        content_type = response.headers.get('Content-Type', '')
        if content_type.startswith('application/jrd+json'):
            return response.text
        else:
            return None
    except Exception:
        return None

But wait, the timeout value is arbitrary here. The original code might have a timeout parameter, but the function signature doesn't include it. However, in the context, there's a fetch_document function that takes timeout as a parameter. But since the current function doesn't have that parameter, perhaps the code uses a default timeout, like 10 seconds.

Also, the code may need to handle cases where the domain is not valid, or the URL is incorrect. But the function is supposed to return None in such cases.

But there's also the possibility that the handle is in the format of an acct URI, like 'acct:user@example.com', in which case splitting on '@' would give 'user@example.com' as the domain part? No, splitting on '@' would split into 'acct:user' and 'example.com' if the handle is 'acct:user@example.com'. Wait, that's not correct. If the handle is 'acct:user@example.com', then splitting on '@' would give ['acct:user', 'example.com'], so domain is 'example.com', which is correct. But if the handle is just 'user@example.com', then splitting gives ['user', 'example.com'], which is also correct.

But if the handle is 'user', then there's no '@', so the code returns None. That's acceptable.

Another consideration: the webfinger URL may require HTTPS. The code constructs the URL with https, which is correct.

But what about cases where the domain doesn't have HTTPS? Well, the code would attempt to connect, but if it fails, the exception is caught and returns None.

Also, the code uses response.raise_for_status(), which will raise an HTTPError for 4xx or 5xx responses. But the function is supposed to not raise, so that's why we have the try-except block.

But in the code above, if the response is 200, but the content type is not application/jrd+json, then return None.

So that's the general approach.

But the user's context includes a fetch_document function. Maybe the code is supposed to use that instead of directly using requests. However, without knowing the parameters of fetch_document, it's hard to say. The function signature of fetch_document is given as fetch_document(url, host, path, timeout, raise_ssl_errors, extra_headers). But the current function doesn't have those parameters. So perhaps the code uses fetch_document, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the code uses the fetch_file function, which is mentioned in the context. The fetch_file function's parameters are url, timeout, extra_headers. But again, without knowing the exact implementation, it's hard to say. However, the original problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, and the imported packages include 'requests', so it's possible that the code uses the requests library directly.

But given that the context includes functions like fetch_document, perhaps the code is supposed to use that. However, since the user hasn't provided the implementation of fetch_document, it's unclear. Therefore, the safest approach is to use the requests library directly, as that's a common way to handle such tasks.

Thus, the code I outlined earlier would be the way to go.

Another thing to consider: the User-Agent. The context mentions that USER_AGENT is defined, so the code should use that in the headers.

Also, the code should handle possible exceptions like connection errors, timeouts, etc., which are caught in the except block.

So the final code would look like that.
