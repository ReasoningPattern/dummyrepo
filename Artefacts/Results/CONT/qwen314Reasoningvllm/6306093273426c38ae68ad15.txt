Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _run_playbook function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function takes cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin as parameters. The docstring says it runs ansible cli with the vars_dict as extra-vars. The return is ansible results.

First, I should figure out how to execute Ansible using the provided arguments. The cli_args is a list of command line arguments. Maybe these are the playbook and other options. The vars_dict is passed as extra variables.

I remember that in Ansible, you can use the Ansible CLI with the -e or --extra-vars flag to pass variables. But since this is within Python, perhaps using the ansible-runner or ansible module directly.

Wait, the user mentioned that the code should be generated without explanations. But I need to think about the correct approach. Let me recall that the Ansible Runner library allows running playbooks programmatically.

So, maybe using ansible_runner.run() function. The parameters would include the playbook, inventory, extra_vars, etc. But how do cli_args fit into this?

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args are the arguments that would be passed to the ansible-playbook command line, like ['playbook.yml', '-e', 'var1=value1'].

But the function is supposed to take cli_args as a list. So perhaps the function is constructing the command line by combining cli_args with the extra variables.

Wait, but the vars_dict is passed as extra-vars. So maybe the cli_args includes the playbook name and other options, and the vars_dict is added as extra variables.

But how to handle that in code. Let me think about the Ansible CLI execution. If using the subprocess module, perhaps.

But the user might be using a specific library. Since the context mentions imported packages, but the user hasn't provided them. However, the original code might be using ansible_runner.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses the ansible module's API. For example, using ansible.playbook.PlayBook.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Assuming that the cli_args is a list that includes the playbook path and other options. The vars_dict is passed as extra variables. The ir_workspace and ir_plugin might be used to determine the inventory or other settings.

Wait, the ir_workspace is an Infrared Workspace object. Infrared is a tool that uses Ansible, so maybe the inventory is managed by Infrared. So the inventory path could be obtained from the workspace.

But without knowing the exact structure of ir_workspace, it's hard to say. However, the code might need to use the inventory from the workspace.

Alternatively, the cli_args might include the inventory path, but that's unclear.

Another approach: The function is part of a class that uses Infrared, so perhaps the inventory is set up via the workspace. The cli_args could be the playbook and other parameters, and the vars_dict is passed as extra variables.

So, perhaps the code uses the AnsibleRunner to run the playbook with the given arguments and variables.

But without knowing the exact libraries used, I need to make assumptions. Let me think of a possible code structure.

The code would need to:

1. Parse cli_args to determine the playbook, inventory, etc.
2. Pass vars_dict as extra_vars.
3. Execute the playbook and return the results.

But how to do that in Python. Let's assume that the cli_args is a list that includes the playbook name. For example, if cli_args is ['playbook.yml', '-i', 'inventory.ini'], then the code would need to process these arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is a list of arguments that would be passed to ansible-playbook, like ['--extra-vars', 'var1=value1', 'playbook.yml'].

But the vars_dict is already provided, so perhaps the code is combining cli_args with the extra-vars from vars_dict.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the code uses the ansible_runner.run() function, passing the playbook, inventory, and extra_vars.

So, here's a possible code outline:

import ansible_runner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Determine the inventory path from the workspace
    inventory = ir_workspace.inventory_path
    # The playbook is the first argument in cli_args?
    playbook = cli_args[0]
    # Run the playbook with the given variables
    r = ansible_runner.run(
        playbook=playbook,
        inventory=inventory,
        extra_vars=vars_dict
    )
    return r

But this is making assumptions about the structure of cli_args and how the inventory is obtained from ir_workspace. However, the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, without including explanations. So perhaps the code is supposed to use some existing setup.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is a list of arguments that are passed to the Ansible CLI, and the code is using subprocess to run it.

But then, how to handle the vars_dict. For example, the vars_dict would need to be converted into --extra-vars flags.

But that's more complex. For example, if vars_dict is {'var1': 'value1', 'var2': 'value2'}, then the cli_args would need to include '-e var1=value1 -e var2=value2'.

But the cli_args is provided as a parameter, so perhaps the code is supposed to append the extra-vars to the cli_args.

But this is unclear. Without more context, it's challenging. However, the user provided that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code is using a specific library or method.

Another angle: The function is part of an Infrared plugin, which uses Ansible. Infrared's code might have a way to run playbooks. For example, using the ir_workspace to get the inventory and other settings.

Assuming that the ir_workspace has a method to get the inventory, and the cli_args includes the playbook name. Then, the code could use ansible_runner to run the playbook with the inventory and extra variables.

But again, without knowing the exact structure of the objects, it's speculative.

In the absence of more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the code uses the ansible_runner library, and the cli_args contains the playbook path. The inventory is obtained from the ir_workspace, and the vars_dict is passed as extra_vars.

So the code would look something like this:

import ansible_runner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active
     workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    # Assuming cli_args[0] is the playbook path
    playbook = cli_args[0]
    inventory = ir_workspace.inventory_path  # Hypothetical attribute
    result = ansible_runner.run(
        playbook=playbook,
        inventory=inventory,
        extra_vars=vars_dict
    )
    return result

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. However, since the user hasn't provided the imported packages, but the context says "Imported Packages: Within file: Within class: ", perhaps the code is supposed to include necessary imports.

Wait, the user's context says "Imported Packages: Within file: Within class: " but no actual packages are listed. So maybe the code is supposed to assume that the necessary modules are already imported.

But in the generated code, I need to include the necessary imports. However, the user's instruction says not to include any explanation, so I need to write the code as is.

But the initial code may not have the import. However, the user's context may have imported packages. But since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps the code is supposed to assume that the required modules are available.

Alternatively, the code may be using the subprocess module to call ansible-playbook.

But again, without knowing the exact setup, it's hard to say. However, given the function's purpose, the most likely approach is using ansible_runner.

So, the final code would include the import of ansible_runner and the function as outlined.
