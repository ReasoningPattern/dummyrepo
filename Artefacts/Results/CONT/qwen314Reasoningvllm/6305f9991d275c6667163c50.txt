Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the set_cut_chars method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by looking at the parameters: before and after are both bytes. The method is supposed to set the delimiters for splitting files.

The context mentions that there's a self._cutter attribute, so maybe the cutters are stored there. The method probably needs to assign the before and after bytes to some instance variables. The docstring says that before is for splitting before the delimiters and after is for after. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Maybe the before is the delimiter that comes before the split point, and after is the one that comes after. Or perhaps it's the opposite. But the parameters are named before and after, so I should follow that.

Looking at the existing code references, there's a self.DEFAULT_CUT_BEFORE and DEFAULT_CUT_AFTER. So maybe the method is setting these defaults, but the parameters are passed in. Wait, the method's name is set_cut_chars, which suggests that it's setting the characters used for cutting. So the before and after parameters are the delimiters. But how are they used? Maybe the before is the delimiter that comes before the split point, and after is the one that comes after. For example, if you have a file split into parts, the split occurs between the before and after delimiters.

But the exact implementation isn't given. The user just wants the method that takes before and after as bytes and sets them. So the method would likely store these values as instance variables. Let me think about the variables. Maybe self._cut_before and self._cut_after? Or perhaps self._cutter has before and after attributes.

Wait, the context mentions self._cutter. So maybe the _cutter is an object that has before and after properties. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the function's job is to set the bytes used for delimiters. So the most straightforward approach is to assign the before and after parameters to instance variables.

Looking at the parameters: the method is part of a class, and the parameters are bytes. So the code would be something like:

self._cut_before = before
self._cut_after = after

But maybe the class has a _cutter attribute that is being set. For example, self._cutter could be an object that holds these values. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given the function's name and the parameters, the most logical thing is to store the before and after bytes as instance variables.

Another possibility is that the method is setting the cut characters for a cutter object. For example, if self._cutter is an instance of some class that has set_before and set_after methods, but again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

But since the user hasn't provided the existing code for the class, I have to make an educated guess. The method's purpose is to set the delimiters, so the code would likely assign the parameters to instance variables. So the code would be:

def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
    self._cut_before = before
    self._cut_after = after

But maybe the variables are named differently. The context mentions DEFAULT_CUT_BEFORE and DEFAULT_CUT_AFTER, which might be class-level variables. So perhaps the method is setting instance variables that override the defaults.

Alternatively, if the _cutter is an object that has before and after attributes, then:

self._cutter.before = before
self._cutter.after = after

But again, without knowing the structure of _cutter, it's uncertain. However, given the information available, the first approach is more straightforward. The method's docstring says that before is for splitting before the delimiters and after after. So the instance variables would store these values for later use when splitting the file.

Therefore, the generated code would assign the before and after parameters to instance variables, probably named _cut_before and _cut_after.
