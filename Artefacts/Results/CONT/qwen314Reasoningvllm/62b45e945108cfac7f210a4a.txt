Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the validate_hierarchy method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user provided some context about imported packages and existing methods within the class. 

First, the function is supposed to validate the storage root hierarchy. The return values are num_objects and good_objects. The parameters include validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings. 

Looking at the context, there are several methods mentioned like check_root_structure, parse_layout_file, validate_extensions_dir, and others. The class has attributes like root, root_fs, disposition, lax_digests, etc. 

The method probably starts by initializing counters for num_objects and good_objects. Then, it might check the root structure using check_root_structure. If validate_objects is True, it would iterate over objects, maybe using object_paths or list method. For each object, it would validate, check digests if required, and update the counters. 

There's also a traversal_error method, so maybe during validation, if there's an error, it's logged or counted. The log attribute is present, so logging warnings or errors might be part of it. The show_warnings parameter could control whether warnings are logged.

I need to make sure that the code uses the existing methods and attributes. For example, self.check_root_structure(self) might be called first. Then, if validate_objects is True, loop through objects, perhaps using self.object_paths() or self.list().

Also, the disposition and _dispositor might be involved in how objects are validated. The lax_digests flag could affect how digests are checked. If check_digests is True, then each object's digest is verified, possibly using a validator from the validator module.

I should structure the code to first check the root structure, then process each object if validate_objects is enabled. For each object, increment num_objects, then check validity, maybe using self.validate() or another method. If check_digests is True, perform digest checks. Update good_objects if valid. Handle traversal errors with self.traversal_error.

Also, the logging part: if show_warnings is True, log warnings using self.log. The num_traversal_errors might be incremented when errors occur.

Putting it all together, the code would have:

- Initialize num_objects and good_objects to 0.
- Call check_root_structure.
- If validate_objects, get the list of objects, loop through them.
- For each object, check validity, digest, handle errors.
- Update counters accordingly.
- Return num_objects and good_objects.

Need to make sure that all the existing methods and attributes are used correctly. Also, the return statement should return the two values as specified.
