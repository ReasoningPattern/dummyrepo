Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _validate_labels function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it checks that the keys and values in the labels are validated using validate_key() and validate_value(). 

So, the function will take a 'labels' parameter, which I assume is a dictionary. The task is to iterate over each key-value pair in the labels and validate them individually. 

First, I need to make sure that the labels are a dictionary. If they're not, maybe raise a TypeError. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling non-dictionary inputs, so perhaps the function assumes that labels is a dict. 

Next, for each key in the labels, I should call validate_key(key). Similarly, for each value, call validate_value(value). If any of these validations fail, the function should raise an appropriate exception. 

But wait, what do validate_key and validate_value do? The context mentions that there are functions like validate_key and validate_value, and possibly regex patterns like _label_key_pattern and _label_value_pattern. So maybe validate_key uses the _label_key_regex to check the key against a regex pattern, and similarly for the value.

The function _validate_labels needs to check all keys and values. So, the code would loop through each key-value pair. For each key, call validate_key, and for each value, call validate_value. If any of these calls raise an exception (like ValueError or similar), they should propagate, causing the validation to fail.

So, putting this together, the code would look something like:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    """
    Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
    """
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

But wait, maybe the function should collect all errors and raise them at once? The docstring doesn't specify, so probably each validation is done sequentially, and the first error encountered will raise an exception, stopping further validation. That's a common approach.

But I need to make sure that the code uses the existing functions validate_key and validate_value. The context says that these functions are present, so I don't need to define them here. 

So the code is straightforward: iterate over each key-value pair, validate key and value. That's all. The function doesn't return anything; it just validates and raises exceptions if any issues are found.

I should check if there's any other context I need to consider. The imported packages include things like dataclasses, enum, typing, re, datetime, marshmallow, serializable. The regex patterns are defined elsewhere, like _label_key_pattern, _label_key_regex, etc. But since the validate_key and validate_value functions are already present, the _validate_labels function just uses them.

So the final code is as I outlined above. Just loop through the items and call the validation functions.
