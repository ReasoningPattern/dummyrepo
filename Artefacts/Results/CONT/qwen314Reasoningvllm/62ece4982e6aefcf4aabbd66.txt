Okay, let's see. I need to write the was_processed function based on the given signature and docstring. The function's purpose is to check if a path has already been processed to prevent recursion. The arguments are a set called processed, a path_name, and a verbose flag.

First, the docstring says to expand the path to an absolute path. So I should use os.path.abspath on path_name. That makes sense because relative paths could cause issues with duplicates.

Next, the function needs to check if this absolute path is already in the processed set. If it is, return True and report the issue if verbose is True. Otherwise, add it to the set and return False.

Wait, the return value is True if it's already in the set, False otherwise. So the steps are:

1. Compute the absolute path.
2. Check if it's in the processed set.
3. If yes, return True. Also, if verbose, print a message.
4. If not, add it to the set and return False.

So the code structure would be:

def was_processed(processed, path_name, verbose):
    abs_path = os.path.abspath(path_name)
    if abs_path in processed:
        if verbose:
            print(f"Already processed: {abs_path}")
        return True
    else:
        processed.add(abs_path)
        return False

But wait, the function is supposed to modify the processed set. So adding the absolute path to the set when it's not present.

I need to make sure that the path is added to the set only when it's not already there. That's handled here.

What about possible exceptions? The docstring doesn't mention handling errors, so probably no need for that. Just assume that the path is valid.

Also, the function is supposed to return True if the entry is already in the set. So the code seems correct.

I think that's all. Now, write the code with the correct indentation and using os.path.abspath.
