Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_config function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns a new VersioneerConfig() and sets various attributes of it. 

First, I should check if VersioneerConfig is a class that's defined elsewhere in the code. Since the context mentions that the function is part of a file with other functions like get_keywords, register_vcs_handler, etc., maybe VersioneerConfig is a class from an external module or defined in the same file. But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so I'll assume it's imported or defined elsewhere.

The function needs to create an instance of VersioneerConfig and set its attributes. But the problem is, the user hasn't specified which attributes to set. The original function's docstring is very minimal, just saying "set various attributes". Without more context, I might need to make assumptions here. However, looking at the context provided, there are functions related to version control systems, Git, and PEP440 versions. So perhaps VersioneerConfig has attributes related to these.

Wait, maybe the user expects me to use the existing functions mentioned in the context. For example, functions like git_get_keywords, git_versions_from_keywords, etc. But how does that relate to get_config? Maybe the get_config function initializes the configuration with default settings for these functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the VersioneerConfig class has attributes like vcs, tag_prefix, parentdir_prefix, etc., which are set in get_config. Since the user hasn't provided the exact attributes, I need to make an educated guess based on common version control configurations.

Let me think of standard attributes that a versioning configuration might have. For example, the version control system (like git), the tag prefix, the parent directory prefix for versioning, whether to use the git describe command, etc. So, the get_config function might set these attributes.

But since the user hasn't provided specific details, maybe the original code (which the user is trying to replicate) has a standard setup. For example, in some versioneer implementations, the config might have attributes like vcs, tag_prefix, parentdir_prefix, and others.

Assuming that, here's a possible approach: create a VersioneerConfig instance, set its vcs to 'git', tag_prefix to 'v', parentdir_prefix to 'v', and other default values. However, without knowing the exact attributes, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the get_config function is supposed to call other functions to determine the configuration. But the function's purpose is to return a new config with attributes set, not to compute them based on the current state.

Another angle: looking at the functions in the context, there's a register_vcs_handler function. Maybe the get_config function registers handlers or sets up the VCS configuration.

But I'm not sure. Since the user hasn't provided the actual code for VersioneerConfig or the attributes to set, I need to make assumptions. However, the user might have provided enough context in the existing functions. For example, the git_pieces_from_vcs function takes parameters like tag_prefix, root, verbose, and runner. Maybe the get_config function sets these parameters in the config.

Alternatively, perhaps the get_config function is part of a setup where it initializes the configuration with default parameters that are used by other functions like git_versions_from_keywords or versions_from_parentdir.

In the absence of specific information, I'll proceed to create a VersioneerConfig instance and set some plausible attributes. For example:

- vcs: 'git' (since there are git-related functions)
- tag_prefix: 'v' (common in version tags)
- parentdir_prefix: 'v' (for parent directory versioning)
- verbose: False (default)
- runner: a function like run_command (from the context)

But I need to make sure that the code doesn't have syntax errors and uses the imported modules. The imported packages include sys, os, subprocess, etc. The run_command function is present in the context, so maybe the runner is set to that.

Putting it all together, the code might look like:

def get_config():
    """
    Return a new VersioneerConfig() and set various attribute of it.
    """
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.vcs = 'git'
    config.tag_prefix = 'v'
    config.parentdir_prefix = 'v'
    config.verbose = False
    config.runner = run_command
    return config

But I need to check if VersioneerConfig is defined. If it's not, this would raise a NameError. However, the user's context mentions that the function is within a file that includes other functions, so maybe VersioneerConfig is defined elsewhere in the same module. Since the user hasn't provided that, I'll proceed with this assumption.

Another possibility is that the get_config function is part of a larger setup where the config is populated based on some logic, but the user's instruction is to generate code that returns a new config with attributes set. Therefore, the code should create the object and assign attributes as per the function's purpose.
