Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the plugins_manager function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is a method that retrieves the plugin manager using ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER from cls._get_service(). The context mentions that within the class, there's a method self._get_service(cls, name) which probably fetches a service by name. So, the plugins_manager function should call this _get_service method with the appropriate service name.

First, I'll check the parameters. The function takes 'cls' as an argument, which suggests it's a class method. But in Python, class methods use '@classmethod' decorator and have 'cls' as the first parameter. However, the existing code snippets in the context don't show a decorator, so maybe it's an instance method that's being called with the class as an argument. Wait, the context shows methods like self._get_service(cls, name), which is a bit confusing. Wait, no, in Python, instance methods have 'self' as the first parameter. So if the method is part of a class, and it's called as self._get_service(cls, name), that might be a mistake. Wait, perhaps the _get_service is a method of the class, and it's being called with 'cls' as the first argument, which would be the class itself. But that's not standard. Maybe the code is using a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_service is a static method or a class method. But the context says within the class, there's self._get_service(cls, name). So perhaps the method is defined as def _get_service(self, cls, name): ... but that seems odd. Wait, maybe the _get_service is a method that takes the class as an argument, which is a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be self._get_service(name), but the context shows that the parameters are (cls, name). Hmm.

Assuming that the _get_service method is part of the same class and requires 'cls' as the first parameter, perhaps it's a class method. But the original function plugins_manager is defined with 'cls' as the parameter. Wait, the function signature is def plugins_manager(cls): ... which suggests it's a class method. But in Python, class methods are defined with @classmethod, and the first parameter is 'cls'. However, the existing code in the context shows that within the class, there's self._get_service(cls, name). So maybe the _get_service is an instance method that takes 'cls' as an argument. That seems a bit conflicting. Maybe the code is using a different approach, like passing the class to the method.

Alternatively, perhaps the _get_service is a static method that takes the class and name as parameters. But this is getting a bit unclear. Let me focus on the task at hand.

The docstring says that the function gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So the function needs to call cls._get_service with the service name ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. But how is ServiceName defined? The context mentions imported packages include 'infrared', which might have a ServiceName enum or something similar. Assuming that ServiceName is a module or class that has an attribute PLUGINS_MANAGER.

So, putting it all together, the plugins_manager function would call the _get_service method of the class (cls), passing the service name. But since the function is defined as taking 'cls' as an argument, and assuming that _get_service is a method of the class, perhaps it's a class method. But in Python, to call a class method, you would use cls._get_service(...). However, if _get_service is an instance method, then you would need an instance. But the function is defined with 'cls' as the parameter, which is the class, not an instance.

This is a bit confusing. Maybe the _get_service is a static method or a class method. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Assuming that _get_service is a class method, then the code would be:

@classmethod
def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But the original function doesn't have the @classmethod decorator. However, the function signature is def plugins_manager(cls): ... which is typical for a class method. But the original code provided by the user doesn't include the decorator. However, in Python, if you define a method with 'cls' as the first parameter but don't use @classmethod, it's treated as an instance method, which would be incorrect. But given the context, perhaps the code is written in a way that expects 'cls' to be passed as an argument, even if it's not a class method.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to be a static method, but that's less likely. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the function as a class method, using the @classmethod decorator, and call cls._get_service with the service name.

But the original code provided by the user doesn't have the decorator. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to include any explanation. So I need to generate the code that matches the given function signature.

The function is defined as def plugins_manager(cls): ... So, assuming that it's a class method, even without the decorator. But in Python, that's not standard. However, perhaps the code is written in a way that the method is called with the class as the first argument, even if it's not a class method. But that's not typical.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is an instance method that's being called with the class as an argument. But that would be unusual. For example, if the method is called on an instance, but the first argument is the class. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the intended code is to use the class method decorator.

But the user hasn't provided any existing code for the plugins_manager function. The context says that within the class, there's self.plugins_manager(cls), which suggests that it's being called as an instance method, passing the class as an argument. That seems odd. Maybe it's a mistake in the context.

Alternatively, perhaps the plugins_manager is a static method, and the 'cls' parameter is a mistake. But given the ambiguity, I need to proceed based on the given function signature and docstring.

The docstring says that the function gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So, the function needs to call cls._get_service() with the service name. Assuming that _get_service is a method of the class, and that it takes the service name as an argument. So, the code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But then, how is ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER accessed? The imported packages include 'infrared', so perhaps ServiceName is from infrared. So, the code would need to import ServiceName from infrared.

But the user's context says that the imported packages are os, sys, infrared. So, perhaps in the code, ServiceName is imported as part of infrared. For example, from infrared import ServiceName.

But the user hasn't provided the exact import statements. However, the generated code should include the necessary imports if they are needed. However, the user's instruction says that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring, and the context mentions imported packages. But the user hasn't provided the exact code for the plugins_manager function, so I need to assume that ServiceName is accessible.

Putting it all together, the function would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But this assumes that ServiceName is in scope. If the code requires importing it, then the code should include that. However, the user's context says that the imported packages are os, sys, infrared. So, perhaps ServiceName is part of the infrared module. Therefore, the code should have from infrared import ServiceName.

But the user hasn't specified that in the function's context. However, the generated code may need to include that import. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to include any explanation. However, the user's context mentions that the imported packages are os, sys, infrared. So, perhaps the code should include the necessary import for ServiceName.

But the user's original code may have that import already. However, the user hasn't provided the exact code, so I need to assume that ServiceName is available. Therefore, the generated code would be as above.

But wait, the original function is part of a class. So, perhaps the plugins_manager is a class method. Therefore, the code should have the @classmethod decorator. However, the original function signature does not include it. But in Python, without the decorator, the method would be an instance method, and calling cls._get_service would require an instance. But this is getting too much into the weeds.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code that matches the function signature and docstring, assuming that the _get_service method is a class method or static method that can be called with the class as the first argument. Therefore, the generated code is:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName is imported. Since the imported packages include infrared, perhaps ServiceName is from infrared. So, adding the import statement:

from infrared import ServiceName

But the user hasn't specified that in the context. However, the user's instruction says that the code should be generated based on the context provided. The context says that imported packages are os, sys, infrared. So, the code may need to import ServiceName from infrared. Therefore, including that import.

But the user's original code may have that already. However, since the function is being generated, perhaps the import is needed. But the user hasn't provided the existing code, so it's unclear. However, the generated code should be self-contained. Therefore, including the necessary import.

So, the final code would be:

from infrared import ServiceName

def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. However, the user's context says that the code is within a class, so the plugins_manager is a method of the class. Therefore, the function should be part of a class. But the user hasn't provided the class definition. However, the function signature is given as def plugins_manager(cls): ... which suggests it's a class method. Therefore, adding the @classmethod decorator.

So, the code would be:

from infrared import ServiceName

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def plugins_manager(cls):
        """
        Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
        """
        return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But the user's original code may not have the class definition. However, the user's context says that within the class, there are methods like self._get_service, etc. So, the plugins_manager is part of a class, and the _get_service is a method of that class.

But the user's instruction is to generate the plugins_manager function based on the given signature and docstring. So, the code should be the function as part of the class, with the necessary decorator.

But the original function signature does not have the @classmethod decorator. However, in Python, without it, the method would be an instance method, and cls would be the class, which is not typical. Therefore, adding the @classmethod decorator is necessary for correctness, even if the original code didn't have it. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, not to include any explanation. Therefore, if the original function signature doesn't have the decorator, perhaps it's not needed. However, this is a bit conflicting.

In conclusion, based on the given information, the most accurate code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

Assuming that ServiceName is imported from infrared and that _get_service is a method of the class that can be called with the class as the first argument. However, without the @classmethod decorator, this may not work as intended. But given the user's instruction to follow the provided function signature, I'll proceed with that.
