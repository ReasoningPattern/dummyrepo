Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called create_complex_argumet_type, which seems to have a typo in the name (probably should be 'argument' instead of 'argumet'). 

Looking at the docstring, it says the function returns a function from COMPLEX_TYPES based on type_name. Then it mentions calling complex_action with some parameters. The parameters include self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path, subcommand, and spec_option. 

First, I need to make sure the function is correctly structured. The parameters are self, subcommand, type_name, option_name, spec_option. The function needs to retrieve the appropriate function from COMPLEX_TYPES using type_name. Then, it should call that function with the given arguments.

Wait, the docstring mentions complex_action, but maybe that's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be the function from COMPLEX_TYPES. So, perhaps the function is supposed to get the function from COMPLEX_TYPES using type_name, then invoke it with the parameters (self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, and spec_option?

Wait, the parameters for the function call in the docstring are a bit unclear. The original docstring says: "returns the result obtained by complex_action after option_name,(self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option) is input." That seems like a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be that the function is called with (self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option as arguments?

Assuming that, the code would be something like:

def create_complex_argumet_type(self, subcommand, type_name, option_name, spec_option):
    func = COMPLEX_TYPES[type_name]
    return func(self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path, subcommand, spec_option)

But wait, the parameters for the function call might be different. Let me check again. The original docstring says "complex_action after option_name,(self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option) is input." Maybe the parameters are (option_name, (self.vars, ...), subcommand, spec_option)? But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to call the retrieved function with the parameters (self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, and spec_option. So the function call would be func(self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path, subcommand, spec_option).

But I need to make sure that COMPLEX_TYPES is a dictionary that maps type names to functions. So the code would first get the function from COMPLEX_TYPES using type_name as the key, then call it with the parameters.

Also, there's a typo in the function name: 'create_complex_argumet_type' should be 'create_complex_argument_type', but the user provided the exact function name as given, so I have to keep it as is.

So the code would be:

def create_complex_argumet_type(self, subcommand, type_name, option_name, spec_option):
    """
    Returns the corresponding function in COMPLEX_TYPES based on type_name and returns the result obtained by complex_action after option_name,(self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option) is input.
    """
    func = COMPLEX_TYPES[type_name]
    return func(self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path, subcommand, spec_option)

But wait, the parameters for the function call might include option_name as well. The original docstring mentions option_name in the parameters. Let me check again.

The docstring says: "returns the result obtained by complex_action after option_name,(self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option) is input." The commas here are a bit confusing. Maybe the parameters are option_name, (self.vars, ...), subcommand, spec_option. But that would be four parameters. However, the function func might expect different parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function call is func(option_name, (self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option). But that's just a guess. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. The user's provided code might have a typo, but given the information, I'll proceed with the initial assumption that the function is called with self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path, subcommand, and spec_option as arguments.

So the code would be as above. Also, need to make sure that COMPLEX_TYPES is accessible in the scope. Since the user mentioned that the function is within a class, and the imported packages include 'collections', 'six', etc., but COMPLEX_TYPES is probably a dictionary defined elsewhere in the code.

Therefore, the generated code should be the function as described.
