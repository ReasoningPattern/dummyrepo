Okay, I need to generate the Python function is_fill_request_seq based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function should do. The docstring says it checks if a sequence can be converted to FillRequestSeq and returns a bool.

First, I should consider what conditions make a sequence valid for FillRequestSeq. Maybe it's related to the elements in the sequence. The context mentions other functions like is_fill_compute_seq and is_fill_request_el, so perhaps there's a pattern here.

Looking at the imported functions, there's is_fill_request_el which checks individual elements. Maybe the sequence needs all elements to pass that check. Or maybe there's a specific structure required, like the sequence being of a certain length or type.

Wait, the function is_fill_request_seq takes a sequence 'seq'. So perhaps the function checks if each element in the sequence is a valid FillRequest element. For example, using all() with is_fill_request_el on each element.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence needs to be non-empty or have certain properties. But the docstring doesn't specify, so I have to make an educated guess based on the context.

Since there's an is_fill_compute_seq function, maybe the logic is similar. For example, is_fill_compute_seq might check if all elements in the sequence are valid for FillCompute. So by analogy, is_fill_request_seq would check if all elements are valid for FillRequest.

Therefore, the function could be implemented as returning True if all elements in the sequence pass is_fill_request_el, and the sequence is not empty. Or maybe the sequence can be empty? The docstring isn't clear, but perhaps the function returns True if the sequence is valid, which might include being non-empty and all elements valid.

So putting it together, the code might look like:

def is_fill_request_seq(seq):
    """
    Check whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and bool is returned.
    """
    return all(is_fill_request_el(obj) for obj in seq) if seq else False

Wait, but what if the sequence is empty? The function returns False in that case. But maybe the empty sequence is considered valid? The docstring doesn't say. However, since the function is named is_fill_request_seq, perhaps it's expecting a sequence that can be converted, which might require at least one element. Or maybe not. Without more context, it's a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the check is just that all elements are valid, regardless of the sequence's length. So even an empty sequence would return True. But that's a guess.

Another possibility is that the sequence must be a list or some iterable, and each element must satisfy is_fill_request_el. So the code would check if every element in seq is valid.

Assuming that's the case, the code would use the all() function with a generator expression. Also, need to make sure that seq is iterable. But in Python, if seq is not iterable, the for loop would throw an error. However, the function's responsibility is to check if it can be converted, so maybe it's assumed that seq is a valid iterable.

So the code would be:

def is_fill_request_seq(seq):
    """
    Check whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and bool is returned.
    """
    try:
        return all(is_fill_request_el(obj) for obj in seq)
    except TypeError:
        return False

But wait, if seq is not iterable, the for loop would raise a TypeError. So wrapping it in a try-except block to handle that case, returning False if it's not iterable.

But the original problem didn't mention handling non-iterable sequences. The context might have other functions that handle that. However, the function's docstring says it checks whether the sequence can be converted, which implies that it's supposed to handle cases where the input isn't a valid sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the function assumes that seq is a sequence, and just checks the elements. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

But given that the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the context includes other functions like is_fill_compute_seq, which probably have similar logic, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function checks if all elements in the sequence are valid FillRequest elements, and returns True if so, False otherwise. Also, if the sequence is empty, perhaps it's considered invalid, so return False.

But maybe the empty sequence is allowed. For example, if FillRequestSeq can be empty. Without knowing, perhaps the function returns True for empty sequences. Let me think: if the sequence is empty, then all() returns True because there are no elements that fail. So the code would return True. But maybe that's not desired. However, the original code example I thought of would return True for empty sequences.

But the user's context may have other functions. For example, maybe is_fill_compute_seq returns False for empty sequences. But without knowing, I have to make a choice.

In the absence of specific information, I'll proceed with the code that checks if all elements in the sequence are valid, and returns True if that's the case, regardless of the sequence's length. So:

def is_fill_request_seq(seq):
    """
    Check whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and bool is returned.
    """
    return all(is_fill_request_el(obj) for obj in seq)

But this would return True for an empty sequence. If that's not desired, perhaps adding a check for non-empty. However, the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is designed to allow empty sequences.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence must be non-empty. But again, no info.

Given that, I think the most straightforward implementation is to check that all elements are valid, which would include empty sequences returning True. However, if the function is supposed to check that the sequence can be converted, maybe the sequence must be non-empty. But without knowing, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the sequence is of a certain type, like a list, and each element is valid. But the function's name is is_fill_request_seq, which might imply that the sequence is a specific type. However, the parameters don't indicate that.

In the absence of more information, I'll proceed with the code that checks all elements in the sequence are valid using is_fill_request_el, and returns True if that's the case. So the code would be as follows.
