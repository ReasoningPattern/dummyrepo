Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_choices_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is one of the available choices. The parameter is args, which are the received arguments. But wait, the function is part of a class, so I should consider the context provided.

Looking at the context, there's a lot of methods related to argument validation, like validate_min_max_args, validate_arg_deprecation, etc. The function probably uses some internal data structures or methods from the class. For example, maybe there's a spec that defines the available choices for each argument. The self might have access to a spec_dict or similar structure that contains the choices.

The function needs to iterate over the arguments and check each one against its allowed choices. How are the choices stored? Maybe in the spec_dict under each argument's definition. So for each arg in args, we look up its choices and ensure the value is in that list.

But how to get the available choices? Perhaps the class has a way to retrieve the spec for each argument. The method might use self.spec_helper or some other attribute. Alternatively, maybe the choices are stored in the defaults or vars. Wait, the context mentions self.defaults and self.vars. Maybe the choices are part of the spec that's stored in the class.

Another thing: the function's name is validate_choices_args, which suggests that it's validating that the arguments' values are among the choices specified in the spec. So the steps would be:

1. Iterate through each argument in args.
2. For each argument, retrieve the available choices from the spec.
3. Check if the argument's value is in the choices.
4. If not, raise an error or handle it somehow.

But the exact implementation details depend on how the choices are stored. Since the user hasn't provided the full code, I need to make assumptions based on common practices.

Assuming that each argument's choices are stored in a spec structure, perhaps in self.spec_dict. For example, each argument might have a 'choices' key. So for each arg in args, we get its spec, check if 'choices' exists, and then validate the value.

Wait, the function's parameters are (self, args). The args could be a dictionary of arguments. So, for each key-value pair in args, check if the value is in the choices for that key.

But how to get the choices? Maybe the class has a method or attribute that provides the choices for each argument. For example, self.spec_helper might have a method to get the choices. Alternatively, maybe the choices are stored in the spec_dict under each argument's entry.

Let me think of a sample code structure. Suppose that for each argument name, the spec has a 'choices' list. Then:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg_name, arg_value in args.items():
        # Get the choices for this argument from the spec
        choices = self.get_choices_for_arg(arg_name)
        if arg_value not in choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice for {arg_name}: {arg_value}. Available choices: {choices}")

But the problem is, the code needs to use existing methods or attributes from the class. Since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, I need to infer based on the context.

Looking at the context, there's a method called self.get_spec_defaults, which might be related to getting the spec. Also, self.spec_helper is mentioned. Maybe the choices are accessed via the spec_helper.

Alternatively, perhaps the choices are stored in the defaults or vars. But that's less likely. Another possibility is that the class has a method like _get_arg_spec that returns the spec for an argument, which includes choices.

Alternatively, maybe the choices are part of the argument's definition in the spec_dict. For example, if the spec_dict is a dictionary where each key is an argument name, and the value is a dictionary containing 'choices'.

Assuming that, the code could be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg_name, arg_value in args.items():
        if arg_name in self.spec_dict and 'choices' in self.spec_dict[arg_name]:
            choices = self.spec_dict[arg_name]['choices']
            if arg_value not in choices:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice for {arg_name}: {arg_value}. Available choices: {choices}")

But this is speculative. However, since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, I need to make a reasonable assumption. Also, the function might need to handle cases where the argument doesn't have choices, so it's skipped.

Another thing: the function might be part of a larger validation process, and perhaps it's using other methods like self.validate_arg_sources or self.validate_min_max_args. But without more info, I have to proceed with the given.

So, the code would iterate through the args, check each against the available choices, and raise an error if invalid. The exact error type and message might vary, but the core logic is checking membership in choices.

Thus, the generated code would look something like that. Now, I need to write the code accordingly, using the class's attributes as per the context.
