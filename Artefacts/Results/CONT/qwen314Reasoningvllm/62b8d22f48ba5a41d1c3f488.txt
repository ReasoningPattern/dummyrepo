Okay, I need to generate the popitem method for a class that's part of a cache implementation, probably using the collections module. The function's docstring says it removes the first inserted key and returns a tuple of key and value. 

Looking at the context, there's a self.__order attribute, which I guess is maintaining the order of insertion. The method needs to remove the first item from this order. Also, there's a self.pop method mentioned, but maybe that's for a different purpose. The __delitem__ method is present, which probably handles deleting an item from the cache.

So, the popitem method should first check if there are items in the cache. If not, maybe raise a KeyError. Then, get the first key from __order, which is likely a list or deque. Once the key is obtained, delete it using __delitem__ (which might handle the actual removal from the cache's data structure), and then remove the key from __order. Finally, return the key and value as a tuple.

Wait, but how do I get the value? The __delitem__ method might not return the value. Hmm, maybe the cache stores items in a dictionary, and __delitem__ just deletes the key. So, perhaps before deleting, I need to get the value from the dictionary. But the user hasn't provided the exact structure. However, the method needs to return the key and value. So maybe the __order holds the keys in insertion order, and the actual data is stored in a dictionary.

So steps:
1. Check if __order is empty. If yes, raise KeyError.
2. Get the first key from __order (maybe using pop(0) or similar).
3. Get the value from the cache's data structure (maybe self._cache or similar).
4. Delete the key using __delitem__.
5. Remove the key from __order.
6. Return (key, value).

But the context mentions self.popitem(self) and self.__order. Also, the __setitem__ uses cache_setitem, which might be a helper function. But for popitem, I need to get the first key from __order. Assuming __order is a list, then the first element is at index 0. So, key = self.__order.pop(0). Then, get the value from the cache's data structure. But where is the data stored? Maybe in a dictionary called self._cache or something similar. However, the user hasn't specified that. But given that it's a cache, perhaps the data is stored in a dictionary, and __delitem__ is used to delete it.

Wait, the __delitem__ is called with self.__delitem__(self, key, cache_delitem). So maybe the actual deletion is handled by that method, which might also handle the cache's internal data structure. But for popitem, after getting the key, we need to delete it and get the value. However, if __delitem__ doesn't return the value, maybe we need to retrieve it before deleting.

So, the code might look like:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError('cache is empty')
    key = self.__order.pop(0)
    value = self._cache[key]  # assuming _cache is the dict
    del self._cache[key]  # or use self.__delitem__(key)
    return (key, value)

But the problem is that the user hasn't specified the exact attributes. However, the context mentions that within the class, there's self.__init__ with maxsize and getsizeof, and methods like __setitem__, __delitem__, etc. So maybe the data is stored in a dictionary, and __delitem__ is used to delete the key. However, in the code, the __delitem__ is called with parameters (self, key, cache_delitem), which might be a helper function. So perhaps the actual deletion is done via that method, which might also handle size tracking or other cache-specific logic.

But for the purpose of popitem, after getting the key from __order, we need to delete it from the cache. So maybe the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError('cache is empty')
    key = self.__order.pop(0)
    value = self._cache[key]
    self.__delitem__(key)
    return (key, value)

But where is _cache defined? The user hasn't provided that. However, given the context of a cache, perhaps the data is stored in a dictionary, and the __delitem__ method is responsible for removing it. Alternatively, maybe the __delitem__ is a method that deletes the key from the cache's data structure.

Alternatively, maybe the __order is a deque, and the first item is popped from the left. Also, the code should handle the case when the cache is empty.

Another thing: the docstring says "the first inserted key", which implies that the order is maintained as insertion order. So __order is likely a list or deque that keeps track of the insertion order.

So putting it all together, the code would:

- Check if __order is empty, raise KeyError if so.
- Pop the first key from __order.
- Retrieve the value from the cache's data structure (assuming a dictionary, perhaps self._cache).
- Delete the key from the cache using __delitem__.
- Return the key and value as a tuple.

But without knowing the exact attributes, like the name of the dictionary, it's a bit tricky. However, given the context, maybe the __delitem__ method is responsible for deleting the key, and the value can be retrieved before deletion.

So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__order:
        raise KeyError('cache is empty')
    key = self.__order.pop(0)
    value = self._cache[key]
    self.__delitem__(key)
    return (key, value)

But I need to make sure that self._cache exists. Alternatively, maybe the __delitem__ is a method that also retrieves the value. However, that's not standard. So the code above is a plausible implementation.
