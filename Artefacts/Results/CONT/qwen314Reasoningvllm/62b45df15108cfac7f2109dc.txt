Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the status_str method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the method should return a string by visiting the sorted self.messages list, adding the prefix and each element.

First, I need to make sure I understand what the method is supposed to do. The key points are: iterate over the sorted self.messages, prepend the prefix to each element, and combine them into a single string. But how exactly? Are the elements being joined with newlines or some other separator? The docstring isn't explicit, but looking at the context might help.

Looking at the context, there's a mention of self.messages, which is likely a list of messages. The method is part of a class that has attributes like num_warnings, num_errors, and methods like warning, error, and info. The status_str might be generating a summary of these messages.

Since the docstring says "visiting the sorted self.messages list, each visit add prefix and the element", it probably means that each message in the sorted list is prefixed with the given 'prefix' string. The resulting elements are then joined into a single string. The default prefix is an empty string.

So the steps are: sort self.messages, iterate over each message, prepend the prefix, and join them. But how are they joined? The original code might have used newlines, but without more context, maybe the user expects a simple join with newlines. Alternatively, maybe each message is on a new line.

Wait, looking at the context, there's a __str__ method. Maybe status_str is similar to __str__, but with a prefix. But without seeing the existing code, I have to go by the docstring.

The function needs to return a string. So the code would be something like:

sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
result = '\n'.join([prefix + msg for msg in sorted_messages])
return result

But maybe the prefix is added before each message. Also, the original code might have used a different separator. However, the docstring doesn't specify, so I have to make an assumption. Since the user provided the function signature and docstring, and no other info, the safest approach is to join the messages with newlines, each prefixed by the given prefix.

Another thing to consider: the messages might be strings, so the list comprehension would handle them. Also, the method is part of a class, so self.messages is accessible.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return a string with visiting the sorted self.messages list, each visit add prefix and the element in the sorted self.messages list.
    """
    return '\n'.join([prefix + msg for msg in sorted(self.messages)])

Wait, but maybe the messages are not strings. But given the context, it's likely they are. Also, the method's name suggests it's for status messages, so each message is a string.

Alternatively, maybe the messages are objects with a __str__ method. But the docstring says "add prefix and the element", implying that the element is converted to a string. So the code would work as written.

I think that's the correct approach. So the generated code would sort the messages, prepend the prefix to each, and join with newlines.
