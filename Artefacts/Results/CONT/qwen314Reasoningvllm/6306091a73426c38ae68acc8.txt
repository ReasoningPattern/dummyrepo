Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called list_of_file_names and takes settings_dirs and spec_option as parameters. The docstring says it creates and returns a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

First, I need to figure out what the actual implementation should be. The docstring mentions using cli.ListOfFileNames(), so I assume that cli is a module or object that has a ListOfFileNames class or function. But the user didn't provide the exact details of that, so I'll have to make some assumptions.

The function's parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option. The name suggests that settings_dirs might be a list of directories to search for files, and spec_option could be some option that affects how the files are listed. 

The return type is supposed to be an IniType complex type. Maybe IniType is a class from the infrared package? Since the imported packages include infrared, perhaps that's where IniType comes from. But the function is supposed to return an instance created via cli.ListOfFileNames(). Hmm, maybe cli.ListOfFileNames() is a factory function that returns an IniType instance.

Wait, the docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So the actual code would probably call cli.ListOfFileNames() with some arguments, maybe settings_dirs and spec_option. But how?

Looking at the parameters, maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames function requires settings_dirs and spec_option. So the function list_of_file_names would just wrap that call. But the user's code might need to process the directories and files first.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to collect file names from the settings_dirs and then pass them to cli.ListOfFileNames. For example, gathering all files in those directories and then creating the IniType with those files.

But without more context, it's hard to tell. The user mentioned imported packages are os, pytest, infrared. So perhaps the code needs to use os to list files in the directories.

Wait, the function's name is list_of_file_names. Maybe it's supposed to collect all the file names from the settings_dirs, maybe filtering based on spec_option, and then pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames to create the IniType.

But how to implement that? Let's think. For each directory in settings_dirs, we can list all files. Then, perhaps filter them based on spec_option. But what is spec_option? Maybe it's a string that specifies a pattern or a type of files to include.

But since the user hasn't provided specifics, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's say that spec_option is a file extension or a pattern. For example, if spec_option is 'ini', we collect .ini files.

Alternatively, maybe spec_option is a flag that determines whether to include certain files. But without more info, it's hard to know.

Alternatively, maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes the directories and the spec option, and returns the IniType. So the function list_of_file_names is just a wrapper that calls cli.ListOfFileNames with the given parameters.

But the user's docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So the code would be something like:

return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But then why is the function named list_of_file_names? Maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a class that needs to be instantiated with some parameters, and the function is supposed to generate the list of file names first and then pass them to that class.

Alternatively, maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that requires a list of file names, which this function generates from settings_dirs and spec_option.

So the steps could be:

1. Collect all file names from the settings_dirs. Maybe recursively, or just in the top level?
2. Apply some filtering based on spec_option.
3. Pass the list of file names to cli.ListOfFileNames to create the IniType.

But how to collect the files? Using os.listdir for each directory in settings_dirs, then checking if they are files.

So code like:

file_names = []
for dir in settings_dirs:
    for file in os.listdir(dir):
        if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir, file)):
            # apply spec_option filtering here
            if some_condition(file, spec_option):
                file_names.append(os.path.join(dir, file))
return cli.ListOfFileNames(file_names)

But what is the condition? Since spec_option is a parameter, perhaps it's a pattern to match, like a file extension. For example, if spec_option is 'ini', then check if the file ends with .ini.

But without knowing the exact logic, this is speculative. However, the user hasn't provided more context, so I have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the spec_option is a boolean that determines whether to include hidden files or something else. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the spec_option is not used in this function, but the docstring is just indicating that the cli.ListOfFileNames is used. But that seems unlikely.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended code is simply to call cli.ListOfFileNames with the given parameters, assuming that it handles the file listing. But that seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names and then pass that to cli.ListOfFileNames. For example:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    files = []
    for dir in settings_dirs:
        for file in os.listdir(dir):
            if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir, file)):
                files.append(os.path.join(dir, file))
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(files, spec_option)

But again, without knowing how cli.ListOfFileNames is supposed to be used, this is a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a class that takes the directories and the spec option, and the function is just instantiating it.

But the user's docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So perhaps the cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that returns an IniType instance. Therefore, the function list_of_file_names is just a wrapper that calls that function with the parameters.

But then why are the parameters settings_dirs and spec_option? Maybe cli.ListOfFileNames expects those parameters.

In that case, the code would be:

return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But then the function's name is list_of_file_names, which might imply that it's generating a list of file names, but the actual implementation is just passing the parameters to cli.ListOfFileNames.

This is confusing. However, given the limited information, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the function as a wrapper that calls cli.ListOfFileNames with the given parameters, assuming that the cli module is available and that ListOfFileNames is a function that takes those parameters and returns the IniType.

So the code would be:

import os
import cli  # assuming cli is a module

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But the user mentioned that the imported packages are os, pytest, infrared. So maybe cli is part of infrared? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be infrared.cli?

Alternatively, maybe the cli is a module that's imported, but the user hasn't mentioned it. However, the user said that the imported packages are os, pytest, infrared. So perhaps cli is part of the infrared package. For example, infrared.cli.ListOfFileNames.

In that case, the code would be:

from infrared import cli

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But again, without knowing the exact structure of the cli module, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names and then pass that to some function in cli. For example, if cli has a function that takes a list of files and returns IniType.

But given the ambiguity, and the user's instruction to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps the intended code is simply to return the result of cli.ListOfFileNames() with the given parameters.

So the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But then, the user might have intended that the function does some processing of the directories and files before passing them to cli.ListOfFileNames. However, without more context, this is impossible to know.

Another possibility is that the function is supposed to collect the list of file names from the settings_dirs, and then pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames. For example:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    files = []
    for dir in settings_dirs:
        for file in os.listdir(dir):
            if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(dir, file)):
                files.append(os.path.join(dir, file))
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(files, spec_option)

But again, the spec_option's role here is unclear. Maybe it's used to filter the files. For example, if spec_option is a pattern, then we can use fnmatch or something.

But since the user hasn't provided that detail, I can't know. Given the ambiguity, I think the safest approach is to assume that the function is a wrapper that calls cli.ListOfFileNames with the given parameters, as per the docstring.
