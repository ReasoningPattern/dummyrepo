Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function generate_default_observer_schema based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it generates the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in spec.manifest where a custom schema hasn't been specified.

First, I should check what parameters the function takes. The parameter is 'app', which is probably an application object that has some attributes related to Kubernetes resources. The function needs to process the spec.manifest of the app.

Looking at the context provided, there are several helper functions mentioned like generate_default_observer_schema_dict and generate_default_observer_schema_list. Maybe the main function uses these helpers to process different types of manifests (dicts and lists).

So, the plan is: iterate over each resource in app.spec.manifest. For each resource, check if it has a custom observer schema. If not, generate the default one using the helper functions. Then, update the app's observer schema accordingly.

Wait, the function's name is generate_default_observer_schema, which might be responsible for generating these schemas. The helpers generate_default_observer_schema_dict and generate_default_observer_schema_list probably handle the actual schema generation for dictionaries and lists, respectively.

So, the main function would loop through each item in app.spec.manifest. For each item, check if 'observer_schema' is present. If not, generate it using the appropriate helper based on the type of the manifest item (dict or list). Then, assign this generated schema to the resource's observer_schema.

But how to determine if it's a dict or list? The helper functions are named generate_default_observer_schema_dict and generate_default_observer_schema_list. So maybe the main function checks the type of the manifest item and calls the corresponding helper.

Wait, the parameters for the helpers are manifest_dict and manifest_list. So maybe the main function iterates over each resource in app.spec.manifest, and for each resource, checks if it's a dict or list. Then, calls the respective helper to generate the schema.

But the original function's docstring says "for each Kubernetes resource present in spec.manifest". So perhaps each entry in spec.manifest is a resource, and each resource may have its own spec. Or maybe the spec.manifest is a list of resources, each of which is a dictionary.

Assuming that app.spec.manifest is a list of resources, each being a dictionary. Then, for each resource in that list, check if it has an 'observer_schema' key. If not, generate the default schema using generate_default_observer_schema_dict (since each resource is a dict). But maybe the helper functions are designed to take the manifest and generate the schema for it.

Alternatively, maybe the main function calls generate_default_observer_schema_dict or generate_default_observer_schema_list depending on whether the manifest is a dict or list. But the function's name is generate_default_observer_schema, which is called with 'app' as an argument. So perhaps the app has a spec.manifest that is a list of resources, each of which is a dict, and for each of those, we generate the observer schema if not present.

Putting this together, the code might look like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not resource.get('observer_schema'):
            if isinstance(resource, dict):
                resource['observer_schema'] = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(resource, first_level=True)
            elif isinstance(resource, list):
                resource['observer_schema'] = generate_default_observer_schema_list(resource)
    return app

But I need to check the parameters of the helper functions. The generate_default_observer_schema_dict takes manifest_dict and first_level. The generate_default_observer_schema_list takes manifest_list. So, for each resource in app.spec.manifest, which is a list, if the resource is a dict, call generate_default_observer_schema_dict with the resource and first_level=True. If it's a list, call generate_default_observer_schema_list with the resource.

Wait, but the app's spec.manifest is probably a list of resources, each of which is a dict. So maybe the code is:

for resource in app.spec.manifest:
    if 'observer_schema' not in resource:
        resource['observer_schema'] = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(resource, first_level=True)

But why first_level=True? Maybe because when generating the schema for the top-level manifest, it's the first level. The helper function generate_default_observer_schema_dict might need to know whether it's processing the first level of the manifest or a nested structure.

Alternatively, maybe the main function is supposed to generate the observer schema for the entire app's manifest, not per resource. But the docstring says "for each Kubernetes resource present in spec.manifest", which suggests that each resource in the manifest is processed individually.

So, the code would loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest, check if it has an observer_schema, and if not, generate it using the helper functions based on the type of the resource.

But the helper functions are named generate_default_observer_schema_dict and generate_default_observer_schema_list. So, for a resource that is a dict, use the dict helper, for a list, use the list helper.

So, the code would be something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer_schema' not in resource:
            if isinstance(resource, dict):
                resource['observer_schema'] = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(resource, first_level=True)
            elif isinstance(resource, list):
                resource['observer_schema'] = generate_default_observer_schema_list(resource)
    return app

But I need to make sure that the helper functions are called correctly. Also, the function returns 'app' after modifying the resources. But maybe the function is supposed to update the app's observer schema in some way, but the exact details depend on the helper functions.

Another thing to consider: the original function might not return anything, but the code above returns 'app'. However, the original function's docstring doesn't mention returning anything, but the code may modify the app in place. However, in Python, if the app is a mutable object, changes to it would be reflected outside the function. But the return statement may be optional.

But looking at the context, there are functions like update_last_applied_manifest_from_resp which take app as an argument and modify it. So perhaps generate_default_observer_schema is also modifying the app in place, and returns it.

Alternatively, the function may not return anything, but the code would still modify the app's spec.manifest.

But the code example I wrote above would modify each resource in app.spec.manifest by adding the observer_schema if it's missing.

So, putting it all together, the generated code would be as follows.
