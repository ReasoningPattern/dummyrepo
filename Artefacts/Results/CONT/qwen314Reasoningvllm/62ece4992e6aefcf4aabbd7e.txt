Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called _resolve_string based on the given signature and docstring. The function takes a matcher, which I assume is some kind of regex match object. The docstring says that the matcher has a name and an optional default value in its group dict. So, the first step is to get the name from the matcher. Maybe the name is in the group dict under a key like 'name'?

Then, the function needs to look up the environment variable using os.environ. If the variable isn't found, it should check if there's a default value in the group dict. If there's a default, return that. Otherwise, raise an error.

Wait, the docstring mentions that the matcher's group dict has an optional default value. So maybe the group dict has a key like 'default'? Or maybe the matcher has a group named 'default'? I need to figure out how the matcher is structured. Since the user hasn't provided more context, I'll make an assumption here. Let's say that the matcher has a group called 'name' which is the environment variable name, and a group called 'default' which is the optional default value.

So the steps would be:

1. Extract the name from the matcher's group dict. Like name = matcher.group('name').
2. Check if the name exists in the environment variables.
3. If it does, return the value.
4. If not, check if there's a default value in the group dict (matcher.group('default')).
5. If there's a default, return that.
6. If neither, raise an error, probably a KeyError or a custom exception. The docstring says "Error is raised", but in Python, it's better to use specific exceptions. Maybe KeyError?

Wait, the docstring says "If the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised." So, the error should be raised when both the environment variable is missing and there's no default. So, in code:

name = matcher.group('name')
default = matcher.group('default')

value = os.environ.get(name)
if value is not None:
    return value
elif default is not None:
    return default
else:
    raise KeyError(f"Environment variable {name} not found and no default provided")

But wait, the matcher might not have a 'default' group. So, maybe the group dict has a key 'default' which could be present or not. So, using matcher.groupdict() to get the groups. Alternatively, maybe the matcher is a regex match object, and the groups are accessed via group(1), group(2), etc., but the docstring mentions a group dict, so probably using groupdict().

Wait, the function's docstring says "matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict." So, the group dict has 'name' and possibly 'default'.

So, perhaps:

groups = matcher.groupdict()
name = groups['name']
default = groups.get('default')

Then proceed as before.

But what if the 'name' is not present in the group dict? The function's purpose is to resolve the string, so perhaps the matcher is expected to have the 'name' group. But the docstring doesn't mention that. Maybe the code should handle that? But the problem says that the function is supposed to get the value from the environment given a matcher that contains a name. So perhaps the matcher is structured such that the name is in the group dict, and the code can safely access groups['name'].

So, putting it all together:

import os

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    groups = matcher.groupdict()
    name = groups['name']
    default = groups.get('default')
    value = os.environ.get(name)
    if value is not None:
        return value
    elif default is not None:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"Environment variable {name} not found and no default provided")

Wait, but the error message in the docstring says "an Error is raised", but in Python, KeyError is a specific exception. However, maybe the user expects a different error, like a ValueError. But the docstring doesn't specify, so I'll go with KeyError as it's related to missing keys.

Another thing: the default value could be a string, but os.environ.get returns a string. So if the default is provided, it's probably a string. But the code just returns it as is.

I think that's the plan. Now, code accordingly.
