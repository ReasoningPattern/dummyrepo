Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_version_inventories method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that each version should have an inventory up to that point. Also, we need to keep track of any content digests that differ from those in the root inventory. The version_dirs parameter is an array of version directory names in sequence.

Looking at the context provided, there are several methods and attributes available. For example, there's self.validate_inventory, self.validate_inventory_digest, self.read_inventory_digest, self.check_additional_digests, and others. The function needs to use these to validate each version's inventory and check digests.

First, the function should iterate over each version directory in version_dirs. For each version, it probably needs to check if the inventory exists and is valid. Then, compare the digests in that version's inventory with the root inventory's digests. If there are differences, those should be recorded.

The method might start by initializing some variables to track errors or differences. Then, for each version directory, it would read the inventory file and its digest file. Using the validate_inventory method, it checks the inventory's validity. Then, compare the digests using read_inventory_digest and check_additional_digests to find any discrepancies.

I should make sure to call the appropriate methods in the correct order. Also, the function needs to update the status string, perhaps using self.status_str. The exact implementation details depend on how the existing methods work, but based on the context, I'll structure the code to use those methods.

Potential steps:
1. Initialize a list to collect errors or differences.
2. Iterate over each version directory in version_dirs.
3. For each version, get the inventory file path and digest file path.
4. Validate the inventory using self.validate_inventory.
5. Read the digest from the inventory digest file.
6. Compare with the root inventory's digests using check_additional_digests.
7. Accumulate any differences.
8. Update the status string with the results.

I need to make sure that the code uses the correct method names and parameters as per the context. Also, handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during validation. The code should not include any explanations, just the Python code in markdown format as specified.
