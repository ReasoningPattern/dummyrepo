Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the to_csv method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring mentions that this function is deprecated starting from Lena 0.5, and that iterables are converted to tables. The task is to convert the graph's points to CSV format.

First, I need to understand what the method is supposed to do. The parameters are separator (default comma) and header (optional). The description says that for each point, first its coordinate is converted to string, separated by the separator, then each part of its value. So, each point in the graph has coordinates and values, and these need to be flattened into CSV rows.

Since the method is deprecated, I should probably add a deprecation warning. The docstring mentions using lena.output.ToCSV for converting Graph to CSV in a Lena sequence, so maybe the current method is just a helper or legacy code.

Looking at the context, the class has attributes like self.points, self.scale, self.dim, etc. The points are probably a list of data points, each with coordinates and values. For example, each point might be a tuple where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values.

So, the steps for the to_csv method would be:

1. Issue a deprecation warning if the user is using this method.
2. Check if the header is provided. If so, add it as the first line.
3. Iterate over each point in self.points.
4. For each point, convert the coordinates to strings, then the values, all separated by the separator.
5. Collect all these lines and return them as a single string with newlines.

But how exactly are the coordinates and values structured? The docstring says that for each point, first its coordinate is converted, then each part of its value. So maybe each point is a tuple where the first part is the coordinate (maybe a list or tuple) and the rest are the values. For example, a point might be (x, y, value1, value2), so coordinates are x and y, and values are value1 and value2. Then, the CSV line would be "x,y,value1,value2".

Wait, but the description says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So perhaps the coordinates are one part, and the values are another. For example, if the coordinate is a tuple (x, y), then converted to "x,y", and then the value parts are added. But how are the values structured? Maybe each point has a value that's a list or tuple, and each element of that is added as separate fields.

Alternatively, maybe the point is structured as (coordinate, value), where coordinate is a tuple and value is another tuple. Then, the CSV line would be the coordinate elements joined by separator, followed by the value elements joined by separator. But how to split them?

Alternatively, maybe the point is a tuple where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values. For example, in a 2D graph, each point might be (x, y, value), so coordinates are x and y, and the value is a single value. Then the CSV line would be "x,y,value".

But the docstring says "multidimensional", so maybe coordinates can be multiple dimensions. For example, a 3D point might have coordinates (x, y, z) and then values. But how are the values structured? Maybe each point has a value that's a list, and each element is a separate field.

So, for each point, we need to take the coordinates (as a list or tuple), convert them to strings, then take the value (which might be a list or tuple) and convert each part to strings, then join all with the separator.

But how to get the coordinates and values from each point? The code may need to know how the points are structured. For example, if each point is a tuple where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values. For example, in a 2D graph, a point might be (x, y, value1, value2). Then, the coordinates are x and y, and the values are value1 and value2. So the CSV line would be "x,y,value1,value2".

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are the first element (a tuple) and the value is the second element (another tuple). For example, point = ((x, y), (v1, v2)), then the CSV line would be "x,y,v1,v2".

But without knowing the exact structure of self.points, it's a bit tricky. However, looking at the context, the class has self.dim, which might be the dimension of the coordinates. For example, if dim is 2, then each point's coordinate has 2 elements.

Assuming that each point in self.points is structured as (coordinate_tuple, value_tuple), then for each point, we can split into coordinate and value parts.

But how to get that? Maybe the points are stored as tuples where the first part is the coordinate and the rest are the values. For example, for a 2D graph with one value per point, each point is (x, y, value). Then, the coordinates are x and y, and the value is value. So the CSV line would be "x,y,value".

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are the first dim elements, and the rest are the values. For example, if dim is 2, then for a point (x, y, v1, v2), the coordinates are x and y, and the values are v1 and v2. Then, the CSV line would be "x,y,v1,v2".

But how to determine that? The code may need to split the point into coordinates and values based on the dim. However, the code may not have access to that information. Alternatively, perhaps the points are structured as (coordinate, value), where coordinate is a tuple and value is another tuple. For example, ((x, y), (v1, v2)).

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the code should process each point as follows: for each point, the coordinates are the first part (maybe determined by self.dim), and the rest are the values. Or perhaps the coordinates are the first elements, and the value is the remaining elements. For example, if the point is (x, y, v), then coordinates are x and y, and value is v. Then, the CSV line would be "x,y,v".

Alternatively, if the point is a tuple where the first element is the coordinate (a tuple) and the second is the value (a tuple), then we can split them.

But given that the user hasn't provided the structure of self.points, perhaps the code should assume that each point is a tuple where the first elements are the coordinates (based on self.dim) and the rest are the values. For example, in a 2D graph, each point is (x, y, value1, value2, ...), and the code would take x and y as coordinates, then the rest as values.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to take the entire point as a list of values, and the coordinates are the first dim elements, then the rest are values. For example, if dim is 2, then for a point (x, y, v1, v2), coordinates are x and y, and values are v1 and v2.

So the code would process each point as follows:

For a point in self.points:

- Split into coordinates (first dim elements) and values (remaining elements)
- Convert coordinates to strings, joined by separator
- Convert values to strings, joined by separator
- Combine the two parts with the separator in between?

Wait, the docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So perhaps the coordinate is converted to a string with separator, then each part of the value is added as separate fields. So, if the coordinate is (x, y), then converted to "x,y", and if the value is (v1, v2), then the entire line is "x,y,v1,v2".

So, the code would take each point, split into coordinates and values, convert each part to strings, then join all with the separator.

So, for each point, the code would:

- Take the coordinates (based on self.dim)
- Take the values (the rest of the elements)
- Convert all to strings
- Join them all with the separator.

But how to split the point into coordinates and values? If the point is a tuple, and self.dim is the number of coordinates, then the coordinates are the first self.dim elements, and the rest are the values.

So, for example, if a point is (x, y, v1, v2), and self.dim is 2, then coordinates are x and y, values are v1 and v2. Then, the CSV line is "x,y,v1,v2".

So, the code would need to process each point in self.points as follows:

for point in self.points:
    coords = point[:self.dim]
    values = point[self.dim:]
    row = [str(coord) for coord in coords] + [str(val) for val in values]
    line = separator.join(row)

But wait, the docstring says that for each point, first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value. So maybe the coordinates are joined with separator, then the values are joined with separator, and then those two parts are joined with separator? No, that would be "x,y,v1,v2" if coords are x,y and values are v1,v2. But that's the same as joining all elements with separator. So perhaps the code is supposed to take all elements of the point (coordinates and values) and join them with the separator.

Wait, but the docstring says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value. So maybe the coordinate is a single string (like "x,y") and the value is a list of parts (like [v1, v2]), then the entire line is "x,y,v1,v2".

But how to split the point into coordinate and value? If the point is structured as (coordinate_tuple, value_tuple), then the code would split into those parts. But how to know that? Without knowing the structure of self.points, this is ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to take the entire point's elements as the coordinates and values. For example, if the point is a tuple of (x, y, v), then the coordinates are x and y, and the value is v. Then, the line is "x,y,v".

But how to know that? Maybe the code is supposed to assume that the coordinates are the first elements, and the rest are values. So, for each point, the first self.dim elements are coordinates, the rest are values.

Assuming that, then the code would process each point as:

coords = point[:self.dim]
values = point[self.dim:]

Then, the row is coords + values, all converted to strings and joined with separator.

But how to get self.dim? The context shows that the class has self.dim as an attribute. So, the code can access self.dim.

So, putting this together:

The to_csv method would:

- Check if header is not None, then add it as the first line.
- For each point in self.points:
   - Split into coords and values based on self.dim
   - Convert each element to string
   - Join with separator
- Collect all lines and return as a single string with newlines.

But also, the method is deprecated. So, the code should emit a deprecation warning.

So, the code would start with:

import warnings

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    # rest of the code

Then, process the points.

Now, the header: if header is not None, then the first line is header, followed by a newline. Then, each row is added.

So, the code could collect lines in a list. If header is provided, add it. Then, for each point, generate the line and add to the list. Then, join with '\n'.

So:

lines = []
if header is not None:
    lines.append(header)
for point in self.points:
    # process point into line
    lines.append(line)
return '\n'.join(lines)

But how to process the point into line?

Assuming that each point is a tuple, and self.dim is the number of coordinates:

coords = point[:self.dim]
values = point[self.dim:]
row = [str(x) for x in coords] + [str(x) for x in values]
line = separator.join(row)

But what if the point is not a tuple or list? Well, the code assumes that self.points contains such structures.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import warnings

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coords = point[:self.dim]
        values = point[self.dim:]
        row = [str(coord) for coord in coords] + [str(val) for val in values]
        line = separator.join(row)
        lines.append(line)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

But wait, the docstring says that the header is the first string of the output, and a new line is added automatically. So if header is provided, it's added as the first line, then each point's line is added. So the code above does that.

But what if the header is not provided? Then, the lines list is empty, and the code returns an empty string? Or maybe the code should return the lines of the points. But the docstring says that the header is optional. So, if header is None, then the lines are just the points' lines.

But what if there are no points? Then, the code returns an empty string. That seems acceptable.

But the code needs to access self.points and self.dim. The context shows that self.points is an attribute, and self.dim is also present.

So, this should be the code. However, the user's context mentions that the method is part of a class, and the code may need to handle cases where self.points is empty, etc.

Another thing: the docstring says that the header is the first string of the output, and a new line is added automatically. So if the header is provided, it's added as the first line, followed by a newline. Then, each line from the points is added, each followed by a newline. But when we join with '\n', the lines are separated by newlines. So, for example, if header is "x,y,value", then the first line is "x,y,value", then the next lines are the data lines. The join adds newlines between them, so that's correct.

So, the code seems correct.

Now, check for possible errors. What if self.dim is zero? Or if the points have fewer elements than self.dim? But that's probably handled by the code, though it may raise an error if the point is not long enough. But that's up to the data structure.

So, the generated code should be as above.
