Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the merge_extra_vars function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function takes a vars_dict, which is a dictionary, and extra_vars, which is a list. The goal is to extend vars_dict with the extra_vars. So, I need to merge the extra variables into the existing dictionary.

Wait, how exactly should the merging happen? Since extra_vars is a list, maybe each element in the list is a key-value pair that needs to be added to vars_dict. But the parameters are a bit unclear. Let me check the context provided.

The context mentions that this function is used within a class, and there's a method called generate_settings. Also, the function is called as self.merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars). The parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring says to extend vars_dict with extra-vars. 

Assuming that extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, perhaps as a list of tuples or a list of strings in some format. But without more context, I need to make an educated guess. Maybe the extra_vars are key-value pairs that need to be added to vars_dict. For example, if extra_vars is a list like ['key1=value1', 'key2=value2'], then we need to split each string into key and value and update the dictionary.

Alternatively, if extra_vars is a list of tuples, like [('key1', 'value1'), ...], then we can directly update the dictionary. But the function's parameters don't specify the type of extra_vars beyond being a list. The docstring says "List of extra-vars", which is a bit vague.

Looking back at the function signature, the extra_vars parameter is optional and defaults to None. So, if extra_vars is None, the function should do nothing. Otherwise, process the list.

In the absence of more specific information, perhaps the intended behavior is to add each item in extra_vars as a key in vars_dict, with the value being the item itself. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars are in the format of 'key=value' strings, which need to be parsed.

Wait, considering that this is part of the infrared package, which is related to configuration management, maybe the extra_vars are similar to Ansible's extra vars, which are key-value pairs. So, perhaps each element in extra_vars is a string in the format 'key=value', and the function should split them and add them to vars_dict.

So, the steps would be:

1. Check if extra_vars is not None.
2. Iterate over each item in extra_vars.
3. For each item, split into key and value by '='.
4. Update vars_dict with the key-value pair.

But how to handle cases where the key already exists? The docstring says "extend", which might mean that existing keys are overwritten. So, using the update method would do that.

So, the code would look something like:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        return vars_dict
    for var in extra_vars:
        key, value = var.split('=')
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

Wait, but what if the extra_vars is not in the 'key=value' format? Maybe the function expects extra_vars to be a list of tuples or something else. However, given the limited information, this seems like a plausible approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge another dictionary into vars_dict. But the parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list. So that's less likely.

Another possibility is that the extra_vars is a list of variable names, and their values are looked up elsewhere. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Given that the user provided the function signature and the docstring, and the context mentions infrared, which might be related to configuration, I'll proceed with the assumption that each element in extra_vars is a 'key=value' string, and split them accordingly.

So, the code would process each string in extra_vars, split into key and value, and add them to vars_dict. Also, since the function is part of a class (as per the context), maybe it's modifying the dictionary in place. However, the function's return type isn't specified. The original code might be intended to modify the vars_dict in place, but the current code returns it. However, the original code's return is not specified in the docstring. But the user's example code may not include returns, but the function may need to return the modified dictionary.

Alternatively, since the function is called as self.merge_extra_vars(...), perhaps it's modifying the dictionary in place. However, in Python, dictionaries are mutable, so if the function modifies vars_dict, the changes will be reflected outside the function. But the function may or may not return it.

But the original function's code is not provided, so I need to make an assumption. Let me check the parameters again. The first parameter is vars_dict, which is the dictionary to merge into. So, the function is likely to modify this dictionary in place. However, in Python, if you pass a dictionary to a function and modify it, the changes are reflected outside. But if the function is supposed to return a new dictionary, that's different.

But given that the function is called as self.merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars), and assuming that vars_dict is a parameter that's being modified, perhaps the function is intended to update it in place. However, the code I wrote earlier returns vars_dict, which is redundant if it's modified in place. But perhaps the function is supposed to return the updated dictionary.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to create a new dictionary. But that's not clear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to update the vars_dict in place and return it. So, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        return vars_dict
    for var in extra_vars:
        key, value = var.split('=')
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

But what if the extra_vars is not in the 'key=value' format? For example, if there's a key without a value, this would raise a ValueError. However, given the context of infrared, which might be using this for configuration variables, this seems plausible.

Another consideration: the function may need to handle cases where the same key appears multiple times in extra_vars. The last occurrence would overwrite the previous ones, which is standard behavior.

So, this code should handle that.

I think this is a reasonable implementation based on the given information.
