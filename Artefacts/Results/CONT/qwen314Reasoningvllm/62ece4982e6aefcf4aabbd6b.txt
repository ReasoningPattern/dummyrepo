Okay, I need to write a Python function called subclasses(cls) that returns all subclasses of a given class recursively. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, a class can have subclasses, and those subclasses can have their own subclasses. So, the function needs to collect all of them, not just the direct ones. That means I need to traverse the class hierarchy recursively.

The built-in function getattr might be useful here. For a given class, I can check if it has a __subclasses__ attribute. Wait, right, every class in Python has a __subclasses__() method that returns a list of direct subclasses. So, I can start by getting the direct subclasses and then recursively get their subclasses as well.

So the plan is: For the input class cls, collect all direct subclasses using cls.__subclasses__(). Then, for each of those subclasses, repeat the process. But I need to make sure I don't end up in an infinite loop, but I think since each subclass is checked once and added to a set, that's handled automatically.

Wait, but how to collect them all? Maybe using a set to avoid duplicates, but in Python's class hierarchy, I don't think there are cycles, so maybe a list is sufficient. However, using a set would prevent duplicates if any for some reason.

Wait, but the __subclasses__ method returns all direct subclasses. So, for example, if I have a class A, and B is a subclass of A, and C is a subclass of B, then A's __subclasses__ would include B, and B's would include C. So, to get all subclasses of A, I need to collect B and C.

So, the function can be implemented with a recursive approach. Let me think about the steps:

Initialize a list or set to collect all subclasses. Then, for the given class, iterate over each subclass in cls.__subclasses__(), add them to the collection, and then recursively process each of those subclasses.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return all subclasses, not including the original class itself. So, for example, if we call subclasses(A), it should return B, C, etc., but not A.

So, the base case is when a class has no subclasses, then it returns an empty list. Otherwise, for each subclass, we collect them and then their subclasses.

But how to implement this recursively. Let's think of it as a helper function. Maybe the main function can collect all the subclasses by iterating through each direct subclass and then appending the results of recursively calling subclasses on each of them.

So, the code could look something like this:

def subclasses(cls):
    result = []
    for sub in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.append(sub)
        result.extend(subclasses(sub))
    return result

Wait, but this would collect all subclasses, including indirect ones. Let me test this logic with an example.

Suppose we have:

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class C(B):
    pass

Then, subclasses(A) should return [B, C]. Let's see:

When calling subclasses(A), it iterates over A's direct subclasses, which is [B]. Then, for B, it appends B to result, then calls subclasses(B). Subclasses(B) would get [C], append C, then call subclasses(C), which has no subclasses, so returns empty. So the result for A would be [B, C]. That seems correct.

But what about if there are multiple levels? Like D(C), then subclasses(A) would include B, C, D. Yes.

But what about if a class has multiple subclasses? Like A has B and C, and B has D, then the result would be [B, C, D]. Correct.

But the code as written would collect all the subclasses in a list. However, the order might not be guaranteed, but the problem doesn't specify any order requirement.

But what about the original class's subclasses? The function is supposed to return all subclasses of the given class, recursively. So the code above seems correct.

But wait, the function is supposed to return all subclasses, not including the class itself. So the code is correct because it starts with the direct subclasses.

But what about if the class has no subclasses? Then it returns an empty list, which is correct.

So, the code would be:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    result = []
    for sub in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.append(sub)
        result.extend(subclasses(sub))
    return result

But wait, this approach uses recursion. However, for very deep inheritance chains, this could hit the recursion limit. But the problem says to return all subclasses recursively, so perhaps that's acceptable.

Another thing to consider: the __subclasses__ method returns a list of all direct subclasses. However, in some cases, especially with metaclasses or dynamic class creation, this might not capture all possible subclasses. But according to the Python documentation, __subclasses__() returns all direct subclasses registered with the class. So this should work for most standard cases.

But what about when a subclass is added after the initial call? Well, the __subclasses__ method returns the current subclasses at the time of the call, so if the class hierarchy is modified after the initial call, this might not capture those. But that's probably beyond the scope of this function.

So the code seems correct. Let me check for possible errors.

Wait, the function is supposed to return all subclasses, but the code as written returns a list of classes. However, the problem says to return all subclasses, which would be the list of classes. So that's correct.

But what about if the same subclass is encountered through different paths? For example, if there's a diamond inheritance. But in Python, the __subclasses__ method would list each subclass once, so the code would not have duplicates. However, in the code above, if a subclass is added multiple times through different paths, it would be added multiple times. Wait, but in reality, each subclass is only directly derived from one parent. So, for example, if you have a class D that is a subclass of B and C, but in Python, a class can't have multiple base classes unless it's using multiple inheritance. Wait, but in that case, D would be a subclass of B and C. However, when you call B.__subclasses__(), D would be in there, and C.__subclasses__ would also include D. So if the code is called on A, which has B and C as subclasses, then when processing B's subclasses (D), and then processing C's subclasses (D), the code would add D twice. But that's incorrect because D is only one class.

Wait, but in the code above, if A has B and C as direct subclasses, and B and C both have D as a subclass, then when we call subclasses(A), the code would collect B, then process B's subclasses (D), then collect C, then process C's subclasses (D). So the result would be [B, D, C, D], which includes D twice. But that's not correct. The function should return each subclass once.

Ah, so the code as written would have duplicates if a subclass is reachable through multiple paths. So, the code needs to collect unique subclasses.

So the problem is that the current approach appends each subclass once for each path, leading to duplicates. Therefore, the code needs to use a set to collect the subclasses to avoid duplicates.

So, modifying the code to use a set:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    result = set()
    for sub in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.add(sub)
        result.update(subclasses(sub))
    return list(result)

Wait, but using a set would prevent duplicates. However, the order is lost, but the problem doesn't specify any order. So converting to a list at the end.

But wait, the __subclasses__ method returns a list, but the order is not guaranteed. However, the problem says to return all subclasses, and the order is not specified, so using a set is acceptable.

But in Python, the __subclasses__ method returns the subclasses in the order they were created, but that's implementation detail. However, using a set would avoid duplicates.

So, the original code would have duplicates in some cases, which is incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach is to use a set to collect all unique subclasses.

So, the corrected code would be:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    result = set()
    for sub in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.add(sub)
        result.update(subclasses(sub))
    return list(result)

But wait, when you call subclasses(sub), which returns a list (from the previous code), but in this code, the function returns a list. However, in the code above, the initial code uses a set, and then updates it with the result of subclasses(sub), which is a list. Wait, no: in this code, the function is returning list(result), but during the recursion, the code is using result.update(subclasses(sub)), which would be adding the elements of the list returned by subclasses(sub) into the set. But the subclasses(sub) function would return a list, which when passed to update, would add each element of the list to the set. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the code above, the function is using a set, and for each sub, adding it to the set, then adding all the subclasses of sub. But the function returns a list of the set. So that would collect all unique subclasses.

But then, in the example where D is a subclass of both B and C, which are subclasses of A, the code would collect D once, not twice.

Yes, that's better. So the original code would have duplicates, but with the set, duplicates are avoided.

But then, what about the order? The problem doesn't specify, so it's acceptable.

So the correct code should use a set to avoid duplicates.

But in the initial code, the user's function is supposed to return all subclasses. So, the code with the set is better.

But how to implement that.

Another thing: the __subclasses__ method returns a list of classes, and each of those classes can have their own subclasses. So, the code needs to collect all of them, recursively.

So, the code with the set is better.

But then, the function returns a list. However, the problem says to return all subclasses. The return type is not specified, but the code can return a list.

So, the final code would be:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    result = set()
    for sub in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.add(sub)
        result.update(subclasses(sub))
    return list(result)

But wait, when you call subclasses(sub), which is a recursive call. For example, when processing sub, the function returns a list of all subclasses of sub. Then, result.update() adds those elements to the set. So, this should collect all subclasses.

But what about the original class's subclasses? For example, the first level is cls's direct subclasses, then their subclasses, etc.

Yes.

But in the code, the initial code adds the direct subclass, then adds all of its subclasses. So, the set will contain all subclasses of cls, recursively.

Yes.

So this code should work.

But what about if the class has no subclasses? Then, the for loop doesn't run, result is empty, and returns an empty list. Which is correct.

Another test case: class A, no subclasses. subclasses(A) returns empty list.

Another case: class A has B as subclass, B has C as subclass. Then, subclasses(A) returns [B, C], but in the code, the set would have B and C, and the list conversion would return them in some order.

Yes.

So, this code should work.

But in Python, the __subclasses__ method is available for all classes. So, this should work.

But what about built-in types? For example, list, int, etc. Let's see. For example, if you call subclasses(list), it would return all subclasses of list, like list's direct subclasses. However, in Python, some built-in types may not have __subclasses__ method? Or do they?

Wait, in Python, even built-in classes have the __subclasses__ method. For example, int.__subclasses__() returns a list of subclasses of int. So, this code should work for any class, including built-in ones.

So, this code should be correct.

Therefore, the final code is as written above.
