Okay, I need to write a Python function called paging that takes a response list and a max_results integer. The goal is to return a generator that yields pages of the response, each with up to max_results items. 

First, I remember that a generator in Python can be created using a function with yield statements. So the function will loop through the response list in chunks of max_results. 

Let me think about how to split the list into chunks. For example, if the response has 10 items and max_results is 3, the generator should yield [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8,9]. 

So, I can loop over the response in steps of max_results. The range for the loop would be from 0 to len(response) with a step of max_results. Then, for each i, take a slice from i to i+max_results. 

Wait, but in Python, the end index in slicing is exclusive. So, for each start index i, the end would be i + max_results. So the slice is response[i:i+max_results]. 

So the code structure would be:

def paging(response, max_results):
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i+max_results]

That seems straightforward. Let me check edge cases. What if max_results is zero? Well, the problem says max_results is an int, but the function should handle that. However, if max_results is zero, the range would be 0 to len(response) with step 0, which would cause an error. But the function's docstring says max_results is the maximum number of objects per page, so probably it's intended to be a positive integer. But maybe the function should handle cases where max_results is zero or negative? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that max_results is a positive integer as per the context. 

But the code as written would raise a ValueError if max_results is zero because range's step can't be zero. However, the problem says that the function is supposed to return pages, so max_results is likely to be a positive integer. The user probably expects that the function will handle valid inputs as per the parameters. 

So the code I wrote should work for valid cases. Let me test with an example. Suppose response is [1,2,3,4,5], max_results is 2. The generator should yield [1,2], [3,4], [5]. The loop would start at 0, then 2, then 4. The slices would be 0:2, 2:4, 4:6. Which gives the correct chunks. 

So the code seems correct. The function uses a for loop with range stepping by max_results, and yields each slice. That's all that's needed. The generator will handle the iteration. 

I think that's the correct approach. So the final code is as I outlined.
