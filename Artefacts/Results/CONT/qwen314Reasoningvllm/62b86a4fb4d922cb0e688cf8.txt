Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate the Python code for the validate_value function based on the given function signature and docstring. The context mentions some imported packages like re, and there are variables like _label_value_pattern and _label_value_regex. Also, there's a _validate_labels function mentioned.

So, the validate_value function is supposed to validate a value against a regular expression. Since the function is named validate_value and there's a _label_value_regex, maybe the value is being checked against that regex. But the parameters don't mention a regex, so perhaps the function uses a predefined regex from the context.

Looking at the context, there's _label_value_pattern and _label_value_regex. Maybe the validate_value function uses _label_value_regex to check the input value. The function should probably use re.match or re.fullmatch to validate the value against the regex.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression." The corresponding regex might be _label_value_regex. So the function would check if the value matches that regex.

So the code would be something like:

def validate_value(value):
    """
    Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression.
    """
    if not _label_value_regex.match(value):
        raise ValueError("Invalid value")

But I need to make sure that the regex is properly applied. Also, maybe the regex is compiled, so using match method. Also, maybe the function is part of a larger validation system, like in the context of labels or resources.

But the user didn't provide the exact regex patterns, so I have to assume that _label_value_regex is already defined elsewhere. The function's job is to check if the value conforms to that regex. So the code would use the regex to match the value and raise an error if it doesn't.

I think that's the main idea. So the code would be as simple as that. Also, considering that the function might be part of a validation process for labels, maybe the error message is more specific, but the user hasn't provided details. So the code would be using the predefined regex and checking the value.
