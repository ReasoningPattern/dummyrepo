Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the point_type function based on the given signature and docstring. They mentioned that the imported packages include threading, and there are existing variables like srid_table, srid_table_lock, and classes CartesianPoint and WGS84Point in the same file.

First, the function needs to dynamically generate a Point class. The parameters are name, fields, and srid_map. The docstring says it's for dynamically generating a Point class, so probably creating a new class with the given name and fields.

Since there's a srid_table and a lock, maybe the function is supposed to register the new point type into the srid_table. The srid_map probably maps SRID values to the new class. Also, the existing classes like CartesianPoint and WGS84Point might be using this mechanism, so the generated class should follow the same pattern.

I need to create a class dynamically. Using type() or a metaclass? Probably using type to create the class. The new class should inherit from a base class, maybe the existing Point classes? Wait, the existing ones are CartesianPoint and WGS84Point. Maybe the generated class is a subclass of a common base class, but the user didn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the generated class is a new class with the given fields as attributes.

Wait, the parameters are name, fields, and srid_map. The fields could be the attributes of the point. For example, if fields are ['x', 'y'], then the class would have x and y as properties.

But how to dynamically create a class with those fields. Maybe using a metaclass or a class factory. Let's think of creating a class with __slots__ or just regular attributes.

Also, the srid_map is probably a dictionary that maps SRID values to the new class. So after creating the class, we need to add entries to srid_table, but using the lock to avoid race conditions.

So the steps could be:

1. Create a new class with the given name, which has the specified fields as attributes.
2. Register this class in srid_table using the SRIDs from srid_map.
3. Use the lock to ensure thread safety when modifying srid_table.

But how exactly to create the class. Let's think: the new class might need to have __slots__ for the fields. Or maybe it's a simple class with __init__ that takes the fields.

Alternatively, maybe the existing CartesianPoint and WGS84Point are classes that have certain properties, and the generated class should follow the same structure. For example, they might have x, y, z attributes, and methods like to_wkt(), etc.

But without seeing the existing code, it's a bit tricky. However, given that the user provided the context of existing variables and classes, the generated code should probably create a class that is similar to those existing ones.

Assuming that the generated class needs to have the fields as attributes, and then register it in srid_table. Let's proceed.

So, the code would look something like:

def point_type(name, fields, srid_map):
    class DynamicPoint:
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            for field in fields:
                setattr(self, field, kwargs[field])
        # Maybe other methods like to_wkt, etc., but not sure.

    # Then register in srid_table with the srid_map
    with srid_table_lock:
        for srid, cls in srid_map.items():
            srid_table[srid] = DynamicPoint

    return DynamicPoint

Wait, but the srid_map might be a mapping from SRID to the class name or something. Or maybe srid_map is a dictionary where the keys are SRID values, and the value is the class to register. But the function's parameters are name, fields, srid_map. So perhaps srid_map is a dictionary that maps SRID values to the new class. But how is that passed? Maybe the srid_map is a dictionary that the function uses to register the new class into srid_table.

Alternatively, maybe srid_map is a mapping from SRID to the class name, and the function creates the class and then adds entries to srid_table for each SRID in srid_map, pointing to the new class.

So, the code would create the DynamicPoint class, then for each key in srid_map, add an entry to srid_table with that SRID and the new class.

But the exact structure depends on how srid_table is structured. Assuming that srid_table is a dictionary where keys are SRID integers and values are classes.

So putting it all together:

The function creates a new class with the given name, which has the specified fields. Then, under the lock, it adds entries to srid_table for each SRID in srid_map, mapping them to the new class.

But how to create the class with the given name. Using type:

DynamicPoint = type(name, (object,), {
    '__init__': lambda self, **kwargs: [setattr(self, field, kwargs[field]) for field in fields]
})

But that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, using a metaclass or a class with __slots__.

Alternatively, maybe the existing classes like CartesianPoint have certain attributes and methods, and the generated class should have similar structure. But without knowing that, it's hard to say.

Another approach: the generated class should have the fields as attributes, and perhaps a method to convert to WKT or something. But since the user hasn't provided that info, maybe the minimal code is to create a class with the fields as attributes.

So the code would be:

def point_type(name, fields, srid_map):
    """
    Dynamically Generating Point Class
    """
    class DynamicPoint:
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            for field in fields:
                setattr(self, field, kwargs[field])
    
    with srid_table_lock:
        for srid, cls in srid_map.items():
            srid_table[srid] = DynamicPoint
    
    return DynamicPoint

But wait, the srid_map might not be a dictionary of SRID to class. Maybe the srid_map is a dictionary that maps SRID to the name of the class, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the srid_map is a dictionary that the function uses to map SRID values to the new class. For example, if srid_map is {4326: 'WGS84Point'}, then the function would register the new class under those SRIDs. But the parameters are name, fields, srid_map. So maybe srid_map is a dictionary where the keys are SRID values, and the value is the class name. But then the function would need to create the class and then map those SRIDs to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the srid_map is a dictionary that the function uses to map SRID values to the new class. For example, the function creates the class, then for each SRID in srid_map, it adds an entry to srid_table with that SRID pointing to the new class.

But the exact structure of srid_map is unclear. However, given that the user has existing code with srid_table and srid_table_lock, the function is likely to register the new class into srid_table under the SRIDs provided in srid_map.

Assuming that srid_map is a dictionary of SRID values to the new class, but that doesn't make sense because the class is being created. So perhaps the srid_map is a dictionary that maps SRID values to the name of the class, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the srid_map is a dictionary that the function uses to map SRID values to the new class. For example, the function creates the new class, and then for each key in srid_map, it adds an entry to srid_table with that SRID and the new class as the value.

So the code would be:

with srid_table_lock:
    for srid in srid_map:
        srid_table[srid] = DynamicPoint

But then what is srid_map? Maybe it's a list of SRIDs, or a dictionary with SRIDs as keys and some other value. Without more context, it's hard to say, but perhaps the srid_map is a dictionary where the keys are SRIDs, and the value is the class name. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the srid_map is a dictionary that maps SRID values to the new class, but that would be redundant since the new class is being created. So perhaps the srid_map is a list of SRIDs that the new class should be associated with.

In any case, the code needs to create a class with the given name and fields, then register it in srid_table under the SRIDs provided in srid_map.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def point_type(name, fields, srid_map):
    """
    Dynamically Generating Point Class
    """
    class DynamicPoint:
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            for field in fields:
                setattr(self, field, kwargs[field])
    
    with srid_table_lock:
        for srid in srid_map:
            srid_table[srid] = DynamicPoint
    
    return DynamicPoint

But I'm not sure about the exact structure of srid_map. If srid_map is a dictionary, perhaps the keys are the SRIDs. So the loop would be for srid in srid_map.keys() or similar.

Alternatively, if srid_map is a list of SRIDs, then the loop would iterate over that list.

But given that the parameter is called srid_map, it's more likely a dictionary. So the code would be:

with srid_table_lock:
    for srid, _ in srid_map.items():
        srid_table[srid] = DynamicPoint

But again, without knowing the exact structure, this is speculative.

Another thing: the existing code has CartesianPoint and WGS84Point. Maybe those classes are registered in srid_table. For example, WGS84Point might be registered under SRID 4326. So the generated class would be registered under the SRIDs provided in srid_map.

In any case, the code needs to create a class with the given name and fields, then register it in srid_table under the SRIDs from srid_map.

So the final code would be something like that.
