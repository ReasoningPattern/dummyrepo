Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is supposed to extract possible values of 'number' and 'sup' from the contents of the 'issue' parameter. The docstring says it returns these values. But the function is currently empty. So I need to implement this function.

First, I need to figure out what 'issue' is. Since it's a parameter, maybe 'issue' is an object that has attributes or methods related to the problem. But the docstring doesn't specify, so I have to make assumptions.

The function is part of a class, but the context says "Within class:" but there's no class name provided. So maybe it's a static method or a helper function.

Looking at the docstring: returns possible values of number and sup. So perhaps the 'issue' object has some attributes like 'number' and 'sup', or maybe it's a string that needs to be parsed.

Wait, the function is named _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. The underscore suggests it's a private method. So maybe the 'issue' is an object that has these attributes, or perhaps it's a string that needs to be processed.

But without more context, I have to make some assumptions. Let's think about possible scenarios.

Case 1: 'issue' is a string, and we need to extract numbers and supplements (maybe abbreviations like 'sup' for supplement?) from it. For example, if the string is "Issue 123 sup 456", extract 123 and 456.

Case 2: 'issue' is an object with attributes like 'number' and 'sup', which are strings. The function would return those values.

But since the function is supposed to return the possible values, maybe it's parsing the string and returning the numbers and supplements.

Alternatively, maybe the 'issue' is a dictionary or a data structure that contains these values.

But since the function is not part of a class, perhaps it's a standalone function. However, the context mentions it's within a class, but no class name is given. So maybe it's a helper function.

Assuming that 'issue' is a string, and we need to extract numbers and supplements. For example, if the string has numbers and abbreviations like 'sup', we need to extract them.

So, the function would process the 'issue' string and return the extracted numbers and supplements.

But how to extract them? Maybe using regular expressions. For example, find all numbers and supplements in the string.

But the function's name suggests that it's extracting values from the 'issue' element. So perhaps the 'issue' is a string that contains these values, and the function is to parse them.

So, the code would involve searching the 'issue' string for patterns that match numbers and supplements.

For example, numbers could be digits, and supplements could be abbreviations like 'sup', 'supp', etc.

So, the function could use regular expressions to find all matches of numbers and supplements.

But the exact pattern depends on the context. Since the docstring doesn't specify, I need to make reasonable assumptions.

Let me think of possible patterns. For numbers, maybe it's digits, and for supplements, maybe letters like 'sup', 'supp', etc.

So, the code could use re.findall to find all matches of numbers and supplements.

But how to structure the regex? For example, numbers could be \d+ and supplements could be [Ss]up? Or maybe [Ss]up[?].

Alternatively, maybe the supplements are abbreviations like 'sup', 'supp', etc., and numbers are sequences of digits.

So, the regex could be something like (\d+|\b[sS]up\b).

But since the function is supposed to return the possible values, maybe it's returning a list of the extracted values.

So, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    # Assume issue is a string
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', issue)
    supplements = re.findall(r'\b[sS]up\b', issue)
    return numbers + supplements

But wait, the function is supposed to return the possible values of number and sup. So maybe the function returns a list of numbers and supplements.

But the docstring says "return the possible values of number and sup". So perhaps the function returns a list of the extracted values.

But the exact implementation depends on the actual data in 'issue'. Since the function is not part of a class, and the context is unclear, I need to make assumptions.

Another possibility: the 'issue' is an object with attributes 'number' and 'sup', and the function is to return those values. But without knowing the structure of 'issue', it's hard to say.

But given the lack of context, the most reasonable approach is to assume that 'issue' is a string, and the function is to extract numbers and supplements from it.

So, the code would use regular expressions to find all numbers and supplements.

But the function is named _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. The 'supplment' might be a typo, perhaps 'supplement'.

So, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    # Extract numbers
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', issue)
    # Extract supplements (assuming 'sup' is the abbreviation)
    supplements = re.findall(r'\b[sS]up\b', issue)
    return numbers + supplements

But I need to make sure that the regex is correct. For example, if the supplements are 'sup', 'supp', etc., then the regex would capture those.

Alternatively, if the supplements are 'supp', 'supp', etc., the regex would need to adjust.

But since the docstring doesn't specify, the code is written with the assumption that supplements are 'sup' and numbers are digits.

So, the final code would be as above.

But the function is supposed to return the possible values. So, maybe the function returns a list of the extracted values, which could be numbers and supplements.

Thus, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', issue)
    supplements = re.findall(r'\b[sS]up\b', issue)
    return numbers + supplements

But I need to check if the function is supposed to return a list or other data structure. The docstring says "return the possible values of number and sup", which could be a list.

So, this should be the code.
