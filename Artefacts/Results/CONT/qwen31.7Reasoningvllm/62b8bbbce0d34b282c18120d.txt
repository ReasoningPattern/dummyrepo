Okay, I need to implement the is_file_exist function based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to check if a file exists. Let me think about how to do that in Python.

The user mentioned that imported packages include codecs, os, logging, and pysolbase. But for checking if a file exists, the os module is usually sufficient. However, maybe the code needs to handle some specific cases. Wait, the docstring says "check whether file_name is an existing file." So the standard way is to use os.path.exists(file_name). But maybe the code needs to handle cases where the file is a directory? Wait, no, the function is for checking if it's a file, not a directory. So the function should return True if the file exists and is a file, False otherwise.

But wait, the function's name is is_file_exist, which is a bit odd. Normally, you might have is_file_exists or similar. But the function is named as such. So the code should check if the file exists and is a file. However, os.path.exists returns True if the path exists, but it doesn't check if it's a file. So maybe I need to check both. Wait, but the function's purpose is to check if the file exists. So maybe the function is supposed to return True if the file exists, regardless of its type. But the docstring says "whether file_name is an existing file," which implies that it's checking if it's a file, not a directory. So perhaps the function should check if the path exists and is a file.

But how to do that? Let me think. The os module has os.path.exists, but that returns True if the path exists, regardless of whether it's a file or directory. So to check if it's a file, we can use os.path.isfile. So the function would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, the user mentioned that the code is within a class, and there are other methods like self.get_file_size, etc. But the function is standalone. However, the user's context says that the code is within a class, but the function is named is_file_exist. So perhaps the code is part of a class method. But the function as given is standalone. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, without any explanation. So the code should just implement the function.

But the user also mentioned that imported packages include codecs, os, logging, pysolbase. So the code should import os. But in the code, the function is part of a class, but the function itself is standalone. So the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, the docstring is provided. The user's docstring says "Check whether file_name is an existing file." So the function returns True if the file exists, but maybe the function is supposed to check if it's a file, not a directory. So perhaps the function should check if the path exists and is a file. But the docstring is a bit ambiguous. However, the function's name is is_file_exist, which suggests that it's checking if the file exists, not if it's a directory. So the code would be as above.

But the user also mentioned that within the class, there are methods like self.is_file_exist, which might be part of a class method. But the function is standalone. So the code would be as written.

So the final code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, the user's context says that the code is within a class, but the function is standalone. However, the code should be written as per the function signature. So the code is as above. The imports are needed, but the user's context says that imported packages include codecs, os, logging, pysolbase. So the code should import os. So the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
