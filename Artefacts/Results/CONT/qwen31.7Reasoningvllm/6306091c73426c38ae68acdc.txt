Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_from_content, and it's part of a class. The docstring explains that it validates the spec content to ensure all required fields are present and raises an IRValidatorException if they're missing. The return value is a dictionary with the data loaded from the spec file.

First, I need to look at the existing code. The user mentioned imported packages: os, jsonschema, six, and infrared. The class has methods like validate_from_file and validate_from_content. The validate_from_content method takes spec_content as a parameter.

The task is to implement this method. The key points are:

1. Validate that the spec_content has all required fields.
2. Raise IRValidatorException if any mandatory data is missing.
3. Return a dictionary with the data loaded from the spec file.

But wait, the function is called validate_from_content, and the parameters are spec_content. The existing methods are validate_from_file and validate_from_content. The user's context says that the class has these methods. So, the validate_from_content method is supposed to take the content of the spec file, which is the spec_content parameter.

So, the code needs to check if the spec_content is None. If it is, perhaps raise an exception? But the docstring says that the parameter is spec_content, and the function is supposed to validate it. However, the docstring doesn't mention handling None. But the function is supposed to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, if spec_content is None, maybe that's considered missing, but the docstring doesn't specify. But the user's example shows that the function is supposed to validate the content.

Assuming that the spec_content is provided, but perhaps we need to check if it's present. But the docstring says that the parameter is spec_content, so maybe it's expected to be provided. However, the function might need to handle cases where it's not provided.

But the user's context says that the function is part of a class that has validate_from_file and validate_from_content. So, the validate_from_content method is supposed to take the content of the spec file, which is the spec_content parameter.

So, the code needs to:

- Check if the spec_content is None. If it is, maybe raise an exception? Or perhaps the function is supposed to handle that. But the docstring says that the function raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, if the spec_content is None, then it's missing, so raise the exception.

But the function's parameters are spec_content, so perhaps the function is supposed to take the content, and if it's not provided, then it's considered missing. But the docstring doesn't specify. However, the user's example shows that the function is supposed to validate the content, so perhaps the code should check that the spec_content is not None, and if it is, then raise an exception.

Wait, but the function's docstring says that it raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, if the spec_content is None, then it's missing, so raise the exception.

So, the code would start by checking if spec_content is None. If it is, raise IRValidatorException.

But the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the data loaded from the spec file. So, the code needs to load the spec_content into a dictionary. But how? The user's context mentions that the class has a method validate_from_file, which probably loads the YAML file. But the validate_from_content method is supposed to take the content directly.

So, the code would need to load the spec_content into a dictionary. But how? The user's context mentions that the imported packages are os, jsonschema, six, and infrared. Maybe the code uses jsonschema to validate the content, but the function is supposed to return the data loaded from the spec file.

Wait, the function's return value is a dictionary with data loaded from the spec. So, perhaps the code uses the spec_content and parses it into a dictionary. But the exact parsing method isn't specified. However, the user's context doesn't mention that, so perhaps the code assumes that the spec_content is a YAML string, and the code parses it into a dictionary.

But the user's code is not provided, so I need to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring.

So, the steps for the code:

1. Check if spec_content is None. If so, raise IRValidatorException.
2. Parse the spec_content into a dictionary. But how? The user's context says that the class has validate_from_file, which probably loads a YAML file. But validate_from_content takes the content directly. So, perhaps the code uses a YAML parser, like PyYAML, to load the content into a dictionary.

But the user's imported packages include six and infrared, which might be for compatibility. However, the code needs to use jsonschema, which is for validation. But the function is supposed to validate the content, so perhaps the code uses jsonschema to validate the spec_content against a schema, but the docstring doesn't mention that. The docstring says that the function validates that the spec has all required fields, so perhaps the code checks for required fields in the spec_content.

But the user's context says that the class has validate_from_file and validate_from_content. So, the validate_from_content method is supposed to take the content and validate it, then return the data.

So, the code would:

- Check if spec_content is None. If so, raise IRValidatorException.
- Parse the spec_content into a dictionary. For example, using yaml.safe_load.
- Then, check if all required fields are present in the parsed dictionary.
- If any required field is missing, raise IRValidatorException.
- Return the parsed dictionary.

But the user's context doesn't specify what the required fields are. The docstring says "when mandatory data is missing in spec file", but the exact fields are not specified. So, the code must have a way to check for required fields. However, the user's code is not provided, so perhaps the code assumes that the spec_content is a dictionary with certain keys, and the function checks for those.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual required fields, perhaps the code is supposed to check for a specific set of fields. However, without that info, it's hard to know. But the function's docstring says that it raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, perhaps the code is supposed to check for a set of required fields, but the exact fields are not specified.

But the user's code is to be generated, so perhaps the code is supposed to check for a specific set of fields. However, since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code is supposed to check for the presence of certain keys, like 'spec', 'data', etc. But without knowing, it's impossible to know. However, the user's example shows that the function is supposed to return a dictionary, so perhaps the code is supposed to parse the spec_content into a dictionary and then validate it.

But the user's code is to be generated, so perhaps the code is supposed to use the spec_content and parse it into a dictionary, then check for required fields. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to use the jsonschema library to validate the spec_content against a schema, but the docstring doesn't mention that. The docstring says that the function validates that the spec has all required fields, so maybe the code checks for required fields in the spec_content.

But again, without knowing the required fields, it's impossible to know. However, the user's context mentions that the class has validate_from_file, which probably loads a YAML file. So, perhaps the code is supposed to load the YAML file into a dictionary, and then validate it.

But the validate_from_content method is supposed to take the content directly. So, perhaps the code is supposed to parse the spec_content into a dictionary, then validate it.

So, putting it all together, the code would:

- Check if spec_content is None. If so, raise IRValidatorException.
- Parse the spec_content into a dictionary using yaml.safe_load.
- Check if all required fields are present in the parsed dictionary.
- If any required field is missing, raise IRValidatorException.
- Return the parsed dictionary.

But the user's code is to be generated, so the code would need to include the necessary imports. The imported packages are os, jsonschema, six, and infrared. So, the code would need to import these.

But the code is to be generated, so the code would include the necessary imports.

But the user's code is to be generated, so the code would have:

import os
import jsonschema
import six
import infrared

But the user's context says that the imported packages are os, jsonschema, six, and infrared. So, the code would need to import these.

But the function is part of a class, so the code would be inside the class.

So, the code for the validate_from_content method would be:

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("Mandatory data is missing in spec file")
    # Parse the spec_content into a dictionary
    try:
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    except yaml.YAMLError as e:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")
    # Check for required fields
    required_fields = ['spec', 'data']  # Assuming these are the required fields
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field {field} is missing")
    return data

But the user's docstring says that the function returns a dictionary with data loaded from the spec file. So, the code would return the parsed data.

However, the user's code may have different required fields. But since the user hasn't provided that, the code is written with the assumption that the required fields are 'spec' and 'data'.

But the user's context says that the class has validate_from_file, which probably loads a YAML file. So, perhaps the code is supposed to load the YAML file into a dictionary, and validate it. But the validate_from_content method is supposed to take the content directly.

So, the code would parse the spec_content into a dictionary, validate it, and return it.

But the user's code may have different required fields. However, without that info, the code is written with the assumption that the required fields are 'spec' and 'data'.

Therefore, the generated code would include the necessary imports, check for spec_content, parse it, check required fields, and return the data.

But the user's code must not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So, the code is to be generated as a Python function.

So, the final code would be:

import os
import jsonschema
import six
import infrared
import yaml

class IRValidator:
    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        if spec_content is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("Mandatory data is missing in spec file")
        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}")
        required_fields = ['spec', 'data']
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field {field} is missing")
        return data

But the user's context says that the class has validate_from_file, which is probably a method that loads a YAML file. However, the validate_from_content method is supposed to take the content directly. So, the code is written as such.

But the user's code may have different required fields. However, without that info, the code is written with the assumption that the required fields are 'spec' and 'data'.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
