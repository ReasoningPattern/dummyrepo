Okay, I need to write a Python function called subclasses that takes a class as an argument and returns all of its subclasses, recursively. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, you can use the inspect module to get information about classes and their subclasses. The inspect module has a function called getsubclasses which returns a list of all subclasses of a given class. But wait, does that include the class itself? Probably not. So maybe I can use that.

Wait, the function is supposed to return all subclasses, recursively. So if I call getsubclasses on the original class, it should give me all the direct subclasses. But to get the recursive ones, I need to check each of those subclasses and then call getsubclasses again on them.

So the approach would be: for the given class, collect all its direct subclasses, then recursively do the same for each of those subclasses. Combine all those results into a single list.

But how to implement this. Let's think about the steps.

First, import inspect. Then, define the function subclasses(cls) that returns a list of all subclasses.

So, the base case is when cls is a class, and we check if it has any subclasses. But how to get the subclasses. Using inspect.getsubclasses(cls) would give the direct subclasses. Then, for each of those, recursively call subclasses on them.

But wait, what if the class is not a class? Well, the function is supposed to take a class as an argument, so I assume that cls is a class.

So the code would look like:

import inspect

def subclasses(cls):
    result = []
    for subclass in inspect.getsubclasses(cls):
        result.append(subclass)
        result.extend(subclasses(subclass))
    return result

Wait, but what about the case where the class is a module? Or maybe the class is a type? Well, the function is supposed to work for any class, so the code should handle that.

Testing this function: if I have a class A, and B is a subclass of A, and C is a subclass of B, then subclasses(A) should return [B, C], and subclasses(B) would return [C], and so on.

But wait, the getsubclasses function returns all the direct subclasses. So for example, if A has B and C as subclasses, then getsubclasses(A) returns [B, C], and then for each of those, we call subclasses again. So the recursion would collect all the subclasses.

Yes, that seems right. So the code would be as above.

But I need to make sure that the function is properly importing inspect. So the code would import inspect at the top.

Wait, the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the import statement.

So the final code would be:

import inspect

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively.
    """
    result = []
    for subclass in inspect.getsubclasses(cls):
        result.append(subclass)
        result.extend(subclasses(subclass))
    return result

But wait, what if the class is a module? Well, the function is supposed to take a class, so maybe the user expects that cls is a class. But the code would still work if cls is a module, but in that case, getsubclasses would return nothing. But the function is supposed to return all subclasses, so if the class is a module, it would return an empty list, which is correct.

So this should work. Let me test with an example.

Suppose we have:

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class C(B):
    pass

Then, subclasses(A) should return [B, C], and subclasses(B) returns [C], and subclasses(C) returns empty list.

Yes. So the code should work.

So the code is as written above.
