Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_deprecated_args method based on the provided function signature and docstring. Let me look at the context given.

The function is part of a class, and the docstring says it returns a dict with options that deprecate others. The comment mentions that the options are from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs(). So, the method is supposed to iterate through the option specs and collect the deprecated arguments.

First, I need to make sure that the method is correctly implemented. The function is called get_deprecated_args and returns a dictionary. The docstring indicates that it's supposed to return options that deprecate others, which likely means it's collecting arguments that are deprecated and their corresponding options.

Looking at the context, the spec_helper is an imported package, so I'll need to assume that spec_helper has a method iterate_option_specs() that returns a list of option specs. The method should iterate through these specs and collect the deprecated arguments.

So, the code would likely involve iterating over the option specs, checking each one for deprecated status, and collecting the relevant arguments. The return value is a dictionary where keys are the deprecated arguments and values are the options they deprecate.

I need to make sure that the code is concise and follows the function signature. The method doesn't take any parameters, so it's just returning the dictionary. The code should be written in Python, using the imported modules as specified.

I'll structure the code to loop through the option specs, check for deprecation, and build the dictionary. Since the exact implementation details of the spec_helper's iterate_option_specs() are not provided, I'll assume that it returns a list of dictionaries or similar structures that can be processed.

Putting it all together, the code would look something like:

def get_deprecated_args(self):
    deprecated_args = {}
    for option_spec in self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs():
        # Check if this option is deprecated
        if option_spec.is_deprecated:
            deprecated_args[option_spec.name] = option_spec.options
    return deprecated_args

But since the actual implementation of iterate_option_specs() is not provided, I'll have to use the given context. The context mentions that the options are from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs(), so the code should call that method and process the results.

Therefore, the final code would be:

def get_deprecated_args(self):
    """
    Returning dict with options which deprecate others. options from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs()
    """
    deprecated_args = {}
    for option_spec in self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs():
        # Assuming each option_spec has a 'name' and 'options' attribute
        deprecated_args[option_spec.name] = option_spec.options
    return deprecated_args

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. The docstring is already provided, so the function's docstring is as given. The code should not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So the output is just the code.
