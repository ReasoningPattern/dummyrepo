Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_run_el based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to check if the obj class has a run method. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is_run_el takes an object 'obj' as input. The docstring says it checks if the obj class has the run method. So, the goal is to determine if the class of 'obj' has a method named 'run'.

In Python, you can check if a method exists in a class using the hasattr() function. So, the code would be something like: hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run'). But wait, the function is supposed to return a boolean. So the function would return True if the class has the run method, else False.

Wait, but what if the obj is an instance of a class that has the run method? Because hasattr checks the class, not the instance. So the function is_run_el is supposed to check the class of 'obj', not the instance. So the code would be:

return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run')

But the function is written as def is_run_el(obj):, so the code would be:

def is_run_el(obj):
    """Check whether the obj class has the run method."""
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run')

That's straightforward. Let me make sure there are no other considerations. For example, if the obj is None, then obj.__class__ would be type(None), which might not have a run method. But the function is supposed to check the class, so that's handled.

So the code is simple. Just use hasattr on the class of the object. That's all.
