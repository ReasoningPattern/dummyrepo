Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called check_digests_present_and_used, and it's part of a class, probably self.validate_manifest. The docstring says it checks if all needed digests are present and used, returning an error() in the class.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. The goal is to verify that all digests in the manifest that are needed are present and used. So, maybe the function needs to check that every digest in the digests_used set is present in the manifest_files, and that those digests are actually used in the manifest.

But how to implement this? Let's think about the steps. The function should iterate over each digest in digests_used and check if it exists in the manifest_files. But wait, the manifest_files might be a list of files, each containing digests. So perhaps the function needs to check that each digest in digests_used is present in the manifest_files.

Wait, the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So maybe manifest_files is a list of files, each of which has digests. The digests_used is a set of digests that are supposed to be used. The function needs to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files.

But how to check that? For each digest in digests_used, check if it exists in the manifest_files. But how are the manifest_files structured? The context mentions that there's a digest_regex method, which might be used to validate the digests. Also, there's a validate_manifest method, which might be called here.

Wait, the context includes several methods like digest_regex, validate_manifest, validate_version_sequence, etc. So perhaps the function is part of a larger validation process.

But the user's main task is to generate the code for check_digests_present_and_used. The function is supposed to return an error() in the class. So, the code should check the conditions and raise an error if any are not met.

Assuming that the manifest_files is a list of files, each containing digests. So, for each file in manifest_files, we need to check if the digests in that file are present in digests_used. But maybe the manifest_files is a list of digests, and digests_used is a set of digests. So, the function needs to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files.

Wait, but the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So, perhaps manifest_files is a list of digests, and digests_used is a set of digests. The function needs to check that all digests in digests_used are present in manifest_files.

But how to handle that? For example, if manifest_files is a list of digests, then for each digest in digests_used, check if it's in manifest_files. If any is missing, return an error.

But the function's docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So maybe the manifest_files contains the digests that are needed, and digests_used is the set of digests that are used. The function needs to ensure that all digests in digests_used are present in manifest_files.

So, the code would loop through each digest in digests_used, check if it's in manifest_files. If any is not present, raise an error.

But how to handle the case where manifest_files is a list of files, each with their own digests? For example, if manifest_files is a list of files, each file has a list of digests. Then, the function needs to check that each digest in digests_used is present in any of the files.

But the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So, perhaps manifest_files is a list of files, and each file has a list of digests. The function needs to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files.

So, the code would be something like:

for digest in digests_used:
    if digest not in manifest_files:
        self.error("Digest {digest} is not present in manifest_files")
        return

But wait, the function is supposed to return error() in the class. So, perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, like self.error(...).

But the exact implementation depends on the class's error method. The context mentions that there's an error method that's called with a code. So, the function would need to check the conditions and call error() if any are not met.

So, putting it all together, the code would iterate through each digest in digests_used, check if it's present in the manifest_files. If any is missing, raise an error.

But how to handle the manifest_files? The context mentions that there's a digest_regex method, which might be used to validate the digests. Also, there's a validate_manifest method, which might be called here.

But the user hasn't provided the actual code for the class, so I need to assume that the manifest_files is a list of digests, and digests_used is a set of digests.

So, the code would be:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    for digest in digests_used:
        if digest not in manifest_files:
            self.error(f"Digest {digest} is not present in manifest_files")
            return
    # If all are present, return success
    return

But the function is supposed to return error() in the class. So, perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, like self.error(...).

But the exact implementation depends on the class's error method. The context mentions that there's an error method that's called with a code. So, the function would need to call error() with an appropriate code.

So, the code would be:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    for digest in digests_used:
        if digest not in manifest_files:
            self.error(f"Digest {digest} is not present in manifest_files")
            return
    # If all are present, return success
    return

But the function is supposed to return error() in the class. So, perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, and the error() method is called with a code.

But the exact implementation depends on the class's error method. Since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I'll assume that the error method is called with a code, and the function returns None or raises an error.

So, the code would be as above. But the user wants the code in Python markdown format, so the code block.

But the user also mentioned that the code should not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. So, the code should be in a code block, and the function is as written.

So, the final code would be:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    """
    Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class.
    """
    for digest in digests_used:
        if digest not in manifest_files:
            self.error(f"Digest {digest} is not present in manifest_files")
            return
    return

But wait, the function's docstring says "Return error() in the class." So, perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, and the error() method is called. So, the code would check if all digests are present, and if not, call error().

But the exact implementation depends on the class's error method. So, the code would be as above.

Another thing to consider: the manifest_files could be a list of files, each with their own digests. So, perhaps the function needs to check that each digest in digests_used is present in any of the manifest_files. But the current code checks if digest is in manifest_files, which would be a list. If manifest_files is a list of digests, then it's okay. But if manifest_files is a list of files, each with their own digests, then the code would need to check each file's digests.

But the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So, perhaps manifest_files is a list of digests, and digests_used is a set of digests. The code would check that each digest in digests_used is present in manifest_files.

So, the code as written is correct.

Therefore, the final code is as above.
