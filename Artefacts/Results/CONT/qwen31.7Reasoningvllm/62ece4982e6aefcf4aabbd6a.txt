Okay, I need to write a Python function called replace_dots that takes two arguments, value and arg. The docstring says it replaces all '.' in the string with arg. So the function should take a string (value) and replace every occurrence of '.' with the new string (arg).

First, I remember that in Python, strings can be modified using the replace method. The replace method allows you to replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring. So, for example, 'hello.world'.replace('.', 'x') would give 'helloxworld'.

So the function should simply return value.replace('.', arg). But wait, what if value is not a string? Well, the docstring says value is an old string, so I can assume it's a string. So the function is straightforward.

Wait, the parameters are named value and arg. So the function is defined as def replace_dots(value, arg): and returns the replaced string. So the code would be:

return value.replace('.', arg)

But I need to make sure that the function is properly formatted. Let me check the docstring again. The docstring says Args: value (old string), arg (new string). Returns: str, the replaced string.

So the code would be:

def replace_dots(value, arg):
    """
    Replaces all values of '.' to arg from the given string
    Args:
        value: old string
        arg: new string to replace '.'
    Returns:
        str, the replaced string
    """
    return value.replace('.', arg)

Yes, that seems right. I don't see any edge cases here. If the input is not a string, but the docstring says value is a string, so the function is safe. The replace method will handle any string input. So this should work.
