Okay, I need to write the Python function is_local that checks if a given host is localhost. The docstring says that localhost includes local IP, username, domain name, 'localhost', and '127.0.0.1'. 

First, I remember that Python's socket module has a function called gethostbyname or gethostname. But wait, the problem says to check the host against these criteria. So maybe I should use socket to get the hostname and then compare it against the allowed ones.

Wait, the function is given a host parameter, which could be a hostname or IP. So the function needs to check if that host is one of the allowed ones.

The allowed ones are: 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', and any local IP. But how to check for local IPs? Oh, right, the socket module has a function called gethostbyname, but maybe I need to use socket.gethostbyname or socket.gethostname.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the socket module to check if the host is in the allowed list. But how?

Wait, the function needs to check if the host is localhost. So perhaps the approach is to check if the host is in the set of allowed hosts. The allowed hosts are 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', and any local IP. But how to check for local IPs?

Wait, the problem says that the localhost includes local IP, username, domain name, 'localhost', and '127.0.0.1'. So maybe the function should check if the host is either 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or any local IP. But how to check for local IPs?

Hmm. Maybe the way to do this is to use the socket module to check if the host is in the allowed list. But how to get the local IP?

Alternatively, maybe the function can check if the host is either 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or if it's a valid IP address that's considered local. But how to determine that?

Wait, maybe the function can use the socket module to get the local host. For example, using socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())? But that might not be reliable.

Wait, maybe the function can use the socket module's gethostbyname function. For example, if the host is '127.0.0.1', then socket.gethostbyname('localhost') would return '127.0.0.1', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function can check if the host is in the allowed list by using the socket module's gethostbyname function. For example, if the host is 'localhost', then socket.gethostbyname('localhost') would return '127.0.0.1', but that's not helpful.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can use the socket module's gethostbyname function to get the local IP, and then check if the given host is equal to that IP. But that would only check for the local IP, not the other cases.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let me think of a way to implement this.

The function needs to return True if the host is localhost. So, the steps could be:

1. Check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' â€” simple cases.

2. If not, check if the host is a valid IP address. If it is, then check if it's a local IP. But how?

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a way to check if a host is localhost, considering all the cases.

Another approach: the function can check if the host is in the list of allowed hosts. The allowed hosts are 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', and any local IP. So, the function can check if the host is in that list.

But how to get the list of allowed hosts?

def is_local(host):
    if host in ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']:
        return True
    try:
        # Check if the host is a valid IP address
        socket.inet_aton(host)
        # Check if it's a local IP (maybe using some method)
        # But how?
        # For example, check if the IP is in the local network
        # But how to do that?
        # Maybe use the socket module's gethostbyname function
        # But I'm not sure.

        # So this approach might not work.
        return True
    except socket.error:
        return False

But this is not correct. For example, if the host is '192.168.1.1', it would be considered local, but the code would return True, which is correct. But if the host is '8.8.8.8', it would return True, which is incorrect. So this approach is not correct.

        return False

But this is not correct. So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the socket module's gethostbyname function to get the local IP, and then check if the given host is equal to that IP. But how to get the local IP?

Wait, the function can use socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) to get the local IP. For example:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    if host in ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']:
        return True
    try:
        local_ip = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
        return host == local_ip
    except socket.error:
        return False

But this would only check if the host is equal to the local IP. So, if the host is 'localhost', it would return True, but the local_ip is '127.0.0.1', so it would return False. Wait, no. Wait, if the host is 'localhost', then the code checks if it's in the allowed list, which it is, so returns True. Otherwise, it tries to get the local IP, which is '127.0.0.1', and then checks if the host is equal to that. So, if the host is '127.0.0.1', it would return True. But if the host is 'localhost', it would return True in the first condition.

But what if the host is '127.0.0.1'? Then, the code would check if it's in the allowed list, which it is, so returns True. So this code would return True for 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', and any other host that is equal to the local IP.

But what about a host that is a valid IP but not the local IP? For example, '8.8.8.8' would return False, which is correct.

But what about a host that is 'localhost' but not the local IP? Wait, no. Because 'localhost' is a hostname, and the code checks if it's in the allowed list, which includes 'localhost'.

So, this code would return True for 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', and any host that is equal to the local IP.

But what about a host that is a valid IP but not the local IP? For example, '192.168.1.1' would return False, which is correct.

But what about a host that is a valid IP but not the local IP? For example, '192.168.1.1' would return False.

So, this code would correctly return True for the allowed hosts.

But what about a host that is a valid IP but not the local IP? For example, '192.168.1.1' would return False.

So, this code seems to handle the cases.

But what about a host that is a valid IP but not the local IP? For example, '192.168.1.1' would return False.

So, this code would correctly return True for the allowed hosts.

Therefore, the code would be:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    if host in ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']:
        return True
    try:
        local_ip = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
        return host == local_ip
    except socket.error:
        return False

But wait, what if the host is not a valid IP? For example, if the host is 'abc', then the code would try to get the local IP, which would raise a socket.error, and return False.

Yes.

So, this code should handle all cases.

But wait, what if the host is 'localhost' but the local IP is something else? For example, if the host is 'localhost', the code checks if it's in the allowed list, which it is, so returns True. So that's correct.

So, this code should work.
