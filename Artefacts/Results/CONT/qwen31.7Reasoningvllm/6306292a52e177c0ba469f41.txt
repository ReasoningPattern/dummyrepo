Okay, let's see. I need to write the Python function test_tag based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function checks if each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is part of a tag. If any character is in a tag, return False; else, return True.

Wait, but the function's parameters are just 'tag' which is a str. The docstring mentions LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, but that's not defined here. Oh, right, the context says that LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is imported, but maybe it's a constant in the code. But the user hasn't provided that, so I need to assume it's available.

Wait, the problem says that the code is within the file ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS, but the function test_tag is defined here. So maybe LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a string that contains the allowed characters. But the function's docstring says "each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the function is checking if the 'tag' parameter is a valid tag based on LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. But the docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, return False. Wait, that's the opposite of what it's supposed to do. Wait, the docstring says: "Checks whether each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag. If any character belongs to a tag, the value False is returned. Otherwise, the value True is returned."

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The function test_tag takes a tag (str) and returns a bool. The docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, then return False. Otherwise, True. Wait, that would mean that the function is checking if the tag contains any characters from LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. But that's the opposite of what's usually done. Normally, a tag is a string that contains certain characters. But here, the function is checking if the tag has any characters that are in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. If so, return False. Otherwise, True.

Wait, but the function's name is test_tag, which might be a test function. Maybe the function is supposed to check if the tag is valid. For example, if LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a set of allowed characters, then the function should check that all characters in the tag are in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. But the docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, return False. That would mean that if the tag has any characters that are in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, then it's invalid. But that's the opposite of usual validation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the docstring is written incorrectly. Let me think. Suppose LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a set of allowed characters. The function test_tag is supposed to check if the tag is valid. So, for example, if the tag contains any characters not in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, then it's invalid. But the docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, return False. That would mean that if the tag has any characters from LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, it's invalid. Which is the opposite. So perhaps there's a mistake in the docstring.

But given the problem statement, I have to work with what's provided. The function's docstring says: "Checks whether each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag. If any character belongs to a tag, the value False is returned. Otherwise, the value True is returned."

Wait, maybe the function is checking if the tag contains any characters that are in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. If so, return False. Otherwise, True. So, for example, if LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is "abc", and the tag is "abc", then the function returns False. But that's not typical. But according to the docstring, that's what it does.

So, the function test_tag would check if all characters in the tag are in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. Wait, no. The docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, return False. So, if the tag has any character that is in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, then return False. Otherwise, True. Wait, that's confusing. Let me rephrase.

The function's purpose is to check if the tag is valid. The docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, return False. So, if the tag contains any character that is in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, then it's invalid. But that would mean that the tag is invalid if it contains any of the allowed characters. Which is the opposite of usual validation. So perhaps the docstring is reversed.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the tag is valid, and LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is the set of allowed characters. So, the function should return True if all characters in the tag are in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, and False otherwise. But the docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, return False. Which would mean that if the tag has any character from LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, return False. Which is the opposite.

This is confusing. But given the problem statement, I have to proceed. The function's docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, return False. So, the function is checking if the tag contains any characters from LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. If yes, return False. Otherwise, True.

So, the code for test_tag would be:

def test_tag(tag: str) -> bool:
    # Check if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag
    # If yes, return False, else True
    return not any(c in tag for c in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS)

But wait, the docstring says that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag, return False. So, the condition is that if any character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag, then return False. So, the function returns False if any character from LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag. Otherwise, True.

So, the code would be:

return not any(c in tag for c in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS)

But then, the function is checking if the tag has any characters from LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. If so, return False. Otherwise, True.

But the problem says that the function is part of the ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS file, which is imported. So, LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a string that's defined in that file. But since the user hasn't provided that, I have to assume that LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a variable that's available.

So, the code would be as above.

But wait, the function's parameters are 'tag' which is a str. So, the code would be:

def test_tag(tag: str) -> bool:
    return not any(c in tag for c in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS)

But the problem says that the code is within the file ILLEGAL_TAG_CHARS, but the function is defined here. So, the code would be as above.

But the user also mentions that imported packages are typing, urllib, re, bleach. But the code for test_tag doesn't use those, so maybe they are just part of the context but not needed for the function.

So, the final code is as above.
