Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate the Python code for the 'formatmany' method based on the given function signature and docstring. The context provided mentions several imports and classes, but I need to focus on the function itself.

First, the function signature: it takes 'sql' as AnyStr, 'many_params' as Union[Iterable[Dict[...]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]], and returns a Tuple[AnyStr, ...]. The docstring says it converts SQL using self._converter.convert_many.

Looking at the context, the method is part of a class, and it's using self._converter. So the code should call self._converter.convert_many with the provided sql and many_params. But I need to make sure the parameters are correctly handled.

Wait, the return type is a tuple of two elements: the converted SQL string and either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. The function is supposed to return these. So the code would be something like:

return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But I need to check if the parameters are correctly passed. The 'many_params' can be an iterable of dicts or sequences, so the converter should handle that. The docstring mentions that the converter is created via self._create_converter, so the converter is already initialized.

So the code is straightforward. The function just returns the result of the converter's convert_many method. There's no need for additional logic here since the docstring indicates that it's a direct call.

I should make sure that the return type is correctly represented as a tuple. The return type is Tuple[AnyStr, ...], so the code would return the result as a tuple. But in Python, the tuple's elements are the return values. Wait, the function is supposed to return a tuple where the first element is the SQL string and the second is either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. So the code would be:

return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But how does the converter's convert_many method return these? Assuming that convert_many returns a tuple of the SQL string and the other element. So the code is correct as is.

Therefore, the generated code is simply the line that calls the converter's method.
