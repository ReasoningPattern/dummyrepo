Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me look at the details.

The function is called list_of_file_names and takes two parameters: settings_dirs and spec_option. The docstring says it creates and returns a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

First, I need to figure out how to implement this function. The problem mentions imported packages like os, pytest, and infrared. But the function itself doesn't use any of these except maybe for some utility functions. However, the user hasn't provided any code for the cli.ListOfFileNames() method, so I need to assume that this is a method that's part of a class or module that's already defined.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a new IniType complex type. So perhaps the function is part of a class that has a method called ListOfFileNames() which returns an IniType instance. But the function here is called list_of_file_names, which is a function, not a method. So maybe the function is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class definition.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So I need to write the function as per the given parameters and docstring.

The docstring says it creates and returns a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So the function is supposed to use that method. But since the user hasn't provided the implementation of cli.ListOfFileNames(), I might need to assume that this method is part of a class or module that's already imported.

Wait, the imported packages are os, pytest, infrared. Maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames() is part of the infrared package? Or perhaps it's a custom function. But without knowing the exact implementation, I can't proceed. However, the user might expect that the function is implemented using the provided imports.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to use the cli.ListOfFileNames() method, which is part of the infrared package. But since the user hasn't provided the actual code for that method, I can't implement it. However, the user might expect that the function is written in a way that uses the imported packages.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to create a list of file names based on the settings_dirs and spec_option, and return an IniType object. But without knowing how the IniType is structured, it's hard to say.

Wait, the function's docstring mentions creating a new IniType complex type. So perhaps the function is part of a class that has a method called ListOfFileNames() which returns an IniType instance. But the function here is a standalone function, not a method.

This is a bit confusing. Since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of the cli.ListOfFileNames() method, I might have to make some assumptions. Maybe the function is supposed to use the os module to list files, and the spec_option is used to filter the files. But without knowing the exact logic, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a list of file names based on the settings_dirs and spec_option, and the IniType is a class that's being instantiated. But again, without knowing the exact implementation, it's hard to code.

But the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So I need to write the function as per the parameters and docstring, even if some parts are unclear.

So, the function list_of_file_names takes settings_dirs and spec_option. The docstring says it creates and returns a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So the function would call that method, perhaps returning the result.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code for cli.ListOfFileNames(), I can't implement it. However, maybe the function is supposed to use the imported packages. For example, using os to list files, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names based on the settings_dirs and spec_option, and then return an IniType object. But without knowing how the IniType is constructed, it's hard to code.

Given the ambiguity, the best approach is to write the function as per the given parameters and docstring, assuming that the cli.ListOfFileNames() is a method that returns an IniType instance. So the function would call that method and return the result.

So the code would look like:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()"""
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But since the user mentioned imported packages, maybe the cli module is imported. So the code would need to import cli.

But the user hasn't provided the import statements, so perhaps the code should include the necessary imports. However, the original code has imported packages: os, pytest, infrared. But the function doesn't use them, except maybe for the cli.ListOfFileNames().

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not to include any explanation. So the code would be:

import cli

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()"""
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code for cli.ListOfFileNames(), this is just a guess. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the given info, so this is the best possible approach.
