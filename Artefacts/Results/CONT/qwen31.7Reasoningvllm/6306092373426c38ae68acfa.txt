Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_spec_defaults and it's part of a class. The docstring says it resolves arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults().

First, I need to understand what the function does. The docstring mentions that it's resolving arguments' values by combining the spec and other sources using the _get_defaults method. So, the function probably calls _get_defaults and uses that to get the default values.

Looking at the context provided, there are several other methods and classes involved, but the main task is to implement get_spec_defaults. The user mentioned not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown, just the code.

The function is part of a class, so I need to make sure the code is within the class. The existing code starts with def get_spec_defaults(self): and the docstring. The user probably wants the implementation of this function.

Since the docstring says it resolves arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults(), I need to assume that _get_defaults is a method that returns the default values. So, the function might be calling _get_defaults and returning the result.

Wait, but the function's purpose is to resolve arguments' values. So maybe it's combining the spec defaults with other sources. But the docstring says it uses self._get_defaults(), which suggests that _get_defaults is responsible for getting the defaults.

So, the function get_spec_defaults would likely be a wrapper that calls _get_defaults and returns the result. But since the user provided the existing code, maybe the actual implementation is just calling _get_defaults and returning it.

But the user's provided code is just the function definition with the docstring. So maybe the actual code is just the function definition, but the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. However, the user says not to include any explanation, so perhaps the code is just the function definition with the docstring, but that seems odd.

Wait, maybe the user is asking for the code to be generated, but the existing code is just the function signature. So perhaps the user wants the actual implementation of the function. But the existing code is just the function definition. So maybe the user is expecting the code to be filled in.

But the problem is that the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the context includes various other methods. However, the main task is to generate the code for get_spec_defaults.

Assuming that the _get_defaults is a method that returns the default values, then the get_spec_defaults function would call that method and return the result. So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But the docstring says it's resolving arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults(). So maybe the function is supposed to combine the spec defaults with other sources, but the existing code is just the function definition. However, the user might expect that the function is implemented.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to call _get_defaults and return the result. Since the docstring mentions using self._get_defaults(), the code would be as simple as returning that.

So the generated code would be the function definition with the docstring, but the actual implementation is just returning self._get_defaults(). But since the user provided the function signature, maybe the code is just the function definition. However, the user might expect that the function is implemented.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The existing code is just the function definition. So perhaps the code is just the function definition with the docstring, but that's not helpful. However, the user might have intended that the function is implemented, but the provided code is just the skeleton.

Wait, the user's context includes various other methods, but the main function is get_spec_defaults. The code to generate would be the function definition with the docstring, but the actual implementation is just calling _get_defaults. So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But the user might want the code to be generated, so the code would be this function. However, the user's example shows that the code is to be output in Python markdown format, but the user says not to include any explanation, so just the code.

So the final code would be the function definition with the docstring, but the actual implementation is just returning self._get_defaults(). Therefore, the code is as above.
