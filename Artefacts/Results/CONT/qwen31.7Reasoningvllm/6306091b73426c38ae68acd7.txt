Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_config_manager and it's a class method. The docstring says it gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service().

First, I need to figure out how this method is supposed to work. The docstring mentions that it uses cls._get_service() with the service name ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER. So, the method should probably call that method and return the result.

Looking at the context provided, the class has methods like self._get_service(cls, name), self.setup(cls, core_settings), self.plugins_manager(cls), self.ansible_config_manager(cls), etc. So the ansible_config_manager is part of the class's methods.

The user's code example shows that the function is defined as a class method. So the code should be written as a class method. The parameters are cls, which is the class instance, and the function is called ansible_config_manager.

In Python, class methods are defined with @classmethod decorator. But the user's example doesn't have that. Wait, the function is defined as def ansible_config_manager(cls):, which is a regular method, not a class method. But in Python, class methods are defined with @classmethod. However, the user's example doesn't include that. Maybe the user is using a different approach, or perhaps it's a regular method. But the docstring mentions using cls._get_service(), which is a method of the class. So the method would need to call that.

So the code would be something like:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(cls, ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER)

But wait, the ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER is probably a constant in the class. So the code would need to reference that. But the user's context mentions that the imported packages are os, sys, infrared. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Also, the user's code example shows that the method is part of the class, and the context includes that the class has self._get_service(cls, name). So the method would call that.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    """Gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service()"""
    return cls._get_service(cls, ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER is defined. Since the user's context includes that, maybe it's a constant in the class. But the code as written would assume that ServiceName is a class with an ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER attribute.

So the final code would be as above. The user's example shows that the function is part of the class, and the docstring is as given. So the code should be written with the return statement calling _get_service with the service name.
