Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function _get_resource_name_regex based on the provided docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it returns the regular expressions used to validate the name of Krake resources. So the function should return a regex pattern that checks if a resource name is valid. 

Looking at the context, there are several related functions and variables mentioned. For example, _resource_name_pattern and _resource_name_regex are mentioned. But the user wants the code for _get_resource_name_regex. 

Wait, the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which suggests it's a helper function that generates the regex pattern. So the code should define this function and return the regex pattern.

But what's the exact regex pattern? Since the context includes variables like _resource_name_pattern, maybe the function is supposed to return that. However, the user might expect the regex to be defined within the function. 

Wait, the user provided the docstring, but the actual code is to be generated. The function is supposed to return the regex. So perhaps the code is to define the regex pattern as a string, maybe using the _resource_name_pattern variable. 

But the user's context mentions that within the file, there are variables like _resource_name_pattern. So maybe the function is simply returning that variable. However, the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which suggests it's a getter function. 

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to generate the regex pattern, and the variable _resource_name_regex is the actual regex. So the function would return that variable. 

But the user's context says that within the class, there's a function _get_resource_name_regex. So the code should define this function and return the regex. 

But how is the regex defined? Since the context includes variables like _resource_name_pattern, maybe the regex is stored in a variable named _resource_name_regex. So the function would return that variable. 

Therefore, the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return _resource_name_regex

But wait, the user's context mentions that the function is part of a class. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, without any explanation. So the code should just define the function and return the regex. 

But the user might have the regex defined elsewhere. Since the context includes _resource_name_pattern, perhaps the regex is stored in _resource_name_regex. So the function returns that. 

Therefore, the code is straightforward: the function returns the variable _resource_name_regex. But the user might have the actual regex defined in the code. However, since the user hasn't provided that, I have to assume that the function is supposed to return the regex as defined in the context. 

So the code is as simple as returning the variable. Therefore, the generated code is:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return _resource_name_regex

But I need to make sure that the variable _resource_name_regex is defined. Since the context includes that variable, the code is correct. So the final code is as above.
