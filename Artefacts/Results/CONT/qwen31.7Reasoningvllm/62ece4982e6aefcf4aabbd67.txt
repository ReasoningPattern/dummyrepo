Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the vertex3tuple function based on the given docstring. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's required.

The function takes a list of vertices, and for each vertex, it needs to create a tuple that includes the vertex itself and the two points on both sides of the vertex. If the subscript is out of bounds, use 0 as the index. The return value is a list of these tuples.

First, I need to loop through each vertex in the input list. For each vertex, I have to get the two adjacent vertices. But wait, the problem says "the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So for each vertex, there are two points: one on each side. But how are the vertices arranged? Are they in a polygon, so each vertex has two neighbors? Like, for a polygon with vertices [v0, v1, v2, ...], each vertex i has neighbors i-1 and i+1 (with wrap-around for the ends).

So for each vertex at index i, the two points on both sides would be the previous vertex (i-1) and the next vertex (i+1). But if i is 0, then i-1 is len(vertices)-1, and i+1 is 1. Similarly for the last element, i is len(vertices)-1, so i-1 is len(vertices)-2, and i+1 is 0.

So for each vertex at index i, the three points are vertices[i], vertices[i-1], vertices[i+1]. But need to handle the indices correctly, wrapping around if necessary.

Wait, the problem says "the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So for each vertex, there are two points: one on each side. So the three points would be the vertex itself, plus the two adjacent vertices. So for each vertex, the tuple is (vertex, previous, next). But the previous and next are the two adjacent vertices.

So the code would loop through each index i in the vertices list. For each i, create a tuple with vertices[i], vertices[i-1], and vertices[i+1]. But need to handle the cases where i is 0 or len(vertices)-1.

So, in Python, to get the previous index, it's i-1, but if i is 0, then i-1 is -1, which is out of bounds. So we need to wrap around. Similarly for i+1, if i is len(vertices)-1, then i+1 is len(vertices), which is out of bounds. So we need to wrap around.

So, to get the previous index, it's (i-1) % len(vertices). Similarly, the next index is (i+1) % len(vertices).

Therefore, for each i in range(len(vertices)), the three points are:

prev = vertices[(i-1) % len(vertices)]
next = vertices[(i+1) % len(vertices)]

So the tuple would be (vertices[i], prev, next).

Wait, but the problem says "the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So the vertex is included, and the two points on each side. So the three points are the vertex, the previous, and the next. So the tuple is (vertex, previous, next).

So the code would be:

result = []
for i in range(len(vertices)):
    prev = vertices[(i-1) % len(vertices)]
    next = vertices[(i+1) % len(vertices)]
    result.append( (vertices[i], prev, next) )

Then return result.

But wait, the function's docstring says that the return is a list where the elements of vertices are represented by tuples. So each element in the list is a tuple of three elements: the original vertex, the previous, and the next.

So the code should be as above.

Now, check the parameters. The function is called vertex3tuple, and takes vertices as the argument. The docstring says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take index as 0. Which is handled by the modulo operation.

So the code should be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    """
    Get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon.
    This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex
    If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0
    Args:
        vertices: vertices to be converted

    Returns:
        A list where the elements of vertices represented by tuple
    """
    result = []
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        prev = vertices[(i-1) % len(vertices)]
        next_ = vertices[(i+1) % len(vertices)]
        result.append( (vertices[i], prev, next_) )
    return result

Wait, but in the code, the variable names are using 'next' and 'next_'. Maybe using 'next' is better, but it's up to style. The problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code should be correct.

Testing with a sample input. Let's say vertices is [v0, v1, v2]. For i=0: prev is v2, next is v1. So tuple is (v0, v2, v1). For i=1: prev is v0, next is v2. Tuple (v1, v0, v2). For i=2: prev is v1, next is v0. Tuple (v2, v1, v0). So the result is [(v0, v2, v1), (v1, v0, v2), (v2, v1, v0)].

Yes, that seems correct.

So the code should be as written above.
