Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_none_string that checks if a value is a string representing None. The docstring says it returns True if the type is string and the lowercase of the value is 'none'. 

First, the function takes 'val' as any type. So I need to check if the type of val is str. Then, check if the lowercase version of val is 'none'. 

Wait, but what if val is None? Because if val is None, then its type is NoneType, not str. So the function should only return True if val is a string and its lowercase is 'none'.

So the steps are: check if type(val) is str, and then lower(val) == 'none'. 

So the code would be:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    return isinstance(val, str) and lower(val) == 'none'

Wait, but the docstring says "the lowercase of val is equal to 'none'". So lower() is the correct method here. 

But wait, what if val is a string like 'None'? Then lower() would make it 'none', so that's correct. 

Yes, that should work. So the code is straightforward. Let me make sure there are no edge cases. For example, if val is a string but not 'none' lowercase, like 'nO' or 'none', it would return False. If val is None, it's not a string, so returns False. If val is a number, like 42, it's not a string, so returns False. 

So the code should be correct.
