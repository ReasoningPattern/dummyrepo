Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_config function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it returns a new VersioneerConfig() and sets various attributes. So the function should create an instance of VersioneerConfig and modify its properties. 

First, I should import the necessary modules. The user mentioned imported packages include typing, errno, sys, os, functools, subprocess, re. But the function doesn't use any of these except maybe for some utility functions. However, the code needs to be self-contained, so I'll assume that the VersioneerConfig class is already defined elsewhere, perhaps in a module that's imported.

Next, the function needs to create a new VersioneerConfig. In Python, the VersioneerConfig is likely a class from the versioneer library. So, the code would be something like:

return VersioneerConfig()

But the docstring says to set various attributes. So I need to set those attributes. However, without knowing exactly which attributes, I can't specify them. But the user probably expects that the function sets common configuration parameters. 

Wait, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't list specific attributes, so maybe the user expects that the function sets some standard attributes. But since the user hasn't provided specific attributes, perhaps the code should just create the config and return it, assuming that the attributes are set elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set some default attributes. For example, maybe setting the version base, tag prefix, etc. But without specific info, I can't know. However, the user might expect that the function returns a config object with some default settings.

Looking at the context, there are functions like git_get_keywords, git_versions_from_keywords, etc., which suggest that the VersioneerConfig is used in a VCS-based versioning system. So perhaps the config is initialized with some default parameters.

But since the user hasn't provided specific attributes, maybe the code is supposed to create the config and return it, leaving the attributes to be set by other parts of the code. However, the docstring says "set various attribute of it," so the function must modify the config's attributes.

But without knowing which attributes, I can't write specific code. However, perhaps the user expects that the function sets some common attributes like version_base, tag_prefix, etc. For example:

return VersioneerConfig(version_base='dev', tag_prefix='v', etc.)

But since the user hasn't provided specific values, maybe the code should just create the config and return it, assuming that the attributes are set elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set some default values.

Wait, the problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." The docstring is:

def get_config():
	"""
	Return a new VersioneerConfig() and set various attribute of it.
	"""

So the function returns a new VersioneerConfig instance and sets various attributes. But without knowing which attributes, I can't write the code. However, perhaps the user expects that the function sets some standard attributes. For example, in the versioneer library, the config might have attributes like version_base, tag_prefix, etc.

Assuming that, perhaps the code would be:

from versioneer import VersioneerConfig

def get_config():
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.version_base = 'dev'
    config.tag_prefix = 'v'
    # add other attributes as needed
    return config

But since the user hasn't provided specific attributes, maybe the code should just create the config and return it, with the attributes set to default values. However, the docstring says "set various attribute of it," so the code must set some attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set the version base to 'dev' and the tag prefix to 'v', which are common defaults. So the code would be:

def get_config():
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.version_base = 'dev'
    config.tag_prefix = 'v'
    return config

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Since the user hasn't provided specific attributes, this is the best I can do. So the final code would be the creation of the config object and setting some default attributes.
