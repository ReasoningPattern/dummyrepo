Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'format' and it's part of a class. The docstring says that the function converts SQL using self._converter.convert. 

First, I need to look at the parameters. The function takes 'sql' which is AnyStr, and 'params' which is a Union of Dict[Union[str, int], Any] or Sequence[Any]. The return type is a Tuple[AnyStr, Union[...]].

The user also provided some context about imported packages like typing and re, and some class methods. But the main task is to generate the code for the 'format' method.

Looking at the existing code, the function is supposed to return a tuple where the first element is the converted SQL string and the second is the params. The docstring mentions using self._converter.convert. So, the code should call self._converter.convert on the sql and params, then return the result as a tuple.

Wait, but the parameters are passed as either a dict or a sequence. The converter might expect a specific type. But the function's parameters are already defined as such. So, the code would be:

return (self._converter.convert(sql, params), params)

But wait, the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and Union[...]. So the first element must be a string. So the code would be:

return (self._converter.convert(sql, params), params)

But the parameters are passed as either a dict or a sequence. The converter might handle both, so the code is straightforward.

I need to make sure that the code is in Python and follows the given signature. The function is part of a class, so the code should be inside the class. But the user provided the function signature, so the code is just the function definition.

So the generated code would be:

def format(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
		"""
		Convert sql using self._converter.convert
		"""
		return (self._converter.convert(sql, params), params)

Wait, but the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and the same params. So the first element is a string, and the second is the params. The code returns the converted sql as a string and the original params. That makes sense.

I need to make sure that the code is correct. The function is supposed to return the converted SQL string and the same params. So the code is correct. The docstring is as given. The parameters are correctly typed. The return type is a tuple as specified.

Yes, that should be it. The code is simple and follows the function signature.
