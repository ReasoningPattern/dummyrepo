Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function _shuffled that shuffles a given sequence of strings with a fixed random seed. The docstring mentions that the seed is fixed, so I need to make sure that the random module is set to a specific value.

First, I remember that in Python, the random module has a seed function. The function signature is given as def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]. The docstring says it shuffles the seq with the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. But the actual seed isn't provided in the docstring, so I need to figure out how to handle that.

Wait, the context mentions that there's a variable called FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. But in the code, the user hasn't provided the actual value. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so maybe the seed is a constant that's already defined elsewhere. But since the user hasn't provided the actual value, perhaps the code should use a fixed seed, like 42, or maybe it's supposed to be a variable that's already defined.

But the problem says to generate the code, not to include explanations. So maybe the code should use a fixed seed, like random.seed(42), and then shuffle the sequence. But the docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", but since the actual value isn't given, perhaps the code should use a fixed seed, and the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant that's already defined in the code.

Wait, the context includes "FIXED_RANDOM_SEED" as a variable. So in the code, the function should use that seed. But how to handle it in the code? The function would need to import random and set the seed using random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED), then shuffle the sequence.

So the steps are:

1. Import random.
2. Set the seed using random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED).
3. Shuffle the sequence using random.shuffle(seq).
4. Return the shuffled list.

But wait, the function's return type is list[str], so the code would return seq.copy() or something similar to avoid modifying the original sequence. But the problem says to generate the code, so maybe just return the shuffled list.

But in Python, if you call random.shuffle, it modifies the list in place. So to return a copy, perhaps we should make a copy. However, the function's parameter is seq, which is a Sequence[str]. So the code would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    random.shuffle(seq)
    return seq

But wait, the docstring says "Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". So the code should use the fixed seed. But the problem is that the actual value of FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is not provided here. However, the user's context includes that variable, so the code should use it.

But in the code, the function is supposed to be part of a class, but the context mentions that it's within a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code should just have the function as defined.

So the code would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    random.shuffle(seq)
    return seq

But wait, the parameter is seq: Sequence[str], and the return is list[str]. So the code is correct.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is given, so the code should follow that.

Another thing: the function is supposed to be part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class definition. So the code is just the function.

So the final code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the seed is set. Since the user's context includes FIXED_RANDOM_SEED, the code uses that.

Therefore, the generated code is as written.
