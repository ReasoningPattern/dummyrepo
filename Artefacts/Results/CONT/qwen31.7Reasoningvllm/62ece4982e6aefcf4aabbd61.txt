Okay, I need to write a Python function called _dictsum that takes a list of dictionaries and sums the values for each key. The example given is when two dictionaries are provided, and the values for the same keys are added together. So the function should take a list of dictionaries, iterate through each dictionary, and for each key, sum the values from all the dictionaries.

First, I'll think about the parameters. The function is named _dictsum and takes one argument, dicts, which is a list of dictionaries. So the function will process each dictionary in that list.

The return type is a dictionary. So I need to create a new dictionary that accumulates the sums.

Let me think about the steps. For each dictionary in the input list, I need to iterate through its key-value pairs. For each key, I'll add the value from the current dictionary to the sum accumulated in the result dictionary.

So, I can initialize a new dictionary, say result = {}. Then, for each dict in dicts, iterate through its items. For each key, check if it's already in result. If it is, add the value to the existing sum. If not, create a new entry with the value.

Wait, but how to handle multiple dictionaries? For example, if there are three dictionaries, each with the same key, the sum should be the sum of all their values.

So, the code structure would be:

result = {}
for dict in dicts:
    for key, value in dict.items():
        if key in result:
            result[key] += value
        else:
            result[key] = value

But wait, what if the input is an empty list? Well, the function should return an empty dictionary in that case.

Testing the example given: dict1 {'a':1, 'b':2}, dict2 {'a':5, 'b':0}. The sum for 'a' is 1+5=6, 'b' is 2+0=2. So the result should be {'a':6, 'b':2}.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, I need to implement this in Python. The function is supposed to be part of a class, but the context says within the class. But the function is named _dictsum, so maybe it's a helper method in a class.

But the user didn't mention any class, just the function signature. So the code will be a standalone function.

So the code would be:

def _dictsum(dicts):
    """
    Sum values with the same key in the dictionaries. And return a new dictionary.
    Example:
        given two dictionaries: dict1: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, dict2: {'a': 5, 'b': 0}
        return a dictionary: dic:{'a': 6, 'b': 2}
    Returns: dict
    """
    result = {}
    for dict in dicts:
        for key, value in dict.items():
            if key in result:
                result[key] += value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but what if the input is not a list of dictionaries? Well, the function is supposed to take dicts as an argument, and the docstring says it's a list of dictionaries. So the code should handle that.

Yes, this should work. Testing the example, the code would loop through each dictionary in the list, add the values for each key.

So the code is as above. The user wants the code generated, no explanations, just the Python code in markdown format. So the answer is the code as written.
