Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate the Python code for the _validate_labels function based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function checks keys and values using validate_key and validate_value.

First, I need to look at the imported packages. The user mentioned imported packages like dataclasses, enum, typing, re, datetime, marshmallow, and serializable. But the actual code for _validate_labels isn't in the imported packages, so maybe those are just context info.

The function _validate_labels takes labels as input. The docstring says it checks keys and values by calling validate_key and validate_value. So, the function should iterate over each key-value pair in the labels dictionary and apply these validations.

Wait, but the function is named _validate_labels, which suggests it's a private method. So, the code should probably loop through each item in the labels dictionary. For each key and value, call validate_key on the key and validate_value on the value. But how are these functions defined?

Looking at the context, there are functions like validate_key(key) and validate_value(value). So, the code for _validate_labels would be something like:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

But wait, the docstring says it checks keys and values by validate_key and validate_value. So maybe the function is supposed to validate each key and value individually. But the current code just calls those functions for each key and value. However, the user's provided code is just the function signature and docstring. The actual implementation is missing.

But the user wants me to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should be the function definition with the loop. But the user also mentioned that the code should not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So, just the code.

Wait, but the user's example shows the function as:

def _validate_labels(labels):
	"""
	Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
	"""

So, the code is just the function definition with the docstring. But the actual implementation is missing. However, the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be the function with the docstring, but the body is empty? Or is there more to it?

Wait, the user's context includes various other functions like validate_key, validate_value, etc. But the code for _validate_labels is supposed to call those. So, the code would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
	"""
	Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
	"""
	for key, value in labels.items():
		validate_key(key)
		validate_value(value)

But the user's example shows the function with the docstring but no body. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be the function with the docstring and the loop.

But the user's example shows the function as:

def _validate_labels(labels):
	"""
	Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
	"""

So, the code would be the function with the docstring and the loop. But in Python, the function body is the code after the function definition. So, the code would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
	"""
	Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
	"""
	for key, value in labels.items():
		validate_key(key)
		validate_value(value)

But the user might expect that the functions validate_key and validate_value are already defined elsewhere. Since the context includes those functions, the code is correct.

So, the final code is the function with the docstring and the loop.
