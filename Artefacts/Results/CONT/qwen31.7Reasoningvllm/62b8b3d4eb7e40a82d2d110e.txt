Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _c_optimizations_ignored and returns True if the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable is not None and not zero, else False.

First, I need to check the environment variables. In Python, you can get the environment variables using os.environ. So I'll need to check if "PURE_PYTHON" is present and its value is not '0'.

Wait, the docstring says "not none and not 0". So the condition is that the variable is set (not None) and its value is not '0'. So the code should be something like:

return os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON") is not None and os.environ["PURE_PYTHON"] != "0"

But wait, the function is supposed to return True in those cases. So the code would be:

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    return os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON") is not None and os.environ["PURE_PYTHON"] != "0"

But I need to make sure that the environment variable is present and not equal to '0'. Also, note that os.environ.get() returns None if the key isn't present, so checking for None is necessary.

Also, the imported packages are os, unittest, sys, types. But the function doesn't use any of those except os.environ. So the code should be straightforward.

Wait, the function is within a class, but the user didn't specify the class name. But the function is just a standalone function, so the code should be as written.

So the final code would be the function as described. Let me make sure there are no typos. The function name is correct, the parameters are none, and the return statement is correct.
