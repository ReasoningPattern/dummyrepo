Okay, let's see. I need to write the Python function remove_ending_os_sep based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to take an input list and return a new list after removing trailing OS separators. The docstring mentions that if the input is None, return an empty list. Also, each string in the list is checked if its length is greater than one and if the last character is a pathname separator. Then, we remove those trailing separators.

First, I need to import os, but the docstring already says imported packages include os, so maybe it's already imported. But the function uses os.sep, which is the OS separator. So the function will use os.sep to check the separators.

The steps I need to do:

1. Check if the input list is None. If so, return an empty list.
2. Iterate over each element in the input list.
3. For each element, check if its length is greater than one. If not, leave it as is.
4. If the length is greater than one, check if the last character is the OS separator (os.sep). If yes, then we need to remove it. But wait, the problem says to remove trailing OS separators. So for each string, if the last character is the separator, remove it. But if the string is longer than one character, and the last character is the separator, then we need to remove it. However, if the string is exactly two characters long and the last is the separator, then we need to remove it. But if the string is longer, like three characters, and the last is the separator, then we remove it.

Wait, the problem says "remove trailing os seperator characters". So for each string, if the last character is a separator, remove it. But if the string is longer than one character, and the last character is a separator, then we need to remove it. But if the string is exactly two characters, like "a/", then the last character is the separator, so we remove it, resulting in "a".

But how to handle this in code. For each string in the list, check if the length is greater than one. If yes, check if the last character is os.sep. If yes, then remove it. But how to do that.

So, for each element in the input list:

if len(element) > 1 and element[-1] == os.sep:

then we need to remove the last character. So, new_element = element[:-1]

else:

keep the element as is.

But wait, the problem says "remove trailing os seperator characters". So, if the string ends with a separator, remove it. But if the string is longer than one character, and ends with a separator, then remove it. But if the string is exactly two characters, like "ab", then the last character is not a separator (assuming os.sep is '/', so "ab" ends with 'b', which is not a separator. So, no removal.

But if the string is "a/", then the last character is '/', which is a separator. So remove it, resulting in "a".

So the code for each element would be:

if len(element) > 1 and element[-1] == os.sep:

    element = element[:-1]

else:

    element remains.

But wait, what if the string is longer than one character, but the last character is not a separator? Then we leave it as is.

So, the code would be:

for each element in input_list:

    if len(element) > 1 and element[-1] == os.sep:

        new_element = element[:-1]

    else:

        new_element = element

Then, collect all new_elements into a new list.

But the function is supposed to return the list after removing trailing OS separators. So the function would process each element in the input list, apply the above logic, and return the new list.

So, putting it all together:

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    result = []
    for item in input_list:
        if len(item) > 1 and item[-1] == os.sep:
            item = item[:-1]
        result.append(item)
    return result

Wait, but the docstring says "each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator". So, the code checks for len > 1 and last character is os.sep. Then, removes the last character.

But what about if the string is exactly two characters, like "ab"? Then, len is 2, but the last character is not a separator, so it's left as is.

But what if the string is "a/", then len is 2, last character is '/', which is a separator. So remove it, resulting in "a".

Yes, that's correct.

But what if the string is "a", then len is 1, so it's left as is.

So the code seems to handle that.

But the function is supposed to return a list after removing trailing OS separators. So the code is correct.

But wait, the function is called remove_ending_os_sep. The docstring says "remove trailing os seperator characters". So, the code is correct.

So the code would be as written above.

But need to make sure that the os module is imported. But the docstring says imported packages include os, so the code will have import os, but the function doesn't need to import it. However, in Python, if the function uses os.sep, then the os module must be imported. But the docstring says imported packages include os, so the code will have import os.

But the function is written without importing os, but the code will use os.sep. So the code is correct.

So the final code is as written above.
