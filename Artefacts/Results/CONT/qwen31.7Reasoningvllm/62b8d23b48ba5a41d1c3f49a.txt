Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the mru_cache decorator based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The function is called mru_cache, and it's a decorator. The parameters are maxsize=128 and typed=False. The docstring explains that it's a decorator that wraps a function with a memoizing callable using an MRU algorithm. 

First, I need to create a decorator that remembers the results of function calls and uses an MRU strategy. The MRU means that the most recently used items are kept, and when the limit is reached, the least recently used one is evicted. 

I remember that in Python, decorators are functions that modify other functions. So, the mru_cache decorator will take the function to be decorated as an argument. But the parameters maxsize and typed are part of the decorator's parameters. Wait, the function signature shows that mru_cache is a decorator, so it should take arguments, but in the given code, the function is defined as def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):. So, the decorator itself has parameters maxsize and typed. 

But when using a decorator, the decorated function is called with the arguments, and the decorator's parameters are passed. Wait, no. The decorator is applied to a function, so the mru_cache function is a decorator that takes the function to decorate as its first argument. But in the given code, the function mru_cache is defined with parameters maxsize and typed. That's a bit confusing. Wait, no. Wait, the function signature is def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):, which means that the decorator is defined with parameters maxsize and typed. But when you use a decorator, the decorated function is passed as the first argument. So, the decorator would be something like @mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False) on the function to decorate. 

But the problem is that the user wants the code for the mru_cache function, which is a decorator. So, the code needs to implement the decorator logic. 

So, the steps are:

1. Create a decorator that takes maxsize and typed as parameters.
2. The decorator will wrap the function it's applied to.
3. The decorator needs to manage a cache, using an MRU algorithm.
4. The typed parameter determines if the cache is typed (i.e., keys are the arguments of the function, or some other type).

Wait, the docstring says that the decorator saves up to maxsize results based on MRU. So, the cache is a dictionary that keeps track of the most recently used items. 

For the MRU algorithm, when a new item is added, the oldest one is removed. So, the cache should be a dictionary where the keys are the arguments of the function, and the values are the results. But how to manage the order? 

In Python, using a deque for the cache might be efficient. But for simplicity, perhaps using a dictionary and keeping track of the order of calls. However, for MRU, the most recently used items are kept, and the least used are evicted. 

So, the decorator needs to track the order of calls. For example, when a function is called, the arguments are added to the cache, and the last call is marked as the most recently used. When the cache exceeds maxsize, the least recently used item is removed. 

But how to implement this? Let's think. 

The decorator can have a cache (a dictionary) and a list or deque to track the order of calls. But for efficiency, perhaps using a deque where the most recent elements are at the end. 

Alternatively, the cache can be a dictionary, and each time a function is called, the arguments are added to the cache, and the last call is recorded. When the cache is full, the oldest entry is removed. 

But how to determine which entry to remove? The MRU algorithm would evict the least recently used item. So, the cache needs to track the order of usage. 

One approach is to use a dictionary to store the results, and a deque to track the order of calls. Each time a function is called, the arguments are added to the deque, and the result is stored in the dictionary. When the deque's length exceeds maxsize, the oldest element (first in the deque) is removed. 

But wait, the deque would have the order of calls. So, the oldest is at the front. When a new call comes in, the new element is added to the end. Then, when the cache is full, the first element (oldest) is removed. 

But in this case, the cache would be a dictionary with the results, and the deque tracks the order. However, the problem is that when a function is called multiple times with the same arguments, the cache would remember the result, and the deque would track the order of calls. 

But the typed parameter might affect how the keys are stored. If typed is True, the keys are the arguments of the function, otherwise, maybe the keys are the function's return value? Wait, the docstring says "saves up to maxsize results based on a Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm." So, the keys are the arguments of the function. 

Wait, but the function's arguments can be of different types. For example, if the function is called with multiple arguments, the keys would be the arguments. But how to handle that? 

Alternatively, the keys could be the function's arguments, but in Python, the arguments are passed as a tuple. So, for example, if the function is called with (a, b), then the key would be (a, b). 

But the problem is that the decorator needs to handle the arguments of the function. So, the decorator would need to capture the arguments of the function call. 

So, the decorator would need to track the arguments of each function call. 

Putting this together, the decorator would have a cache (a dictionary) and a deque (or some other structure) to track the order of calls. 

But how to implement this in Python. 

Let me think of the code structure. 

The decorator function mru_cache would have parameters maxsize and typed. 

The decorated function (let's call it func) would be modified to have the cache and the deque. 

So, the code would look something like this:

from collections import deque

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # Cache and order tracking
        cache = {}
        order = deque()
        
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Get the key based on the arguments and kwargs
            key = get_key(args, kwargs)
            # Check if the key is in the cache
            if key in cache:
                # Update the order
                order.appendleft(key)
            else:
                # Add new key
                order.append(key)
                cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
            # Check if the cache is full
            if len(cache) > maxsize:
                # Remove the oldest key
                oldest = order.popleft()
                del cache[oldest]
            return cache[key]
        
        return wrapper
    
    return decorator

But wait, the get_key function is not defined. So, the code needs to generate a way to create the key based on the arguments and kwargs. 

But how to handle the key? If typed is True, maybe the key is the arguments as a tuple, otherwise, maybe the key is the function's return value? Wait, the docstring says that the cache is based on the function's arguments. So, the key should be the arguments of the function call. 

But how to generate the key. For example, if the function is called with (a, b), then the key is (a, b). But if the function is called with a, then the key is (a,). 

But in Python, when you pass arguments to a function, the *args and **kwargs are tuples. So, the key can be generated by converting the args and kwargs into a tuple. 

So, the get_key function would be something like:

def get_key(args, kwargs):
    return (args, kwargs)

But in the code, the wrapper function would need to generate this key. 

Wait, in the code above, the wrapper function is inside the decorator. So, the wrapper would have to generate the key based on the args and kwargs. 

So, in the wrapper function, the key is generated by combining the args and kwargs. 

But how to handle the args and kwargs. For example, if the function is called with *args and **kwargs, then the key is (args, kwargs). 

But in Python, when you pass *args, it's a tuple of the arguments. So, the key can be generated as a tuple of the args and kwargs. 

So, the code for the wrapper would be:

def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    key = (args, kwargs)
    # check if key is in cache
    if key in cache:
        # update order
        order.appendleft(key)
    else:
        # add new key
        order.append(key)
        cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
    # check if cache is full
    if len(cache) > maxsize:
        # remove oldest
        oldest = order.popleft()
        del cache[oldest]
    return cache[key]

But wait, the order is a deque, and each time a key is added, it's appended to the deque. So, the oldest is at the front. 

But when a key is added, the order is updated. So, for example, if the same key is called again, the key is added to the front of the deque. 

But this would mean that the most recently used keys are at the front of the deque. 

But the problem is that when a function is called with the same arguments again, the key is added to the front of the deque, so the next call would have the same key at the front. 

But this would work for MRU. 

But what about when the same key is called again? For example, if the function is called with (a, b) twice, the first call would have the key (a, b) added to the deque, and the second call would add it again to the front. 

So, the deque would have (a, b) at the front, and the next call would add it again to the front. 

But this would mean that the deque is always ordered by the order of calls. 

But the MRU algorithm requires that the least recently used items are evicted. So, when the cache is full, the oldest item (the one that was called first) is removed. 

So, the code above would work. 

But there's a problem: when the same key is called again, the key is added to the front of the deque, so the next time it's called, it's at the front. 

But in the code, when the key is in the cache, it's added to the front of the deque. 

So, the code would work. 

But what about the typed parameter? The docstring says that typed=False, but the parameter is part of the decorator. So, perhaps the typed parameter determines whether the key is the arguments or the return value. 

Wait, the docstring says that the decorator saves up to maxsize results based on a Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm. So, the keys are the arguments of the function. 

But if typed is True, perhaps the keys are the arguments as a tuple, or perhaps the return value. But the docstring doesn't specify. 

But the user hasn't provided any information about the typed parameter, so perhaps the code should handle it. 

Wait, the user's function signature is def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):, and the docstring says that the decorator saves up to maxsize results based on MRU. So, the typed parameter is probably a boolean that determines whether the cache keys are the arguments of the function or the return value. 

But how to handle that. For example, if typed is True, the keys are the arguments, but if False, the keys are the return value. 

But that's not clear. However, the user hasn't provided any further details, so perhaps the code should assume that the typed parameter is not used in the key generation. 

Alternatively, maybe the typed parameter is used to determine whether the cache is typed (i.e., the keys are the arguments) or not. 

But without more information, it's hard to say. However, the original code provided by the user has the parameters maxsize and typed. 

So, perhaps the code should include the typed parameter in the key generation. For example, if typed is True, the key is the arguments, otherwise, the key is the return value. 

But how to implement that. 

Alternatively, the typed parameter might be a flag that determines whether the cache is typed (i.e., the keys are the arguments) or not. 

But in the absence of more information, perhaps the code should not include the typed parameter in the key generation. 

But the user's docstring says that the decorator saves up to maxsize results based on MRU. So, the keys are the arguments of the function. 

So, the code should generate the key based on the arguments. 

But the code above uses (args, kwargs) as the key. 

But in Python, when you pass *args and **kwargs, they are tuples. So, the key is a tuple of the args and kwargs. 

But perhaps the code should generate the key as a tuple of the args and kwargs. 

So, the code for the wrapper function would be:

def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    key = (args, kwargs)
    # check if key is in cache
    if key in cache:
        # update the order
        order.appendleft(key)
    else:
        # add new key
        order.append(key)
        cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
    # check if cache is full
    if len(cache) > maxsize:
        # remove oldest
        oldest = order.popleft()
        del cache[oldest]
    return cache[key]

But this would work. 

Now, the problem is that the decorator's parameters are maxsize and typed. But in the code above, the decorator is defined with parameters maxsize and typed. 

But in the code, the decorator is a function that takes maxsize and typed as parameters. 

So, the code would be:

from collections import deque

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        cache = {}
        order = deque()
        
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key = (args, kwargs)
            if key in cache:
                order.appendleft(key)
            else:
                order.append(key)
                cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if len(cache) > maxsize:
                oldest = order.popleft()
                del cache[oldest]
            return cache[key]
        
        return wrapper
    
    return decorator

But wait, the code above has the parameters maxsize and typed, but the decorator is defined with those parameters. However, the code doesn't use the typed parameter. So, perhaps the typed parameter is not used in the code. 

But the user's docstring says that the typed parameter is part of the decorator's parameters. So, the code should include it, but in the current code, it's not used. 

But the problem is that the code as written doesn't use the typed parameter. So, perhaps the code should include the typed parameter in the key generation. 

But how? 

If typed is True, maybe the key is the arguments, but if False, the key is the return value. 

But that's not clear. 

Alternatively, the typed parameter might be used to determine whether the cache is typed (i.e., the keys are the arguments) or not. 

But without more information, it's hard to say. However, the user's docstring says that the decorator saves up to maxsize results based on MRU. So, the keys are the arguments. 

Therefore, the code should not use the typed parameter. 

But the user's function signature includes the typed parameter. So, perhaps the code should include it, but not use it. 

But the user's problem is to generate the code for the mru_cache function, which is a decorator. 

So, the code as written would be:

from collections import deque

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        cache = {}
        order = deque()
        
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key = (args, kwargs)
            if key in cache:
                order.appendleft(key)
            else:
                order.append(key)
                cache[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if len(cache) > maxsize:
                oldest = order.popleft()
                del cache[oldest]
            return cache[key]
        
        return wrapper
    
    return decorator

But this code would not use the typed parameter. However, the user's docstring mentions that the typed parameter is part of the decorator's parameters. 

But the code as written is correct for the given function signature. 

However, there's a problem with the code: when the same key is called again, the key is added to the front of the deque. But if the same key is called again, the cache is updated, and the order is maintained. 

But what if the function is called with the same arguments multiple times? The first call would add the key to the deque, the second call would add it again to the front, and so on. 

This is correct for MRU. 

Another possible issue is that when the cache is full, the oldest key is removed. 

But the code uses order.popleft(), which removes the first element of the deque. 

So, the code should work. 

But the user's docstring says that the decorator is a memoizing callable. So, the wrapper function returns the cached value. 

So, the code seems correct. 

But the user's code has the parameters maxsize and typed. The code uses maxsize, but not typed. 

But the user's problem is to generate the code for the mru_cache function, which is a decorator. 

Therefore, the final code would be as above. 

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. 

Another possible issue is that when the function is called with *args and **kwargs, the key is (args, kwargs). But in Python, when you pass *args, it's a tuple of the arguments. So, the key is a tuple of the args and kwargs. 

Yes. 

So, the code should be correct. 

Therefore, the generated code is as follows.
