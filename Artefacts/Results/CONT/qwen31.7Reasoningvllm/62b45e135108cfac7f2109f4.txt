Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function is_valid as described. The function is part of a class, and the docstring says it returns True always. The user mentioned not to include any explanation or markdown, just the code.

So the function is called is_valid and takes an identifier as a parameter. The docstring says to return True always. The base implementation is always returning True. So the code is straightforward.

I should just write the function with the return True. Make sure the parameters are correctly spelled. The function is part of a class, but since the docstring doesn't mention any class methods, maybe it's a standalone function? Wait, the context says it's within a class. But the user didn't provide the class definition. However, the function signature is given as def is_valid(self, identifier):. So the function is a method of a class.

But the code doesn't need to include the class definition. The user just wants the function implementation. So the code would be:

def is_valid(self, identifier):
    """
    Return True if identifier is valid. In this base implementation, always return True.  (D)
    """
    return True

That's all. The docstring is as given. No other code needed. Just the return statement.
