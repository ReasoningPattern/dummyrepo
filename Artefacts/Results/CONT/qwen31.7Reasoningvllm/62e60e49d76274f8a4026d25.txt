Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called unit_of_work, and it takes metadata and timeout as parameters. The docstring says it returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes.

First, I need to figure out what a decorator looks like in Python. A decorator is a function that wraps another function. So, the unit_of_work function should return a decorator that can be applied to other functions.

The parameters metadata and timeout are optional, so they should be handled with default values. The docstring mentions that the decorator has metadata and timeout attributes, so the decorator should store these in some way, maybe as attributes of the decorated function.

Wait, when you use a decorator, the decorated function's attributes are modified. So, if the decorator is applied to a function, it would add the metadata and timeout to that function. But the function unit_of_work is supposed to return the decorator. So, the decorator would take the metadata and timeout and store them as attributes of the decorated function.

So, the decorator would look something like this: when you apply it to a function, it adds the metadata and timeout to that function. But how to structure that in Python.

Let me think. The decorator function would have the metadata and timeout as attributes. So, the unit_of_work function would return a function that, when called, adds these attributes to the decorated function.

Wait, no. The decorator is a function that returns another function. So, the unit_of_work function would return a decorator that, when applied to a target function, modifies the target function's attributes.

So, the decorator would have the metadata and timeout as attributes. Let me try to write this.

The function unit_of_work would take metadata and timeout as parameters. Then, it would return a decorator that, when applied to a function, sets the metadata and timeout attributes of that function.

But how to structure that. Let's see.

The decorator would be a function that takes a target function and returns a new function. So, the unit_of_work function would return a decorator that, when applied to a target, adds the metadata and timeout to the target.

So, the code would be something like:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(target):
        # Store metadata and timeout as attributes of the target
        target.metadata = metadata
        target.timeout = timeout
        return target
    return decorator

Wait, but the docstring says that the decorator returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. Wait, maybe the decorator is supposed to return a function that has those attributes. But in Python, when you use a decorator, the decorated function is the one that gets the attributes. So, the decorator would modify the target function's attributes.

But the docstring says "Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes." So maybe the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a new function with those attributes. But that's not standard. Usually, a decorator is a function that returns a new function.

Hmm. Maybe the docstring is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again.

The docstring says: "Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes." So, the decorator is a function that, when applied, adds these attributes to the decorated function. So, the decorator is a function that takes a target and returns a modified target with the attributes.

So, the code would be as I wrote before. But the parameters metadata and timeout are passed to the decorator. So, the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that, when applied to a target, sets the target's metadata and timeout.

But the parameters metadata and timeout are optional, so they should have default values. The docstring says "metadata=None, timeout=None", so the decorator should take those as parameters.

So, the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(target):
        target.metadata = metadata
        target.timeout = timeout
        return target
    return decorator

But wait, in Python, when you use a decorator, the decorated function is the one that gets the attributes. So, the decorator function would modify the target function's attributes. So, this code would work.

But the problem is that the decorator is supposed to return a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. But in this code, the decorator is a function that takes a target and returns a modified target. So, the decorator itself doesn't have metadata and timeout attributes. The target function does.

But the docstring says "Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes." Maybe the decorator is supposed to return a function that has those attributes. But that's not standard. Typically, the decorator is a function that returns a new function.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a higher-order function that returns a function with the attributes. But that's not the usual way.

Wait, perhaps the user is expecting that the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that, when applied, adds the metadata and timeout to the decorated function. So, the code I wrote is correct.

But the docstring says "Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes." So, maybe the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a new function with those attributes. But that's not standard. For example, the @decorator syntax would apply the decorator to the target function, and the decorator would modify the target.

So, the code as written is correct. The unit_of_work function returns a decorator that, when applied to a target, sets the target's metadata and timeout.

So, the final code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(target):
        target.metadata = metadata
        target.timeout = timeout
        return target
    return decorator

But wait, the parameters metadata and timeout are passed to the decorator. So, when the unit_of_work is called, it returns a decorator that takes the target and sets its metadata and timeout. So, the decorator is a function that takes the target and returns the modified target.

Yes, that's correct. So, the code should be as above.

But the user wants the code in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes.
    """
    def decorator(target):
        target.metadata = metadata
        target.timeout = timeout
        return target
    return decorator

But the user said not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Wait, the user said "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But Python markdown is not a standard format. Maybe they mean to format the code with triple backticks and the language specified.

So, the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
	"""
	Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes.
	"""
	def decorator(target):
		target.metadata = metadata
		target.timeout = timeout
		return target
	return decorator

But the user said to output only the code. So, the code is as above. But the original code had the function definition with the parameters. So, the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
	"""
	Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes.
	"""
	def decorator(target):
		target.metadata = metadata
		target.timeout = timeout
		return target
	return decorator

Yes, that's the code. So, the answer is this code.
