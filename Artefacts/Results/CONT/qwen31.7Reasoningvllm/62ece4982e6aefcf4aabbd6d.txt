Okay, I need to write the Python function string_to_int based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function takes a string and an alphabet list, and converts the string to an integer using the alphabet. The docstring says the alphabet contains letters, and the string is composed of those letters. The return value is the corresponding number.

First, I need to figure out the transition rule. The problem doesn't specify the exact rule, but since it's a conversion from a string to a number, it's likely that each character in the string represents a digit in a base system. For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], maybe each character maps to 0, 1, 2 respectively. But the problem doesn't specify the exact mapping. Wait, the docstring says "using the given transition rule," but the function isn't provided with that rule. Hmm, maybe the default is to use the position of the character in the alphabet as the digit value. Like, the first character is 0, second 1, etc. That's a common approach.

So, the plan is: for each character in the input string, find its index in the alphabet list, and then compute the number by converting the string to a base-len(alphabet) number. For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2. The string 'ab' would be 0*3 + 1 = 1 in base 3.

But wait, the function's return type is int. So, the code needs to convert the string into a number using the alphabet's order.

So, the steps are:

1. Check that the string is non-empty and each character is in the alphabet. But the problem doesn't mention handling invalid inputs, so maybe we don't need to handle that. The function's parameters are given as per the signature, so we can assume the input is valid.

2. For each character in the string, find its index in the alphabet. For example, alphabet.index(char) gives the position.

3. Convert the string to a number using the positions as digits. For example, the string 'abc' would be 0*len(alphabet)^2 + 1*len(alphabet)^1 + 2*len(alphabet)^0 = 0 + 3 + 2 = 5.

But how to compute this? Well, we can iterate through each character, compute the value, and accumulate the result.

So, the code would be:

Initialize a result variable as 0.

For each char in the string:

    result = result * len(alphabet) + alphabet.index(char)

Return result.

Wait, but if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2. So, for the string 'abc', the calculation would be:

start with 0.

First 'a' → 0 * 3 + 0 = 0.

Second 'b' → 0 * 3 + 1 = 1.

Third 'c' → 1 * 3 + 2 = 5.

Which is correct.

Yes, that seems right.

So the code would be:

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    result = 0
    for char in string:
        result = result * len(alphabet) + alphabet.index(char)
    return result

But wait, what if the alphabet has duplicate characters? For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'a', 'b'], then alphabet.index('a') would return 0, which is correct. But if the string has multiple 'a's, they would all be treated as 0. That's probably acceptable, as the problem doesn't specify handling duplicates.

So this code should work.

Now, the function is supposed to be in the given context. The user mentioned that the code should be generated without explanations, so just the code.

But the user also said to output only the code in Python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in backticks.

So the final code is as written above.
