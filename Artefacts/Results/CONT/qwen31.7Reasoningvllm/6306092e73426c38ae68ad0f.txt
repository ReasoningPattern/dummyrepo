Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_nested_custom_and_control_args, and it's part of a class. The docstring explains that it splits input arguments into control, nested, and custom arguments. The return value is a tuple of two dicts: control_args and nested_args.

First, I need to understand the parameters. The function takes 'self' and 'args', which is a list of arguments. The docstring mentions that control arguments are not put into the spec yml, nested are for Ansible playbooks, and custom are custom variables.

The user also provided a lot of context with imported packages and other methods, but the main task is to generate the code for this function. Since the user said not to include explanations or markdown, I just need to write the code.

I need to create a function that processes the 'args' list and separates them into the three categories. The function returns a tuple of two dicts. Let's think about how to structure this.

Maybe the function will iterate over the args and categorize them. For example, using a dictionary to track which category each argument belongs to. Then, after processing, return the two dicts.

Wait, but the function is part of a class, so the code will be inside the class. The function is called get_nested_custom_and_control_args, so the code will be inside the class method.

The parameters are 'self' and 'args'. The function returns (dict, dict). So the code will need to process the 'args' list and split them into the three categories.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize control_args and nested_args as empty dictionaries.
2. Iterate over each argument in 'args'.
3. For each argument, determine which category it belongs to.
4. Add the argument to the appropriate dictionary.
5. After processing all arguments, return the two dictionaries.

But how to determine which category an argument belongs to? The docstring mentions that control arguments are not put into the spec yml, nested are for Ansible, and custom are custom variables. But the actual logic for determining which is which isn't provided. However, the function's purpose is to split them, so perhaps the code will have some logic to categorize them.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided any specific logic for categorization. The problem is that the function's implementation is not given, but the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code will have a placeholder for the categorization logic.

But since the user hasn't provided any specific code for the categorization, maybe the code will just split the arguments into three groups, but the actual categorization logic is left as a placeholder. However, the function's docstring says that the parameters are the collected list of args, and the return is the three dicts.

Wait, the function's docstring says that the parameters are 'args' and returns (dict, dict). So the code needs to split the args into control, nested, and custom. But how?

Perhaps the code will have a helper function to determine the category, but since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code will just split the args into three groups, but the actual categorization is left as a placeholder.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be a stub, but the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So the code will be a function that processes the args and returns the two dicts.

Wait, but the function's docstring mentions that control arguments are not put into the spec yml, nested are for Ansible, and custom are custom variables. So perhaps the code will have some logic to determine which arguments are control, nested, or custom.

But without specific logic, the code can't be written. However, the user might expect that the code is a placeholder, but the actual implementation is not provided. So perhaps the code is just a function that returns the two dicts, with the categorization logic being handled elsewhere.

But the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code will be the function that splits the args into the three categories, and returns the two dicts.

So the code would look something like:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    custom_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        # determine category
        if arg is control:
            control_args[arg] = True
        elif arg is nested:
            nested_args[arg] = True
        else:
            custom_args[arg] = True
    return (control_args, nested_args)

But this is just a placeholder. However, the actual categorization logic is not provided. But since the user hasn't given any specific logic, perhaps the code is just a stub, and the actual implementation is left as a placeholder.

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, and the code is to be generated. So the code will be the function with the logic to split the args into the three categories.

But since the actual categorization logic is not provided, the code will have to be written with some placeholder logic. However, the user might expect that the code is written in a way that the categorization is done based on some criteria, but without that, it's impossible to know.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be a simple split, but that's not possible without more info.

Given that, perhaps the code will be written with a simple split, but the actual logic is left as a placeholder. However, the user might expect that the code is written with the categorization logic, but since it's not provided, the code will have to be written with some placeholder.

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, and the code is to be generated. So the code will be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    custom_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        # Determine category
        # For example, if arg starts with 'control', add to control_args
        # If starts with 'nested', add to nested_args
        # Else, add to custom_args
        if arg.startswith('control'):
            control_args[arg] = True
        elif arg.startswith('nested'):
            nested_args[arg] = True
        else:
            custom_args[arg] = True
    return (control_args, nested_args)

But this is just an example. However, the actual categorization logic might be different. But since the user hasn't provided it, this is the best I can do.

So the final code would be the function with this logic, returning the two dicts.
