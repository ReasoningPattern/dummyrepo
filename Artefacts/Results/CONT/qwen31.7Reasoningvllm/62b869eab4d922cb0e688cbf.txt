Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function generate_default_observer_schema based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it generates the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in spec.manifest where a custom observer schema hasn't been specified. So the function is part of a larger system, probably related to Kubernetes resources and observers.

Looking at the imported packages, there's a list of modules like inspect, logging, asyncio, etc. But the function itself doesn't use any of these except maybe for logging or handling responses. The function is called generate_default_observer_schema and is part of a class, perhaps in the 'logger' file.

Wait, the context mentions that the function is within a class, but the code isn't provided. So I need to write the function inside a class, maybe as a method. But the function signature is given as def generate_default_observer_schema(app):, so it's probably a standalone function, but the context says it's within a class. Hmm.

But the user wants the code generated, so I need to write the function as per the signature. The docstring is given, so I need to implement the function.

The function's purpose is to generate default observer schemas. So, perhaps it's looking for all Kubernetes resources in the spec.manifest, check if they have a custom observer schema, and if not, generate the default one.

But how to implement this? Let's think about the steps:

1. Find all Kubernetes resources in spec.manifest. But what's spec.manifest? Maybe it's a dictionary or a list of resources. The function might need to process the manifest_dict or manifest_list.

2. For each resource in the manifest, check if there's a custom observer schema. If not, generate the default.

But the function is called generate_default_observer_schema(app), and the context mentions that it's part of the 'logger' file. Maybe the app is an instance of some class that provides the necessary information.

Wait, the context includes functions like update_last_applied_manifest_from_resp, which suggests that the function is part of a larger system handling Kubernetes manifests. The function might need to process the app's state to determine which resources to check.

But without the actual code, I need to make assumptions. Let's think about the possible implementation.

The function might need to:

- Iterate over the resources in the spec.manifest (maybe as a dictionary or list).
- For each resource, check if there's a custom observer schema.
- If not, generate the default schema.

But how to get the spec.manifest? Maybe it's a parameter passed to the function, but the function signature doesn't have it. Wait, the function signature is def generate_default_observer_schema(app):, so the app is the parameter. So the function is probably part of a class, and the app is an instance of that class.

But the context mentions that the function is within the 'logger' file, so perhaps the app is an instance of a class that has access to the manifest data.

Assuming that the app has a method or attribute that provides the spec.manifest, like app.manifest or something similar.

But without knowing the exact structure, I need to make some assumptions. Let's proceed.

The function's code would need to:

- Access the spec.manifest from the app.
- Iterate over each resource in the manifest.
- For each resource, check if there's a custom observer schema.
- If not, generate the default.

But how to generate the default? The default schema would likely be a dictionary or a list of dictionaries, depending on the resource type.

But the exact details are not provided. Since the user hasn't given the actual implementation, I need to create a generic function that does this.

Perhaps the function returns a dictionary of default observer schemas for each resource in the manifest.

So, the code would look something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    # Assume app has a manifest attribute
    manifest = app.manifest
    default_schemas = {}
    for resource in manifest:
        if resource not in default_schemas:
            # Generate default schema for this resource
            default_schemas[resource] = generate_default_schema(resource)
    return default_schemas

But the generate_default_schema function is not defined. However, the user might expect that the function is implemented in the same file or in a helper function.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I need to write the function as per the given docstring and the context.

Wait, the context includes functions like generate_default_observer_schema_dict and generate_default_observer_schema_list, which suggest that the function returns a dictionary or list of default schemas.

So, the function might return a dictionary where the keys are resource names and the values are the default schemas.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'll have to make some assumptions.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    # Assume app has a manifest attribute
    manifest = app.manifest
    default_schemas = {}
    for resource in manifest:
        # Check if a custom schema exists for this resource
        # If not, generate the default
        # For the purpose of this example, we'll generate a dummy default schema
        default_schemas[resource] = {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "metadata": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {"type": "string"},
                        "namespace": {"type": "string"}
                    }
                },
                "status": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "phase": {"type": "string"}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    return default_schemas

But this is a generic example. The actual implementation would depend on the specific structure of the manifest and the required schema for each resource.

However, the user's context mentions that the function is part of a class and uses various helper functions like update_last_applied_manifest_from_resp, which suggests that the function is part of a larger system handling Kubernetes resources. But since the code is to be generated, not modified, I'll proceed with the above example.

So, the final code would be the function as written, with the assumption that the app has a manifest attribute and that the default schema is generated as a dictionary.
