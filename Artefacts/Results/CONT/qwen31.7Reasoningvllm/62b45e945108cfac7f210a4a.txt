Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_hierarchy, and it's part of a class. The docstring explains that it validates the storage root hierarchy and returns the number of objects checked and the number of good objects.

First, I need to look at the parameters: validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings. The function returns num_objects and good_objects. The docstring mentions that the code should not include explanations or markdown, just the code.

Looking at the imported packages: logging, json, re, namaste, pyfs, validator, fs. These are likely used for various functionalities like logging, JSON handling, regular expressions, etc. But since the user didn't ask for specific imports, maybe I just need to include them as they are.

The class has several methods and attributes, but the main focus is on the validate_hierarchy method. The user provided the function signature and docstring, so I need to generate the code for that method.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so the code should be inside the class. The function is defined as def validate_hierarchy(self, ...). The parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings. The return values are num_objects and good_objects.

But the user hasn't provided the actual implementation. So I need to generate the code for this method. Since the user didn't provide the implementation, I have to assume that the code is to be written based on the function signature and docstring.

The docstring says that the function returns the number of objects checked and the number of good objects. So the code should compute these values.

But how? The function is part of a class, so perhaps the class has attributes like self.num_objects and self.good_objects. But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so I need to assume that these attributes are managed by the class.

Wait, the docstring mentions that the function returns num_objects and good_objects. So the code should return these values. But how are they computed?

Since the user hasn't provided the implementation, I need to generate the code that would logically implement this function. For example, the function might iterate over objects, check their validity, and count the number of valid ones.

But without knowing the actual implementation details, I have to make assumptions. The function is part of a class, so perhaps the class has methods to parse the layout file, validate objects, etc.

Given that, the code for validate_hierarchy would likely involve:

1. Initializing the number of objects checked (num_objects) and good objects (good_objects).
2. Depending on the parameters, perform validation checks.
3. Return the counts.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I need to write the function as per the given signature and docstring.

So the code would look something like:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    # Initialize the counts
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0

    # Perform validation checks based on parameters
    if validate_objects:
        # Check objects
        num_objects += self.check_objects()
    if check_digests:
        # Check digests
        num_objects += self.check_digests()
    if show_warnings:
        # Show warnings
        self.log_warnings()

    # Return the counts
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is just a rough idea. The actual implementation would depend on the class's internal methods. However, since the user hasn't provided the class's code, I have to generate the function as per the given parameters and docstring.

Another consideration: the function's parameters are optional, with default values. The docstring specifies that validate_objects is True by default, check_digests is True, and show_warnings is False.

So the code would include the parameters with their defaults.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    """
    Validate storage root hierarchy.

    Returns:
        num_objects - number of objects checked
        good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
    """
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0

    # Perform validation checks
    if validate_objects:
        num_objects += self.check_objects()
        # Assume check_objects returns the count of objects checked
        # Similarly for other checks
    if check_digests:
        num_objects += self.check_digests()
    if show_warnings:
        self.log_warnings()

    return num_objects, good_objects

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of check_objects and check_digests, I can't be sure. However, the function's purpose is to return the counts, so the code would need to track these.

In the absence of specific implementation details, the code would be as above. The user might have expected that the function returns the counts based on the parameters, but without the actual code, this is the best possible guess.
