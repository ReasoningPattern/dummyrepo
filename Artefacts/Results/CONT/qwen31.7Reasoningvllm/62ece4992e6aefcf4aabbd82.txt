Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_pattern function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by looking at the function definition.

The function is called get_pattern and takes two arguments: pattern and strip. The docstring says it converts a string to a regex pattern object. The Args section mentions that pattern can be a string or a regex pattern object, and strip is a boolean.

So the function needs to handle both cases. If the pattern is a string, it should convert it into a regex pattern. If it's already a regex object, maybe just return it as is. But how to handle that in Python?

Wait, the re module in Python has a compile function that takes a string and returns a pattern object. So if the input pattern is a string, we can use re.compile on it. But if it's already a regex object, like a re.Pattern object, then we just return it.

But how to check if the pattern is a string or a regex object? In Python, you can check if an object is an instance of re.Pattern using isinstance. So, the function should check if the pattern is a string. If it is, compile it. Otherwise, return it as is.

Wait, but the function's return type is a regex pattern object. So, if the input is a string, compile it. If it's a regex object, return it. But what if the input is something else? The docstring says pattern can be a str or regex pattern object, so perhaps the function is supposed to handle those cases.

So the code would be something like:

import re

def get_pattern(pattern, strip=True):
    if isinstance(pattern, str):
        return re.compile(pattern)
    else:
        return pattern

But wait, the docstring says "convert a string to a regex pattern object". So if the input is a string, compile it. If it's a regex object, return it. But what if the input is not a string or a regex object? The function's docstring doesn't mention handling other types, so perhaps we can assume that the input is either a string or a regex object.

But the function's parameters are pattern and strip. The strip parameter is a boolean. So the code would check if the pattern is a string, then compile it. Otherwise, return the pattern as is. But what if the pattern is a regex object? Then return it.

But wait, the function's return type is a regex pattern object. So, the compile function returns a re.Pattern object, which is a regex pattern object. So, if the input is a string, compile it. If it's a regex object, return it.

So the code would be:

import re

def get_pattern(pattern, strip=True):
    if isinstance(pattern, str):
        return re.compile(pattern)
    else:
        return pattern

But wait, the strip parameter is a boolean. The docstring says that strip is whether the spaces in the start/end will be stripped. But in the function, the strip parameter is not used in the code. Wait, the docstring says that strip is a boolean, but in the code, it's not used. Wait, the function's code as written in the example would have the strip parameter, but in the code, it's not used. Wait, the user provided the function signature with strip as a parameter, but the code example doesn't include it. Wait, the user's example shows the function signature with strip as a parameter, but the code that needs to be generated should include the strip parameter.

Wait, the user's function definition is:

def get_pattern(pattern, strip=True):
    """
    Convert a string to a regex pattern object

    Args:
            pattern: str or regex pattern object
            strip: boolean, whether the spaces in the start/end will be stripped
    Returns:
            regex pattern object
	"""

So the function has a strip parameter, but in the code, it's not used. But the user's code example doesn't include the strip parameter in the code. Wait, but the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must include the strip parameter.

But in the code, the strip parameter is not used. So, perhaps the code is supposed to handle the strip parameter. Wait, but how? The docstring says that strip is a boolean, but the code doesn't use it. So maybe the strip parameter is not used in the code, but the function is supposed to handle it. But how?

Wait, maybe the strip parameter is for stripping leading and trailing spaces in the pattern. But in the code, the function is just compiling the pattern. So, if the pattern is a string, the code would compile it. But if the strip parameter is True, maybe the code should strip leading and trailing spaces. But how?

Wait, the function's docstring says that strip is whether the spaces in the start/end will be stripped. So, perhaps the code should strip leading and trailing spaces from the pattern. But in the current code, the strip parameter is not used. So, perhaps the code should be modified to strip the spaces.

But the user's example code doesn't include that. Wait, the user's example code is the function definition, and the code to generate is the function body. So, the code must include the strip parameter. But how?

Wait, maybe the code is supposed to strip the spaces in the pattern. For example, if the pattern is "  a b ", then strip would make it "a b". But how to do that?

So, the code would be:

import re

def get_pattern(pattern, strip=True):
    if isinstance(pattern, str):
        # Strip leading and trailing spaces
        if strip:
            pattern = pattern.strip()
        return re.compile(pattern)
    else:
        return pattern

But then, the strip parameter is used. So, the code would check if the pattern is a string, then strip it if strip is True.

But the original function's docstring says that strip is a boolean, but the code uses it. So, the code would include the strip parameter in the function.

So, the generated code would be:

import re

def get_pattern(pattern, strip=True):
    """Convert a string to a regex pattern object

    Args:
        pattern: str or regex pattern object
        strip: boolean, whether the spaces in the start/end will be stripped

    Returns:
        regex pattern object
    """
    if isinstance(pattern, str):
        if strip:
            pattern = pattern.strip()
        return re.compile(pattern)
    else:
        return pattern

But wait, the function's docstring says that the strip parameter is whether the spaces in the start/end will be stripped. So, the code would strip the spaces from the pattern if strip is True.

But the original function's code didn't have the strip parameter in the code. So, the code must include the strip parameter.

So, the code would be as above.

But the user's example shows the function signature with strip=True, but the code doesn't use it. But in the generated code, it's used.

So, the final code would be:

import re

def get_pattern(pattern, strip=True):
    """Convert a string to a regex pattern object

    Args:
        pattern: str or regex pattern object
        strip: boolean, whether the spaces in the start/end will be stripped

    Returns:
        regex pattern object
    """
    if isinstance(pattern, str):
        if strip:
            pattern = pattern.strip()
        return re.compile(pattern)
    else:
        return pattern

Yes, that seems correct. The code checks if the pattern is a string, strips it if strip is True, and compiles it. Otherwise, returns the pattern as is.
