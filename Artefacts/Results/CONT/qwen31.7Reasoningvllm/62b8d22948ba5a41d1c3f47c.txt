Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get method based on the provided function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is part of a class, and the docstring says that if the key exists in the class, the corresponding value is returned; otherwise, the default is returned. The function is called get, and it takes a key and a default parameter.

First, I need to implement the get method. The problem is that the class isn't provided, so I have to assume that the class has some kind of storage mechanism. The most common way in Python is to use a dictionary to store the class's attributes. So, perhaps the class has a __dict__ attribute that's a dictionary.

So, the get method would check if the key is in the class's dictionary. If it is, return the value; else, return the default.

But wait, the function is part of a class. So, the class might have a __dict__ attribute. So, the code would look something like:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    return self.__dict__.get(key, default)

But wait, the docstring says that if the key exists in the class, the value is returned. So, the class's __dict__ is the storage. So, the method would check if the key is in the dictionary and return the value or the default.

But the problem is that the class might not have a __dict__ attribute. However, in Python, if you use a class and access its attributes, it's stored in __dict__. So, assuming that the class has a __dict__ attribute, this code should work.

So the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    """
    If a key exists in the class, the value corresponding to the key is returned. Otherwise, default is returned.
    """
    return self.__dict__.get(key, default)

But wait, the function is part of a class. So, the method is part of the class. So, the code would be written within the class.

But the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be the function definition with the docstring.

So, the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    """
    If a key exists in the class, the value corresponding to the key is returned. Otherwise, default is returned.
    """
    return self.__dict__.get(key, default)

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check.

Yes, the function returns the value from the class's __dict__ using get, which is safe because it returns the default if the key is not present.

So, that's the code.
