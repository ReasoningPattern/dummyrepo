Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_option_spec and takes command_name and argument_name as parameters. The docstring says it gets the specification for the specified option name, and mentions that getting options for a command can be done with self.get_parser_option_specs().

First, I need to understand the context provided. The imported packages include 'copy infrared', but that might be a typo or a placeholder. The class has methods like get_parser_option_specs, _include_groups, iterate_parsers, etc. The function seems to be part of a class that deals with command line options.

The function's purpose is to retrieve the option specification. Looking at the docstring, it's mentioned that the method gets options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs(). So, the get_option_spec method is probably a helper method that's used to get the specifications for a specific command and argument.

In the code, the function is defined as def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):. The docstring explains what it does. But the actual implementation is missing. The user wants me to generate the code, but they mentioned not to include explanations or markdown. So I need to write the code for get_option_spec.

Since the context includes methods like get_parser_option_specs, it's likely that get_option_spec is a method that uses that to get the specifications. But how exactly? Maybe it's a helper method that returns the specification for a given command and argument.

Wait, the docstring says "Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()". So perhaps get_option_spec is a method that, when called, returns the specifications for the command_name and argument_name. But how is that implemented?

Looking at the context, there's a method called get_parser_option_specs which is probably a class method that returns all the options for a command. So maybe get_option_spec is a helper that takes command_name and argument_name, and then calls get_parser_option_specs with command_name, and then returns the result.

But the function's parameters are command_name and argument_name. So perhaps the code for get_option_spec is to call get_parser_option_specs with command_name, and then return the result. But how does that fit into the class structure?

Alternatively, maybe the get_option_spec is part of a larger process where the parser is built, and the method is used to get the specifications for a specific command and argument.

Given the lack of specific code, I need to write the function as per the signature and docstring. The function is supposed to return the specification for the given option. So perhaps the code is something like:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    # Get the parser options for the given command
    parser_options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    # Find the specific option and return its spec
    # Assuming parser_options is a list or some structure that contains the options
    # For example, return parser_options[argument_name]
    return parser_options.get(argument_name, None)

But this is just a guess. The actual implementation would depend on how the parser_options are structured. Since the context mentions methods like _include_groups and iterate_parsers, maybe the parser is built by iterating through parsers and including groups.

However, without more context, the best approach is to write the function as a helper that calls the relevant method and returns the result. The user might have expected that the function is part of a class that manages parsers and options, so the code would involve accessing the parser's options.

But since the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the context, I need to generate the code that fits those. The function is supposed to get the specification for the option. So perhaps the code is:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    # Get the parser options for the given command
    parser_options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    # Return the specification for the argument_name
    return parser_options.get(argument_name, None)

But I need to make sure that the function is correctly structured. Also, considering that the docstring mentions that get_options of the given command_name can be obtained with self.get_parser_option_specs(), so the function is likely a helper that returns the specs for a specific command and argument.

Another possibility is that the function is part of a class that has a method to get all options, and this is a way to get a specific one. But without more code, the best I can do is write the function as a helper that calls the relevant method and returns the result.

So the code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    # Assuming that get_parser_option_specs returns a dictionary of options for the command
    # and that argument_name is a key in that dictionary
    return self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name).get(argument_name, None)

But I need to make sure that the function is correctly implemented. Since the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the context, the code should be as per that.

Another thing to note is that the function is part of a class, so the code would be inside the class. The user's context mentions that the class has methods like get_parser_option_specs, so the code would use those.

Therefore, the generated code for get_option_spec is as above.
