Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_ipv4 that checks if a given target is an IPv4 address. The user mentioned that imported packages include ipaddress, and it's within a class. Wait, but the function is standalone. Hmm, maybe the class is not necessary here. The docstring says to return a boolean, so the function should use the ipaddress module.

The ipaddress module has an IPv4Address class. So, the function can try to create an IPv4Address object from the target string. If it succeeds, return True; else, False. But I need to handle cases where the target is not a valid IPv4 address. For example, if the input is "192.168.1.1", it should return True. If it's "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334", that's IPv6, so it should return False.

Wait, but the ipaddress module's IPv4Address constructor will raise an exception if the input is invalid. So, the function can try to create the address and catch the exception. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, using the ipaddress module's validate function? Or maybe using the ipaddress module's IPv4Address class and checking if it's valid.

Wait, the ipaddress module's IPv4Address class has a method called is_valid() which returns True if the address is valid. But I need to check if the input is a valid IPv4 address. So, perhaps the function can try to create an IPv4Address object from the target string. If that's possible, return True; else, False.

But what about cases where the target is a string that looks like an IPv4 but is invalid? For example, "192.168.1.256" is invalid. The ipaddress module would raise an error, so catching that exception would work.

So the code would be:

import ipaddress

def is_ipv4(target):
    try:
        ipaddress.IPv4Address(target)
        return True
    except ipaddress.AddressValueError:
        return False

Wait, but the ipaddress module's IPv4Address constructor raises AddressValueError when the input is invalid. So catching that exception would work. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, using the ipaddress module's validate function? Or maybe using the ipaddress module's IPv4Address class and checking if it's valid.

But the problem is that the ipaddress module's IPv4Address class is not directly available in the standard library. Wait, no, the ipaddress module is part of Python's standard library. So, the code should work.

So the function would try to create an IPv4Address object from the target string. If it succeeds, return True. Otherwise, return False.

But wait, what about if the target is a string that's not a valid IPv4 address? For example, "192.168.1.256" would raise an AddressValueError, so the except block would catch it and return False.

Yes, that seems correct. So the code would be:

import ipaddress

def is_ipv4(target):
    try:
        ipaddress.IPv4Address(target)
        return True
    except ipaddress.AddressValueError:
        return False

But the user mentioned that the imported packages include ipaddress, so that's okay.

But wait, the ipaddress module's IPv4Address class requires that the input is a valid IPv4 address. So, if the input is "192.168.1.1", it's valid. If it's "192.168.1.256", it's invalid. So the code would correctly return False.

But what about leading or trailing spaces? The ipaddress module's IPv4Address constructor will throw an error if the input has leading or trailing spaces. So, the function would catch that as well.

Therefore, this code should work.
