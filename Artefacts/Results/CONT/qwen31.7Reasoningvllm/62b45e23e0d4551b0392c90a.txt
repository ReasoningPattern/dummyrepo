Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_version_inventories method based on the provided function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that each version in version_dirs should have an inventory up to that point, and we need to keep track of any content digests that differ from those in the root inventory. The version_dirs is an array of version directory names in sequence (1, 2, 3...).

Looking at the imported packages: json, re, namaste, pyfs, fs, digest. But the actual code might not need all of these, but the function is part of a class, so I need to make sure the method is correctly structured.

The method is part of a class, and the parameters are self and version_dirs. The function is called validate_version_inventories, which seems to be a method in a class. The docstring mentions other methods like validate_inventory_digest_match, validate_inventory, etc., which are probably part of the same class.

The user wants the code generated without any explanation, so I need to write the method as per the signature and docstring.

First, the function definition: def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):. The docstring is given, so I need to include that.

Now, the implementation. The function needs to ensure that each version in version_dirs has an inventory. Also, track any content digests different from the root inventory.

But how to implement this? Let's think about the steps.

1. Check that each version directory exists and has an inventory.
2. Compare content digests of each version's inventory with the root inventory's digests.
3. Record any discrepancies.

But the exact implementation details are not provided. Since the user hasn't given the actual code, I need to assume that the method will perform these checks.

Looking at the imported packages, maybe the digest module is used for handling digests. The function might involve reading inventory files, checking their digests, and comparing them against the root's.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I need to write a placeholder that follows the structure.

Possible steps:

- Iterate over each version in version_dirs.
- For each version, check that there's an inventory file (maybe in a specific directory).
- Compare the digest of the current version's inventory with the root's digest.
- If they differ, record the discrepancy.

But without knowing the exact implementation, I'll have to create a generic method that does these checks.

So, the code would look something like:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    """Check that each version has an inventory and track content digests."""
    for version in version_dirs:
        # Check if inventory exists for this version
        inventory_path = self.get_inventory_path(version)
        if not self.exists(inventory_path):
            self.log(f"Inventory for version {version} not found")
            # Maybe raise an error or mark as invalid
            return False
        # Check digest against root inventory
        digest = self.read_inventory_digest(inventory_path)
        root_digest = self.read_inventory_digest(self.root_inv_validator)
        if digest != root_digest:
            self.log(f"Digest mismatch for version {version}")
            # Record this discrepancy
            self.registered_extensions.append((version, digest))
    return True

But this is just a draft. The actual implementation would need to handle the specific logic, but since the user hasn't provided that, I'll have to write a method that does the basic checks as per the docstring.

Another thing: the docstring mentions that version_dirs is in version sequence (1, 2, 3...), so the method assumes that the versions are in order.

Also, the method might need to call other methods like validate_inventory_digest_match, validate_inventory, etc., but since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I'll have to include those calls in the method.

But the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code should be self-contained.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    """
    Each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point.
    Keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory.
    """
    # Check each version
    for version in version_dirs:
        # Assume inventory is in a specific path, maybe self.content_directory + version
        inventory_path = self.content_directory + version
        # Check if inventory exists
        if not self.obj_fs.exists(inventory_path):
            self.log(f"Inventory for version {version} not found")
            return False
        # Get digest of inventory
        digest = self.read_inventory_digest(inventory_path)
        # Compare with root inventory's digest
        root_digest = self.read_inventory_digest(self.root_inv_validator)
        if digest != root_digest:
            self.log(f"Digest mismatch for version {version}")
            self.registered_extensions.append((version, digest))
    return True

But I need to make sure that the code uses the imported packages. For example, self.obj_fs is likely an instance of fs.FileSystem, and self.read_inventory_digest is a method that reads the digest from a file.

However, since the user hasn't provided the actual code, the answer should be the method as per the given signature and docstring.

So the final code would be the function definition with the docstring, and the implementation as above.
