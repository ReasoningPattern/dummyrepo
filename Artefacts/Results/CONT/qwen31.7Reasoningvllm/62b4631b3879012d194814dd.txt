Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function fix_namespace_prefix_w. The docstring says it replaces "w:st=" with "w-st=". Let me think about how to do that.

First, the function is called fix_namespace_prefix_w and takes content as a parameter. The docstring is straightforward. The task is to replace the prefix in the content.

So, the approach would be to process the content string and replace every occurrence of "w:st=" with "w-st=". In Python, I can use the string method replace. But wait, the replace method replaces all occurrences. So if the content has multiple instances, they'll all be replaced.

But wait, the function is supposed to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=". So the code would be something like:

return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

But I need to make sure that the function is properly defined. The function is supposed to return the modified content. So the code would be:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    """
    Replace "w:st=" in content with "w-st=".
    """
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

Wait, but the user mentioned imported packages: logging, re, copy. But the function doesn't use any of those. Maybe they are just part of the project's imports, but the function doesn't use them. So the code doesn't need to import any of those. The function is simple.

So the code is just the function definition with the replace method. No imports needed. So the output should be the code as per the function signature and docstring.
