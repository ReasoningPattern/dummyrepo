Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _reset_logging method in the given class. The docstring says it resets the logging system. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the method is part of a class, so I need to make sure that the logging module is properly reset. The logging module in Python has a root logger, and resetting it would involve setting the logging level, handlers, and other configurations.

Wait, but the exact details of how to reset logging might vary. However, the task is to generate code that resets the logging system. So, the standard approach would be to reset the logging configuration. But how exactly?

Maybe the method should reset the logging level to the default, remove all handlers, and then reconfigure them. But without knowing the exact setup of the class, I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to reset the logging configuration, like resetting the log level, handlers, and other settings. But since the class is not provided, I need to write code that would typically reset logging.

In Python, to reset logging, you can use the logging module's methods. For example, you can call logging.root.handlers and logging.root.level to reset them. But maybe the class has a specific way of handling logging.

Wait, the docstring says "reset the logging system". So the method should probably reset the logging configuration. So, the code might look like:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logging.root.handlers = []
    logging.root.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
    # Maybe other configurations if needed

But since the class is not provided, I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the method is a class method, so it should be defined with cls.

Wait, the function is defined as def _reset_logging(cls):. So, the code would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logging.root.handlers = []
    logging.root.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
    # Maybe add other configurations if needed

But perhaps the class has a specific logging setup. However, since the context doesn't provide that, the code should be general.

Another consideration: sometimes, logging is configured via a configuration file or via the logging module's setup. But without knowing the class's specific setup, the code should be generic.

So the code would import logging, reset the handlers and level. That's the standard way to reset logging.

So the code would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logging.root.handlers = []
    logging.root.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the method is a class method, so it's called as cls._reset_logging(). But the code is written as a function, so it's okay.

Wait, the function is defined as def _reset_logging(cls):, which is a class method. So the code would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logging.root.handlers = []
    logging.root.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)

But maybe the class has a specific logging configuration. However, without more info, this is the standard approach.

So the final code would be as above.
