Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called make_find_paths, and it takes a sequence of paths. The goal is to transform each path into a glob pattern, leaving existing patterns untouched.

First, I remember that in Python, the re module has a module called re.compile, but I think the function here is using the glob module. Wait, the docstring mentions that the user wants to transform paths into glob patterns. So the function should take each path and convert it into a glob pattern.

Wait, the function's argument is a sequence of paths. So for each path in find_paths, I need to convert it into a glob pattern. But how? The glob module's glob function can take a pattern and return a list of matches. But here, the task is to convert a path into a glob pattern. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern would be 'file.txt'.

But wait, maybe the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern that matches that path. So for each path in find_paths, we need to create a glob pattern that represents that path. For example, if the path is 'a/b/c', the glob pattern would be 'a/b/c'.

But how to do that? The glob module's glob function can take a pattern and return a list of matches. But here, we need to generate the pattern. So perhaps the function is using the glob module's glob function to generate the pattern. Wait, no. The function is supposed to transform the path into a glob pattern. So maybe the function is using the glob module's glob function to generate the pattern. Wait, but that's not directly possible. Alternatively, maybe the function is using the re module to compile a pattern.

Wait, the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So existing patterns are left as is. So the function needs to take each path and convert it into a glob pattern. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'a/b/c', the glob pattern is 'a/b/c'.

But how to convert a path into a glob pattern? Well, the glob pattern is the same as the path, but with certain characters replaced. For example, in glob, certain characters are special. But the function is supposed to transform the path into a glob pattern, which is the same as the path. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern that matches that path. But that's the same as the path itself. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the path and return it as is, but that seems redundant.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to convert the path into a glob pattern that can be used in a glob search. For example, if the path is 'a/b/c', the glob pattern would be 'a/b/c', but if the path is 'a/b/c/d', the pattern is 'a/b/c/d'. So the function is just returning the path as is, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to convert the path into a glob pattern that can be used in a glob search, but that's the same as the path. So perhaps the function is just returning the path as is, but that seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace certain characters in the path. For example, replacing slashes with asterisks, but that's not the case. The docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So existing patterns are left as is. So the function is supposed to take each path and return it as a glob pattern. But that's the same as the path. So perhaps the function is just returning the path as is, but that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern that matches the path. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file.txt', then the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. So the function is just returning the path as is. But that's not a transformation. So maybe the function is supposed to take the path and return it as a glob pattern, which is the same as the path. So the code would be to return the path as is.

But then the function's purpose is unclear. However, the docstring says that existing patterns are passed through untouched. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the path and return it as a glob pattern, which is the same as the path. Therefore, the code would be to return the path as is.

But that seems too simple. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think again. The function is called make_find_paths, and the argument is a sequence of paths. The function is supposed to transform each path into a glob pattern. So perhaps the function is using the glob module to generate the pattern. For example, if the path is 'a/b/c', the glob pattern would be 'a/b/c', but perhaps the function is using the glob module's glob function to generate the pattern. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern that can be used in a glob search. For example, if the path is 'a/b/c', the glob pattern would be 'a/b/c', but if the path is 'a/b/c/d', the pattern is 'a/b/c/d'. So the function is just returning the path as is.

But then the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    return find_paths

But that's not a transformation. However, the docstring says that existing patterns are passed through untouched. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the same paths as input, but that's not a transformation. So maybe the function is supposed to take the path and return it as a glob pattern, which is the same as the path. Therefore, the code is simply returning the input.

But that seems too simple. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert the path into a glob pattern by replacing certain characters. For example, replacing slashes with asterisks, but that's not what the docstring says. The docstring says that existing patterns are passed through untouched. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the path as is, but that's not a transformation.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern that can be used in a glob search. For example, if the path is 'a/b/c', the glob pattern is 'a/b/c', but if the path is 'a/b/c/d', the pattern is 'a/b/c/d'. So the function is just returning the path as is.

In that case, the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    return find_paths

But the problem says that the function is supposed to transform the path into a glob pattern. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern, but that's the same as the path. Therefore, the code is as above.

But maybe the function is supposed to use the glob module to generate the pattern. For example, using the glob module's glob function to generate the pattern. But that's not possible. The glob module's glob function takes a pattern and returns a list of matches. But here, the function is supposed to generate the pattern. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern that matches that path. For example, if the path is 'a/b/c', the pattern is 'a/b/c'.

But how to do that? Well, the function is supposed to return the path as is. So the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    return find_paths

But that's not a transformation. However, the docstring says that existing patterns are passed through untouched. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the same paths as input. Therefore, the code is as above.

But maybe the function is supposed to use the re module to compile the pattern. For example, using re.compile to create a pattern. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern by replacing certain characters. For example, replacing slashes with asterisks, but that's not what the docstring says.

Given the ambiguity, but based on the docstring, the function is supposed to return the same paths as input. Therefore, the code is:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    return find_paths

But the problem says that the function is supposed to transform the path into a glob pattern. So perhaps the function is supposed to use the glob module to generate the pattern. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the path and generate a glob pattern by using the re module. For example, using re.escape to escape the path and then using a regular expression. But that's not the same as a glob pattern.

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
