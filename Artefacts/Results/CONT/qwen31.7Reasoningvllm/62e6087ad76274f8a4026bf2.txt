Okay, I need to generate the Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the function and the context provided.

The function is called `discard` and it's part of a class. The parameters are `n`, `qid`, `dehydration_hooks`, `hydration_hooks`, and some keyword arguments `**handlers`. The docstring explains each parameter, including their defaults and what they do.

Looking at the context, the class has several methods and attributes, but the main focus here is on the `discard` method. The user mentioned that the code should not include explanations or markdown, just the generated code.

I need to make sure that the generated code matches the function signature and docstring exactly. The parameters are all correctly listed with their defaults. The `dehydration_hooks` and `hydration_hooks` are described as dictionaries, so in Python, they should be typed as `dict`.

Wait, the docstring says `dehydration_hooks: Hooks to dehydrate types (dict from type (class) to dehydration function)`. So in the code, the parameters should be typed as `dehydration_hooks: dict` and `hydration_hooks: dict`.

But in the function definition, the parameters are declared as `dehydration_hooks=None`, `hydration_hooks=None`, etc. So in the code, the parameters should be typed with their types as per the docstring.

So the generated code should have the parameters with their types specified in the function definition. For example, `n: int`, `qid: int`, `dehydration_hooks: dict`, `hydration_hooks: dict`, and the rest as per the docstring.

Wait, the original function definition has `n=-1, qid=-1, dehydration_hooks=None, hydration_hooks=None, **handlers`. So in the code, the parameters should be typed with their types as per the docstring.

So the code should look like:

def discard(self, n: int = -1, qid: int = -1, dehydration_hooks: dict = None, hydration_hooks: dict = None, **handlers):
    """
    Appends a DISCARD message to the output queue.

    :param n: number of records to discard, default = -1 (ALL)
    :param qid: query ID to discard for, default = -1 (last query)
    :param dehydration_hooks:
        Hooks to dehydrate types (dict from type (class) to dehydration
        function). Dehydration functions receive the value and returns an
        object of type understood by packstream.
    :param hydration_hooks:
        Hooks to hydrate types (mapping from type (class) to
        dehydration function). Dehydration functions receive the value of
        type understood by packstream and are free to return anything.
    :param handlers: handler functions passed into the returned Response object
    """

But wait, the original function has `dehydration_hooks` and `hydration_hooks` as parameters with default values. In the code, the types should be specified as `dict` for both, as per the docstring.

So the code should have the parameters with their types, and the docstring as given.

I need to make sure that the code matches the function signature exactly, including the parameter names and types. Also, the docstring must be included as provided.

So the final code would be the function definition with the parameters and the docstring as specified.
