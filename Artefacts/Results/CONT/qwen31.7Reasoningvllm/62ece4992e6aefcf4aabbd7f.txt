Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _parse_image_ref, and it returns a tuple of three elements: image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. The docstring mentions that it raises a ValueError, but the actual implementation isn't provided.

First, I need to figure out how to parse the image_href. The docstring says to use urllib, so I should probably use urllib.parse to split the href. The function is supposed to return a tuple, so I need to split the href into parts.

The image_href is a string, and the expected output is (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). Let's think about how to split it. The netloc is the network location, which is usually the domain part, like 'example.com' or 'www.example.com'. The use_ssl flag would indicate if the URL uses SSL, so maybe the presence of 'https' in the href would indicate that.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. So the image_id might be the part before the netloc, but that depends on how the href is structured. For example, if the href is 'https://example.com/image.jpg', then image_id could be 'image', netloc is 'example.com', and use_ssl is True.

But how to extract that? The urllib.parse module has urlparse, which can split a URL into components. Let's think: urlparse returns a ParseResult object, which has fields like scheme, netloc, path, etc. So maybe the image_id is the path part, but that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the part after the scheme, but that's unclear.

Wait, the function's return type is a tuple of str, str, bool. So the image_id is a string, netloc is a string, and use_ssl is a boolean. So the function needs to parse the image_href into these three components.

Let me think about the steps. First, split the href into parts. Using urlparse, we can get the scheme, netloc, and path. The scheme is the protocol (http or https), netloc is the domain, and path is the path part. The use_ssl would be True if the scheme is 'https', otherwise False.

But the image_id is not clearly defined. The docstring says "image_id" but doesn't specify how to extract it. Maybe the image_id is the part after the scheme, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if the href is 'https://example.com/image.jpg', then the image_id could be 'image', but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the entire path, but that's not clear.

Wait, the function's docstring says that the return is a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So the image_id is a string, but how to get it? Maybe the image_id is the part after the scheme, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if the href is 'http://example.com/path/to/image.jpg', then the image_id could be 'image.jpg', but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the part before the netloc, but that's not standard. For example, if the href is 'https://example.com/image.jpg', then the netloc is 'example.com', and the image_id could be 'image.jpg', but that's not standard. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify how to extract the image_id, so perhaps the user expects that the image_id is the part after the scheme, but that's not clear.

Wait, maybe the image_id is the part after the scheme, but before the netloc. For example, if the href is 'https://example.com/image.jpg', then the image_id is 'image.jpg', netloc is 'example.com', and use_ssl is True. But that's just a guess. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the image_id is the part after the scheme, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the entire path, but that's not clear.

But since the function is supposed to return a tuple, and the user is expecting the code to be generated, perhaps the image_id is the part after the scheme, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the entire path, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the image_id is the part after the scheme, but before the netloc. For example, if the href is 'https://example.com/image.jpg', then the image_id is 'image.jpg', netloc is 'example.com', use_ssl is True. But how to extract that?

Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the part after the scheme, but that's not standard. For example, if the href is 'http://example.com/image.jpg', then the image_id is 'image.jpg', netloc is 'example.com', use_ssl is False.

But how to extract that? The urlparse function would give us the scheme, netloc, and path. So the path would be 'image.jpg', and the image_id could be the path. But that's not necessarily the case. However, given the lack of information, perhaps that's the way to proceed.

So, the steps would be:

1. Parse the image_href using urllib.parse.urlparse.
2. Extract the scheme, netloc, and path.
3. The image_id is the path, netloc is the netloc, use_ssl is True if the scheme is 'https', else False.

But then, the image_id would be the path, which could be something like 'image.jpg', but that's not necessarily the case. However, given the lack of information, that's the best approach.

So, the code would be:

Import urllib.parse.

Then, in the function:

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    from urllib.parse import urlparse
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    image_id = parsed.path
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, what if the image_href is not a valid URL? The function raises ValueError, but the docstring says that it raises ValueError. However, the code doesn't include any error handling. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and not to include any explanation. So the code would just parse the href, and if it's not a valid URL, perhaps it would raise an error, but the function is supposed to raise ValueError. However, the code as written would not handle that. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code is expected to just parse the href, and raise ValueError if it's not a valid URL. But the code as written would not handle that. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code is expected to just parse the href, and the ValueError is raised if the href is invalid.

But the function's docstring says that it raises ValueError, but the code doesn't include any error handling. So perhaps the code is expected to raise ValueError if the href is invalid. But how to handle that? For example, if the href is not a valid URL, urlparse would raise a ValueError. So the code would raise that error, but the function is supposed to raise ValueError. So the code would raise ValueError if the href is invalid.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be as follows:

Import urllib.parse.

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    from urllib.parse import urlparse
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    image_id = parsed.path
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, the function's return type is Tuple[str, str, bool], so the code would return a tuple of three elements. The image_id is parsed.path, which is a string. The netloc is parsed.netloc, which is a string. The use_ssl is a boolean.

But what if the image_href is not a valid URL? For example, if the href is 'image.jpg', then urlparse would raise a ValueError. So the function would raise ValueError in that case. But the docstring says that it raises ValueError, so the code would do that.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would include the error handling. However, the code as written would raise ValueError if the href is invalid. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code would be as written.

Therefore, the code would be:

import urllib.parse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    image_id = parsed.path
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But the function's return type is Tuple[str, str, bool], so the code would return a tuple. However, in Python, the tuple is written as (str, str, bool), so the code would return that.

But the user's code example shows that the function returns a tuple, so the code is correct.

So the final code would be as above.
