Okay, let's see. I need to generate the Python code for the function append_text_to_file based on the given signature and docstring. The user also provided some context about imported packages and other methods that might be used here.

First, the function signature is def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False). The docstring says it writes data from the text buffer to a file. The parameters are file_name, text_buffer, encoding, and overwrite. The overwrite parameter is a boolean, defaulting to False.

Looking at the context, the imported packages include codecs, os, logging, pysolbase. But the code might not need all of them unless they're used. The logger is mentioned, so maybe the function uses logging for output. The other methods like get_file_size, is_file_exist, append_binary_to_file, file_to_textbuffer, etc., are part of the class's methods. 

The task is to implement the append_text_to_file function. So, the function needs to write the text_buffer to the file. The text_buffer is a string, probably. The encoding is specified, so we need to open the file with that encoding. 

Wait, the function's parameters are text_buffer, which is a buffer. But in Python, when writing to a file, you usually have a string. So maybe text_buffer is a string, and we need to write it to the file. But the function's parameters are file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite. So the function should open the file in write mode (if overwrite is True) or append mode (if False?), but wait, overwrite is a boolean. If overwrite is True, it overwrites the file. If False, it appends. But the default is False, so maybe it appends. But the docstring says "overwrite=False" which might mean that if not specified, it overwrites. Wait, the parameter's default is False, so the function uses overwrite=False by default. But the docstring says "overwrite=False" which might be a bit confusing. But the function's parameters have overwrite as a parameter with default False.

So, the function needs to open the file with the given encoding. If overwrite is True, it will overwrite the file. Otherwise, it will append. But how to handle that? Well, in Python, when you open a file with 'w' mode, it overwrites. If you use 'a' mode, it appends. But the overwrite parameter is a boolean. So, if overwrite is True, we use 'w' mode. If False, we use 'a' mode. But the docstring says "overwrite=False" which might mean that the default is to overwrite. Wait, the parameter's default is False, so the function uses overwrite=False by default. But the docstring says "overwrite=False" which might be a bit confusing. But according to the parameters, the default is False, so the function will overwrite if the parameter is not provided. Wait, no. The default is False, so if the user doesn't specify overwrite, it's False. So, the function will overwrite the file if the parameter is not provided. But the docstring says "overwrite=False" which might be a bit confusing. But the function's parameters have overwrite as a parameter with default False. So, the function will overwrite the file if overwrite is True, otherwise append. But the default is False, so the function will append. Wait, no. If the default is False, then when the user doesn't specify overwrite, it's False, so the function appends. But the docstring says "overwrite=False" which might be a bit conflicting. But the function's parameters are as given.

So, the code would need to open the file with the appropriate mode. Let's think: if overwrite is True, then open in 'w' mode. If False, open in 'a' mode. But the default is False, so the function will open in 'a' mode. But the docstring says "overwrite=False" which might be a bit confusing. But the function's parameters have overwrite as a parameter with default False. So, the code would be:

with open(file_name, 'w' if overwrite else 'a', encoding=encoding) as f:
    f.write(text_buffer)

But wait, the text_buffer is a string. So, the function is supposed to write that string to the file. So, the code would open the file with the correct mode and write the text_buffer.

But also, the function might need to handle encoding. So, the code would open the file with the given encoding. For example, if encoding is 'utf-8', then the file is opened with that encoding.

But what about the file's existing content? If the file exists, and overwrite is True, then it's overwritten. If overwrite is False, then it's appended. So, the code would open the file in the appropriate mode.

So, the code would be:

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    """Writes the data in the text buffer to a file"""
    if overwrite:
        mode = 'w'
    else:
        mode = 'a'
    with open(file_name, mode, encoding=encoding) as f:
        f.write(text_buffer)

But wait, the function's parameters are text_buffer, which is a buffer. But in Python, when you write to a file, you pass a string. So, the function is supposed to take a string and write it to the file. So, the code above should work.

But the context mentions that there are other methods like self.file_to_textbuffer(file_name, encoding), which might be used here. But the function is supposed to be implemented as per the given signature.

So, the code would be as above. But need to make sure that the file is opened correctly. Also, the encoding is passed as a parameter, so the code uses that.

But the function is part of a class, and the context mentions that there are methods like self.get_file_size(file_name), which might be used here. But the function is standalone, so the code would just be the function.

So, the code would be:

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    """Writes the data in the text buffer to a file"""
    if overwrite:
        mode = 'w'
    else:
        mode = 'a'
    with open(file_name, mode, encoding=encoding) as f:
        f.write(text_buffer)

But wait, the function's parameters are text_buffer, which is a buffer. But in Python, when you write to a file, you pass a string. So, the function is supposed to take a string and write it. So, the code is correct.

But the context mentions that the function is part of a class, and the methods like self.is_file_exist(file_name) are part of the class. But the function is standalone, so the code is as above.

So, the final code is as written.
