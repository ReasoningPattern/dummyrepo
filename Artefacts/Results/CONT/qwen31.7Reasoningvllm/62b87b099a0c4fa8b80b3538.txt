Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_fill_request_el based on the given docstring. Let me read the docstring again: it says the function checks if the obj class has the fill and request attributes. So the goal is to determine if the class of the object has those attributes.

First, I need to figure out how to check if a class has specific attributes. In Python, you can check if an attribute exists in a class using the hasattr() function. So for a given class, if both 'fill' and 'request' are present, then return True.

Wait, but the function is called is_fill_request_el(obj), which takes an object. So the function should check if the class of obj has those attributes. So the code would be something like:

return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request')

But wait, the docstring says "the obj class has the fill and request attributes." So the function should return True if both attributes exist in the class, otherwise False.

So the code would be:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes.
    """
    return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request')

That's straightforward. I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me test some scenarios. If the object's class has both attributes, returns True. If one is missing, returns False. If neither, also False. That's exactly what hasattr does.

So the code should be as simple as that. No need for any additional checks or imports since it's a basic attribute check.
