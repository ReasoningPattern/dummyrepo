Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called tzname_in_python2, and the docstring says it changes unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2. 

First, I remember that in Python 2, strings are Unicode by default, but the datetime module uses bytestrings. The function is supposed to convert the output of the namefunc into bytestrings. So, the function should take a function that returns a Unicode string and return a bytestring instead.

Looking at the imports: datetime, functools, six. The six module is probably for compatibility with Python 2 and 3. So, maybe the function needs to handle the conversion between Unicode and bytestrings.

In Python 2, the str type is used for bytestrings. So, the function should take the namefunc, which is a function that returns a Unicode string, and return a str (bytestring) version of that.

So, the code would be something like: return namefunc().encode('utf-8')? Wait, but the function is supposed to be a function that takes a namefunc. Wait, the function signature is def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):. So, the function is supposed to take a namefunc as an argument, which is a function that returns a Unicode string. Then, the function should return a bytestring.

But how to handle the encoding? The default encoding for Python 2 is ASCII, but the problem is that the datetime module uses bytestrings. So, perhaps the function should encode the Unicode string using the default encoding, which is ASCII. But in Python 2, the str type is bytestring, so the function would return a str.

Wait, the docstring says "Change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2". So, the function is supposed to take a function that returns a Unicode string and return a bytestring. So, the code would be to take the result of namefunc, and encode it into a bytestring. But how to do that?

In Python 2, the str type is bytestring. So, the function would return namefunc().encode('utf-8')? But wait, the namefunc is a function that returns a Unicode string. So, if namefunc is, say, datetime.datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Z'), which returns a Unicode string, then encoding it with utf-8 would give a bytestring.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to be a function that takes namefunc as an argument. So, the code would be:

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    return namefunc().encode('utf-8')

But wait, in Python 2, the str type is bytestring, so the function would return a str. But the namefunc is a function that returns a Unicode string. So, the code would be to take that Unicode string and encode it into a bytestring using utf-8.

But maybe the function is supposed to handle different encodings? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the default is to use utf-8.

So, the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the function is correctly handling the encoding. Also, the six module might be needed for compatibility, but the function signature doesn't mention that. The imports are given, but the function itself doesn't use them. So, perhaps the code is straightforward.

Another consideration: in Python 2, the str type is bytestring, so the function returns a str. The code would be to encode the result of namefunc into a bytestring. So, the code is:

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    return namefunc().encode('utf-8')

But wait, the function is supposed to be a function that takes namefunc as an argument. So, the code is correct.

But maybe the function is supposed to be a decorator? But the function signature is def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):, so it's not a decorator. It's a function that takes a function as an argument.

So, the code is as above. The imports are given, but the function doesn't use them. So, the code is straightforward.
