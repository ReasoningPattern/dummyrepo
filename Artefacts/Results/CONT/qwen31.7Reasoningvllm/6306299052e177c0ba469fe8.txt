Okay, I need to write the Python function check_sender_and_entity_handle_match based on the given docstring. Let me read the docstring again. The function should check if sender_handle is the same as entity_handle. If they are the same, return True; otherwise, False.

The user mentioned that imported packages include typing, logging, datetime, federation, lxml. But the function doesn't use any of these except maybe for logging? Wait, the function is just a simple check, so maybe the imports are for other parts of the code, but the function itself doesn't need them. The function is straightforward.

So the function is just comparing two handles. Let me think about possible edge cases. What if the handles are None? The docstring doesn't mention handling that, but the function's logic is simple. So the code would be as simple as returning sender_handle == entity_handle.

Wait, but maybe the function is part of a larger system where handles can be None. But according to the docstring, it's just checking if they are the same. So the code would be:

def check_sender_and_entity_handle_match(sender_handle, entity_handle):
    return sender_handle == entity_handle

That's all. No additional logic needed. The imports are probably for other parts of the code, but the function doesn't use them. So the code is straightforward.
