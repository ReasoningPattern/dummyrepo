Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by looking at the function definition.

The function is called paging and takes two arguments: response (a list) and max_results (an integer). The docstring says it returns a generator object that splits the WAPI response into pages, each with max_results elements.

So, the goal is to create a generator that yields chunks of the response list, each of size max_results. The generator should handle the splitting logic.

First, I need to think about how to split the list. If the response is empty, the generator should yield nothing. Otherwise, iterate through the response in steps of max_results.

Wait, the generator should yield each page. So, for example, if the response has 10 elements and max_results is 3, the first page is [0,1,2], the second is [3,4,5], etc.

So, the generator can be implemented with a loop that advances by max_results each time. But how to handle the case where the response isn't a multiple of max_results?

The docstring doesn't mention handling that, so maybe the function assumes that the response is a multiple of max_results. Or perhaps it's up to the caller to handle that. The function's responsibility is just to split it into pages of max_results.

So, the code would loop through the response, taking elements in chunks of max_results. Each chunk is a list, and the generator yields that list.

Let me think about the code structure. The function is a generator, so using a yield statement.

The code would look something like:

def paging(response, max_results):
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i + max_results]

Wait, but what if the response is empty? Then the loop would not run, and the generator would yield nothing. That's correct.

But wait, the docstring says "Return every response with the length of max_results". So if the response is shorter than max_results, it would return the entire response. But the code above would yield the entire response if the length is less than max_results. But if the length is exactly max_results, it would yield one chunk of max_results. So that's correct.

But what if max_results is zero? The function would throw an error, but the docstring doesn't mention handling that. The problem says not to include explanations, so I'll assume that the inputs are valid.

So the code is straightforward. The generator yields slices of the response list, each of size max_results.

So the final code is:

def paging(response, max_results):
    """
    Return every response with the length of max_results
    Args:
        response (list): WAPI response.
        max_results (int): Maximum number of objects to be returned in one page.
    Returns:
        Generator object with WAPI response split page by page.
    """
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i + max_results]

Yes, that should do it. The generator is created by looping through the response in steps of max_results, slicing each time and yielding the slice.
