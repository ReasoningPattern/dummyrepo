Okay, I need to write a Python function called regex_dict that takes a dictionary as input and converts the keys into regex patterns. The docstring says that the keys are filenames with wildcards, and I need to convert those into regexes while leaving the values unchanged.

First, I remember that in Python, the re module has a subpattern function that can handle regular expressions. But wait, the function is supposed to convert the keys into regexes. So for each key in the dictionary, I need to replace the wildcard characters with their regex equivalents.

The wildcards in the filenames are probably like * and ?. So, for example, a key like "file*txt" would become "file.*txt". But I need to make sure that the function handles any wildcards present in the keys.

So the plan is: iterate over each key in the input dictionary. For each key, replace each * with .*, and each ? with ., but wait, maybe the original keys have other wildcards? The problem statement says "wildcards" but doesn't specify what they are. But in the context of filenames, the common wildcards are * and ?. So I'll assume that the keys are filenames with those wildcards.

So, for each key in the dictionary, I'll replace * with .*, and ? with ., but I need to make sure that the regex is properly formed. Also, the function should leave the values intact, so the dictionary's values are not modified.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a new dictionary where the keys are converted to regexes. So the code will create a new dictionary, and for each key in the input, replace the wildcards with regex patterns.

So the code would look like this:

def regex_dict(item):
    import re
    result = {}
    for key in item:
        # Convert the key to a regex
        regex_key = re.sub(r'\*', '.*', key)
        regex_key = re.sub(r'?', '.', regex_key)
        result[key] = item[key]
    return result

Wait, but wait. The problem says "convert *.cpp keys to regex keys". But the function is supposed to handle any keys with wildcards. However, the docstring says that the keys are filenames with wildcards, so maybe the function is supposed to handle * and ? as wildcards. But the example given in the docstring is not clear. But the function is supposed to convert the keys into regexes, so the code above would replace * with .*, and ? with ., which is correct.

But wait, the original keys might have other characters, but the problem says that the keys are filenames with wildcards. So the function is supposed to handle only * and ? as wildcards. So the code above would work.

But I need to make sure that the regex is properly formed. For example, if the key is "file.txt", then the regex would be "file.txt", which is correct. If the key is "file*txt", then it becomes "file.*txt".

But what about the original key having other characters? The problem says that the keys are filenames with wildcards, so perhaps the function is supposed to handle only * and ? as wildcards. So the code above is correct.

So the code would be as written. But I need to make sure that the import is done. Wait, the function is supposed to import re. But in the code, the import is inside the function? No, in Python, you can't import inside a function. Wait, the code as written would have the import re inside the function, which is not allowed. Wait, the code I wrote earlier has import re inside the function, which is invalid. Oh right, that's a mistake.

So the correct approach is to import re at the top of the module, or inside the function. But in Python, you can't have an import inside a function. So the code should have the import re outside the function. But the user's code example shows that the import is within the function. Wait, the user's code example shows:

def regex_dict(item):
	"""
	Convert *.cpp keys to regex keys.
Given a dict where the keys are all filenames with wildcards,
convert only the keys into equivalent regexes and leave the values intact.

Args:
    item: dict to convert
Returns:
    dict with keys converted to regexes
	"""

But the user's code example doesn't show the import. So the code must include the import re. But in the function, the code would need to use re.sub. So the code would need to have import re at the top of the module.

But the user's code example doesn't show that. So the code must include the import re. However, the user's code example shows that the function is written without the import. So the code must include the import.

But in the code that the user is asking for, the function is supposed to be generated. So the code will have the import re at the top, and the function regex_dict.

But the user's code example doesn't include the import. So the generated code must include the import.

So the correct code would be:

import re

def regex_dict(item):
    """
    Convert *.cpp keys to regex keys.
    Given a dict where the keys are all filenames with wildcards,
    convert only the keys into equivalent regexes and leave the values intact.

    Args:
        item: dict to convert
    Returns:
        dict with keys converted to regexes
    """
    result = {}
    for key in item:
        # Convert the key to a regex
        regex_key = re.sub(r'\*', '.*', key)
        regex_key = re.sub(r'?', '.', regex_key)
        result[key] = item[key]
    return result

But the user's code example doesn't include the import, but the function uses re.sub. So the import must be present.

So the final code is as above. But the user's code example shows that the import is not present. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and not to include any explanation. So the code must include the import re.

Therefore, the correct code is as written above.
