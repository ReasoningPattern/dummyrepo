Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the parse_arguments function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by looking at the function signature: it's a function that takes a variable number of arguments, *unparsed_arguments. The docstring says it parses parameters and returns them as a dict maps.

The context mentions that imported packages are collections, argparse, and borgmatic. The function is part of a class, specifically within the SUBPARSER_ALIASES section. The function is called parse_subparser_arguments, which is probably part of a larger class, maybe a parser or a utility class.

Wait, the function is named parse_arguments, but the context mentions parse_subparser_arguments. Hmm, maybe there's a typo or confusion here. But the user provided the function signature as parse_arguments, so I should stick to that.

The goal is to implement parse_arguments so that it takes the unparsed arguments and returns them as a dictionary. But how? The function is supposed to parse parameters, so maybe it's using argparse or collections to process the arguments.

Since the imported packages include argparse, perhaps the function uses argparse to parse the arguments. But the function is called parse_arguments, which is a bit odd. Maybe it's part of a class that's using argparse.

Wait, the context mentions that parse_subparser_arguments is called with unparsed_arguments and subparsers. So maybe the function is part of a class that's handling subparsers. But the user wants the code for parse_arguments, not parse_subparser_arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the unparsed arguments and convert them into a dictionary. For example, if the arguments are passed as a list, the function might split them into key-value pairs.

But how to handle that? Let's think. The function is supposed to return a dict maps. Maybe it's converting the arguments into a dictionary where each key is a parameter name and the value is the value from the arguments.

But without knowing the exact structure of the arguments, it's a bit tricky. However, the function is likely to use argparse to parse the arguments. So perhaps the function is using argparse to parse the arguments and then returns the parsed dictionary.

But the function is named parse_arguments, which is a bit confusing. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Here's an idea: the function could take the unparsed arguments, split them into key-value pairs, and then use argparse to parse them. But since the function is supposed to return a dict, maybe it's just converting the arguments into a dictionary.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that's using argparse, and the parse_arguments method is responsible for parsing the arguments.

But the user's instruction is to generate the code for parse_arguments, so I need to write the function that takes *unparsed_arguments and returns a dict.

Wait, the function is called parse_arguments, and the docstring says it returns them as dict maps. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the unparsed arguments and convert them into a dictionary. For example, if the arguments are passed as a list of strings, like ["--key1=value1", "--key2=value2"], the function would parse them into a dictionary.

But how to handle that? The function would need to process each argument. Maybe using argparse to parse them.

But since the function is called parse_arguments, and the imported packages include argparse, perhaps the function uses argparse to parse the arguments.

So, here's a possible implementation:

Import argparse.

Then, inside the function, create an argparse.ArgumentParser, parse the arguments, and return the dictionary.

But the function is supposed to take *unparsed_arguments. So maybe the function is supposed to take the unparsed arguments and parse them using argparse.

Wait, but the function is called parse_arguments, and the parameters are *unparsed_arguments. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the unparsed arguments and parse them into a dictionary.

But how? Let me think of an example. Suppose the function is called with some arguments, like:

parse_arguments("--key1=value1", "--key2=value2")

Then, the function would parse those into a dictionary.

So, the code would be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    for arg in unparsed_arguments:
        parser.add_argument(arg)
    args = parser.parse_args()
    return vars(args)

But wait, this would add each argument as a separate argument. But if the unparsed_arguments are passed as a list of strings, like ["--key1=value1", "--key2=value2"], then the code would add each as a separate argument. But the parser would then parse them, and the args would be a dictionary.

But the function is supposed to return a dict maps. So this approach would work.

But the function is called parse_arguments, and the parameters are *unparsed_arguments. So the code would take the arguments, parse them, and return the dictionary.

But maybe the function is supposed to handle the arguments in a more structured way. However, given the information, this seems like a plausible approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the unparsed arguments and return them as a dictionary, without using argparse. For example, if the arguments are passed as a list of strings, the function could split them into key-value pairs.

But that's more complex. However, given that the imported packages include argparse, it's more likely that the function uses argparse.

So, the code would be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    for arg in unparsed_arguments:
        parser.add_argument(arg)
    args = parser.parse_args()
    return vars(args)

But wait, the function is supposed to return a dict maps. The vars(args) would convert the arguments into a dictionary. So this should work.

But the function is called parse_arguments, and the parameters are *unparsed_arguments. So the code would take the arguments, parse them, and return the dictionary.

But there's a problem: if the unparsed_arguments are not properly formatted, like if they are not in the form of --key=value, then the parser might not parse them correctly. However, the function is supposed to parse them, so perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the unparsed arguments and split them into key-value pairs. For example, if the arguments are passed as a list of strings, like ["--key1=value1", "--key2=value2"], then the function would parse each as an argument and collect them into a dictionary.

But the code above would do that. So the code seems correct.

But the function is part of a class, and the context mentions that it's within the SUBPARSER_ALIASES section. However, the user hasn't provided the exact class structure, so the code can be written as a standalone function.

So the final code would be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    for arg in unparsed_arguments:
        parser.add_argument(arg)
    args = parser.parse_args()
    return vars(args)

But wait, the function is supposed to return a dict maps. The vars(args) would return a dictionary of the arguments. So this should work.

But maybe the function is supposed to handle the arguments in a different way. However, given the information, this is the best approach.
