Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called set_cut_chars and belongs to a class. The docstring explains that it sets the bytes used to delimit slice points, taking before and after as bytes and returning None.

First, I need to make sure that the function is correctly implemented. The parameters are before and after, which are bytes. The return type is None, which is correct.

Looking at the context provided, there are several imports: argparse, typing, re, logging, pathlib, abc, os. But the function doesn't use any of these except maybe re for regex, but the function is straightforward.

The class has attributes like self.DEFAULT_CUT_BEFORE, self.DEFAULT_CUT_AFTER, self.parts, self._cutter, etc. The function is part of the class, so I need to make sure that the code is within the class context.

Wait, the function is defined as part of a class. The docstring mentions that the function is called set_cut_chars and is part of the class. So the code should be inside the class.

The user also mentioned that the code should not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So just the code.

I need to write the function definition with the given parameters and docstring. The parameters are before and after, which are bytes. The function returns None.

So the code would be:

def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
    """
    Set the bytes used to delimit slice points.

    Args:
        before: Split file before these delimiters.
        after: Split file after these delimiters.
    """
    # Here, we need to set the before and after values for the cutter
    # Assuming that the cutter has attributes or methods to set these
    # For example, maybe self._cutter.set_before(before) and self._cutter.set_after(after)
    # But since the context doesn't show how the cutter is implemented, perhaps the code is just setting the attributes
    # So maybe self._cutter.before = before and self._cutter.after = after
    # But without knowing the exact implementation, perhaps the code is just assigning the attributes
    self._cutter.before = before
    self._cutter.after = after

Wait, but the context mentions that there's a self._cutter attribute. So the function would be setting those attributes. But the user's code might have other parts. However, the user hasn't provided the exact implementation of the _cutter, so the code should just assign the attributes.

So the code would be as above. But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, so the code is correct.

I need to make sure that the function is correctly formatted with the parameters and return type. Also, the docstring is correctly written.

So the final code would be the function as described, with the parameters and docstring.
