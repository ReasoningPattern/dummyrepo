Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_fill_compute_el based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to check if an object's class has the fill and compute methods. 

First, I should figure out how to check if a class has those methods. In Python, you can check if a method exists in a class using the hasattr() function. So, for the class of the object 'obj', I need to check if 'fill' and 'compute' are present.

Wait, but the function is called is_fill_compute_el, and it's supposed to return a boolean. So the code would be something like:

return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')

But I need to make sure that the methods are indeed present. Also, the docstring says "Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods." So the function should return True if both methods exist, False otherwise.

So the code would be straightforward. Let me write that.

Wait, but what about the parameters? The function is defined with obj as the parameter. So the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')

Yes, that should do it. I don't see any other aspects to consider here. The user wants the code without any explanation or markdown, just the Python code.
