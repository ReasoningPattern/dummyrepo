Okay, I need to write a Python function called match that checks if the given filename is of type 'doxyfile' in lowercase. The function is supposed to return True if the lowercase version of the filename matches 'doxyfile'.

First, the function is defined with a parameter 'filename'. The docstring says it checks if the type is 'doxyfile' in lowercase. Wait, but filenames are usually strings, right? So the function is probably checking if the filename, when converted to lowercase, equals 'doxyfile'.

So the logic is straightforward: take the filename, convert it to lowercase, and check if it's equal to 'doxyfile'.

But wait, the docstring says "the type of the given filename". Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to check if the filename ends with '.doxyfile'? Or maybe the type refers to the extension. But the docstring says 'doxyfile' in lowercase, so maybe it's the extension.

Wait, the function's docstring says: "Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". So perhaps the function is checking if the filename's extension is 'doxyfile'. For example, if the filename is 'example.doxyfile', then the extension is 'doxyfile', and the function returns True.

But the function's parameter is 'filename', which is a string. So the function needs to check if the filename ends with '.doxyfile' and then return True. But the docstring says 'the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile' in lowercase'. So maybe the function is checking if the filename, when lowercased, is 'doxyfile'.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to check if the filename is exactly 'doxyfile' (without the .), but that's not likely. Because filenames usually have extensions. So perhaps the function is checking if the filename's extension is 'doxyfile'.

But the docstring is a bit ambiguous. However, the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the task is to generate code based on that.

Looking at the docstring again: "Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So the function is checking if the lowercase version of the filename is 'doxyfile'. So the code would be something like:

return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But wait, what if the filename is 'Doxyfile'? Then lower() would make it 'doxyfile', which matches. So that's correct.

But the function is supposed to check the type. Maybe the function is supposed to check if the filename is exactly 'doxyfile' (without the .), but that's not possible because filenames can have extensions. So perhaps the function is checking if the filename's extension is 'doxyfile'.

But the docstring says 'type of the given filename is 'doxyfile' in lowercase'. So maybe the function is checking if the filename, when lowercased, is 'doxyfile', which would include cases where the filename is 'Doxyfile' or 'doxyfile' or 'Doxyfile.' etc.

But the problem is that the function's parameters are just a filename. So the code would be:

def match(filename):
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But the user also mentioned that imported packages are os, but the code doesn't use os. So maybe that's not relevant here.

So the code is simple. The function returns True if the lowercase filename is 'doxyfile'.
