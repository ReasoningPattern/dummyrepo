Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called pop in a class, and there are some imported packages and class methods mentioned.

First, I need to understand the function's purpose. The docstring says that pop removes a key and returns its value. If the key isn't found, it returns the default provided (which is __marker by default). So the function should handle the case where the key exists or not.

Looking at the class methods: there's self.pop(self, _), self.__setitem__, and self.__getitem__. The user mentioned that these are within the class. So the pop method is part of the class, and it's probably using the dictionary's pop method, but with some custom behavior.

Wait, the function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):. But in the context, the user has self.pop(self, _), which might be a typo. Maybe the actual method is called pop, and the parameters are key and default. But the docstring shows that the first parameter is key, and the second is default. So the function is supposed to take a key and a default value.

But in Python, the pop method of a dictionary usually takes a key and a default. So maybe this is a custom implementation. The user wants me to generate the code for this pop method.

The user also mentioned that the code should not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So I need to output only the code in Python markdown format, which is just the code.

Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be in Python, but in markdown. But Python markdown is just the code. So the answer should be the code as a Python function.

But the function is part of a class. The class has methods like self.pop(self, _), self.__setitem__, and self.__getitem__. So the pop method is probably a method of the class, and it's supposed to implement the pop functionality.

So the code for the pop method would need to check if the key exists in the dictionary. If it does, return the value and remove it. If not, return the default.

But in Python, the standard dict.pop method does that. However, the user might want to implement it manually. So the code would look like:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        return self[key]
    else:
        return default

But wait, the user's docstring says that if the key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised. So if default is not provided, then KeyError is raised. But in the function signature, default is set to __marker by default. So the code would need to handle that.

Wait, the default parameter is set to __marker, but in the docstring, it says that if the key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised. So if the default is provided (like if the user calls pop(key, some_value)), then return that. Otherwise, raise KeyError.

But in the function signature, the default is set to __marker. So the code would need to check if the default is provided. Wait, but in Python, the default parameter in the function is set to __marker, but when the user calls pop(key, default), if default is not provided, it's __marker. So the code would need to handle that.

So the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        return self[key]
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

But wait, the user's docstring says that if the key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised. So if the default is provided (i.e., the user passes a value for default), then return that. Otherwise, raise KeyError.

So the code would check if the default is __marker. If it's not, return it. Otherwise, raise KeyError.

But in the function signature, the default is set to __marker by default. So the code would have to handle that.

So putting it all together, the code for the pop method would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        return self[key]
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

But wait, in Python, the __marker is a special value. So the code should use that. But the user's context mentions that the code is within a class, and the methods are self.pop(self, _), etc. So the code would be part of the class.

But the user's problem is to generate the code for the pop method based on the given signature and docstring. So the code should be as above.

But the user also mentioned that the code should not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So the answer is just the code.

So the final code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        return self[key]
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

But wait, in Python, the __marker is a special value. So the code should use that. But the user's context says that the code is within a class, and the methods are self.pop(self, _), etc. So the code is correct.

So the answer is the code as written above.
