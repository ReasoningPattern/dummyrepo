Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function process_text_links as described. Let me start by understanding the function's purpose. The docstring says it processes links in text, adding attributes and linkifying them. So, the goal is to identify links in the text, convert them into hyperlinks, and add some attributes like rel or href.

First, I should figure out how to extract links from the text. The user mentioned using urllib and re, which are part of the imported packages. Oh, and the function is supposed to be part of a class, but the context says within a class, but the code isn't provided. So maybe the class is already set up, and the function is a method.

The steps I need to take are:

1. Extract all links from the text. The links could be in various formats, like http://example.com, https://example.org, etc. But how to detect them? Using regular expressions might be the way to go. The re module can help match patterns.

2. For each link found, create a hyperlink in the text. This involves replacing the text with a <a> tag. But I need to make sure that the links are properly formatted. Also, adding attributes like rel="nofollow" or href="...".

3. The function should return the processed text with the links linked.

Wait, but the function is called process_text_links, and the parameters are text. So the input is a string, and the output is the modified string.

So, the plan is:

- Use re.findall to find all links in the text. The regex pattern should match URLs. But how to define the pattern? Maybe something like r'https?://\S+'

But that's too simplistic. Maybe using a more robust pattern. For example, using a regex that matches http or https URLs. But I need to make sure that it's not too strict. Alternatively, using the bleach library to sanitize the text, but the docstring says to add attributes and linkify. So maybe the bleach library is used for sanitizing, but the actual linkifying is done with re.

Wait, the problem says to use the imported packages: typing, urllib, re, and bleach. So the function will use these.

But the function is supposed to process the text, so perhaps the steps are:

- Use re to find all links in the text.

- For each link, replace it with a hyperlink.

But how to do that? For example, replace each occurrence of a link with <a href="...">...</a>.

But the problem is that the links could be in different formats. So the regex needs to capture the URL and the surrounding text.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace each link with a hyperlink, but the exact regex is not specified. However, the user hasn't provided the regex, so I need to make a reasonable assumption.

Let me think. The regex pattern for URLs could be something like r'(https?://[^\s]+)'. But that might not capture all cases. Alternatively, using a more comprehensive pattern.

But perhaps the function is supposed to use the re module to find all links, and then replace them with hyperlinks. So, the code would involve:

- Using re.findall to find all matches of the URL pattern.

- Then, for each match, create a hyperlink.

But how to handle the replacement? For example, using re.sub to replace each link with the hyperlink.

So, the code might look like:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    # Find all links using regex
    links = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    # Replace each link with a hyperlink
    processed = re.sub(r'(https?://\S+)', r'<a href="\1" rel="nofollow">\1</a>', text)
    return processed

Wait, but this approach would replace each link with a hyperlink, but the problem is that the regex might not capture the entire link. For example, if the link is part of a larger string, like "http://example.com/somepage", the regex would capture the entire URL.

But the code above uses a regex that matches any URL starting with http or https and followed by non-space characters. So, it should capture the entire URL.

But then, the substitution would replace each match with <a href="...">...</a>. However, the original text might have other characters around the link. For example, if the text is "Visit http://example.com and https://example.org", the substitution would replace each link with the hyperlink, but the original text's surrounding characters would be left as is.

But the problem says to "linkify textual links", which implies that the links are part of the text, and the code should replace them with hyperlinks. So, the approach of using re.sub with a regex that captures the entire link would work.

But there's a problem: the regex might not capture the entire link. For example, if the link is "http://example.com/somepage", the regex would capture "http://example.com/somepage" as the match. So, the substitution would replace that with the hyperlink.

But the code above uses a regex that matches any URL starting with http or https, and then any non-space characters. So, it would capture the entire URL.

But the code as written would replace each occurrence of the URL with the hyperlink. However, the problem is that the substitution is done with a regex that matches the URL, and the replacement is the hyperlink. So, the code would work.

But the problem is that the code may not handle cases where the URL is part of a larger string. For example, if the text is "Check out http://example.com", the code would replace the entire URL with the hyperlink.

But the function is supposed to process the text and linkify the links. So, this approach seems correct.

But then, the code would need to import re and maybe other modules. However, the user has imported urllib and re, so the code would use re.

But the function is supposed to be part of a class, but the context doesn't show that. So, the code would be a standalone function.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, without any explanation. So, the code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    # Find all links using regex
    links = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    # Replace each link with a hyperlink
    processed = re.sub(r'(https?://\S+)', r'<a href="\1" rel="nofollow">\1</a>', text)
    return processed

Wait, but the code uses re.sub with a regex that matches the URL, and replaces it with the hyperlink. However, the problem is that the substitution is done with a regex that captures the entire URL, but the replacement is the hyperlink. So, the code would work.

But the code as written would replace each occurrence of the URL with the hyperlink. However, the problem is that the substitution is done with a regex that matches the entire URL, and the replacement is the hyperlink. So, the code should work.

But there's a problem with the regex. For example, if the text has multiple links, the code would replace each one. But the code uses re.findall to get all links, then re.sub to replace each one. However, the re.sub would replace each occurrence in the text. So, if the text has multiple links, each would be replaced.

But the code as written would replace each link with the hyperlink. However, the code may not handle cases where the URL is part of a larger string. For example, if the text is "Visit http://example.com and https://example.org", the code would replace each link with the hyperlink.

But the problem is that the code uses re.sub with a regex that matches the entire URL, and the replacement is the hyperlink. So, the code should work.

But the user's docstring says to "add some attributes and linkify textual links". The code adds rel="nofollow" and the href attribute. So that's covered.

But the code may not handle cases where the URL is not properly formatted. For example, if the URL is "http://example.com/somepage", the code would capture it as a match.

But the code is supposed to be correct. So, this seems like a valid approach.

But the user's code may need to use the bleach library for sanitizing, but the docstring doesn't mention that. The problem says to use the imported packages, but the function is supposed to process the text. So, perhaps the code is supposed to use re to find the links and then replace them with hyperlinks.

Therefore, the code would be as written above.

But the code may need to import re and maybe other modules. However, the user has imported urllib and re, so the code would use re.

So, the final code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    # Find all links using regex
    links = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    # Replace each link with a hyperlink
    processed = re.sub(r'(https?://\S+)', r'<a href="\1" rel="nofollow">\1</a>', text)
    return processed

But wait, the code uses re.sub with a regex that matches the URL, and the replacement is the hyperlink. However, the code may not handle cases where the URL is part of a larger string. For example, if the text is "http://example.com/somepage", the code would replace the entire URL with the hyperlink.

But the problem says to linkify textual links, which implies that the links are part of the text, and the code should replace them. So, this approach should work.

Another thing to consider: the regex may not capture all possible URLs. For example, URLs with http://, https://, or other protocols. But the code uses r'https?://\S+', which matches http:// or https:// followed by any non-space characters. So, it should capture most URLs.

Therefore, the code should be correct.
