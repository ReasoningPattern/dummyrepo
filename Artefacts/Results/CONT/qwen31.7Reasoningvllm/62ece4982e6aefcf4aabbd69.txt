Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function _replace_register based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function replaces the value of flow_params at register_number with the value from register_value and then deletes the entry at register_value. So, the steps are: take the flow_params dictionary, update the register_number key to be the value of register_value, and then remove the register_value key from the dictionary.

First, I need to access the value at register_number. So, flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]. But wait, what if register_value is not a key in flow_params? The function might need to handle that, but the docstring doesn't mention error checking. So maybe we assume that register_value is a valid key.

Then, after replacing, we need to delete the register_value key. So, del flow_params[register_value].

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    # Replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    # Delete the register_value key
    del flow_params[register_value]

Wait, but what if register_value is not a key in flow_params? The function might raise a KeyError. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps the function is expected to assume that register_value is present.

So the code should be as above. Let me check the parameters. The function takes flow_params, register_number, and register_value. The docstring says that register_value is the value to replace, but the function is replacing flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value]. So the parameters are correct.

Yes, that's the correct approach. So the code is straightforward.
