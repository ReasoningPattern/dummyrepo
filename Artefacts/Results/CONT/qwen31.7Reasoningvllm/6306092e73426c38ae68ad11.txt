Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called merge_extra_vars, and it's supposed to extend a vars_dict with extra_vars. The docstring mentions that extra_vars is a list of extra-vars.

First, I need to make sure I understand the function's purpose. The function takes a vars_dict and an optional extra_vars parameter. The goal is to merge the extra_vars into the vars_dict. So, if extra_vars is provided, each element in that list should be added to the vars_dict as key-value pairs.

Wait, but how does the merge work? If the extra_vars is a list, maybe each element is a string like "host1:port1" or something. So the function needs to split each element into key and value. For example, if extra_vars is ["host1:port1", "host2:port2"], then vars_dict should have "host1" mapped to "port1", and "host2" to "port2".

But the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring says "Extend vars_dict with extra-vars". So the function should take the existing vars_dict and add the extra_vars as additional entries.

So the code would need to iterate over each element in extra_vars, split them into key and value, and add them to the vars_dict.

But how to handle the splitting? For each element in extra_vars, split on the colon. For example, "host1:port1" becomes key "host1" and value "port1".

So the code would look something like:

for var in extra_vars:
    key, value = var.split(':', 1)
    vars_dict[key] = value

But wait, what if the extra_vars is None? The docstring says extra_vars is a list, but maybe it's optional. So if extra_vars is None, we don't do anything. But the function's parameters have extra_vars as a parameter, so maybe we need to check if it's provided.

Wait, the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring says "extra_vars: List of extra-vars". So the function expects extra_vars to be a list. But if it's not provided, maybe it's None. So in the code, if extra_vars is None, we skip adding anything. Otherwise, process each element.

So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is not None:
        for var in extra_vars:
            key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            vars_dict[key] = value

But wait, what if the extra_vars is empty? Then nothing is added. Also, what if a single element in extra_vars has multiple colons? Like "host1:port1:another". Then splitting on colon once would split into key and value, but the rest would be ignored. But the docstring doesn't specify that, so maybe the function assumes that each extra-var is a single key-value pair.

So the code as written should handle that. The split on colon once, and take the first part as key, the rest as value. But if the split results in more than one part, like if the extra-var is "host1:port1:another", then split would give ["host1", "port1:another"], so key is "host1", value is "port1:another". But the function's purpose is to merge the extra-vars, so perhaps the extra-vars are expected to be in the format key:value, so the split on colon once is correct.

So the code seems correct. The user also mentioned that the code should be in Python markdown format, but the user said to output only the code, no explanation. So the answer is the code as written.

Wait, but the user provided the function signature and docstring. The code needs to be generated based on that. So the code is as written above. The user also mentioned that the code is within a class, but the function is standalone. However, the user's context says that the code is within a class, but the function is called merge_extra_vars. So the code is just the function as per the signature.

So the final code is the function as written, with the loop over extra_vars, splitting each into key and value, and adding to vars_dict.
