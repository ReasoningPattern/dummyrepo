Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called protocol_handlers and is part of a class. The docstring explains what it does, including handling different protocol versions and raising a TypeError if the protocol version isn't a tuple.

First, I need to understand the structure of the function. The function takes a cls parameter, which is the class itself, and a protocol_version parameter that can be None or a tuple. The return value is a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. If a protocol_version is provided, it should return either zero or one entries depending on support.

Looking at the imports, there are several packages like logging, collections, time, abc, asyncio, api, neo4j. But the actual code isn't provided, so I need to generate the function body.

The function's docstring mentions that if an explicit version is provided, the dictionary contains zero or one items. So, the code needs to check if the protocol_version is None or a valid tuple. If it's None, return all supported versions. If it's a tuple, check if it's supported and return that version.

But how to implement this? The function is part of a class, so the class probably has a method that keeps track of supported versions. Maybe the class has a static variable or a list of supported versions.

Wait, the function is called protocol_handlers, and the docstring says "return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers, keyed by version tuple." So the class must have some way to track which versions are supported. But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I need to assume that the class has a method or attribute that holds the supported versions.

In the context given, there's a line like self.version_list(cls,versions,limit), which suggests that the class has a method to list versions. But without the actual class code, I need to make assumptions.

Assuming that the class has a list of supported versions, maybe stored in a variable like self.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS. Then, the protocol_handlers function would check if the provided version is in that list.

So, the code would look something like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    supported_versions = cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS
    if protocol_version is None:
        return {version: handler for version, handler in supported_versions.items()}
    else:
        if protocol_version in supported_versions:
            return {protocol_version: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS}
        else:
            raise TypeError("Protocol version not supported")

But wait, the docstring says that if the protocol version is provided, the dictionary contains zero or one items. So if the version is not supported, it should raise a TypeError. But the user's docstring says "raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple". Wait, the docstring says "if protocol version is not passed in a tuple" but the parameter is protocol_version, which is a tuple. So maybe the docstring is a bit confusing. But the actual code should check if the protocol_version is a tuple. So in the code, we need to check if protocol_version is None or a tuple.

Wait, the docstring says: "if an explicit protocol version is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items, depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol version is provided, all available versions will be returned."

So, the code should handle:

- If protocol_version is None: return all supported versions.
- If protocol_version is a tuple: check if it's in the supported versions, return that version's handler.
- If protocol_version is not a tuple: raise TypeError.

So in the code, the function would first check if protocol_version is None. If not, check if it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError. Then, if it's a tuple, check if it's in the supported versions, and return the corresponding handler.

But how to get the handler class? The docstring mentions "handler class for all relevant and supported protocol versions". So the class must have a PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS attribute, which is the class for the handler.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        return {version: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS for version in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS}
    elif isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        if protocol_version in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS:
            return {protocol_version: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS}
        else:
            raise TypeError("Protocol version not supported")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")

But wait, the docstring says "raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple". So the code should check if the protocol_version is not a tuple, and raise TypeError. But the code above checks if it's None, then checks if it's a tuple. So if it's not None and not a tuple, it raises TypeError.

But the docstring says "if protocol version is not passed in a tuple", which would include cases where it's None. Wait, the docstring says "if an explicit protocol version is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items, depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol version is provided, all available versions will be returned."

So the code needs to handle:

- If protocol_version is None: return all versions.
- If protocol_version is a tuple: check if it's supported, return that version's handler.
- If protocol_version is not a tuple: raise TypeError.

So the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        return {version: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS for version in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS}
    elif isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        if protocol_version in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS:
            return {protocol_version: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS}
        else:
            raise TypeError("Protocol version not supported")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")

But the docstring says "raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple". However, in the code, if protocol_version is None, it's handled separately. So the code is correct.

But the user's docstring says "if protocol version is not passed in a tuple", which would include cases where it's None. But the code handles None as a separate case.

So the code should be as above. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, but the instructions say to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as a Python function.

Wait, the original function is defined as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    ...
    """

So the code would be the function definition with the implementation.

But the user's example shows that the code should be generated. So the final code would be the function with the implementation.

So the final code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        return {version: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS for version in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS}
    elif isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        if protocol_version in cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS:
            return {protocol_version: cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS}
        else:
            raise TypeError("Protocol version not supported")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")

But I need to make sure that the variables like cls.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS and cls.PROTOCOL_HANDLER_CLS are defined in the class. Since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I'll assume that the class has these attributes.

So the code is as above. The user's context includes lines like self.SUPPORTED_VERSIONS, so the code is correct.
