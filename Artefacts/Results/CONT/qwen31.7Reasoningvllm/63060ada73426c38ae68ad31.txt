Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _convert_non_cli_args and is part of a class. The docstring explains that it casts arguments to correct types by modifying the values_dict parameter, defaulting to strings.

First, I need to look at the parameters: parser_name and values_dict. The function is supposed to modify the values_dict. The default for values_dict is a dictionary, but the docstring says it's a dict of arguments. The function's purpose is to convert these arguments to correct types.

Looking at the context provided, there are several other methods and attributes in the class, but the main task here is to implement the _convert_non_cli_args function. The user mentioned not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown, just the code.

So, the function needs to take parser_name and values_dict, and modify the values_dict. The default is strings, but maybe there are other types. The function should probably cast each value to the appropriate type based on the parser name. For example, if the parser is 'main', maybe some arguments are integers, others are strings.

But how to determine the types? The function isn't provided with any logic, so maybe it's a stub. The user probably expects that the function will handle the conversion based on the parser's requirements. However, since the function is part of a class and the context includes other methods like resolve_custom_types, perhaps the function is supposed to handle type conversion as part of the class's logic.

Wait, the docstring says "By default all the values are strings." So the function's role is to cast them to correct types. But without knowing the specific types for each parser, how can the function know? Maybe the function is supposed to handle the conversion based on the parser's specifications, which are perhaps handled elsewhere in the class.

But since the user hasn't provided that logic, maybe the function is just a placeholder. However, the user wants the code generated, so perhaps the function is supposed to perform some basic type conversion. For example, converting strings to integers if possible, or other types.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger system where the parser_name determines the type conversion. For instance, if the parser is 'virsh', certain arguments are integers, others are strings. But without knowing the exact logic, the function can't be written. However, the user might expect that the function is implemented with some basic type conversion.

Given that, perhaps the function is supposed to cast each value in the values_dict to the appropriate type based on the parser name. For example, if the parser is 'main', maybe some arguments are integers, others are strings. But how to determine which ones?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle the conversion as part of the class's logic, perhaps using the parser_name to determine the type. For example, if the parser is 'main', then certain arguments are integers, others are strings.

But without specific information, the function can't be fully implemented. However, the user might expect that the function is written with some basic type conversion. For example, converting strings to integers where possible, or other types.

So, perhaps the function will iterate over the values_dict and convert each value to the appropriate type. For example, if the value is a string, check if it's a number and convert to int, or leave as string.

But since the function is part of a class and the context includes other methods like resolve_custom_types, maybe the function is supposed to handle the conversion as part of the class's processing.

In the absence of specific logic, the function can be written to cast each value in the values_dict to the appropriate type. For example, converting strings to integers if possible, or leaving as strings.

So, the code might look like this:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    # Iterate over the values_dict and convert to appropriate types
    for key, value in values_dict.items():
        # Determine the type based on parser_name
        # For example, if parser is 'main', convert to int if possible
        # But without knowing the exact logic, this is a placeholder
        # Assume that the parser_name determines the type conversion
        # For simplicity, convert to str first, then to int if possible
        if isinstance(value, str):
            # Check if it's a number
            if value.isdigit():
                values_dict[key] = int(value)
            else:
                values_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # Assume it's a string, convert to str
            values_dict[key] = str(value)

But this is just a placeholder. The actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements of the parser_name. However, the user hasn't provided that information, so the code must be written with the given info.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle the conversion based on the parser's specifications, which are handled elsewhere in the class. But since the user hasn't provided that, the function can't be written with that logic.

Therefore, the function is a stub that converts the values_dict to the appropriate types, perhaps by converting strings to integers where possible.

So, the generated code would be the function as described, with the conversion logic.
