Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called plugins_manager and it's a class method. The docstring says it gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

First, I need to understand the context. The user provided some imported packages like os, sys, infrared. But the actual code isn't given. The class has methods like _get_service, setup, and others. The plugins_manager is supposed to call cls._get_service with the service name 'PLUGINS_MANAGER'.

So, the function plugins_manager is a class method. It needs to call cls._get_service with the name 'PLUGINS_MANAGER'. But wait, the docstring mentions ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. Maybe the ServiceName is a class or a constant? But since it's not provided, perhaps the actual implementation would use a service name like 'PLUGINS_MANAGER' as a string.

Wait, the docstring says "Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So, the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER is probably a constant or a class variable. But since it's not given, maybe the code just uses the string 'PLUGINS_MANAGER' as the service name.

So, the code for plugins_manager would be something like:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service('PLUGINS_MANAGER')

But wait, the docstring says it's getting the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. So maybe the ServiceName is a class, and the actual service name is ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. But without knowing the exact implementation, perhaps the code just uses the string 'PLUGINS_MANAGER'.

Also, the user mentioned that the class has methods like self._get_service(cls, name), so the plugins_manager would call that method with the name 'PLUGINS_MANAGER'.

So the code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(cls, 'PLUGINS_MANAGER')

Wait, but the function is a class method, so the first argument is cls. So the code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(cls, 'PLUGINS_MANAGER')

But the docstring says "Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So maybe the ServiceName is a class, and the code is using ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. But since it's not provided, perhaps the code just uses the string.

Alternatively, maybe the ServiceName is a class, and the code is something like:

return ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER

But again, without knowing the exact implementation, it's hard to say. However, the user's context mentions that the class has a method self._get_service(cls, name), so the plugins_manager would call that method with the name 'PLUGINS_MANAGER'.

So the code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(cls, 'PLUGINS_MANAGER')

But the user's docstring says "Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So perhaps the ServiceName is a class, and the code is using ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code just uses the string.

In any case, the code should call cls._get_service with the service name 'PLUGINS_MANAGER'. So the generated code would be as above.
