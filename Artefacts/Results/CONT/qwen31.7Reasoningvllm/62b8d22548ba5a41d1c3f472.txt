Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called cachedmethod, and it takes cache, key, and lock as parameters. The docstring says it returns a decorator that can call a result in the cache.

First, I need to understand what the decorator does. The function is supposed to wrap another function and check the cache. The parameters key and lock are mentioned, but they're not used in the docstring. Wait, the docstring says "key=hashkey" but maybe that's a typo? Or maybe it's a placeholder. The user might have intended that the key is a function that generates the key for the cache.

So, the decorator needs to take the cache, a key function, and a lock. The cache is probably a dictionary or some cache structure. The decorator should check if the result is already in the cache. If it is, return it. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache with the key, and maybe lock it to prevent concurrent access.

Wait, the lock parameter is mentioned. So maybe the decorator uses a lock to synchronize access to the cache. But how? Maybe the lock is used to ensure that the cache is not modified while the function is being executed.

So the steps for the decorator:

1. Define the wrapper function that will be used as the decorator.
2. The wrapper will check if the result is in the cache using the key function.
3. If it's present, return the cached result.
4. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache with the key, and maybe lock it.
5. Return the result.

But how to handle the lock? Maybe the lock is a threading.Lock object. So the decorator would need to acquire the lock before accessing the cache, and release it after.

Wait, the lock parameter is passed to the decorator. So the decorator's wrapper function would need to use the lock. But how? Maybe the lock is used to ensure that the cache is not modified while the function is being executed.

Alternatively, the lock could be used to synchronize access to the cache. For example, when the function is called, the lock is acquired, the result is computed, then the lock is released.

But the problem is that the cache is being accessed, so the lock should be acquired before accessing the cache, and released after.

So the decorator would need to handle the lock. Let's think about the code structure.

The function cachedmethod returns a decorator. So the decorator is a function that takes a target function (the function to be decorated) and returns a new function.

So, the code would look something like this:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Check if the result is in the cache
            key_arg = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if key_arg in cache:
                return cache[key_arg]
            # Compute the result
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            # Store in cache
            cache[key_arg] = result
            # Acquire lock
            if lock is not None:
                lock.acquire()
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the lock is passed as a parameter to the decorator. So the lock is used in the wrapper. But the lock is a parameter to the decorator, so when the decorator is called, it's passed the lock. But in the code above, the lock is used in the wrapper. However, the lock is not a parameter to the wrapper. So maybe the lock is used in the wrapper, but how?

Wait, the lock is passed to the decorator. So the decorator's wrapper function would need to use the lock. But in the code above, the lock is not used. So perhaps the lock is used to synchronize access to the cache. For example, when the function is called, the lock is acquired, the result is computed, then the lock is released.

But in the code above, the lock is not used. So maybe the lock is not used, or maybe the code is incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe the lock is used to prevent multiple threads from accessing the cache simultaneously. So the decorator would need to acquire the lock before accessing the cache, and release it after.

But in the code above, the lock is not used. So perhaps the code is incomplete.

Wait, the user's docstring says that the lock is a parameter. So the decorator should handle the lock. But in the code I wrote, the lock is not used. So maybe the code is incorrect.

Hmm. Let me think again.

The lock is passed to the decorator. So the decorator's wrapper function would need to use the lock. But how?

Maybe the lock is a threading.Lock object, and the wrapper acquires it before accessing the cache, and releases it after.

So in the wrapper, before checking the cache, acquire the lock. Then, if the cache is not present, compute the result, store it, and release the lock.

But in the code above, the lock is not used. So the code would be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Acquire lock
            if lock is not None:
                lock.acquire()
            # Check cache
            key_arg = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if key_arg in cache:
                return cache[key_arg]
            # Compute result
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            # Store in cache
            cache[key_arg] = result
            # Release lock
            if lock is not None:
                lock.release()
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But this would work if the lock is a threading.Lock object. However, the user hasn't provided any imports for threading, so maybe the code is incomplete.

But the user's problem is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would include the decorator, using the lock parameter.

But the problem is that the lock is not used in the code. Wait, but the code is supposed to use the lock. So the code above would use the lock, but only if it's not None.

But the user's docstring says that the lock is a parameter. So the code should handle it.

So the final code would be as above.

But the key is that the key is generated by the key function. The key is passed as a parameter to the decorator. So the key is a function that takes the args and kwargs and returns the key.

So the code would have the key function as part of the decorator.

But the user's code has key=hashkey, which might be a typo. But the user's code is given as is, so I need to follow that.

So the code would be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Acquire lock if provided
            if lock is not None:
                lock.acquire()
            # Generate key using the provided key function
            key_arg = key(*args, **kwargs)
            # Check if the result is in the cache
            if key_arg in cache:
                return cache[key_arg]
            # Compute the result
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            # Store the result in the cache
            cache[key_arg] = result
            # Release the lock
            if lock is not None:
                lock.release()
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the key is supposed to be a function, but in the code, key is a parameter to the decorator. So the key is a function that takes args and kwargs and returns the key. So the code is correct.

But the user's docstring says that key=hashkey. So maybe hashkey is a function that generates the key. But the user hasn't provided that function, so the code would use the key parameter as provided.

So the code is as above.

But the user's problem is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be as written.

But the user's code has a docstring that says "key=hashkey", which might be a typo. But the code is written as per the given parameters.

So the final code is as above.
