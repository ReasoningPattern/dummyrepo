Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _inline_r_setup and takes a code string and returns a str. The docstring mentions that R settings can't be configured via env variables but need to be set via R options once R starts. The task is to generate the code without any explanation or markdown.

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says that the function sets R options. But how? In Python, there's the rpy2 library which allows interacting with R. So maybe this function is setting R options using rpy2.

Wait, the function is named _inline_r_setup, which suggests it's a private method. But the user hasn't provided the actual implementation. The problem is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is supposed to set some R options.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual code to modify. The function's purpose is to set R options, but the code isn't given. So maybe the task is to write the code that sets R options using rpy2.

So, the function would need to import rpy2.robjects as robjects, and then set the R options. For example, setting the options for R, like robjects.r.options("some_option", value="some_value").

But the exact options to set are not specified in the docstring. The docstring says that these are set here, but the actual code would need to set specific options. However, since the user hasn't provided the specific options, maybe the code is supposed to set some common R options.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set the R options for the current session. For example, using robjects.r.options().

So, the code would look something like:

import rpy2.robjects as robjects

def _inline_r_setup(code: str) -> str:
    # Set R options here
    robjects.r.options("some_option", value="some_value")
    return code

But since the user hasn't provided specific options, maybe the code is just a placeholder. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function sets R options, so the code must include setting those options.

But without knowing which options, perhaps the code is supposed to set some common ones. For example, setting the R options for the current session.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to set the R options for the current session, using rpy2. So the code would import rpy2, and then set the options.

But the function is supposed to take code as input and return a str. Wait, the function's return type is str, but the code is passed as a string. Maybe the function is supposed to process the code and set the R options, then return the code? Or perhaps the code is being processed to set the R options, and the function returns the modified code.

But the docstring says that the function sets the R options. So the code would be something like:

import rpy2.robjects as robjects

def _inline_r_setup(code: str) -> str:
    # Set R options here
    robjects.r.options("some_option", value="some_value")
    return code

But since the user hasn't provided specific options, maybe the code is just a skeleton. However, the user's example shows that the function is supposed to generate code that sets R options. So the code would need to include the necessary imports and the setting of R options.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual code to modify. So perhaps the code is supposed to set the R options for the current session, using rpy2.

So the final code would include the import statement and the setting of R options. But since the user hasn't provided specific options, maybe the code is just a placeholder.

But the user's example shows that the function is supposed to generate code that sets R options. So the code would be:

import rpy2.robjects as robjects

def _inline_r_setup(code: str) -> str:
    robjects.r.options("some_option", value="some_value")
    return code

But the exact options are not specified. However, the problem requires generating the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must include the necessary imports and the setting of R options.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

import rpy2.robjects as robjects

def _inline_r_setup(code: str) -> str:
    robjects.r.options("some_option", value="some_value")
    return code

But the user might expect that the code sets specific options. However, since the docstring doesn't specify which options, the code is just a placeholder. So the answer is the code that sets R options using rpy2.
