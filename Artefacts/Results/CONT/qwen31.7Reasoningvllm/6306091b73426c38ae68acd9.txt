Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called workspace_manager and is a class method. The docstring says it gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service().

First, I need to understand the context. The user mentioned imported packages like os, sys, infrared. But the code isn't provided yet. The class has methods like _get_service, setup, plugins_manager, ansible_config_manager, execution_logger_manager, register_service, and workspace_manager.

The task is to generate the code for the workspace_manager method. The docstring indicates that it's calling cls._get_service with the service name WORKSPACE_MANAGER. So, the code should be something like:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But wait, the docstring says "Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So the method is returning the service obtained by calling _get_service with the service name.

But the user's code example shows that the function is a class method, so the correct syntax would be using cls._get_service. However, the ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER is probably a constant, so it should be defined somewhere. But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe it's assumed to be a constant.

So the code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, and the docstring is as given. The user also mentioned that the code should not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So the output should be just the code in Python markdown format.

Wait, the user's instruction says to output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. But Python markdown is just the code. So the answer should be the function definition with the return statement.

But the original function signature is def workspace_manager(cls):, and the docstring is given. So the code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, and the docstring is as given. So the code should include the docstring as specified.

But the user's original code has the docstring as:

def workspace_manager(cls):
	"""
	Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
	"""

So the code should have the function definition with the docstring. Therefore, the correct code is the function with the return statement and the docstring.

But the user's example shows that the function is a class method, so the code is as above. So the final answer is the function with the return statement and the docstring.
