Okay, I need to write a Python function called parser_flags that takes an argparse.ArgumentParser instance and returns all its argument flags as a space-separated string. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that ArgumentParser objects have a method called _actions, which is a list of all the actions added to the parser. Each action corresponds to an argument. So maybe I can loop through these actions and collect the option strings for each argument.

Wait, each action's 'option_strings' attribute holds the flags for that argument. For example, if an argument is added with parser.add_argument('--verbose', '-v'), then option_strings would be ['--verbose', '-v']. So for each action in parser._actions, I should check if the action has any option strings. If it does, then add all of them to the result.

But wait, there might be actions that aren't arguments, like the help action? Or maybe not. Probably, the _actions list includes all the arguments. So I can iterate through them, collect their option strings, and then join them all with spaces.

Hmm, but how do I access those? Let's outline the steps:

1. Iterate over parser._actions. Each action is an instance of an Action class.
2. For each action, check if it has option_strings. If it's not empty, then take all the strings in there.
3. Collect all these strings from all actions and combine them into a single space-separated string.

Wait, but the function's parameter is named 'parser' in the docstring, but the argument is called 'script' in the parameters. Oh, that's a mistake in the docstring. The user probably meant the parameter is an ArgumentParser instance. So in the code, the function's parameter is called 'parser'? Wait the function signature says def parser_flags(parser):, so the parameter is indeed named parser. The docstring says 'script: argparse.ArgumentParser instance', which is a typo. So I should proceed under the assumption that the parameter is the parser.

So the code would be something like:

def parser_flags(parser):
    flags = []
    for action in parser._actions:
        if action.option_strings:
            flags.extend(action.option_strings)
    return ' '.join(flags)

Wait, but does this include all the possible flags? Like positional arguments don't have option strings. So positional arguments won't be included, which is correct because they don't have flags. Only optional arguments have flags.

Wait the question says "argument flags", so maybe they only want the optional arguments. That makes sense because positional arguments are required and don't have flags. So the code above should work.

Wait, but how about the default actions like --help? The _actions might include those. The function's docstring says to return all the flags, so I should include all of them. The user probably wants all the flags that the parser has, including those added by default.

Testing this, let's see: if I create a parser and add some arguments, then the _actions would have each of their option strings. For example, if I add an argument with -v and --verbose, those would be in the list. The --help is added by default when using add_argument('--help', ...), but in the standard parser, the help argument is automatically added. So the code would pick that up too.

Therefore, this approach should work. Let me make sure that the code is correct. The function loops through each action in the parser's _actions, checks if the action has any option strings (so skips positional arguments), then adds all the strings for that action to the list. Then joins them with spaces.

Wait, but the order? The actions are in the order they were added, so the flags would be listed in the same order. The problem doesn't specify any particular order, so that's probably okay.

I think that's it. So the code would be as above. Let me check again. Oh, right, the parameter is called parser, so that's correct. The function's docstring says 'script: argparse.ArgumentParser instance' but the parameter is named parser. Oh, the user probably made a mistake in the docstring. Since the function's parameter is called parser, the code uses that variable. So the code is okay.

Wait, but in the docstring's Args section, the parameter is labeled as 'script', but the actual parameter name in the function is 'parser'. So there's a discrepancy here. However, the user's instruction says to base on the function signature and docstring. The function signature says the parameter is called parser, so the code should use that. The docstring's Args section might be an error, but perhaps the user wants the code to follow the signature, not the docstring's labels. So proceed with the code as written.

Another possible edge case: if an action has no option strings, like a store const but without any flags? Wait, no. The optional arguments have their option strings. So the code correctly skips any actions without them (like positional arguments).

So I think that's the solution. Let's code it.
