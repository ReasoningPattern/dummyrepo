Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem. The function is called validate_hierarchy and it's part of a class since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The parameters are validate_objects (default True), check_digests (default True), and show_warnings (default False). The docstring says it returns num_objects and good_objects, which are the counts of objects checked and those valid.

Hmm, the function probably checks some hierarchy of objects in the storage. Since it's a method, maybe the class has a structure where it can traverse these objects. The parameters control whether to validate the objects themselves, check their digests, and whether to show warnings. 

First, the return values. The function should return two integers. So the return statement will have those two variables. The function needs to count all objects checked (num_objects) and how many were valid (good_objects). 

The code structure. Since it's a method, inside the class, I'll have to define it. Maybe the class has attributes like a list of objects or some way to access them. Let's assume there's a way to get all the objects, perhaps a list called objects. 

The logic steps: iterate over each object in the hierarchy. For each object, if validate_objects is True, then perform some validation. Maybe each object has a validate() method that returns a boolean. Also, check_digests would involve another check, like verifying a digest value. If either check fails, the object isn't counted as good. 

But how to handle the parameters? If validate_objects is False, maybe we still count the objects but don't validate them. Wait, the return is num_objects, which is the number checked. So even if validate_objects is off, we still count them? Or does "checked" mean the validation steps are done? The doc says "number of objects checked that were found to be valid", so the 'good' count only comes from those actually validated. 

Wait, perhaps the parameters control whether to perform certain checks. For example, when validate_objects is True, each object is validated. Similarly for check_digests. But how do they combine? Like, maybe both checks are done when both are True. 

The function should loop through each object in the hierarchy. Let's think of initializing counters: num_objects and good_objects. 

Starting with num_objects = 0 and good_objects = 0. Then for each obj in the hierarchy (maybe a list or some structure):

- Increment num_objects by 1 for each object considered. But does "checked" mean that the validation is performed? The parameter validate_objects is a flag. So if validate_objects is True, then we do the validation steps. Otherwise, maybe we just count the object without checking? 

Wait, the description says "Validate storage root hierarchy". The return is the number of objects checked, so perhaps when validate_objects is True, each object is validated, and thus counted. If it's False, maybe the function just counts them without doing validation. But the parameters might allow for different validation steps. 

Alternatively, maybe the function will always count all objects, but the validation and digest checks are optional. So even if validate_objects is False, the num_objects is the total, but good_objects is 0? Or maybe the parameters determine which checks are performed, but the count of objects checked is the total regardless. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the docstring again. 

The returns are "number of objects checked" and "number of objects checked that were found to be valid". So, "checked" implies that they went through some validation process. So if validate_objects is False, perhaps the function doesn't check any objects, so num_objects would be 0? But that might not make sense. Maybe the parameters control which aspects are checked. Like, validate_objects could mean checking the object's integrity, while check_digests is another check. 

Alternatively, maybe the function will check all objects in the hierarchy, and the parameters determine whether certain validations are performed. For example, when validate_objects is True, each object is validated (maybe via a method), and if check_digests is True, their digests are checked. The 'good' count is the number where all applicable checks passed. 

So the steps would be:

Initialize num_objects and good_objects to 0.

Loop over each object in the hierarchy:

   num_objects +=1

   if validate_objects:

       valid = obj.validate()  # assuming this is a method that returns True/False

       if check_digests and valid:

           valid = obj.check_digest()  # another method?

       if valid:

           good_objects +=1

       else:

           if show_warnings: print a warning.

   else:

       maybe just count but not validate. Wait, but in that case, the good_objects wouldn't be incremented. 

Wait, perhaps when validate_objects is True, we perform the checks and count the good ones, but if it's False, then maybe we don't perform the checks but still return the count. But the doc says the function returns the number of objects checked (so maybe when validate_objects is False, it's just counting, but not doing validation, so the good_objects would be same as num_objects? Or no, perhaps the function is only doing validation when the parameters are set. 

Alternatively, maybe the parameters are flags that control whether to perform certain validations. So when validate_objects is True, the code checks each object's validity, and when check_digests is True, it also checks their digests. The 'good' count is the number that passed all the checks that were enabled. 

So the logic would be:

for each obj in the hierarchy:

   num +=1

   if validate_objects:

       valid = True

       if obj's validation (like some method):

           maybe check the object's attributes?

       Then, if check_digests is also true, do another check.

       If both are okay, then good +=1

       else, if show_warnings, log a warning.

But how exactly to structure that? Let's think of the object having a method that returns validity. Maybe the object has a 'valid' attribute or a 'validate' method. Let's assume each object has a validate() method which returns a boolean. 

Then, the code could be something like:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self.get_all_objects():  # assuming there's a method to get all objects
        num_objects +=1
        if validate_objects:
            valid = obj.validate()
            if check_digests and valid:
                valid = obj.check_digest()  # another method for digest check
            if valid:
                good_objects +=1
            else:
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: {obj} is invalid.")
    return num_objects, good_objects

Wait, but maybe the check_digests is part of the object's validation. Or perhaps the digest check is a separate step. 

Alternatively, maybe the check_digests is a parameter that decides whether to check the digest of the object. So, when validate_objects is True, the function first checks if the object is valid (maybe through existence or some other criteria), and then if check_digests is True, also checks the digest. 

But the exact implementation might depend on the class's structure. Since the problem doesn't give more context, I have to make some assumptions. 

The function signature includes 'self', so the method is part of a class. The code must be inside that class. 

Another thing: the parameters have default values. So the method can be called with different options. 

What if the hierarchy is stored in a tree-like structure, and the method needs to traverse it? Maybe the class has a root, and the method walks through all children. But for simplicity, perhaps the code uses a generator or a list to get all the objects. 

Assuming that self has a way to get all objects, perhaps via a method called get_objects() or something. 

Alternatively, maybe the objects are stored in a list called self.objects. 

In any case, the code must loop through all objects in the hierarchy. 

Another point: the return is two values, so the function returns a tuple (num_objects, good_objects). 

The parameters:

- validate_objects: if True, perform object validation. So when it's False, perhaps we don't do any validation, but still count the objects. 

Wait, the docstring says "Validate storage root hierarchy". So maybe when validate_objects is True, the function does the validation, but when it's false, it skips it. 

Wait, the function's return is "number of objects checked" which would be the number of objects that went through any of the checks. So if validate_objects is False, then maybe the function just counts them without doing any checks, so the 'good_objects' would equal the 'num_objects' because they weren't validated. But that might not make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps "checked" here means that the object was considered in the validation process. So if validate_objects is False, then the function doesn't check anything, so the num_objects would be 0? No, that probably isn't the case. The parameters are flags to enable certain checks. 

Wait the function's return is the number of objects checked (so the ones that were actually validated, perhaps). 

Hmm, maybe the parameters are whether to perform the checks. So, if validate_objects is True, then each object is validated (so checked and counted towards num_objects), and if check_digests is True, then also check their digests. 

Alternatively, the 'num_objects' is the total number of objects in the hierarchy, and 'good_objects' is how many passed the validations. 

Wait the docstring says "number of objects checked that were found to be valid". So the checked ones are those that went through the validation process. So, if validate_objects is set to False, then the function doesn't check any objects, so the num_objects would be 0? That seems odd. 

Alternatively, perhaps 'num_objects' is the total number of objects considered, and 'good_objects' is the count of those that passed all the checks. 

So even if validate_objects is False, the function still counts all objects but doesn't perform validation. But then how would that affect the good_objects? Maybe in that case, all are considered valid, so good_objects would equal num_objects. 

Wait, that could be possible. For example, if validate_objects is False, then the code skips the validation steps and just counts all objects as valid. 

Alternatively, maybe when validate_objects is False, the function doesn't validate, so the 'good_objects' is the same as 'num_objects', because there's no check to fail. 

Hmm, perhaps the parameters are flags to decide which checks to perform. So, the 'num_objects' is the total objects in the hierarchy. Then, 'good_objects' is the count of objects that passed all the checks that were enabled. 

So, the function would always count all objects (so num_objects is the total number), but when validate_objects is True, it checks each object's validity, and when check_digests is also true, it does that check as well. 

Wait, perhaps the parameters are optional checks. So, the function will always count all objects (so num_objects is fixed as the total), but only perform validation when validate_objects is True. Then, for each object, if validate_objects is True, it checks validity, and if check_digests is True, also checks the digest. 

If either check fails, then the object is not counted as good. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'check_digests' is a subset of the validation. Like, if validate_objects is True, then the digest check is part of it, but can be toggled via the parameter. 

The code needs to handle these flags. 

So, in the loop:

for each object in the hierarchy:

    num_objects +=1

    if validate_objects:

        valid = True

        if we need to check the object's validity (maybe via a method), and then if check_digests is also True, check the digest. 

        For example:

        valid = obj.validate()

        if check_digests and valid:

            valid = obj.check_digest()

        if valid:

            good_objects +=1

        else:

            if show_warnings:

                print warning

    else:

        # if not validating objects, then perhaps the good count is the same as num_objects?

        # but then the function's return would have good_objects equal to num_objects when validate_objects is False. 

        # But the doc says the good_objects are those checked and found valid. So if we don't validate, then we didn't check their validity, so maybe the good count is 0? Or maybe the 'good' is only counted when the validation is done. 

Hmm, this is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the problem. 

The function's docstring says it returns the number of objects checked and the number of those that were valid. 

So, "checked" implies that some checks were done on them. So when validate_objects is False, the function doesn't check any objects, so the num_objects would be 0? But that's probably not right. The function's name is validate_hierarchy, so maybe even if validate_objects is off, it's still checking something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the 'validate_objects' parameter controls whether to validate each individual object, while 'check_digests' might check the hierarchy's digests but not the objects themselves. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'num_objects' is the number of objects that were actually validated (i.e., the checks were run on them). 

Wait, the parameters have defaults: validate_objects and check_digests are True by default. So by default, the function will validate the objects and check their digests, and return the counts. 

So, the code must loop through each object in the hierarchy. For each, if validate_objects is True, then run some validation. If check_digests is also True, then run that check. 

Let me structure it like this:

Initialize counters to 0.

Loop over all objects in the hierarchy:

   num_objects +=1

   if validate_objects:

       valid = obj.validate()

       if check_digests and valid:

           valid = obj.check_digest()  # maybe this is another check. 

       if valid:

           good_objects +=1

       else:

           if show_warnings:

               print warning.

   else:

       # if not validating, then maybe we don't do anything, so the object is considered valid?

       # but then good_objects would be the same as num_objects. 

       # Or perhaps when validate_objects is False, the function just counts the objects but doesn't validate them, so all are considered 'good'? 

       # Because the 'good' is only counted when the validation was done. 

       # So in that case, if we don't validate, then good_objects is 0? Or maybe the good is the same as num because they were not checked, so no invalid found? 

Hmm, the wording is "number of objects checked that were found to be valid". So if you didn't check them, they can't be part of that count. 

So, when validate_objects is False, then the code skips the validation steps, so the 'good_objects' remains 0, and 'num_objects' is the total objects that were checked (but since validation is off, they weren't actually checked, so maybe num_objects is 0? But that's conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps 'num_objects' is the total number of objects in the hierarchy, and 'good_objects' is the number that passed validation when enabled. 

Wait, maybe the parameters are whether to perform the checks, but the function will still count the objects. So:

num_objects is the total number of objects in the hierarchy. 

good_objects is the number that passed validation (when validate_objects is True) and digest check (when check_digests is True). 

So, the code would first get all the objects, count them (so num_objects is the length of the list). Then, for each object, if validate_objects is True, run the checks. 

Wait, but how to get all the objects? Let's assume that there's a method called get_objects() that returns an iterator over all objects in the hierarchy. 

So:

objs = self.get_objects()

num_objects = len(objs) 

Wait, but if we need to process each object, maybe we need to loop through them. 

Alternatively, the code can loop through each object, and in each iteration, increment the count. 

Wait, perhaps the parameters determine whether the checks are done. So, when validate_objects is True, we do the validation, but when it's False, we don't. 

In that case, the num_objects would be the total number of objects that were checked (i.e., the ones we loop through, but only if we are doing the checks). Or maybe the num_objects is the total number of objects in the hierarchy, and the good_objects is the number that passed the checks. 

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let's think of the default case. 

When both parameters are True, the function checks each object's validity and their digests. 

The 'num_objects' would be the total number of objects in the hierarchy. 

The 'good_objects' is the number that passed both checks. 

But if validate_objects is False, then the function doesn't check the objects, so the 'good_objects' would be the total (since they weren't validated, so we assume they are okay?), but that might not be the case. 

Alternatively, maybe when validate_objects is False, the function skips the object validation, but still checks the digests if check_digests is True. 

Wait, the parameters are separate. So 'validate_objects' controls whether to validate each object, and 'check_digests' controls whether to check their digests. 

Wait, maybe the check_digests is part of the object's validation. Like, the validate() method might include digest checks. But the parameter allows turning it off. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function first checks whether to validate the objects, and if so, then for each, it does their validation. Then, if check_digests is True, it also does a digest check on each object. 

Wait, perhaps the hierarchy has a root, and each node has children. So to traverse the hierarchy, maybe a recursive approach is needed. 

But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the code can assume that all objects are stored in a list. 

Let me proceed with the code structure. 

The function will loop through each object in the hierarchy. 

Initialize num_objects and good_objects to 0. 

Then, for each obj in the hierarchy (like, in a list or via some traversal method):

num_objects +=1 

then, if validate_objects is True, run the checks. 

First, check if the object is valid (maybe via obj.validate() method). 

Then, if check_digests is also True, do another check. 

Wait, perhaps the order is important. Like, first check if the object is valid, then check the digest. 

So:

valid = True 

if validate_objects:

    valid = obj.validate() 

if check_digests and valid:

    valid = obj.check_digest() 

Then, if valid is still True after those checks, increment good_objects. 

Wait, but that would require that both checks are run only if their respective parameters are True. 

Wait, maybe the digest check is part of the object validation, but can be turned off via the parameter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the check_digests is a separate step that's only done if that parameter is True. 

So in the code:

for obj in self.objects:  # assuming self has a list called objects

    num_objects += 1

    is_valid = True

    if validate_objects:

        is_valid = obj.validate() 

    if check_digests and is_valid:

        is_valid = obj.check_digest() 

    if is_valid:

        good_objects +=1 

    else:

        if show_warnings:

            print("Warning: ...")

Wait, but that way, if check_digests is True but validate_objects is False, then the code would first skip the validate_objects check, then proceed to check the digest. 

Hmm, but maybe the digest check requires the object to be valid first. 

Alternatively, perhaps check_digests is only meaningful if validate_objects is True. 

The parameters are separate, so the code should handle them as independent. 

Alternatively, the digest check is a separate check, so even if the object is valid (as per its own validation), but the digest is invalid, then it's considered invalid. 

So the code structure would be as above. 

The function returns the two counts. 

Now, possible edge cases: if validate_objects is False, then the first check (obj.validate()) isn't run. So in that case, the digest check would only run if check_digests is True and the object was considered valid (but since validate_objects is off, maybe the initial is_valid is True? Wait in the code above, if validate_objects is False, then the is_valid remains True (initialized to True). 

Wait, in my previous code, when validate_objects is False, then the first 'if validate_objects' block is skipped, so is_valid remains True. Then, the digest check would be done if check_digests is True and is_valid (which is still True). 

So in that case, if validate_objects is False but check_digests is True, then it would check the digest. But that might not be intended. 

Hmm, perhaps the parameters are such that check_digests can only be done if validate_objects is also done. Or maybe the parameters are separate, and the user can choose to check only digests. 

The problem's function signature allows both parameters to be set independently. 

So, maybe the code should first check if validate_objects is True, then do the object validation. 

Then, regardless of that, if check_digests is True, do the digest check. 

Wait, but that might not be the case. Let's think again. 

The function's parameters are:

- validate_objects: if True, validate each object. 

- check_digests: if True, check the digests. 

- show_warnings: if True, output warnings when an object is invalid. 

The function's return counts the objects that were checked (so, those for which any of the checks were run?), or the total number of objects in the hierarchy? 

The docstring says "number of objects checked" which probably refers to the total in the hierarchy, since you can't check a subset. 

Alternatively, maybe "checked" means that the validation was performed. 

Wait, the wording is "number of objects checked that were found to be valid". So, the 'checked' ones are those that went through the validation steps. 

Thus, if validate_objects is False, then the code doesn't perform validation, so the 'checked' count is zero. 

But that would mean that num_objects is zero, which might not make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps 'num_objects' is the total number of objects in the hierarchy, and 'good_objects' is how many passed the checks (but only if the checks were enabled). 

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to proceed with the code as I thought before, assuming that the parameters control whether to perform the checks. 

The code would:

Initialize num and good to 0. 

Iterate over all objects (maybe via a method like traverse_hierarchy() or similar). 

For each object:

num +=1 

then, if validate_objects is True, run the object's validation. 

then, if check_digests is True, run the digest check. 

Wait, but how to combine the two checks? 

Maybe the logic is: 

if validate_objects:

    valid = obj.validate() 

else:

    valid = True 

then, if check_digests is True:

    digest_valid = obj.check_digest() 

    valid = valid and digest_valid 

then, if valid, increment good. 

But that's a possible approach. 

Alternatively, the digest check is part of the object validation, so when check_digests is True, the validation includes that step. 

Hmm, perhaps the object's validate() method can take a parameter to check the digest. 

Alternatively, the code has separate steps. 

Wait, perhaps the code should first check if validate_objects is True, then perform the object validation. Then, if check_digests is also True, perform the digest check. 

So, the code would be:

valid = True 

if validate_objects:

    valid = obj.validate() 

if check_digests and validate_objects:

    # maybe need to check the digest only if the object is valid so far 

    valid = valid and obj.check_digest() 

Wait, but that's assuming that check_digests is only relevant when validate_objects is on. 

Alternatively, the parameters are separate, so even if validate_objects is off, you can check digests. 

Hmm, but that might not make sense. Maybe the digest is part of the object's data, so you can check it even if you don't validate the object. 

Alternatively, perhaps the digest check is a separate hierarchy check. 

But given the problem's lack of specifics, I'll proceed with the initial approach. 

So, the code would loop through each object, increment num_objects. 

Then, if validate_objects is True, run the object's validation. 

If check_digests is also True, run that check. 

Wait, the code structure I had earlier would do that. Let me write it again:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self.get_objects_in_hierarchy():  # some method to get all objects
        num_objects += 1
        valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            valid = obj.validate()
        if check_digests and valid:
            valid = obj.check_digest()
        if valid:
            good_objects += 1
        else:
            if show_warnings:
                print(f"Warning: {obj} failed validation.")
    return num_objects, good_objects

Wait, but in this case, if validate_objects is False, then valid stays as True. So the digest check would be done only if check_digests is True and the object is valid (which it is, because validate_objects is off). 

Wait, that might be an issue. Suppose the user sets validate_objects=False but check_digests=True. Then, the code would check the digest, but not the object's own validation. 

But the problem's parameters are separate, so maybe that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe the digest check is part of the object's validation when check_digests is True. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'check_digests' is a separate parameter that, when True, requires checking the digest of each object. 

In any case, the code as above would work under the assumption that the digest check is only done if the object is valid (so first validate_objects, then digest). 

But maybe the order is not important. 

Alternatively, the digest check is done regardless of the object's validity. 

Hmm, perhaps the code should first check if the object is valid (via validate_objects), and then check the digest (if check_digests is true). 

Wait, in the code above, if validate_objects is True, then the first step is to check obj.validate(). If that returns true, then proceed to check the digest. But if the digest check is also required, then only if both are true, the object is counted as good. 

If validate_objects is off, then the first part is skipped, so valid remains True. Then, the digest check would only be done if check_digests is true, and the digest is valid. 

But then, in that scenario, when validate_objects is False but check_digests is True, the code would check the digest and count based on that. 

Is that the intended behavior? The problem's description doesn't say, but given that the parameters are independent, perhaps it is. 

Alternatively, maybe the digest check is only done when validate_objects is True. 

In that case, the code would have:

if validate_objects:

    valid = obj.validate() 

    if check_digests:

        valid = valid and obj.check_digest() 

    ... 

But the parameters allow check_digests to be True even if validate_objects is False. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that the digest check is part of the object's validation. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'check_digests' is a parameter that, when True, checks the digest of each object, but only if the object is present (so validate_objects must be done first). 

Well, given the information, I think the code I wrote earlier is a reasonable approach. 

Now, the function must return the two counts. 

What about the 'show_warnings' parameter? It's a boolean. So, if an object is invalid (after all the checks), then if show_warnings is True, we output a warning. 

In the code, after determining that valid is False, we check if show_warnings is True and then print a message. 

The exact method for printing could be a simple print statement, but in a class method, maybe it should use logging. But the problem's example uses print, so I'll go with that. 

Now, the code's structure. The method is part of a class, so it has to access the objects somehow. 

Assuming that there's a method called get_objects_in_hierarchy() that yields each object in the hierarchy. 

Alternatively, perhaps the hierarchy is stored in a list, like self.objects. 

But since the function is called 'validate_hierarchy', maybe it needs to traverse a tree-like structure. 

Alternatively, the code could have a for loop that goes through all the objects in the hierarchy. 

Since the problem doesn't specify the internal structure, I'll make the code as generic as possible. 

Another thing: the function's return is two values. So the code must return them as a tuple. 

Wait, the docstring says the returns are num_objects and good_objects. So the function should return those two variables. 

Putting it all together, the code would look something like:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self._get_all_objects():  # assuming a helper method
        num_objects += 1
        valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            valid = obj.validate()
        if check_digests and valid:
            valid = obj.check_digest()
        if valid:
            good_objects += 1
        else:
            if show_warnings:
                print(f"Warning: Object {obj} is invalid.")
    return num_objects, good_objects

Wait, but in the first case, when validate_objects is True, we run the validation. 

Then, if check_digests is True and the object is still valid (after the first check), we run the digest check. 

So, the object is considered valid only if both steps are passed. 

If either step is skipped (because the parameter is False), then that step isn't part of the validation. 

So, for example, if check_digests is False, but validate_objects is True, then only the object's validation is considered. 

The digest check is only done if both validate_objects is True (so that the first check passes) and check_digests is also True. 

Wait, but the code uses 'if check_digests and valid', so if the first check (validate_objects) passed, then do the digest check. 

But what if validate_objects is off, but check_digests is on? 

In that case, valid would have been set to True (since validate_objects is False skips that part), so the code would do the digest check. 

But then, the 'valid' variable is computed as follows: 

valid starts as True. 

If validate_objects is True, then valid is set to the result of obj.validate(). 

Then, if check_digests is True and valid is still True (from previous steps), then we do the digest check. 

So in the case where validate_objects is False, the code proceeds to the digest check only if check_digests is True. 

But maybe that's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the digest check requires the object to be valid first, so it's only done when validate_objects is True. 

But since the parameters are independent, perhaps the user can choose to skip object validation and just check digests. 

Well, perhaps that's possible. 

The code structure seems okay. 

Now, what about the helper method? Since the function is part of a class, maybe the class has a method like _get_all_objects() that returns an iterable of all objects in the hierarchy. 

Alternatively, maybe the objects are stored in a list called self.objects. 

In the code, I can use a placeholder for that. 

Assuming the helper method is named _get_all_objects(), which is a private method of the class, then the code would loop through that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that directly accesses the objects. 

The code as written is a possible solution. 

Another thing to consider: the 'show_warnings' is a flag to decide whether to print warnings. 

In the else clause, after determining valid is False, we check if show_warnings is True, and if so, print a warning. 

The print statement would need to include some identifier of the object, perhaps its name or id. 

The example in the print uses f"Warning: Object {obj} is invalid." which assumes that obj can be stringified, or that __str__ or __repr__ is defined. 

Alternatively, maybe the object has a 'name' attribute. 

But without knowing the object's structure, the code can just use the obj's string representation. 

Now, the code must be written in a way that uses these parameters. 

So the code is as above. 

Wait, but the parameters have defaults. So when called with default parameters, it will validate objects and check digests, and not show warnings. 

Yes. 

Now, possible errors: maybe the helper method isn't named correctly. But since the problem doesn't specify, it's okay to use a placeholder. 

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a different approach to get the objects. 

Alternatively, maybe the hierarchy is stored in a way that requires recursive traversal, but the code would need to handle that. 

But without more info, the code can assume that there's a way to get all objects. 

Thus, the code seems okay. 

I think that's the best approach given the constraints. Now, I need to write the code exactly as per the problem's instructions. 

The function must be part of a class, so I'll need to define it within a class. But the problem didn't mention the class name. 

Wait, the problem says "You are a Python software engineer. Generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". The function is a method, so it's part of a class. 

But the code needs to be just the method. 

Wait, the user's instruction says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. /think"

Wait, the output should be the code in markdown format? Or just the code? 

Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So probably, the code should be enclosed in triple backticks, but the problem's example might have used a different approach. 

Wait, looking at the example in the problem's initial prompt: 

The user provided a function signature and docstring, and the assistant is to generate the code. 

The assistant's answer should be the code, formatted as Python code. Since the user mentioned "python markdown format", perhaps they mean putting the code inside a code block with ```python ... ```.

But the problem says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I should present the code as a code block. 

But since the function is a method, it has to be part of a class. 

Wait, perhaps the code is just the method, but the class isn't specified. 

Hmm, but the method is part of a class, so the code must be inside a class. 

Wait, the problem didn't specify the class, so perhaps the method is standalone? But no, since it uses 'self', it must be part of a class. 

So, the code must include the class. But the problem didn't give a class name. 

Hmm, this is a problem. Without knowing the class, I can't write the full code. 

Wait, perhaps the code is to be written as a standalone function, but the function has 'self' as the first parameter. So maybe the class is part of the code, but the user didn't specify the class name. 

In that case, I can create a dummy class, like a class named StorageHierarchy or something. 

Alternatively, the user expects just the method code, but in that case, the code would have a syntax error since it's part of a class. 

Hmm, the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". So the code must include the method with that signature. 

Therefore, I can write a class with that method, even if the class is otherwise empty. 

Let me do that. 

So, the code would start with a class definition, then the method inside. 

Like:

class SomeClass:
    def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
        """
        Validate storage root hierarchy.

        Returns:
            num_objects - number of objects checked
            good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
        """
        num_objects = 0
        good_objects = 0
        for obj in self.get_objects():
            num_objects += 1
            valid = True
            if validate_objects:
                valid = obj.validate()
            if check_digests and valid:
                valid = obj.check_digest()
            if valid:
                good_objects += 1
            else:
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: {obj} failed validation.")
        return num_objects, good_objects

Wait, but 'get_objects()' is a method that's not defined here. The class would need that method. But since the problem doesn't specify the class structure, perhaps I can just use a placeholder. 

Alternatively, maybe the code can assume that self has an attribute like 'objects' which is a list. 

Then, the loop would be for obj in self.objects:

So maybe:

class StorageHierarchy:
    def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
        """
        Validate storage root hierarchy.

        Returns:
            num_objects - number of objects checked
            good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
        """
        num_objects = 0
        good_objects = 0
        for obj in self.objects:  # assuming self.objects is a list of objects
            num_objects += 1
            valid = True
            if validate_objects:
                valid = obj.validate()
            if check_digests and valid:
                valid = obj.check_digest()
            if valid:
                good_objects +=1
            else:
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} is invalid.")
        return num_objects, good_objects

This way, the code is part of a class. The class would need to have a 'objects' list or similar. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should have a helper method like _get_objects(), but without more info, using self.objects is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the hierarchy is stored in a different way, but the code must be written as per the given function. 

Thus, the code above should be acceptable. 

Wait, but in the loop, when check_digests is True and validate_objects is True, the code first runs validate, then if valid, runs check_digest. 

That way, the digest is only checked if the object is valid. 

If the user wants to check digests regardless, then the code might be different. But given the parameters, this seems okay. 

Another possible point: the digest check could be part of the object's own validation. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'check_digests' parameter is redundant if the object's validate method already checks the digest. But the parameters are separate, so perhaps the digest is an optional part of the validation. 

The code as written handles both parameters. 

So this should be the correct approach. 

Now, I need to make sure that the code only includes the method and the class, without any explanation. 

Wait, the problem says "do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting". So the code must be written as is. 

Also, the code must be in Python markdown format, which I think means putting it inside a code block. 

So the final code would be enclosed in triple backticks with 'python' specified. 

But the user's example shows that the code is written without the class, but the function has 'self', so it must be in a class. 

Therefore, the code must be part of a class. 

I can choose a class name like 'Storage' or 'HierarchyValidator', but since it's not specified, I'll just use a generic class name like 'StorageHierarchy'. 

The code would then be:

```python
class StorageHierarchy:
    def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
        """
        Validate storage root hierarchy.

        Returns:
            num_objects - number of objects checked
            good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
        """
        num_objects = 0
        good_objects = 0
        for obj in self.objects:
            num_objects += 1
            valid = True
            if validate_objects:
                valid = obj.validate()
            if check_digests and valid:
                valid = obj.check_digest()
            if valid:
                good_objects += 1
            else:
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: {obj} failed validation.")
        return num_objects, good_objects
```

Wait, but in this code, the class 'StorageHierarchy' needs to have an 'objects' attribute. If that's not present, the code would fail. 

But since the problem doesn't specify the class's other methods or attributes, perhaps this is acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a method to get the objects. 

But without knowing the actual structure, the code is as good as can be. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'objects' is a list that the class has. 

Another possible approach is to have the method traverse the hierarchy starting from a root node. 

But again, without specifics, it's hard to know. 

The code I wrote is a possible solution. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should use a generator or recursion to traverse the hierarchy. 

But the problem's function is called 'validate_hierarchy', so perhaps the class has a root, and the method goes through all descendants. 

But without knowing, perhaps the code can assume that self.objects is a list of all objects in the hierarchy. 

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a helper function. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that has a method 'get_all_objects()' which returns a list. 

So perhaps:

def get_all_objects(self):
    # some code to traverse the hierarchy and return all objects 

Then in the loop: 

for obj in self.get_all_objects():

But since that method isn't provided in the problem, I can use a placeholder. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class where 'objects' is a list. 

In any case, the code I have is a valid example. 

Wait, in the code I have, the 'objects' is a list stored in the class. 

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a different way. 

But given the problem's constraints, I think the code as written is okay. 

Another thing to consider: the 'validate_objects' and 'check_digests' are both True by default. 

Thus, when both are True, the code does both checks. 

When validate_objects is False, then the code skips the first check, so the valid is True, and then proceeds to check the digest only if check_digests is True. 

So, for example, if validate_objects is False, but check_digests is True, the digest is checked, and the validity is based on that. 

But that's a possible design. 

Alternatively, if the user wants to disable the digest check, they can set check_digests=False. 

Yes, that makes sense. 

The code also returns the two variables as a tuple. 

The print statement uses f-strings, which is okay. 

Now, I think that's the correct code. 

Wait, but the function's return is written in the docstring as 'num_objects' and 'good_objects' on separate lines. The actual return is a tuple. 

The docstring uses Google-style formatting, so the Returns section lists the variables. 

The code correctly returns a tuple of two integers. 

So this should be acceptable. 

Therefore, I'll present this code in the required format.
