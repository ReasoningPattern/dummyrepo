Okay, so I need to write the Python function get_nested_custom_and_control_args based on the provided docstring. Let's see. The function is supposed to split the input arguments into control, nested, and custom categories. The return type is two dictionaries: control_args and nested_args. Wait, the doc mentions three categories but the return is two dicts. Oh right, maybe custom is part of nested? Or perhaps the custom arguments are a separate category but the return combines them with nested? Hmm, the description says custom arguments are variables to be used instead of normal nested usage. So maybe they are part of the nested args but treated differently?

The docstring says: Control arguments will not be in the spec yml, nested will be included. Custom are variables to be used instead of normal nested. So perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested arguments but are passed as-is, while the regular nested args are structured in some way. But the function returns two dicts: control and nested. So maybe the custom args are merged into the nested args? Or perhaps the custom args are a separate subset?

Wait, the return is (control_args, nested_args). The custom args probably go into nested_args but are handled differently. The problem is to split the input args into these two groups. How do I determine which arguments are control, nested, or custom?

The parameters are "args", which is a collected list. Wait, the function's parameter is called args, but the doc says it's a list. So maybe the input is a list of arguments? Or perhaps a dictionary? The function is supposed to return two flat dicts. The parameter's description says "the collected list of args." Hmm, maybe the args are a dictionary where each key is an argument name, and the value is some info? Or perhaps it's a list of strings, like command-line arguments, and I need to parse them into these categories?

Wait the return is two dicts, so probably the input args is a dictionary. Let me check the parameters again. The doc says "param args: the collected list of args." Wait, "list" might mean a list of key-value pairs, or maybe a list of argument names? That's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the args are a dictionary, and the function is supposed to split that into control and nested/custom parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that has some predefined way to categorize arguments. Like, the class might have attributes that define which arguments are control, nested, or custom. But the problem here is that the function's parameters are given as "args", so the function's responsibility is to process that input.

Looking at the docstring's return, it says flat dicts. So maybe the input is a nested structure, and the function has to flatten them into nested_args and separate control_args. Or perhaps the input is a list of arguments, and the function has to parse each argument into the correct category based on some naming convention or rules.

Wait the function's name is get_nested_custom_and_control_args. The splitting is into control, nested, and custom. But the return is two dicts. Maybe custom and nested are combined into one dict, with custom taking precedence? Or maybe custom is a subset of nested? The doc says that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage, so perhaps they are part of the nested args but are treated specially. However, the return is control and nested. So perhaps the custom args are part of the nested args, but the function just needs to separate control from the rest, which are nested, and within nested, some are custom. But the return is two dicts, so maybe the custom args are stored in a separate dictionary, but the function combines them into the nested_args?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into three groups, but returns only two: control and the rest (nested + custom), but the custom ones are marked somehow. Or perhaps the custom args are a separate part of the nested args, like they are added to the nested structure. But the problem is the function returns two dicts: control and nested. So maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested args, but the function just needs to separate the control ones.

Wait the problem says "Split input arguments to control nested and custom." So three categories. But the return is two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are a subset of the nested ones. The control args are separate. So perhaps the function is to split the args into control (which are excluded from spec) and nested (which include custom and go into spec), but the custom ones are just part of the nested. Or perhaps the custom are separate and the function returns control and nested, where nested is a combination of regular nested and custom arguments. But the return is two, so maybe the custom are part of the nested. The function's name includes both nested and custom, but the return is two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are stored in the nested_args, but with some processing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function takes the args (a dictionary) and splits them into control and nested, with custom being a part of nested. So the code would loop through each key in the args, check if it's a control argument, then the rest go into nested. But how to determine which is which?

The problem might be expecting me to assume that the control arguments have certain prefixes or are known keys. Since the user hasn't provided any specific rules, I have to infer from the docstring. The doc says control args are those that control the IR behavior and won't be in the spec. Nested are used by playbooks and go into the spec. Custom are variables used instead of normal nested usage. Maybe custom arguments are those that start with a certain prefix, like 'custom_' or something. The function might check for such prefixes to categorize them as custom, but they still go into the nested args. The control args are those that don't go into spec, so they are separated.

Alternatively, perhaps the function uses some attributes of the class to determine which arguments are control. Since it's a method, maybe the class has a list or set of control arguments. But without knowing that, perhaps the function is supposed to split based on the argument names. For example, any argument whose name starts with 'control_' goes into control_args, and others into nested. Or maybe the custom ones are those with a 'custom_' prefix, and nested are the rest except control. But the problem doesn't specify that. Since the user hasn't given any specifics, maybe the function is supposed to assume that control arguments are those that are in a predefined list, and the rest are nested, with custom being a part of nested. But how to code that without knowing the exact criteria?

Hmm, perhaps the function is expecting to split the arguments into control and the rest, which are nested. The custom args are a subset of the nested ones. But the problem states that the return is two dicts. So maybe the function returns control and nested, where nested includes both the regular nested and custom arguments. The custom ones are just variables that the user can set to override the normal nested parameters. So the code would need to separate the control arguments from the rest, which go into nested. But how to determine control args?

Wait, maybe the function uses some naming convention. For example, control arguments have names starting with '_' or some specific prefix. Or perhaps the control arguments are those that are not intended for the playbook. Since the docstring is a bit vague, perhaps the approach is to split the args into control and nested, and custom is part of the nested. But how exactly?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args (a list?) and process them into two dictionaries. But since the return is two dicts, I think the input is a dictionary. Let's assume that the args is a dictionary. The function needs to separate control and nested. Custom args might be a part of the nested, but perhaps the user can specify which ones are custom by using a certain prefix or suffix.

Wait the problem might require that the custom args are those that are explicitly marked as such. For example, if an argument has a key like 'custom_foo', then it's a custom variable. The nested args are the regular ones that go into the spec, but custom ones are also part of the nested args. But the control args are separate. So the code would loop through all keys in the args, check if they start with 'control_', then those go into control. The remaining go into nested. The custom ones are part of the nested, perhaps with their names stripped of the prefix. Or maybe they are kept as-is in nested.

Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are those that are not part of the standard nested parameters. But without knowing the exact criteria, this is tricky. The problem might be expecting a simple separation where control arguments are those that match a certain list, and the rest are nested. Since the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps the code should separate based on the presence of a prefix like 'control_' for control args, and other args (including custom) are in nested. But the doc says custom are variables used instead of normal nested, so maybe they are part of the nested but can override them. But the code just needs to split into control and the rest as nested, regardless of custom vs regular.

Alternatively, maybe the function takes a list of arguments (like command-line arguments) and parses them into the two dicts. But that would require parsing strings like '--key=value' into key-value pairs. But the parameter is called args, which is collected, so perhaps it's already a dictionary. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, the code would need to iterate through each key in the args dictionary. For each key, decide whether it's a control argument or not. The control arguments are those that are meant to control the IR (like maybe parameters for the workflow engine, not the playbook). The rest go into nested. But how to decide that?

Since the problem doesn't specify any criteria, perhaps the function is expecting to split based on some predefined set of control parameters. For example, the class might have a list called control_args_list, and any key in that list is considered a control argument. The code would then check if the key is in that list, and split accordingly.

But since the user hasn't given any specific information, maybe the function is supposed to split based on the presence of a certain prefix. Let's think that control arguments are those that start with 'control_', and the rest are nested. Or maybe 'custom_' are part of the nested. But the problem says custom are to be used instead of normal nested usage, so perhaps they are part of the nested but can override the default values. But the code doesn't have to do that processing, just separate the categories.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate the control arguments (like parameters that start with underscores or certain keywords), but without knowing, perhaps the code is supposed to have a default way. Since the problem is a bit ambiguous, maybe I can proceed with a generic approach where control arguments are those that are in a specific list, and the rest are nested. But since I can't know the list, perhaps the function uses the presence of a certain keyword in the argument name.

Wait the problem says "split input arguments to control nested and custom". So perhaps there are three categories, but the return combines nested and custom into one dict. So maybe the function's return is control and nested, where nested includes both the regular nested and custom arguments. The custom ones are a part of the nested args but are handled differently in the spec. But the code just needs to separate control from the rest, which all go into nested. Alternatively, maybe the custom are separate, but the function only returns two dicts, so perhaps the custom are part of the nested.

Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are those that are not part of the standard nested parameters and are added as extra variables. So the function would collect all arguments except control into nested, and custom is part of that. But the code doesn't have to distinguish between nested and custom in the return, just separate control from the rest.

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and the rest, which are nested, and the custom ones are part of the nested but are named in a way that they can override. But the code doesn't have to process that. Since the return is two dicts, control and nested, the code would just need to separate the control arguments from the others. The custom ones are just part of the nested, so their keys are included in nested.

So, the code would be something like:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But wait, the doc mentions "custom ansible variables" as a separate category. So perhaps the custom arguments are those that start with 'custom_' or some other prefix. Then, the code would need to split into control, custom, and nested. But the return is two dicts. Maybe the custom are part of the nested, so their keys are added to nested but with some processing. For example, stripping the 'custom_' prefix?

Alternatively, maybe the function treats custom arguments as part of the nested, so the code just separates control from the rest, which are all nested (including custom). So the above code would work if control_ is the prefix for control args.

Alternatively, perhaps the control arguments are a predefined list. Since the function is part of a class, maybe the class has an attribute like control_params that lists the control argument names. Then, the code would check if the key is in self.control_params. But without that info, I can't code that. So maybe the example code uses the prefix approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split based on the presence of certain keywords. Let me think again. The doc says controls are for IR behavior and not in spec. Nested are for playbooks and go into spec. Custom are variables to be used instead of the normal nested. So perhaps the custom args are those that the user explicitly wants to set as variables, so they are part of the nested but with some flag.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control and nested, where the custom arguments are a part of the nested, but the function doesn't have to do anything else. So the code is straightforward: iterate over all keys, separate into control and nested based on some criteria.

Since the problem doesn't specify the criteria, I might need to make an assumption. Let's assume that any argument with a key starting with 'control_' is a control argument, and the rest are nested (including custom). Then the code would be as above. Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are those that start with 'custom_', but in that case, they would be part of the nested as well. The return would still have control and nested, with custom being part of the nested.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to separate control, nested, and custom, but returns control and nested (with custom included in nested). The problem is, without more info, I have to make an educated guess. Since the user's example is expecting code, perhaps the standard approach is to use prefixes like 'control_', 'nested_', and 'custom_', but the control args are those with 'control_', and the rest are nested (including custom). Or perhaps custom is part of the nested but the function just separates control from everything else.

Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are those that are not in a predefined list of nested parameters. But again, without knowing the list, this can't be done. The problem might require a generic split where control arguments are known to the function, and the rest are nested. So perhaps the function's code is as simple as splitting based on key names with a certain prefix.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested, and custom is a part of nested, so the code is as follows. The problem says "custom ansible variables to be used instead of the normal nested usage". So perhaps the nested args are the ones that are structured in a certain way (like nested under a specific key), but the custom ones are variables that are added as top-level variables. But how to code that?

Alternatively, maybe the function takes the args (a list) and processes them into two dictionaries, but the exact logic isn't given. Since the user hasn't provided specifics, perhaps the code should use a dummy implementation that splits based on some arbitrary criteria. For instance, if the key starts with 'control_', it's control. All others are in nested. The custom part is part of the nested, so the function doesn't need to handle them separately except that they are part of the nested args.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and the rest (nested), and the custom arguments are a subset of the nested. But the code doesn't have to do anything else except separate control from the rest. So the code would be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control = {}
    nested = {}
    for k, v in args.items():
        if is_control_arg(k):
            control[k] = v
        else:
            nested[k] = v
    return control, nested

But the problem is that I don't have the is_control_arg function. So maybe the code uses a set of control keys. Let me think that the control arguments are those that are not intended to be in the spec. So the function would have to know which keys are control. Since the function is part of a class, perhaps the class has an attribute like control_args that lists those keys. So the code would be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    control_keys = self.CONTROL_ARGS  # assuming there's a class-level variable
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key in control_keys:
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But without knowing what the actual control keys are, I can't write that. The problem might require that the function just splits the arguments into control and nested, with control being any key that starts with 'control_', and the rest being nested. So I'll proceed with that approach, since it's a common way to categorize such parameters.

Wait the doc says that custom arguments are variables to be used instead of the normal nested usage. So maybe custom arguments are part of the nested but have their own processing. But the function's return is two dicts, so perhaps the custom are included in the nested. So the code would separate control from the rest, which are all nested, including custom.

So the code would be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key in args:
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[key] = args[key]
        else:
            nested_args[key] = args[key]
    return control_args, nested_args

Wait, but the parameters are a list? Wait the parameter says "the collected list of args." Hmm, maybe the args are a list of tuples or a list of strings like ["key=value", ...], but the function needs to parse them into a dictionary first. Wait the return is two dicts, so maybe the input is a dictionary. The problem's wording is a bit unclear. Let me re-read the docstring's parameters.

":param args: the collected list of args."

Hmm, perhaps "list" here is a mistake, and it's actually a dictionary. Because splitting into two dicts from a list would require parsing each element. Alternatively, maybe the args is a list of keys, but that's unlikely. Since the return is two dictionaries, I think the input is a dictionary. So the code can proceed as above.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle nested structures within the args. For example, if the args contain nested dictionaries, but the problem says to return flat dicts, so maybe they need to be flattened. But the doc says "Split input arguments to control nested and custom." So perhaps the input is a dictionary that may have nested structures, and the function needs to flatten them into the two output dictionaries. But how?

Wait the problem says "flat dicts", so the output should be a flat structure. So maybe the function takes a potentially nested dictionary (like from parsing a spec) and splits into control and nested, with nested being flattened. But without more details, this is hard to code.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to separate the arguments into control (those that control IR behavior, like workflow parameters) and the rest (nested and custom) which are for the playbooks. The custom ones are part of the nested. So the code would be as I first thought, using a prefix to identify control args. Let's go with that, since it's the most straightforward approach given the information.

Wait but the function's name mentions both nested and custom, so maybe the custom args are a separate group. For instance, the function returns control and nested, and custom is a part of nested but processed differently. However, the return is two dictionaries, so perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested, but the code doesn't need to do anything special except separate them into the nested dict. The function's name might be indicating that it's handling both nested and custom, but the return combines them.

Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are those that are explicitly named as such, so perhaps they are in the args with a certain prefix, but are included in the nested. The code would just move them into nested. So the code would be as before.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate the arguments into three groups, but the return combines nested and custom into one dict. So the code would first separate control, then the rest are in nested_args, which includes custom. So the code is as simple as the first example.

Alternatively, perhaps the custom arguments are those that are not nested under any structure. For example, if the nested args are supposed to be a flat dict, but some arguments are part of a deeper structure, but the function is to flatten them. Wait the problem says the return is flat dicts, so perhaps the input args are a nested dictionary, and the function needs to flatten them, separating control from the rest.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. The problem's docstring says the function returns two flat dicts. So maybe the input args is a nested structure, and the function has to flatten them, but also split into control and others. But without knowing the structure of the input, I can't write that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of arguments (like a list of strings) and parse them into the two dicts. For example, each argument is a string like "--key=value", and we split them into control and nested based on the key's name.

In that case, the code would first parse the args list into a dictionary, then split into control and nested. But the parameter is called args, and the return is two dicts, so maybe the input is a dictionary.

Assuming the input is a dictionary, then the code would loop through each key-value pair and decide which category they belong to. Since the problem doesn't specify the criteria, perhaps the control arguments are those that start with a certain prefix like 'control_', and the rest are nested (including custom ones). So the code would be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

Alternatively, maybe the control arguments are specified in a list, like the class has an attribute. Let me think that maybe the function uses some attributes like self.CONTROL_ARGS which is a list of keys that are considered control. Then, the code would be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control = {k: v for k, v in args.items() if k in self.CONTROL_ARGS}
    nested = {k: v for k, v in args.items() if k not in self.CONTROL_ARGS}
    return control, nested

But this requires that the class has a list of control arguments. Since the problem doesn't mention that, perhaps the first approach with the 'control_' prefix is better.

Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are those that start with 'custom_', and they are part of the nested, so the code would include them in the nested dict. So the code remains the same as the first example, where control_ keys are moved to control, others to nested.

Alternatively, perhaps the function has to split the args into three parts but return two, perhaps combining custom and nested. But the problem states that the return is two dicts. So the custom is part of the nested.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the first approach: control arguments are those whose keys start with 'control_', and the rest are nested. So the code would look like that. Let me check the docstring again. The return is (control_args, nested_args). The custom args are mentioned as a third category but the return doesn't have them. So maybe the custom are part of the nested, so they go into the nested dict. The function's job is to separate control from the rest, and the rest (including custom) are nested. So the code would be as I wrote.

Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are those that are not in a predefined list of nested parameters. But without that list, it's impossible. So I think the best approach is to use a prefix-based check, assuming that control arguments have a 'control_' prefix, and others are nested. That's a common pattern in such scenarios.

Another thought: maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and the rest (which are nested), but the custom arguments are those that are explicitly marked as such, perhaps via a different method. But since the problem requires only code based on the given signature and docstring, and no other info, perhaps the code is as simple as that.

Wait the function is called get_nested_custom_and_control_args. The name suggests that it returns both nested and custom, but the return is two dicts. So maybe the first is control, the second is nested, and custom are part of the nested. Or perhaps the function is supposed to separate control and then split the remaining into nested and custom, but the return combines them into nested_args. So the code would have to have a way to separate custom from nested. But again, without criteria, perhaps the code uses a prefix for control, and another for custom, but the custom are included in the nested. For example:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control = {}
    nested = {}
    custom = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control[key] = value
        elif key.startswith('custom_'):
            custom[key] = value
            nested.update(custom)  # but then they are part of nested
        else:
            nested[key] = value
    return control, nested

Wait but that's adding custom into nested. So the custom would be part of the nested. But the function's return is control and nested. So that's possible. But the code would have to decide between custom and nested. Or maybe the custom are a separate category but the function returns them in the nested. Or perhaps the code is supposed to treat custom as separate but they are part of the nested.

Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are those that are not nested (so they are top-level variables in the playbook) and the nested are structured under some keys. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to code.

Hmm, perhaps the function just separates control arguments (those starting with 'control_') into control_args, and the rest (including custom) go into nested_args. The doc's explanation about custom is just additional info, but the code doesn't have to handle them differently. So the code would be as first written.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control and nested, and custom is a separate parameter but not returned. But the problem's return is two dicts. So perhaps the custom are part of the nested. The function's code would just split into control and the rest. Let me go with that approach.

Another possible way is that the custom arguments are passed as part of the nested structure but with a different naming convention. But again, without specifics, I can't code that.

In conclusion, given the information, the best approach is to use a simple prefix check for control arguments, and the rest go into nested. The custom are part of the nested, perhaps with their own prefixes, but the function doesn't need to separate them further. So the code would look like the first example. Let me write that.
