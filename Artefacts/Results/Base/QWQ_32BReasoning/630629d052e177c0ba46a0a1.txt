Okay, I need to generate Python code for the verify_relayable_signature function. Let's see, the function takes a public key, a document (doc), and a signature. The goal is to verify that the signature is valid for the given document using the public key. 

Hmm, I remember that XML signatures usually involve checking the cryptographic signature against the document. So maybe I should use a library that can handle XML signature verification. The xmlsig library comes to mind, which is part of the lxml package. Oh right, but first I need to make sure the dependencies are installed. Wait, the user didn't mention anything about that, so maybe I'll just proceed with the code assuming the library is available.

The function's docstring says to verify the signed XML elements to ensure the claimed author generated the message. So I need to parse the XML document, find the signature node, and then verify it using the public key. 

Let me outline the steps. First, parse the XML doc. Then, locate the Signature element. Using the public key, which is probably in a specific format like PEM, I need to load it into the library's key structure. Then, use the verify method from xmlsig. 

Wait, the public key might be in a string, so I should create a temporary file or use a memory file object to hold it. Or maybe the xmlsig library can handle it directly. Oh right, maybe the public key is part of the XML document itself, but the function's parameters separate them, so probably the public key is provided externally. 

Wait, the function's parameters are public_key, doc, and signature. So the signature is a separate parameter. That complicates things because usually the signature is embedded in the XML. Or maybe the signature is the XML's signature node? Not sure. Let me think again. The function's name suggests that the signature is a separate value. Maybe the signature is the actual cryptographic signature string, and the doc is the XML document. But how do we split that?

Alternatively, perhaps the doc is the XML with the signature included, and the signature parameter refers to the specific signature element within it. Like, maybe the signature is a node in the XML tree. But the function's parameters are separate, so maybe the doc is the XML data without the signature, and the signature is the part that's signed. Hmm, maybe I need to extract the signature from the doc and then verify against the public key. 

Wait, maybe the signature is the entire XML signature block, and the doc is the original document that was signed. So the process would be to parse the XML, find the Signature element, then check if the signature is valid using the public key. 

Alternatively, perhaps the public key is used to validate the signature over the doc. So the steps would be:

1. Parse the XML document (doc) to get an ElementTree or similar structure.
2. Find the Signature element in the XML.
3. Use the public key to verify the signature. 

But how exactly to do that with the xmlsig library. Let me recall the steps from the lxml documentation. 

First, you need to parse the XML. Then, get the signature node. The signature is usually part of the XML, so perhaps the signature parameter is the actual signature value extracted from the XML. Or maybe the signature is the entire XML element. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the public key, the document (the data that was signed), and the signature (the cryptographic signature string), and verify that the signature matches the document's hash using the public key. 

Wait, that's a different approach. The standard way would be to sign a digest of the document. So the signature is the encrypted digest using the private key, and verification uses the public key to check that the digest of the document matches the decrypted signature. 

So, perhaps the steps are:

- Compute the digest (hash) of the document.
- Use the public key to decrypt the signature, get the original digest.
- Compare the two digests.

But that's a simplistic view. In reality, XML signatures can be more complex because they might sign specific parts of the document, use references, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is using the xmlsec library, which is a Python binding for XML Security. Oh right, the xmlsig module might be part of that. 

Wait, I think the correct approach is to use the xmlsec library. Let me think of how to structure this. 

First, parse the XML document into a tree. Then, get the signature node from the XML. The signature node contains the signed data and references. The verification process would involve checking the signature against the document using the public key. 

Wait, but the public key is given as a parameter here, so maybe the signature is not part of the XML. Or perhaps the XML includes the signature, and the public key is provided separately. 

Alternatively, maybe the public_key is the certificate used to verify the signature, and the doc is the XML data, and the signature is a separate value. Hmm, this is a bit unclear. Let me think of a standard XML signature verification process. 

In XML Digital Signatures, the signature is part of the XML document. The verification process typically involves parsing the XML, locating the signature element, and then using the public key (which might be embedded in the signature or provided separately) to validate it. 

So perhaps the function should do something like:

- Parse the doc as XML.
- Find the Signature element in the XML.
- Use the public_key to verify that signature against the document. 

Alternatively, maybe the signature is a separate string, so the function has to sign the doc using the public key and see if it matches. But that's not how public key crypto works. 

Wait, perhaps the signature is the actual XML signature element, and the public key is used to validate it. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is using a different method, like the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 or similar algorithm. But without more details, I should probably go with the standard XML signature verification approach. 

Let me recall the steps using the xmlsec library. 

First, you need to load the public key. Then, parse the XML document. The signature is a part of the XML. You need to get the signature node from the XML tree, then call the verify function with the signature node and the public key. 

Wait, maybe the code would look like this:

from xmlsig import Document, methods

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    # parse the document
    xml_doc = Document.from_string(doc)
    # get the signature node
    sig_node = xml_doc.get_signature(signature)
    # load the public key
    # create a context with the public key
    # verify the signature
    try:
        xml_doc_ctx = methods.verify(xml_doc, sig_node, public_key)
        return True
    except:
        return False

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact methods here. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the xmlsec module directly. Like:

import xmlsec

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    # parse the XML
    xml_tree = xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring(doc)
    # find the signature element
    signature_element = xml_tree.find('.//ds:Signature', namespaces={'ds': 'http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#'})
    # create a digital signature context
    ctx = xmlsec.SignatureContext()
    # load public key
    key = xmlsec.Key.from_memory(public_key, xmlsec.constants.KeyDataFormatCertPem)
    ctx.key = key
    # verify
    ctx.verify(signature_element)
    return True
except xmlsec.Error as e:
    return False

Wait, but maybe the signature is passed as a separate string? Or perhaps the 'signature' parameter here is the XML element. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'doc' is the XML without the signature, and the signature is a separate part. But that's not standard. 

The function's parameters are public_key, doc, signature. The doc is the XML document, and the signature is the actual cryptographic signature. 

Alternatively, maybe the signature is a string that is the base64 encoded signature value. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's see, the standard approach with XML signatures is that the signature is part of the XML. So perhaps the 'signature' parameter is the XML node that contains the signature. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the XML doc, extract the signature from it, and then verify it with the public key. But in that case, the signature parameter might not be needed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the signature is the value of the SignatureValue element. 

Wait, the function's docstring says "signed XML elements" so maybe the signature is part of the XML. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the public key, the document (the XML with the signature), and the signature is the part to verify. 

Alternatively, maybe the signature is the entire signed XML part, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the public_key is given as a string (like a PEM certificate), the doc is the XML as a string, and the signature is the signed data as a string. 

Hmm, perhaps I should structure the code using the xmlsec library. Let me check the typical way to verify an XML signature with that library. 

Looking up in my mind, here's a typical approach:

Parse the XML document into an ElementTree. Then, find the Signature node. Then, create a SignatureContext, load the public key into it, and then call verify on the Signature node. 

The key would be loaded from a certificate. So if the public_key is in PEM format, perhaps we can do something like:

key = xmlsec.Key.from_memory(public_key, xmlsec.constants.KeyDataFormatCertPem)

But I need to make sure that the key is correctly loaded. 

So putting it all together, the code might look like this:

import xmlsec
from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    # Parse the XML document
    tree = ET.fromstring(doc)
    # Find the Signature element
    signature_node = tree.find('.//{%s}Signature' % xmlsec.NS_DS)
    # Create a signature context
    ctx = xmlsec.SignatureContext()
    # Load the public key
    key = xmlsec.Key.from_memory(public_key, xmlsec.constants.KeyDataFormatCertPem)
    ctx.key = key
    # Verify the signature
    try:
        ctx.verify(signature_node)
        return True
    except xmlsec.Error:
        return False

Wait, but in the parameters, the 'signature' is given. Maybe in this case, the signature is the element node, so perhaps the parameters are structured differently. Or maybe the 'signature' is the value to check. 

Alternatively, maybe the signature parameter is the signed data's digest, but that's not likely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'signature' is the actual signature value (the encrypted digest), and the 'doc' is the data that was signed. So the code would need to compute the digest of the doc, then verify that the signature, when decrypted with the public key, matches that digest. 

But that's more of a simple RSA verification, not using the XML structure. 

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the function is called verify_relayable_signature, and the parameters are public_key, doc (the XML document), and signature (maybe the signature element). 

Alternatively, perhaps the signature is the entire XML signature element as a string, and the doc is the original document. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the xmldsig library. Let me think. 

Alternatively, perhaps the public key is passed as a certificate, and the doc is the XML, and the signature is part of that XML. 

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to extract the signature from the doc, but the signature parameter is redundant here. That might not be the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the signature is the value of the SignatureValue element. Then, the code would have to parse the XML to get the signed info part, compute the digest, then use the public key to verify. 

But that's more involved. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is the XML that includes the signature, and the 'signature' is the actual value (the bytes) of the signature. 

Hmm, I think the best approach is to use the xmlsec library as I thought before, where the signature is part of the XML document. So the 'signature' parameter might not be needed, but perhaps the function is designed to have the signature as a separate parameter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'signature' is the element tree node for the signature in the XML. 

Wait, perhaps the parameters are structured as public key (string PEM), the document (XML as a string), and the signature (the XML signature element as a string). 

Alternatively, maybe the signature is a separate part, and the code needs to sign the document's digest and compare. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is using the RelayState in some way, but the name is verify_relayable_signature. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the xmlsig module from the signxml library. Let me think of that approach. 

The signxml library has a XMLSigner and XMLVerifier. The XMLVerifier might be used here. 

So code could be something like:

from signxml import XMLVerifier

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    try:
        XMLVerifier().verify(doc, signature=signature, cert=public_key).signed_xml
        return True
    except:
        return False

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact parameters. The XMLVerifier's verify method can take the XML as a string, and the cert parameter is the certificate. The signature might be part of the XML, but perhaps the 'signature' parameter here is the signed data. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is the data that was signed, and the 'signature' is the actual signature value. Then, the public key is used to verify it. 

But in that case, the code would be more like using the RSA module. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is using the cryptography library. Let me think. 

Wait, the function's name and the docstring mention XML elements, so it's likely dealing with XML signatures. 

So, perhaps the correct approach is to use the xmlsec library. 

Let me try to structure the code again. 

First, parse the XML document into an ElementTree. Then find the Signature element. 

Wait, but in the parameters, the signature is given. Maybe the signature is the element's text? Or perhaps the 'signature' parameter is the signature value extracted from the XML. 

Alternatively, maybe the signature is the entire Signature XML element, and the doc is the rest of the document. 

Hmm, this is a bit unclear, but given the parameters, I think the 'doc' is the XML document that was signed, and the 'signature' is the actual cryptographic signature (maybe as a string). 

Alternatively, perhaps the signature is the XML Signature element, and the doc is the XML document that includes it. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is a separate part, and the code needs to construct the XML with the signature, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to use the public key to verify that the signature was generated by the corresponding private key for the given document. 

Assuming that the document is an XML string and the signature is a base64 encoded string, but that's probably not the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the signature is an XML node. 

Wait, maybe the best way is to use the xmlsec library's verify function, which takes the document, the signature node, and the public key. 

Alternatively, here's another approach: 

The code would need to parse the XML document, find the signature node, load the public key into a Key object, then verify the signature. 

So let me try to write this step by step. 

First, import the necessary modules:

import xmlsec
from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET

Then, parse the doc into an ElementTree:

tree = ET.fromstring(doc)

Find the Signature node:

signature_node = tree.find('.//{%s}Signature' % xmlsec.NS_DS)

Wait, maybe the namespace is needed. The default namespace for XML Signature is usually http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#, so perhaps:

ns = {'ds': 'http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#'}
signature_node = tree.find('.//ds:Signature', ns)

But using xmlsec's own NS_DS might be better. 

Then, create a signature context:

ctx = xmlsec.SignatureContext()

Load the public key. 

Assuming that public_key is a PEM certificate. So:

key = xmlsec.Key.from_memory(public_key, xmlsec.constants.KeyDataFormatCertPem)

Then set the context's key:

ctx.key = key

Then call verify on the signature node. 

So putting it all together:

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    tree = ET.fromstring(doc)
    signature_node = tree.find('.//{%s}Signature' % xmlsec.NS_DS)
    ctx = xmlsec.SignatureContext()
    key = xmlsec.Key.from_memory(public_key, xmlsec.constants.KeyDataFormatCertPem)
    ctx.key = key
    try:
        ctx.verify(signature_node)
        return True
    except xmlsec.Error:
        return False

Wait, but what about the signature parameter? In this code, I'm not using the 'signature' parameter. That's a problem. Because the function has three parameters, but here I'm only using two. 

Hmm, maybe the 'signature' parameter is the actual Signature node as an XML element. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'doc' is the data that was signed, and the 'signature' is the cryptographic signature (like a hex string or base64). 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'signature' is the element tree node for the signature, so in that case, the code would be:

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    # parse the document into an ElementTree
    tree = ET.fromstring(doc)
    # check if the signature matches
    # but the signature parameter is perhaps the node to check
    # so maybe signature is already the node. 
    # So the code would use the signature parameter as the node. 

Wait, perhaps the 'signature' parameter is the Signature element node from the XML, so in that case, the code would use it directly. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the value of the SignatureValue element. 

Hmm, I'm getting confused. The function's parameters are public_key, doc (the XML document), and signature. 

Maybe the 'signature' is the value of the SignatureValue element. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'doc' is the unsigned XML, and the 'signature' is the signed one. 

Alternatively, perhaps the signature is the detached signature, so the code would need to read the document and the signature as separate XML elements. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the public key to verify the signature over the doc's bytes. 

Wait, in that case, the code would need to compute the hash of the document, then verify the signature against that hash using the public key. 

But how to do that in Python? 

Let me think of using the cryptography library. 

First, get the public key in PEM format, then load it into an RSA key. 

Then, get the data (doc) as bytes, compute its digest (like SHA256), then verify that the signature (also as bytes) is valid. 

But the signature might be in base64. 

So, steps:

1. Convert the doc to bytes (maybe using doc.encode('utf-8')).
2. Compute the digest (e.g., SHA256).
3. Decode the signature from base64.
4. Verify using the public key: public_key.verify(signature, digest, some padding, etc.)

But the public key would need to be parsed. 

Wait, let's see. The public key is given as a string, probably PEM. 

So using the cryptography module's RSA:

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes, serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding, utils
from cryptography.exceptions import InvalidSignature

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key_str, doc_str, signature_str):
    # Load public key
    public_key = serialization.load_pem_public_key(
        public_key_str.encode(),
    )

    # Compute the digest of the document
    digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
    digest.update(doc_str.encode())
    doc_digest = digest.finalize()

    # Decode the signature from base64
    signature = base64.b64decode(signature_str)

    # Verify the signature
    try:
        public_key.verify(
            signature,
            doc_digest,
            padding.PKCS1v15(),
            utils.PreVerificationError
        )
        return True
    except InvalidSignature:
        return False

Wait, but this would be for a simple RSA signature over the document's digest. However, XML signatures can be more complex, involving canonicalization of the XML, which might be necessary. 

The problem is, the function's name mentions XML elements, so perhaps the XML structure is important. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to use the xmlsec library and process the XML with the signature. 

In that case, maybe the 'signature' parameter is redundant, but perhaps the function is designed so that the signature is a separate XML node. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'doc' is the XML without the signature, and the 'signature' is the detached signature. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the value of the Signature element's SignatureValue node. 

Hmm, perhaps the user expects the code to use the xmlsec library and process the XML document's signature. 

In that case, the 'signature' parameter might be the Signature element's node. 

Wait, the function's parameters are public_key, doc, signature. So the doc is the XML document, and the signature is a separate element. 

Alternatively, maybe the signature is part of the doc, but the function is structured to pass it separately. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'doc' is the XML document that was signed, and the 'signature' is the actual cryptographic signature (like the bytes of the signature). 

But how does that fit with the XML structure? 

Alternatively, maybe the function is using a different approach, like checking the XMLDSig signature. 

Wait, perhaps the correct code is to use the signxml library. Let me see. 

The signxml's XMLVerifier would need the XML with the signature. So the 'doc' should include the signature. 

Wait, the function's parameters are public_key, doc, signature. So maybe the 'doc' is the data, and the 'signature' is the XML signature block. 

Then, the code could be:

from signxml import XMLVerifier

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    try:
        XMLVerifier().verify(signature, cert=public_key).signed_data == doc
        return True
    except:
        return False

But I'm not sure how the XMLVerifier works. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is the signed XML, and the 'signature' is the element. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be using the public key to verify the signature on the document. 

Wait, the signxml's verify function can take the XML, and the certificate. So maybe:

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    try:
        # Assuming the 'signature' is the signed XML, which includes the signature element
        # Wait, perhaps the doc is the signed XML and the signature is the signature value. 
        # Hmm, perhaps better to use the signxml library's verify method. 

        # The public key is the certificate, so:
        # The 'doc' is the XML that contains the signature, so the XMLVerifier can parse it. 
        # The 'signature' parameter is not needed here. Wait, but the function has it. 

        # Maybe the 'signature' is the actual signature value (the bytes), and the 'doc' is the data. 
        # So using the public key to verify that the signature matches the data's digest. 

        # So, first, compute the digest of the doc (as bytes), then verify the signature against it. 

        # The public key is in PEM format. 

        # So code would be:

        from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
        from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
        from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import load_pem_public_key
        import base64

        public_key_obj = load_pem_public_key(public_key.encode())
        data = doc.encode()
        digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
        digest.update(data)
        digest_data = digest.finalize()
        signature_bytes = base64.b64decode(signature)
        try:
            public_key_obj.verify(signature_bytes, digest_data, padding.PKCS1v15(), hashes.SHA256())
            return True
        except:
            return False

Wait, but that would require that the signature is a base64 encoded string of the RSA-signed digest. 

But the function's parameters have 'doc' as the document (probably the data), and the signature as the cryptographic signature. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is the XML document that includes the signature, so the code must parse it and find the signature node. 

Hmm, this is a bit of a confusion. Since the user's function is named verify_relayable_signature, perhaps it's related to SAML or similar protocols where the signature is part of the XML. 

In that case, the correct approach is to use the xmlsec library to verify the entire XML signature. 

So let's try again. 

The function will take the XML document (as a string) and the public key (as a PEM string). The signature parameter might be the Signature element node. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'signature' is the SignatureValue's content. 

Wait, the standard way with XML signatures is that the Signature element contains the SignatureValue, which is the actual signature. 

So, perhaps the code should parse the XML to find the SignatureValue, then extract the digest and verify. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use the xmlsec library's methods to verify the entire signature in the XML document, using the provided public key. 

The problem is that the function's parameters include 'signature', which might be part of the XML or a separate string. 

Hmm, perhaps the 'signature' parameter is the XML signature node. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is the XML document that contains the signature, and the 'signature' is the actual signature value (the bytes). 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the entire signed XML. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'doc' is the data that was signed, and the 'signature' is the cryptographic signature over that data. 

In that case, the code would be using the public key to verify the signature against the document's digest. 

So here's a possible code structure using the cryptography library:

import base64
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import padding
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import load_pem_public_key

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    # Load the public key from the PEM string
    public_key = load_pem_public_key(public_key.encode())

    # Compute the digest of the document
    digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
    digest.update(doc.encode())
    digest_value = digest.finalize()

    # Decode the signature from base64
    signature = base64.b64decode(signature)

    # Verify the signature
    try:
        public_key.verify(
            signature,
            digest_value,
            padding.PKCS1v15(),
            hashes.SHA256()
        )
        return True
    except:
        return False

Wait, but the public key is passed as a string, so the code first loads it. The 'doc' is the data being signed, which is hashed. The signature is the bytes of the RSA signature over that digest. 

This would work for a simple RSA signature. But XML signatures might require more steps, like canonicalization. 

The problem is that the function's name mentions XML elements, so maybe it's more involved. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is the XML document, and the 'signature' is the signature element within it. 

In that case, the code would need to parse the XML, find the signature element, and then use xmlsec to verify it. 

Let me try to code that. 

First, parse the XML document (doc) into an ElementTree. 

Then, find the Signature element (the 'signature' parameter might be that element's path or the element itself). 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the element tree node. 

Wait, in the function parameters, the 'doc' is probably the XML string, and the 'signature' is the element tree node. 

But in Python, when you parse a string with ET, you can pass it. 

Hmm, perhaps the code should be:

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature_node):
    # code here...

But the parameter is called 'signature', not 'signature_node'. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'signature' is the element's string. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the signature value (the content of the SignatureValue tag). 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to use the signxml library. 

Looking up the signxml's XMLVerifier method. The verify method can take the XML as a string, and the cert. 

Wait, the XMLVerifier's verify function might take the XML with the signature, and the cert. 

So, perhaps the code would be:

from signxml import XMLVerifier

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    try:
        # The doc includes the signature, so maybe we can combine them?
        # Or perhaps the 'signature' is the XML signature element, and 'doc' is the data. 
        # Not sure. 

        # Maybe the 'doc' is the XML with the signature, and the 'signature' is the value. 

        # Alternatively, the XMLVerifier can process the XML document (which includes the signature) and the certificate. 

        # So, the public key is the certificate, and the doc is the XML that contains the signature. 

        # Then, the code would be:

        # The signature is part of the XML, so the XMLVerifier can do the whole thing. 

        # But the third parameter 'signature' is redundant here. 

        # Hmm, perhaps the 'signature' parameter is the signature value (the bytes). 

        # Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the detached signature. 

        # This is getting too ambiguous. 

        # Let me think of the function's parameters again. 

        # The function is called verify_relayable_signature, with public_key, doc, signature. 

        # The docstring says to verify the signed XML elements. 

        # So the doc is the XML document, and the signature is part of it. 

        # So the code would parse the XML document, find the signature element, and verify using the public key. 

        # So using the xmlsec library approach. 

        # Let me try to write that code again, but this time include the 'signature' parameter. 

Wait, perhaps the 'signature' parameter is the signature value (the content of the SignatureValue element). 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the entire signature XML element as a string. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'doc' is the XML without the signature, and the 'signature' is the XML signature element, so the code needs to combine them or process them separately. 

Hmm, perhaps the user expects the code to use the signxml library. Let's try that approach. 

The XMLVerifier's verify function can take the XML as a string and the certificate. It would return the verified data. 

So the code would be something like:

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    try:
        # Assuming the signature is the XML with the signature element
        # Wait, perhaps the 'doc' is the XML that includes the signature, and the 'signature' is the Signature element's value. 

        # Or maybe the 'doc' is the data and the 'signature' is the signed data. 

        # Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the XML document's signature part, and the 'doc' is the original data. 

        # Not sure, but perhaps using the signxml library's verify function with the public key as the cert. 

        # Let me see the example from the signxml docs:

        # from signxml import XMLVerifier
        # XMLVerifier().verify(signed_data).verify_x509_cert(cert).signed_data

        # So perhaps the code would be:

        # Load the public key as a certificate
        cert = public_key
        # The doc is the signed XML, so:
        verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(doc, x509_cert=cert).signed_data
        return True
    except:
        return False

But then the 'signature' parameter is not used. Which is a problem. 

Hmm, the function signature has three parameters, so I must use all of them. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is the element tree node. 

Wait, perhaps the function is structured such that the 'doc' is the XML document without the signature, and the 'signature' is the generated signature. 

In that case, the code would sign the doc, then compare with the given signature. 

But how to sign it? 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the signature is a detached signature. The XML document is the data, and the signature is a separate part. 

In that case, the code would need to create a signature context, load the public key, and then verify the signature against the document. 

Wait, here's an example using xmlsec for a detached signature:

The document is the data being signed (the XML), and the signature is the cryptographic signature (the bytes). 

So the steps would be:

1. Load the public key. 
2. Compute the digest of the document (canonicalized XML).
3. Verify the signature using the public key against that digest. 

But how to canonicalize the XML? 

Hmm, perhaps the code is supposed to use the xmlsec library's methods for verification. 

Let me try to write code using xmlsec again, this time considering all parameters. 

Wait, maybe the 'signature' is the Signature element node from the XML document. 

So the code would parse the document into an ElementTree, then find the Signature element, and pass it to the context. 

Wait, but the function's parameters have a separate 'signature' parameter. 

Perhaps the 'signature' is the XML node (element) that contains the signature. So the code would do:

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature_element):
    # parse the XML document into an ElementTree
    tree = ET.fromstring(doc)
    # create a signature context
    ctx = xmlsec.SignatureContext()
    # load the public key
    key = xmlsec.Key.from_memory(public_key, xmlsec.constants.KeyDataFormatCertPem)
    ctx.key = key
    # verify the signature against the document's root element
    try:
        ctx.verify(signature_element)
        return True
    except:
        return False

But then the 'signature_element' is passed as the third parameter. Which is possible. 

In this case, the function expects the signature to be an element node. So the user would have to parse the doc into an ElementTree, find the signature node, and then pass that node here. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'signature' is a string containing the signature value (the content of the SignatureValue tag). 

Then, the code would need to extract the signed info from the document, compute the digest, and verify. 

But that's more complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'signature' is the base64 encoded signature, and the 'doc' is the data. 

In that case, the code would need to compute the digest of the data (doc), then verify the signature. 

So, using the cryptography approach again. 

Wait, maybe the user expects that. 

Let me think again. 

The function's name is verify_relayable_signature, and the parameters are public key, doc, and signature. 

The docstring says to verify the signed XML elements. 

Assuming that the signature is a cryptographic signature over the document, perhaps using RSA. 

So, the steps are:

- Convert the document to bytes (maybe using canonical form)
- Compute the digest (like SHA256)
- Decode the signature from base64
- Use the public key to verify the signature against the digest. 

The problem is that XML signatures require canonicalization of the XML, which the cryptography library doesn't handle automatically. 

The signxml library might handle that. 

Looking at signxml's documentation: 

The XMLVerifier can handle the verification of an XML Signature. The method would take the XML document (which contains the signature) and the certificate. 

So, perhaps the code is:

from signxml import XMLVerifier

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    # The 'signature' parameter is not needed here, but the function has it. 
    # Maybe the 'doc' is the signed XML including the signature, so the 'signature' is redundant. 

    # Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is the data and the 'signature' is the signed XML. 

    # Let me try this way: 

    try:
        # The doc is the XML with the signature, and the public_key is the certificate. 
        # So signature is part of doc. 

        # Then, the code would be: 
        # but the parameters include 'signature' which is unused. 

        # Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to verify the signature parameter against the doc. 

        # Maybe the signature is the value of the SignatureValue element. 

        # So, parse the XML to get the signed info, compute the digest, then check. 

        # This is getting too unclear. 

        # Let me go back to the original problem. The user wants a function that takes public_key, doc, and signature. 

        # The doc is the XML document. The signature is probably the actual cryptographic signature (like a base64 string). 

        # The public key is used to verify that signature was created by the corresponding private key. 

        # So the code would need to compute the hash of the document, then verify the signature against that hash. 

        # But how to get the hash in a way compatible with the signature method. 

        # Let's proceed with the code using the cryptography library. 

        # So, first, the public key is in PEM format. 

        # The doc is the data (XML string) to sign. 

        # The signature is the bytes of the RSA signature. 

        # So, code steps: 

        # 1. Load the public key. 

        public_key = load_pem_public_key(public_key.encode())

        # 2. Compute the digest of the document. 

        digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
        digest.update(doc.encode('utf-8'))
        digest_value = digest.finalize()

        # 3. Decode the signature from base64. 

        signature_bytes = base64.b64decode(signature)

        # 4. Verify using the public key. 

        try:
            public_key.verify(
                signature_bytes,
                digest_value,
                padding.PKCS1v15(),
                hashes.SHA256()
            )
            return True
        except InvalidSignature:
            return False

        except Exception as e:
            return False

        return False

Wait, but in this case, the 'signature' is the base64 encoded RSA signature of the document's hash. 

This would work for a simple RSA signature, but XML signatures might require more steps like canonicalization of the XML. 

If the XML needs to be canonicalized, then the code would have to do that. 

But how to do that in Python? 

The xmlsec library can handle that. 

Alternatively, maybe the signxml library does that automatically. 

So, perhaps the code using signxml would be:

def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
    # Assuming that the 'doc' includes the signature, but the 'signature' is the value. 

    # Or perhaps the 'signature' is the XML part. 

    # Maybe the 'doc' is the data, and the 'signature' is the signed data. 

    # Let me see an example from the signxml docs:

    # signed_data = XMLSigner(c14n_algorithm='http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n').sign(data, key=private_key)

    # To verify:

    # verifier = XMLVerifier().verify(signed_data).verify_certificate(x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(cert_pem)).signed_xml

    # So perhaps the code would be:

    try:
        # The public key is the certificate in PEM format. 
        # The 'doc' is the data that was signed, and the 'signature' is the signed XML. 

        # So the signature is the signed XML, which includes the signature element. 

        # So the code would take the 'signature' as the signed XML, and check against the doc and public key. 

        # Wait, but the function's parameters have 'doc' and 'signature' as separate. 

        # Maybe the 'doc' is the original XML without the signature, and the 'signature' is the detached signature. 

        # In that case, the code would combine the doc and signature. 

        # Alternatively, the 'doc' includes the signature, and the 'signature' is the value of the SignatureValue node. 

        # This is getting too ambiguous. 

        # Given that the function's parameters are public_key, doc, signature, perhaps the code should use the signxml's verify method where the signature is passed as the data. 

        # So:

        # The 'doc' is the data that was signed, and the 'signature' is the signed XML (with the Signature element). 

        # So the code would do:

        from signxml import XMLVerifier
        import base64

        # Load the public key as a certificate. 

        # But public_key is passed as a string, perhaps the PEM certificate. 

        # So:

        try:
            verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, cert=public_key).signed_data
            return verified_data == doc
        except:
            return False

        # Wait, that makes sense. The signature is the signed XML, which includes the signature element. 

        # The XMLVerifier's verify method takes the signed XML (the 'signature' parameter here), then uses the certificate (public_key) to verify it. 

        # The signed_data would then be the original document. 

        # So comparing that to the 'doc' parameter would confirm if the signature is valid. 

        # That seems plausible. 

        # So the code would be:

        def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
            try:
                verified = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, x509_cert_pem=public_key).signed_data
                return verified == doc
            except Exception:
                return False

        # Wait, but in signxml, the verify function might require passing the certificate as a parameter. 

        # Let me check the actual parameters of XMLVerifier. 

        Looking at the signxml documentation: 

        The verify function can take the xml data, and then the certificate can be passed via the verify_certificate method. 

        So perhaps the code is:

        from signxml import XMLVerifier
        import base64

        def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
            try:
                # The signature is the XML with the signature element. 
                # The public_key is the PEM certificate. 

                # Verify the signature XML against the certificate. 
                # Then check that the signed data matches the doc. 

                # So:

                # parse the signature XML
                # Wait, maybe the 'signature' is the signed XML. 

                # So:

                # First, verify the signature XML with the certificate. 
                # The signed_data is extracted and compared to 'doc'. 

                # So:

                # The XMLVerifier's verify method takes the XML (signature) and checks it. 

                # The 'cert' can be passed via the 'cert' parameter. 

                # Wait, perhaps the 'public_key' is the certificate in PEM format. 

                # So:

                verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, cert=public_key).signed_data
                return verified_data == doc
            except:
                return False

        That makes sense. 

        So the function would take the public key (certificate PEM), the original document (the data that was signed), and the signature (the XML that contains the signature). 

        The XMLVerifier checks the signature XML against the certificate, extracts the signed data, and compares it to the 'doc'. 

        So that would work. 

        But I need to make sure that the 'signature' is the XML that contains the signature. 

        So this code uses the signxml library. 

        I think this is the way to go. 

        Also, the user might expect this approach, since it's handling XML elements. 

        So, the code would look like this. 

        However, I should also handle exceptions properly, not just a generic except. 

        So, perhaps:

        from signxml import XMLVerifier

        def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
            try:
                # Verify the signature XML with the public key certificate
                # The 'signature' parameter is the signed XML, which includes the Signature element. 
                # The XMLVerifier's verify method takes the XML data (signature) and the certificate. 

                # The 'cert' parameter expects the PEM certificate. 

                # So:

                verified = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, x509_cert_pem=public_key).signed_data
                return verified == doc
            except XMLVerifier.InvalidInput as e:
                return False
            except XMLVerifier.SignatureVerificationError as e:
                return False

        Wait, but I'm not sure of the exact exceptions thrown by signxml. 

        Alternatively, just catch all exceptions, but better to catch specific ones. 

        The signxml documentation says that the verify method can raise exceptions like InvalidInput, SignatureVerificationError, etc. 

        So the code can have a try block that catches those exceptions. 

        Alternatively, to keep it simple, just a general except clause, but return False. 

        Also, the signed_data is the data that was signed. So if that equals the 'doc' parameter, then it's valid. 

        So the code would be:

        def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
            try:
                # The signature is the XML with the signature element. 
                # The public key is the certificate. 
                # Verify the signature XML, check that the signed data matches the doc. 
                # The XMLVerifier's verify method returns a VerifiedData object. 

                verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, cert=public_key).signed_data
                return verified_data == doc
            except:
                return False

        But I need to import XMLVerifier from signxml. 

        So the code would start with:

        from signxml import XMLVerifier

        Also, the 'doc' is passed as a string, and the signed_data is also a string (the data from the XML), so comparing them as strings would work. 

        So this seems like a good approach. 

        Now, considering that, the parameters are:

        public_key is the PEM certificate string.

        doc is the original data (the unsigned XML string).

        signature is the signed XML (the XML with the Signature element).

        So the code would parse the signature XML, verify using the certificate, and check that the signed data matches the doc. 

        That's a possible scenario. 

        I think this is the best way given the function signature and the docstring. 

        So I'll proceed with this approach. 

        Now, to write the code properly. 

        Also, need to ensure that the 'signature' is properly parsed. 

        So the code would be:

        from signxml import XMLVerifier

        def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
            try:
                # Verify the signature XML with the public key certificate
                # The 'signature' is the XML containing the signature
                # The 'cert' is the public key in PEM format
                # The .signed_data should give the original document
                verified = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, cert=public_key).signed_data
                return verified == doc
            except Exception:
                return False

        Wait, but the XMLVerifier's verify method may have different parameters. Let me check the correct usage. 

        Looking up the signxml docs. 

        The verify method takes the signed XML as input. 

        The 'cert' parameter can be passed to the verify method, or via a separate method. 

        Wait, the example in the signxml documentation shows:

        from signxml import XMLVerifier
        import requests

        r = requests.get("https://example.com/file.xml")
        data = r.content
        # Verify the signature
        verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(data).signed_data

        But to verify with a specific certificate, perhaps you can pass the cert_pem parameter. 

        Wait, checking the documentation. 

        XMLVerifier has a verify_cert method. 

        Alternatively, perhaps the code should be:

        def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
            try:
                # The signature is the XML with the signature
                # The public key is the PEM certificate. 
                # So the certificate is passed in the verify method. 

                # So, first, the verifier must have the certificate. 

                # Maybe:

                # Create a verifier, load the certificate, then verify. 

                # Or perhaps the verify method takes the certificate as an argument. 

                # Let me see the parameters of XMLVerifier().verify. 

                Looking at the source code of signxml, the verify function's parameters include the data, and the cert can be passed via the cert_pem parameter. 

                Wait, according to the signxml documentation, the verify method can be called with the signature XML, and then the certificate can be checked using verify_certificate. 

                So perhaps the code is:

                verifier = XMLVerifier().verify(signature)
                verifier = verifier.verify_x509_cert(public_key)
                # Or maybe the public key is a certificate object. 

                Hmm, maybe the code should be:

                from signxml import XMLVerifier

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    # Load the certificate from the public_key string. 

                    # Assuming public_key is a PEM certificate. 

                    cert = public_key

                    try:
                        verified = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, cert_pem=cert).signed_data
                        return verified == doc
                    except:
                        return False

                That might work. 

                Alternatively, maybe the 'cert_pem' is the parameter name. 

                I think the correct code using signxml would be:

                from signxml import XMLVerifier

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    try:
                        verified = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, x509_cert_pem=public_key).signed_data
                        return verified == doc
                    except Exception:
                        return False

                Yes, that seems right. 

                So the parameters are:

                public_key is the PEM certificate.

                doc is the original data (the unsigned XML string).

                signature is the signed XML (with the Signature element).

                The verify method checks the signature against the certificate, and the signed_data is extracted and compared to the original doc. 

                So this code should work. 

                Now, I need to make sure that the return is correct. 

                Also, the XMLVerifier's verify function returns a VerifiedData object, whose signed_data is the data that was signed. 

                So, if the signed_data equals the doc, then the signature is valid. 

                So that's the approach. 

                Therefore, the code would be as above. 

                But I need to make sure to import XMLVerifier from signxml. 

                Also, perhaps the signature is not the entire XML, but the function requires the signature to be part of the doc. 

                Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is the XML that includes the signature, and the 'signature' is the value of the SignatureValue element. 

                In that case, the approach would be different. 

                But given the parameters, the code using signxml seems plausible. 

                Let me check the signxml's documentation again. 

                Looking at the example here: 

                https://pypi.org/project/signxml/

                The verification example is:

                from signxml import XMLVerifier
                import requests

                r = requests.get("https://example.com/file.xml")
                data = r.content
                verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(data).signed_data

                So the verify function takes the data (the XML with signature). The certificate is not passed here, but perhaps the certificate is part of the XML. 

                If the certificate is not part of the XML, then you have to provide it. 

                Looking further into the parameters, the verify method has an optional 'cert_required' and 'cert' parameters? 

                Wait, the verify method has a 'cert' parameter which is the certificate in PEM format. 

                So in this case, the code would use the 'public_key' as the certificate, and the 'signature' is the XML with the signature. 

                The 'doc' is the original data that was signed. 

                So the code would verify that the signed data (from the signature XML) equals the doc. 

                Therefore, the code I wrote earlier should be correct. 

                So I'll proceed with that. 

                But wait, what if the signature is not the entire XML but just the signature element? 

                Then, the code would have to include that element. 

                But given the function parameters, perhaps the signature is the entire XML. 

                So the code is as above. 

                Now, I need to make sure to handle exceptions properly. 

                The try-except block catches any exceptions (like invalid signature, parsing errors, etc.) and returns False. 

                So the code should be:

                from signxml import XMLVerifier

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    try:
                        verified = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, x509_cert_pem=public_key).signed_data
                        return verified == doc
                    except Exception:
                        return False

                That's concise. 

                Alternatively, perhaps the 'doc' is the canonical form, so the code needs to canonicalize it before comparing. 

                But the signed_data would already be the canonical form. 

                Hmm, I think this is the best way. 

                So I'll write the code using the signxml library. 

                Wait, but I need to make sure that the signxml package is imported correctly. 

                Also, maybe the 'signature' parameter is a string, so we need to parse it as XML. 

                The XMLVerifier's verify method can take a string (the XML content) as the first argument. 

                So the code should work as written. 

                Therefore, the final code is as above. 

                But I should check for possible errors. 

                Also, maybe the 'doc' is passed as bytes, but the function's parameters say it's a string, so encoding may be needed. 

                Wait, in the code, the signed_data is a bytes object, and the 'doc' is a string. So comparing them may require encoding. 

                For example, if 'doc' is a string, then we need to encode it to bytes before comparing. 

                So perhaps the code should be:

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    try:
                        verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, x509_cert_pem=public_key).signed_data
                        return verified_data.decode('utf-8') == doc
                    except:
                        return False

                But then the 'doc' must be in the same encoding as the signed data. 

                Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is passed as bytes. 

                The function's parameters don't specify, but the docstring says "signed XML elements", so the doc is likely an XML string. 

                So, perhaps the code should decode the verified_data to a string and compare to 'doc'. 

                So adding .decode('utf-8') to the verified_data. 

                Alternatively, maybe the XML is read as bytes, so the 'signature' is passed as a bytes object. 

                But the function's parameters have 'signature' as a parameter, which is probably a string. 

                So I'll adjust accordingly. 

                Let me code it with that in mind. 

                Also, the signxml's verify method may return the signed data as bytes, so comparing to doc (a string) would require encoding. 

                Therefore, the code would be:

                from signxml import XMLVerifier

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    try:
                        verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signature.encode(), x509_cert_pem=public_key).signed_data
                        return verified_data.decode('utf-8') == doc
                    except:
                        return False

                Wait, but the 'signature' parameter might already be bytes. 

                Alternatively, perhaps the function expects the signature to be a string, so the code can encode it. 

                Hmm, perhaps the user passes 'signature' as a string, so we need to encode it into bytes. 

                So in the code, the signature is encoded as bytes before passing to the verify method. 

                But the XMLVerifier's verify method can take a string. 

                Let me check the source code of signxml. 

                Looking at the verify function in signxml's XMLVerifier:

                def verify(self, data, parser=None, ca_pem_file=None, cert_uri=None, cert_required=True, validate_schema=True, disable_xml_declaration=False):
                    # data can be bytes or a string. 

                    So perhaps it's okay to pass the signature as a string. 

                Therefore, the code can be:

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    try:
                        verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, x509_cert_pem=public_key).signed_data
                        return verified_data.decode('utf-8') == doc
                    except:
                        return False

                Wait, but the signed_data could be bytes, so comparing to a string would require decoding. 

                Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is passed as bytes, but the function's parameters say it's a string. 

                So assuming that the 'doc' is a UTF-8 string, the code should decode the verified_data to a string and compare. 

                So that's necessary. 

                Also, perhaps the 'signature' is the XML document containing the signature, so the code would use that as the data. 

                So the code is as written. 

                I think this is the correct approach given the parameters and the XML elements mentioned in the docstring. 

                Therefore, the code should be this. 

                Now, to make sure that all the parameters are used. The public_key is passed as the certificate, the signature is the XML to verify, and the doc is the original data. 

                So the code uses all three parameters. 

                Therefore, this should work. 

                Now, I need to write this code in Python, using the correct imports and syntax. 

                Also, need to catch the exceptions properly. 

                The signxml's verify method may raise exceptions like VerificationError, InvalidCertificate, etc. 

                But to keep it simple, catching all exceptions. 

                So the final code would be:

                from signxml import XMLVerifier

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    try:
                        verified = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, x509_cert_pem=public_key).signed_data
                        return verified.decode('utf-8') == doc
                    except:
                        return False

                Wait, but maybe the 'doc' is already bytes. 

                Hmm, the function's parameters say 'doc' is a parameter, which could be a string. 

                So the code is correct. 

                Alternatively, perhaps the signed_data is an ElementTree object, so comparing to a string wouldn't work. 

                Oh right, maybe the signed_data is the XML element that was signed. 

                In that case, the code would need to compare the XML string to the signed data's string representation. 

                So perhaps:

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    try:
                        verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, x509_cert_pem=公共鍵).signed_xml
                        # Then, convert the ElementTree to a string and compare to doc. 
                        # But how?

                        # If verified_data is an Element, then:

                        # from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET

                        # ET.tostring(verified_data) would give the XML as bytes. 

                        # So:

                        from xml.etree.ElementTree import tostring

                        return tostring(verified_data).decode('utf-8') == doc
                    except:
                        return False

                But I'm not sure what the signed_data returns. 

                The signxml's documentation says that the signed_data is the data that was signed. 

                If the signature is a detached signature, then the signed_data would be the doc. 

                But if the signature is enveloping or enveloped, the signed_data may be part of the XML. 

                Hmm, maybe the signed_data is the actual data that was signed, so comparing to 'doc' would work. 

                So I'll proceed with the first version, assuming that the signed_data is the original document as bytes. 

                Therefore, the code would be as follows. 

                Also, the public_key is passed as a string (PEM), so that's okay. 

                I think this is the best way to proceed given the constraints. 

                So, the code is as above. 

                Now, let me make sure to include the necessary imports. 

                The 'signxml' module must be imported. 

                The code would need to import XMLVerifier from signxml. 

                Also, maybe need to handle the case where the signed data is an Element, so converting to a string. 

                Alternatively, perhaps the code should return True if the verification is successful. 

                Wait, in the example from the docs, the .signed_data is the data that was signed. 

                So, in the case of a detached signature, the signed data would be the original XML (the 'doc' parameter), so comparing the two would make sense. 

                So the code is correct. 

                Therefore, I think this is the right approach. 

                So the final code would look like this. 

                Also, need to make sure that the 'x509_cert_pem' is the correct parameter name. 

                Checking the signxml documentation again. 

                The XMLVerifier's verify method has parameters like 'cert' or 'x509_cert_pem'? 

                Looking at the code for signxml's XMLVerifier, the method signature for verify is:

                def verify(self, data, parser=None, ca_pem_file=None, cert_uri=None, cert_required=True, validate_schema=True, disable_xml_declaration=False):

                So perhaps the 'x509_cert_pem' is not a parameter. 

                Wait, perhaps the 'cert' is the certificate. 

                Maybe I should pass the public_key as the cert parameter. 

                So the code should be:

                verified_data = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, cert=public_key).signed_data

                Because the 'cert' parameter expects the PEM certificate string. 

                So the correct parameter is 'cert', not 'x509_cert_pem'. 

                So I need to adjust that. 

                Therefore, the corrected code would be:

                from signxml import XMLVerifier

                def verify_relayable_signature(public_key, doc, signature):
                    try:
                        verified = XMLVerifier().verify(signature, cert=public_key).signed_data
                        return verified.decode('utf-8') == doc
                    except:
                        return False

                That's better. 

                Now, I think that's the correct approach. 

                So the function uses the signxml library to verify the signature XML (passed as the third parameter) with the provided public key (as a PEM certificate), then checks that the signed data matches the 'doc' parameter. 

                This should work for verifying that the document was indeed signed with the corresponding private key. 

                I'll proceed with this code. 

                Also, perhaps the 'signature' is a base64 encoded string of the signature, but that's not likely since the parameter is called 'signature' and the function is dealing with XML elements. 

                So the code above should be correct. 

                So the final code is as written. 

                I need to make sure to use the correct method and parameters. 

                Let me also check that the XMLVerifier's verify method returns the signed data as bytes. 

                So, when you call .verify() on the signature XML with the cert, the .signed_data would be the original document's bytes. 

                So comparing to doc (a string) requires decoding. 

                Thus, the code should return the decoded string equals the doc. 

                So this is correct. 

                Therefore, the generated code is as above. 

                Also, need to handle possible exceptions. 

                The except clause catches any exceptions, returns False. 

                That should work. 

                So I think this is the correct code to generate. 

                Now, the user wants the code in markdown format but only the code, no explanations. 

                So I need to write the code using the signxml approach. 

                Let me make sure the code is properly formatted. 

                Also, perhaps the 'doc' is not exactly the same as the signed_data because of XML formatting differences. 

                Like, extra spaces or line breaks might differ, but the XMLVerifier would have canonicalized it. 

                So the comparison should be okay. 

                Alternatively, maybe the 'doc' is already canonicalized. 

                But in any case, the code compares the two strings. 

                So that's the best we can do here. 

                Therefore, the code is as follows.
