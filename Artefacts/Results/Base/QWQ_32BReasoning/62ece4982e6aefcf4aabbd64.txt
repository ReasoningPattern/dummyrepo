Okay, I need to write a Python function called strip_root that takes a path and a root as arguments. The goal is to remove the root from the path. If that's not possible, it should throw an exception. Hmm, right, so how do I approach this?

First, I remember that paths can be absolute or relative. The root here probably refers to the directory that the path starts with. For example, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/documents/file.txt', then stripping the root would give 'documents/file.txt'. But if the path doesn't start with the root, like if it's '/etc/passwd', then we should raise an exception.

Wait, but how do I check if the path starts with the root? Oh right, using os.path.commonprefix might be helpful here. Or maybe just compare the start of the path string to the root. But I have to be careful with case sensitivity and different OS path separators. Oh, but in Python, the os.path module handles that, so maybe using those functions is better.

Alternatively, I can split the path and the root into their components and compare them. Like, using os.path.split or something like that. Let's think: perhaps using the posixpath module since we're dealing with paths in a generic way, but maybe os.path is better because it's OS-dependent. But the problem might want a cross-platform solution. Hmm.

Wait, the key is that the root must be a prefix of the path. So, first, I should check if the path starts with the root. But I also need to consider the trailing slash. Like, if the root is '/home/user/' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the common prefix is '/home/user', but if the root is given without the trailing slash, maybe the check should be done properly.

Alternatively, maybe using the startswith method, but making sure to account for the separator. For example, if the root ends with a slash, the path should start with that. Otherwise, maybe the root is the directory, and the path must start with root followed by a slash or be exactly the root.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to use the os.path.commonpath function to check if the root is actually a parent directory of the path. But I have to be cautious because commonpath can raise exceptions if the paths are on different drives (on Windows) or if the path isn't actually under the root. Oh right, but in that case, I need to catch that and raise an exception if it's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe using the pathlib module would be better. Let's see, Path objects have parents and parts. So converting both to Path objects, then checking if the path starts with the root. Let me think.

Wait, the function's docstring says to return the path without the root. So, for instance, if the path is the root itself, then return an empty string? Or maybe just an empty string. But perhaps the user expects that if the path is exactly the root, then stripping it would leave an empty string, but maybe it's better to return '.' or something else? The problem isn't clear on that. The example in the docstring says "returns a path without root", so probably just the part after the root.

Wait, let's see. Let's think of an example. Suppose root is '/var/www' and path is '/var/www/uploads/file.txt', then stripping the root would give 'uploads/file.txt'. But if the path is '/var/log/file.txt', then the root isn't a prefix, so we need to throw an exception.

So the steps are:

1. Check if the root is a prefix of the path. But need to handle the case where the root doesn't end with a separator. For example, if root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the common prefix is '/home/user', so that's okay. But if the path is '/home/userdocs', then the prefix would be '/home/user' which is incorrect. So perhaps we need to make sure that the root is exactly the prefix, followed by a separator or is the end of the path.

Ah right, so the correct way is to ensure that the path starts with the root, and either the next character is a separator or the path is exactly the root. Otherwise, the root isn't actually the prefix. So to do that, maybe:

- Normalize both paths to have a trailing slash (or not) in a consistent way.

Alternatively, append a separator to the root and check if the path starts with that. But need to use the correct separator for the OS.

Wait, but maybe using the os.path.sep and os.path.altsep to handle the separators. Let me think of a way.

Alternatively, using the pathlib module's PurePath. Let me see. Let's try to use PurePath for this. Because with pathlib, it's easier to handle path operations in a cross-platform way.

So here's an idea:

Convert both path and root to PurePath objects (since we don't need to check existence, just the structure). Then check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then return the relative path. Otherwise, raise an exception.

Wait, how does the PurePath.relative_to method work? Because if the path is a descendant of the root, then relative_to(root) would give the relative path. But if the path isn't under root, then it throws a ValueError.

Exactly! So maybe the function can be as simple as:

return Path(path).relative_to(root)

But then, the problem says to throw an exception if it fails. So that's exactly what happens when the path isn't under root. But the parameters are given as strings, so perhaps using the Path objects from pathlib.

Wait, but what if the root doesn't have a trailing slash? Let me see. Suppose root is '/home/user' and path is '/home/user/file.txt', then relative_to would give 'file.txt'. But if the root is '/home/user/' (with a trailing slash), does that affect it? Let me check in my mind. The PurePath doesn't care about trailing slashes in the same way when checking for relative paths. For example, Path('/a/b').relative_to('/a/b/c') would be '..' but in our case, if the root is the parent, then it's okay. So perhaps using the pathlib approach is better.

So the code would be:

from pathlib import Path

def strip_root(path, root):
    stripped = Path(path).relative_to(root)
    return str(stripped)

But then, if the relative_to throws an error, then it's caught, and the function will raise it. Wait, but the problem says to throw an exception if it fails. The relative_to does that, so perhaps that's sufficient. But maybe we need to handle some edge cases, like if the root is the same as the path. For example, if path is the root, then relative_to would return an empty string? Let me see.

Testing example: Path('/var/www').relative_to('/var/www') returns a relative Path object with the empty string. So converting to string would give '.'? Or maybe empty? Let me think. Wait, in Python, Path('/var/www').relative_to('/var/www') would actually raise ValueError if the path is exactly the same as the root, because the relative path would be '.'?

Wait, no, let me check. Suppose root is a Path object for '/var/www', and path is also '/var/www'. Then Path(path).relative_to(root) would return a relative path that's just the empty string, but when converted to a string, it becomes '.'? Or maybe an empty string?

Wait, let me think. Let's see, in Python, when you do Path('/a/b').relative_to('/a/b'), does it return an empty Path? Or does it raise an error?

Wait, I think it would raise a ValueError. Because relative_to requires that the path starts with the root. So if they are the same, then the relative path is '.'? Or perhaps the function can't return that, so it would raise an error. Wait, maybe not. Let me check an example in code.

Wait, I can't run code right now, but I'll try to recall. The relative_to method returns a path that is relative to the argument. So if the path is exactly the root, then the relative path is a Path() with no parts, which when converted to a string would be empty. But maybe in practice, when the paths are equal, it returns an empty path. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps using the try-except block. Because if the path is not under root, then relative_to would raise ValueError. So the function can just call that and let it throw. That's probably the best approach.

Wait, but the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So perhaps using the Path's relative_to is exactly what we need. So the code would be:

from pathlib import Path

def strip_root(path, root):
    return str(Path(path).relative_to(root))

Wait, but the user might pass the root as a string without a trailing slash, and the path as having that. Like, root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', so that's okay. But if the root is given with a trailing slash, like '/home/user/' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', the relative_to would still work. Because the PurePosixPath treats them similarly.

Hmm, but what about Windows paths with different drive letters? For example, if root is 'C:/Program Files' and the path is 'D:/Program Files/file.txt', then the drive letters are different, so relative_to would throw. That's correct, since the path isn't under the root. So the function would work as intended.

But maybe the user wants to handle absolute vs. relative paths correctly. Let's think. Suppose the root is an absolute path, but the path is a relative path. Then the check would fail. So the function would throw, which is correct.

Wait, but the problem says "Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception". So using the Path relative_to method seems to do exactly that. So that's the way to go.

But the problem's docstring says "Returns a path without root". So perhaps the function should return the stripped path as a string. So converting the Path object to a string is necessary.

Another point: what if the root is a directory that is a parent but not the direct parent? Like root is '/var', and path is '/var/www/somefile', then the relative path is 'www/somefile', which is correct.

Wait, but what about cases where the path has symbolic links or different representations? The function may need to resolve the actual paths, but the problem probably doesn't require that. Since it's about the string path, not the actual file system. So using the pure path functions (without resolving) is better here.

Therefore, the code can be written using pathlib's Path. So the code would be:

from pathlib import Path

def strip_root(path, root):
    return str(Path(path).relative_to(root))

Wait, but the function's parameters are path and root. So I need to make sure that the root is passed as a Path as well? Or maybe just pass the strings into the Path constructor. Since Path can take a string, that's okay.

Wait, but the user might pass a root that is a string, like 'root/some/dir' and the path is 'root/some/dir/file.txt', then it would work. However, if the paths are on different OSes, like if the root is a Windows path and the path is a Unix path, but that's probably beyond the scope here. The function should work with the given strings as paths, using the OS's conventions.

Wait, but in Python, the Path uses the OS's separator. However, since the problem doesn't specify the environment, maybe using PurePath to avoid resolving, which would treat the paths as strings without considering the OS. Wait, perhaps better to use PurePath to be platform-independent.

Wait, the Path class uses the current OS's path semantics. So if the code is run on Windows, then it would use backslashes, but maybe the function is supposed to work with the given strings as is. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects to work with the paths as strings, without resolving. So maybe using the os.path module functions?

Alternatively, maybe using the os.path.commonpath function. Let me think. The commonpath between the path and the root would give the root if the path is under it. But how to use that?

Wait, the problem is to remove the root from the path. So perhaps:

import os

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        # but also check that after the root, there's a separator
        # because maybe the root is exactly the start but the next part is part of the same directory.
        # For example, root is '/a/b' and path is '/a/bc/file.txt', then the startswith would return true if the path starts with '/a/b', but that's not correct. Because the actual directory structure would not have the root as a parent.

        # So perhaps using os.path.commonpath to check if the root is indeed the common path.

    common = os.path.commonpath([root, path])
    if common != root:
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")
    # Then, the stripped path is path[len(root)+1:], but need to be careful with the separator.

Wait, but the commonpath function can be tricky. For instance, if the root is a directory and the path is a file in that directory, then commonpath would return the root. But if the path is the root itself, then commonpath would return the root, so then the stripped path would be empty? Let me see.

Suppose root is '/var/www' and path is '/var/www', then commonpath would be '/var/www', so the code would proceed. Then path[len(root)+1:] would be from index len('/var/www') +1, which is 8 (if root is '/var/www', length is 8, so adding 1 gives 9, but the path is 8 characters, so the substring would be empty. But perhaps that's okay.

Wait, but the problem says to return a path without the root. So in that case, maybe it should return the empty string? Or maybe an empty path is considered as current directory. Hmm, but the function's docstring doesn't specify. Let's see.

Another example: path is '/var/www/index.html', root is '/var/www'. Then the stripped path is 'index.html'.

But if the path is '/var/www/' (with a trailing slash), then the code would do path[len(root)+1:], which would be 8 +1 =9, so the path up to 9, then the remaining is '/'. So the result would be '/'. But that's not correct. The relative path should be empty if it's exactly the root. So perhaps the code needs to handle that.

Alternatively, using the split and join approach. Hmm, maybe the Path approach is better here.

Wait, let's think again. Using the Path relative_to method. Let's take the example where path is the same as root. For instance, Path('/var/www').relative_to('/var/www') would raise ValueError? Or not?

Wait, according to the Python documentation, Path.relative_to(other) returns the relative path from other to the path object. So if the path is exactly other, then the relative path is an empty string. Let me see: 

Testing in Python (imagining):

>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> p = Path('/var/www')
>>> r = Path('/var/www')
>>> p.relative_to(r)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError:パス '/var/www' は '/var/www' に相対ではありません。

Wait, maybe I'm wrong here. Because when the path is exactly the root, then the relative path would be '.', not an empty string. Wait, no, perhaps the method raises an error. Let me think of another example. Suppose the root is '/var/www', and the path is '/var/www', then the relative path is '.'? Or does it raise an error?

Hmm, maybe in that case, it would raise a ValueError. Because the path is exactly the same as the root, so there's no relative path. Wait, but the relative path from the root to itself is indeed an empty string. Or maybe '.'.

Alternatively, perhaps the code would need to handle that case. Because if the path is exactly the root, then the stripped path should be empty or '.'?

The problem's docstring says to return the path without the root, so if the path is exactly the root, then the result should be an empty string. But maybe the function returns the relative path as a string, which in that case would be '.'? That's a problem.

Hmm, so perhaps the Path.relative_to approach isn't perfect here. Let me see. Let's try in my mind:

If path is '/var/www/index.html' and root is '/var/www', then p.relative_to(r) gives 'index.html'.

If path is '/var/www', then p.relative_to(r) would raise ValueError because the path is exactly the root. Wait, no, actually, I think that it would return a relative path that's empty, but in practice, I think the method raises an error. Let me think again. Let me check an example with a parent.

Suppose the root is '/var' and the path is '/var/www'. Then p.relative_to(r) would return 'www'. But if the path is the same as the root, then the relative path would be '.'? Or perhaps it's considered as the same, so the method raises an error?

Wait, the documentation says: "Return a new path object relative to the passed path." So, if the passed path is the same as the current path, then the relative path is an empty path. But in Python, when you call p.relative_to(r) where p is r, then it should throw ValueError because r is not a parent of p. Wait, no, because the parent of p is not r. Wait, p is exactly r, so the relative path would be empty, but the method may not allow that. Let me think of a concrete example.

Suppose:

p = Path('/a/b/c')
r = Path('/a/b')
Then p.relative_to(r) is 'c'.

But if r is '/a/b/c', then p is the same as r, so p.relative_to(r) would be an empty path? Let me see in code:

>>> Path('/a/b/c').relative_to('/a/b/c/')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/pathlib.py", line 779, in relative_to
    raise ValueError("{!r} does not start with {!r}"
ValueError: '/a/b/c' does not start with '/a/b/c/'.

Ah, so if the root ends with a slash, then the path must start with that. But in the case where the path is exactly the root, then the relative_to would return an empty path?

Wait, let's try:

>>> Path('/a/b/c').relative_to('/a/b/c')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/pathlib.py", line 779, in relative_to
    raise ValueError("{!r} does not start with {!r}"
ValueError: '/a/b/c' does not start with '/a/b/c'.

Wait, that's strange. Wait, the path is exactly the same as the root. So why does it raise an error?

Hmm, maybe because the relative_to is expecting the root to be a parent. So when they are exactly the same, the relative path is the current directory, but the method requires that the path starts with the root followed by a separator. So in this case, the root is exactly the same as the path, so the relative path would be empty, but the method might not consider that as a valid case. Because in some cases, like on Windows, if the drive letters match, but otherwise, perhaps it's considered valid.

Wait, maybe I should use the PurePath instead. Let me check.

The PurePath relative_to method works similarly? Let's see. For example, using PurePosixPath:

from pathlib import PurePosixPath

p = PurePosixPath('/var/www')
r = PurePosixPath('/var/www')
p.relative_to(r) would return a PurePosixPath with empty parts? Or raise?

Hmm, I think in that case, it would raise an error. Because the path does not start with the root plus a separator. Wait, but in this example, the path is exactly the root. So maybe the method is not designed for that. So in this case, the function would need to return an empty string, but the relative_to would throw. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should first check if the root is indeed a prefix, and then return the rest. Let's think of a different approach.

Let me think of the steps:

1. Check if the path starts with the root. But also, after the root, there must be a separator (or the end of the string). Otherwise, it could be part of a longer path. For example, root is '/a/b' and path is '/a/bc', then the startswith would be True, but the actual path isn't under the root.

2. So first, check if the root is a directory. So the path must start with root, followed by os.sep, or be exactly equal to the root. Wait, but how to handle that?

Hmm, perhaps:

import os

def strip_root(path, root):
    # Make sure the root is a directory, so we can check if the path starts with it followed by a separator or is exactly the root.

    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

    # Now check if the next character after the root is a path separator, or if it's the end of the string.

    path_after_root = path[len(root):]
    if len(path_after_root) == 0 or path_after_root[0] in (os.sep, os.altsep):
        # Then it's okay. The stripped path is the part after the root, excluding the separator if present.
        # So the stripped path would be path[len(root)+1:] if there is a separator, else empty string.

        stripped_path = path[len(root)+1:] if path_after_root and path_after_root[0] in (os.sep, os.altsep) else ''
        return stripped_path
    else:
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

Wait, but this approach may have issues with different path separators. For example, on Windows, the altsep is '/' even if the sep is '\', so maybe need to handle that.

Alternatively, using the os.path.sep and os.path.altsep. Let me see.

But this code may not handle all cases. Let's test some scenarios.

Test case 1:
root = '/var/www'
path = '/var/www/index.html'
path starts with root, then the next character is '/', so path_after_root is '/index.html' (since path is 10 characters, root is 8, so len(root) is 8. path[8:] is '/index.html'. Then stripped_path would be path[8+1:] which is 'index.html'.

Test case 2: path is exactly the root.
root = '/var/www'
path = '/var/www' → path_after_root is empty. So the first condition (len ==0) is true, so stripped_path is empty string. So the function returns that. But does the problem want that? The docstring says "returns a path without root", so if the original path is the root, then the stripped path would be empty. That's okay.

Another test case where the root has a trailing slash:

root = '/var/www/'
path = '/var/www/index.html' → starts with the root? Let's see: the root is 9 characters, path starts with 9, the next character would be 'i'? So no. So the code would fail. Hmm, so this approach may not account for the root having a trailing slash. Because the path may start with the root without the trailing slash, but when the root has a slash, then it's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps we should normalize both paths by ensuring that the root ends with a separator, and then check if the path starts with that.

So, first, we can make sure that the root has a separator at the end (if it's not the root itself, like '/').

Wait, let's see. Let me think of a helper function.

def _add_trailing_sep(path_str):
    if not path_str.endswith(os.sep) and path_str != os.sep:
        return path_str + os.sep
    return path_str

Then, the root_str = _add_trailing_sep(root)
path_str = os.path.normpath(path)

Wait, but maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, using os.path.join to append a separator?

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to use the os.path.commonpath function. Let me think again.

Wait, the commonpath function returns the common directory between the two paths. So if the common path is the root, then it's okay. But if the path is exactly the root, then commonpath would be the root, so it's okay.

Wait, but commonpath may have security issues, but perhaps for this problem, it's okay.

Alternatively:

import os

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")
    # Now check if after the root, the next character is a separator or end.
    # Also, handle cases where root is the root directory (like '/').

    # To avoid issues with trailing slashes, let's use os.path.split or something else?

    # Another approach: split the path into components and the root into components, then check if the path starts with the root components.

    from os.path import split, sep

    path_parts = []
    while True:
        path, part = split(path)
        if part:
            path_parts.append(part)
        else:
            break
    path_parts.reverse()
    root_parts = []
    while True:
        root, part = split(root)
        if part:
            root_parts.append(part)
        else:
            break
    root_parts.reverse()

    if len(path_parts) < len(root_parts):
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

    for i in range(len(root_parts)):
        if path_parts[i] != root_parts[i]:
            raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

    # Now, the root is indeed a prefix. So the remaining parts are path_parts[len(root_parts):]
    # So we can join them with sep, but also handle the case when the path is exactly the root.

    stripped = sep.join(path_parts[len(root_parts):])
    return stripped

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe better to use the Path approach with try-except.

Wait, here's another idea. Using the Path's relative_to method and wrapping it in a try block. Because if the path is not under root, then relative_to will raise ValueError. So:

from pathlib import Path

def strip_root(path, root):
    try:
        return str(Path(path).relative_to(root))
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

Wait, but let's test some cases.

Case 1: path is '/var/www/file.txt', root is '/var/www' → relative_to returns 'file.txt', which is correct.

Case 2: path is '/var/www', root is '/var/www' → then Path(path).relative_to(root) would raise ValueError, because the path is exactly the root. So the function would throw, but that's not desired. Because the stripped path should be empty, but the method is not returning that. So this approach would fail in this case.

Hmm, that's a problem. So how do I handle the case when the path is exactly the root?

Maybe the code should check if the path is the root, then return an empty string. Otherwise, use relative_to.

Alternatively, perhaps we can adjust the root by adding a separator. Like, making the root into a Path and then adding a slash? Or perhaps using the parent.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the root as a directory. So, if the path is the same as the root, then the relative path is empty. But the relative_to method might not like that. So perhaps, we can make the root into a Path object, then check if the path is the root, and return empty. Otherwise, proceed with relative_to.

Wait, but how to check that? Let's see:

root_path = Path(root)
path_obj = Path(path)

if path_obj == root_path:
    return ''
else:
    return str(path_obj.relative_to(root_path))

But then, if the path is exactly the root, we return empty string. However, what about case where the root is a directory and the path is the root plus a separator? Like, on Posix, if root is '/var/www' and path is '/var/www/', then they are considered the same, but the code would see them as equal. So in that case, it would return empty string. But perhaps the user wants that.

Alternatively, the problem may not require that edge case, but just to handle the general case. Let me see the problem's examples again. The problem's docstring says "returns a path without root". So perhaps the function should return the part of the path after the root, excluding the root's trailing separator. So in the case where path is exactly the root, then the stripped path is empty string. So the code above would work for that.

Wait, but the problem says to "throw exception if fails". So in that case, when the path is exactly the root, the code would return empty string, not throw. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the code using relative_to, when path is exactly the root, then the code would raise ValueError. So in that case, the code would need to handle that.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct approach is:

Check if the root is a prefix of the path, and then handle the case when the path is exactly the root.

Alternatively, using the relative_to method but ensuring that the root is treated as a directory. So, adding a slash to the root.

Wait, here's another idea. Let's use the pure path objects and check if the path starts with the root. But also, ensure that after the root, there is a separator or nothing.

Wait, using PurePath:

def strip_root(path, root):
    from pathlib import PurePath
    p = PurePath(path)
    r = PurePath(root)
    if r not in p.parents and p != r:
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")
    # Wait, that's not correct. The parents don't include the root itself unless it's a parent.

    # Alternatively, check if r is a parent of p, or if p is exactly r.

    if p.is_relative_to(r):
        return str(p.relative_to(r))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

Wait, but is_relative_to is available in Python 3.9+, maybe? Oh right, the problem may not assume that. So perhaps using the try-except block is better.

Alternatively, in Python versions before 3.9, there's no is_relative_to, so the code would need to be compatible with older versions. But I'm not sure what the user expects. Let's proceed with the try-except approach.

Wait, but in the case where the path is exactly the root, the code would raise, but we need to return an empty string. So how to handle that?

So, perhaps:

from pathlib import Path

def strip_root(path, root):
    path_obj = Path(path)
    root_obj = Path(root)
    try:
        if path_obj == root_obj:
            return ''
        return str(path_obj.relative_to(root_obj))
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

Wait, but how does the equality work? For example, on Posix, if path is '/var/www/' and root is '/var/www', then Path objects are considered equal? Let me see. Path('/var/www') and Path('/var/www/') are considered equal because they point to the same directory. So in that case, the equality check would pass, and return empty string.

So that's good. So this code would handle the case where path is exactly the root. But in other cases, like when the path is not under the root, it throws.

Wait, but let's test the example where path is exactly the root. Let's say:

strip_root('/var/www', '/var/www') → returns ''

strip_root('/var/www/', '/var/www') → returns ''

strip_root('/var/www/index.html', '/var/www') → returns 'index.html'

Another case where the path is under the root but not directly. Like, path is '/var/www/html/index.html', root is '/var/www' → returns 'html/index.html'.

That seems correct.

But what about when the root is a directory and the path starts with the root but without a separator? Like, root is '/a/b', path is '/a/bc' → then the code would check if the path starts with root? The PurePath would see that '/a/b' is not a parent of '/a/bc', so the relative_to would throw, and the code would raise the error. Which is correct.

Another edge case: the root is the root directory (like '/') on Posix. Then path is '/home/user/file', stripping the root would return 'home/user/file'? Wait, no. Because relative_to('/') would give 'home/user/file', but the actual stripped path would be 'home/user/file', which is correct. However, if the path is '/' itself, then the code would return an empty string. So that's okay.

Wait, in the code above, when path is '/' and root is '/', then the equality check is true, so return ''. Which is correct.

Another test case: Windows path. Suppose root is 'C:\\Program Files', and path is 'C:\\Program Files\\file.txt'. Then, the code would return 'file.txt'.

But if the path is 'C:\\Program Files' (the root itself), then return empty string. That's correct.

Hmm, this approach seems to handle most cases. But what about when the root is a drive letter in Windows and the path has a different drive letter? The code would correctly throw an error.

So, perhaps this is the way to go. The code would first check if the path is exactly the same as the root (so return empty string), else use relative_to. But how to do the equality check. Because in some cases, like when the path is a symlink, but the problem says to work with the given strings, not actual filesystem paths. So the equality check between Path objects should be okay since they are pure paths (no resolving).

Wait, but when using Path, the equality checks the actual path strings (normalized?), so maybe that's okay.

Wait, let's see:

In the case where the path is '/var/www/' and the root is '/var/www', then the Path objects are considered equal. So the code would return empty string. That's correct.

Another case where the path is 'var/www/file.txt' and root is 'var/www', then the path is exactly the root. So the code would return empty string. But if the path is 'var/www/some/file.txt', then it would return 'some/file.txt'.

Wait, but what if the root is not a directory? Like, if the root is a file. Then the code would still work, but the problem's intention may be to only consider directories as roots. But the problem's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's okay.

So the code would be:

from pathlib import Path

def strip_root(path, root):
    path_obj = Path(path)
    root_obj = Path(root)
    if path_obj == root_obj:
        return ''
    try:
        return str(path_obj.relative_to(root_obj))
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

Wait, but what about the case where the root is a directory and the path is the root followed by a slash? For example, path is '/var/www/' and root is '/var/www', then the equality check would be true (since Path treats trailing slashes as same), so return empty string. That's correct.

Another case where the path starts with the root but has different case (on a case-insensitive OS like Windows). But the problem may not care about that. The code would still check the actual strings, so maybe it's better to use case-sensitive comparisons. Because the Path objects on Windows would consider 'C:\\Program Files' and 'c:\\program files' as equal? Or not?

Hmm, the Path equality uses case-insensitive comparison on Windows. So if the problem requires case-sensitive checking, then this approach may not work. But the problem probably expects that if the path is not under the root (case-sensitive), then it should throw. So perhaps the code needs to use PurePath instead of Path, to avoid any case-insensitive checks.

Wait, the Path class uses the OS's case sensitivity. So on Windows, it's case-insensitive, but on Linux it's case-sensitive. If the problem requires case-sensitive checking, then perhaps we need to use PurePath. Because the PurePath doesn't do any case folding. Let me see.

Yes, the PurePath is for manipulation of paths as strings without considering the actual file system. So maybe using PurePath is better here.

So modifying the code:

from pathlib import PurePath

def strip_root(path, root):
    path_obj = PurePath(path)
    root_obj = PurePath(root)
    if path_obj == root_obj:
        return ''
    try:
        return str(path_obj.relative_to(root_obj))
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Path is not under root")

Wait, but in this case, the PurePath would check the exact string (with case sensitivity). So for example, on Windows, if the root is 'C:\\Program Files' and the path is 'C:\\program files\\file.txt', then the PurePath would treat them as different (since case-sensitive), but in reality, on the OS, they might be considered the same. But the problem says to "remove root from path", so it's probably treating the path as a string, not considering the OS's case sensitivity. So using PurePath is better here because it's purely string-based.

Yes, that makes sense. So using PurePath ensures that it's a string-based check, not relying on the OS's case sensitivity.

So this code should work for all cases except when the path is exactly the root. Wait, but in the code above, if the path is exactly the root, then it returns empty string, which is correct. Otherwise, it tries to get the relative path. Which would return the part after the root.

Wait, but let me test some scenarios in code.

Example 1:

root = '/var/www'
path = '/var/www/index.html'

path_obj = PurePath('/var/www/index.html'), root_obj is PurePath('/var/www')

path_obj != root_obj → so proceed to relative_to. The result is 'index.html', so correct.

Example 2: path is exactly the root → returns empty string.

Example 3: path is '/var/www' and root is '/var' → then relative_to would return 'www', which is correct. But in the code, the equality check is between the path and root, which are not equal, so proceed to relative_to. That's okay.

Another example where the path is not under root:

root = '/var/www', path = '/etc/passwd' → path_obj doesn't start with root_obj, so relative_to throws, and code raises the error.

Another tricky case: the root is a parent directory but the path has a different case (like on Windows). But with PurePath, the case is considered, so if the root is 'C:\\Program Files' and the path is 'C:\\program files\\file.txt', then the code would see them as different and raise an error. But if the problem requires that, then that's correct. The problem didn't specify, but since it's a function to remove the root, probably expects exact match.

So this code should work.

Wait, but what about leading slashes? For example, root is '/var/www', and path is '/var/www/index.html' → the relative path is correct. But if the root is not absolute and the path is absolute, then it's not under. For example, root is 'var/www' and path is '/var/www/index.html', then the code would see that the root is not part of the path's components, so throw.

Which is correct, because the root is a relative path and the path is absolute, so they are not in the same hierarchy.

Another case where the root is a relative path, like 'docs', and the path is 'docs/report.txt' → the code returns 'report.txt'.

But if the path is 'doc/report.txt' (with a typo in docs), then the code would throw, which is correct.

Hmm, this seems to handle all cases. So the code would be as above. Let me see:

Wait, the code first checks if path_obj equals root_obj. If so, returns empty string. Otherwise, tries to get the relative path. But what if the root is a subdirectory of the path? For example, root is '/var/www/index.html' and path is '/var/www/index.html' → then they are equal, so return empty string. But if the path is shorter than the root, like path is '/var/www' and root is '/var/www/index.html', then the code would check equality, but they are not equal, so try to get relative_to, which would throw. That's correct.

So this code should handle all the cases correctly. The only possible issue is when the root is the root directory (like '/') on Posix. Let's see:

root = '/', path = '/home/user/file.txt → the code would do path_obj.relative_to(root_obj) which is 'home/user/file.txt', and that's correct. But if the path is '/', then the equality check is true, so returns empty string. But in that case, the stripped path would be empty, which is correct.

Another case: Windows drive letters. For example, root is 'C:\\projects', path is 'C:\\projects\\code.py → returns 'code.py'. If the path is 'C:\\projects', then returns empty string. If the path is 'D:\\projects\\code.py', then relative_to would throw, because the drive letters are different.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, this code should work. So the final code is using PurePath, checking for equality, then returning the relative path. Let's write that.
