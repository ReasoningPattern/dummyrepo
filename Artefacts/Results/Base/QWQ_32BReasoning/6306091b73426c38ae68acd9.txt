Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called workspace_manager and it's a class method since it takes 'cls' as the parameter. The docstring says it gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

Hmm, so first, I should figure out what the function is supposed to do. The name suggests that it's retrieving a workspace manager, probably from some service. The docstring mentions using ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER as the key for cls._get_service(). So I think the function should call cls._get_service() with the ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER argument and return that.

Wait, but what's ServiceName here? Probably an enum or a class that has a constant called WORKSPACE_MANAGER. Maybe the function is part of a larger system where services are looked up using this name. The user didn't provide any other details, so I'll have to assume that the ServiceName is correctly imported and that cls._get_service() is a method that can take that enum value as an argument.

So the code structure would be something like:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But wait, I need to make sure that ServiceName is properly referenced. Since the function is a method of a class, maybe ServiceName is part of the same class or imported from somewhere. The user didn't specify, so I should just use it as is, assuming it's defined elsewhere. 

Also, the function is a decorator? Wait no, the signature says def workspace_manager(cls): which looks like a method. But the way the docstring is phrased, maybe it's a class method. So perhaps it should be decorated with @classmethod. Oh right, the function is named as a method that's part of a class, so yes, adding @classmethod is necessary. 

Wait, the function is called workspace_manager and it's a method that takes cls, so the correct decorator is @classmethod. The user didn't mention that in the signature, but since it's a method using cls, that's implied. So the code should start with that decorator.

Putting it all together: the function is a class method that calls the _get_service method of the class with the ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER argument and returns the result. 

So the code would be:

@classmethod
def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

Wait, but in Python, when you use a class method, the method is bound to the class, so the code inside should call the service method. The problem is that ServiceName might be part of another module or class. However, since the user didn't specify, I can't import anything. They probably expect that ServiceName is already defined in the current context. 

I should also check if there's any other possible interpretation. The docstring says "via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()", so maybe the ServiceName is an enum, and WORKSPACE_MANAGER is one of its members. Therefore, passing that as the argument to _get_service is correct. 

I think that's all. The code is straightforward once you know how the service is being accessed. Just need to make sure the class method decorator is there and the correct argument is passed.
