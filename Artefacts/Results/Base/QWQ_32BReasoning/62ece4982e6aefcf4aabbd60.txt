Okay, I need to write a Python function called size_to_bytes that converts a human-readable string like '500K' into bytes. Let's see, the input is a string, and the output is an integer representing the bytes.

First, I should think about the possible formats of the input. The examples given are like '500K', so the string probably has a number followed by a unit suffix. The units could be K for kilobytes, M for megabytes, G for gigabytes, etc. Maybe also considering uppercase and lowercase, like 'k', 'M', or 'G'?

Hmm, the function needs to parse the string, separate the numeric part and the unit part. So maybe split the string into the numerical value and the unit. Let's think about how to do that. The unit is usually the last character, but sometimes there might be a 'B' at the end, like '500KB' or '500MB'. Wait, the example uses '500K', so maybe the 'B' is optional. Or perhaps the unit is just one character? Like K, M, G, etc. So perhaps the unit is the last character of the string, but I need to check if it's one of those.

Wait, the function's docstring says the input is like '500K', so the unit is a single character. So the input could have a number followed by a single unit character. So the first step is to extract the number and the unit.

So, perhaps the approach is to take the string, remove any non-numeric characters except the unit, but actually, the number can have digits and maybe a decimal point? Wait, the example is '500K', which is an integer. But maybe the function can handle fractions? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that the input is an integer with the unit.

So the plan is: process the input string to get the numeric part and the unit part. Then multiply the number by the appropriate factor based on the unit.

The units and their multipliers are:

- K → kilobyte = 1024 bytes
- M → megabyte = 1024^2 bytes
- G → gigabyte = 1024^3 bytes
- T → terabyte = 1024^4 bytes
- etc. But maybe the function only needs to handle up to a certain unit, like the common ones. The problem doesn't specify, but the example uses K, so perhaps the units are K, M, G, T, maybe even KB, MB, etc. Wait, but the example is '500K', so maybe the unit is just the last letter, and the 'B' is part of the unit but not necessary. Or perhaps the unit is a single character, so the function should take the last character as the unit, and the rest as the number.

Wait, maybe the string can have a 'B' at the end, like '500KB' or '500K'. So the unit is the last letter before the B, but maybe the B is just part of the unit and can be ignored. Wait, no, the unit is the letter that represents the size. For example, 'KB' would be kilobytes, but perhaps the function treats 'K' and 'KB' the same. So maybe we can just look for the last character that is a unit indicator, ignoring any 'B's after it?

Alternatively, perhaps the unit is the last non-numeric character. So the input can be '500K', '500KB', '500k', '500m', etc. So the steps are:

1. Split the string into the numerical part and the unit part. The unit is the last character (assuming it's one of the valid units). So for example, in '500K', the unit is 'K', and the number is 500. In '500KB', the unit would be 'B', but that's not correct. Wait, that's a problem. Because 'KB' is the unit, but the last character is 'B', which is part of the unit abbreviation. So perhaps the unit is the last letter before the 'B'? Or maybe the 'B' is part of the unit, so the actual unit is the preceding letter. So in '500KB', the unit is 'K', and the 'B' is just part of the abbreviation but doesn't affect the multiplier. So the function should process the unit as the first non-numeric character from the end, excluding the 'B'?

Hmm, maybe the correct approach is to extract the unit as the last alphabetic character. Let me think. Let's see, the problem says the input is like '500K', so maybe the unit is always a single character, and the 'B' is part of the unit but not needed. So perhaps, the unit is the last character that's a letter, but the 'B' is part of the unit. Wait, perhaps the unit is the last letter, but if the last letter is 'B', then the unit is the previous one. Wait, that complicates things. Maybe the better way is to look for the unit as the last letter before any 'B's. Or just take the last non-digit character?

Alternatively, the function could check for the presence of a unit in the string. Let me think of possible cases. The string could be '500', which would be bytes. So if there's no unit, it's just bytes. So the function needs to handle that.

So the steps would be:

- Iterate over the string from the end to find the unit. The unit is the first non-numeric character (excluding possible 'B'? Or including it?)

Wait, perhaps the unit is the last letter (regardless of case). Let's see:

Take the input string, and separate the number and the unit. The unit is the last character, but it might be uppercase or lowercase. For example, '500k' would be 500*1024.

So, first, process the string to extract the number part and the unit. Let's think of the string as consisting of a number followed by a unit. The unit is one character, except for cases where it's written with 'B' like 'KB', but in that case, the unit is 'K' because the 'B' is part of the abbreviation for bytes. So maybe the unit is the last non-digit character before the end. So the approach is to split the string into the numeric part and the unit.

Wait, perhaps the unit is the last character of the string. Let me see. For example, '500K' → 'K', '500KB' → 'B', but that would be a problem because 'B' is the base unit. So maybe in that case, the unit is the character before the 'B'? Hmm, but that's a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, the function can consider that the unit is the last letter that is not a digit or decimal point. So, for example, in '500KB', the 'K' is the unit, and the 'B' is part of the unit's name but not part of the actual unit. So the function should ignore the 'B' at the end if it's there. Wait, but how do I handle that?

Maybe the correct way is to remove any 'B' at the end of the string, then take the last character as the unit. Because 'KB' and 'K' both mean kilobytes. So, first, we can process the string by stripping off the trailing 'B' if present. Wait, but that's only if the last character is 'B'? Like '500K' would be the same as '500KB'? The problem's example uses '500K', so perhaps the 'B' is optional. So the unit is determined by the character before any trailing 'B's?

Alternatively, perhaps the unit is the last non-digit character. So in '500KB', the 'K' is the unit. So how to split the string into the numeric part and the unit.

So here's an approach:

Loop through the characters of the string from the end until we find a non-digit, non-decimal point character. That would be the unit. But maybe the unit is only one of the letters K, M, G, T, etc. So perhaps the unit is the last character that is a letter. So the steps are:

- Find the position of the last letter in the string (like K, M, G, etc). The part before that is the numeric value, and the letter is the unit.

Wait, but the letters could be uppercase or lowercase. So perhaps we should make the unit case-insensitive. So 'k' is the same as 'K'.

So, first, process the string to find the unit. Let's go through each character from the end, until we hit a non-digit (and not a decimal point). The first such character is the unit. For example:

In '500K', the last character is 'K' → unit is 'K'

In '500KB', the last character is 'B', but that's not a unit (since the units are K, M, G, etc), so we look back until we find a letter that's part of the unit. So the 'K' is the unit here.

Wait, but how do we determine that? Maybe the units are only K, M, G, T, P, etc. So the valid units are those letters, and the 'B' can be ignored if it's part of the string. So the approach is:

- Remove any trailing 'B' (case-insensitive?) so that 'KB' becomes 'K', 'MB' becomes 'M', etc. So first, check if the last character is 'B' or 'b', and if so, remove it, then take the previous character as the unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the unit is the last character before the 'B' if it's present. So, for example, '500KB' → the unit is 'K', '500MB' → 'M', and '500B' → unit is 'B'? But 'B' by itself would mean bytes, so maybe '500B' is 500 bytes, but then the function would return 500. But in that case, if the input is '500', it's also bytes. So perhaps 'B' is the base unit and if present, it's the unit. So maybe the steps are:

- Split the string into the numeric part and the unit part. The unit is the last character (if it is a letter), but if the last character is 'B', then perhaps check the one before it. Wait, maybe the unit is the last letter before any trailing 'B's. So in '500KB', the unit is 'K', and in '500B', the unit is 'B'.

But how to handle that? Let's think of the string as the number followed by the unit, which can be one of the letters K, M, G, etc. The 'B' is part of the unit abbreviation but not part of the actual unit. So perhaps the correct way is to process the string as follows:

Take the entire string, and iterate from the end backwards. The first non-numeric character is the unit. But we have to check if that character is part of the valid units. The valid units are K, M, G, T, P, etc. (each representing 2^10, 2^20, etc). But 'B' is also a possible unit (for bytes), but in that case, the string would be like '500B'?

Wait, the problem says 'human readable' so perhaps the 'B' is part of the unit's name. For example, '500KB' is 500 kilobytes, so the unit is K. So the function should ignore the trailing 'B' when determining the unit.

Hmm, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Check the last character of the string. If it's a 'B' or 'b', then we can remove it, then check the next last character. So for example, '500KB' becomes '500K', then the unit is K. Similarly, '500MB' becomes '500M'.

2. If the last character is a letter (other than B?), then that's the unit.

Wait, but maybe the unit could be 'B' (like 500 bytes). So in that case, the input would be '500B', but that's a bit redundant. But maybe the function should handle it. So, the 'B' is a valid unit (meaning bytes), but when the unit is 'B', the multiplier is 1.

So the plan is:

- Remove any trailing 'B's (case-insensitive) so that the unit is the preceding character.

Wait, but how to do that? Let me think of code steps.

First, the string can be stripped of whitespace, perhaps. Let's assume that the input has no leading or trailing spaces except maybe in cases like ' 500 K ', but the docstring example doesn't include that, so maybe the function can assume that the input is properly formatted with no whitespace except possibly between the number and the unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should process the string to remove any non-numeric characters except the unit. Wait, but perhaps the code can process the string as follows:

Take the input string, and split into parts where the unit is the last letter (before any 'B' perhaps). Let's see.

Let me think of the code steps:

Let's process the string:

- Iterate over the string from the end backwards until we find a non-digit and non '.' character. That will be the unit.

Wait, but the unit can be uppercase or lowercase. So, first, we can process the string to find the unit:

Loop over the characters in reversed order. The first character that is not a digit (0-9) or a decimal point is the unit. So for example:

In '500K', the last non-digit is 'K'

In '500.5K', the decimal is allowed, so the unit is 'K'

In '500KB', the last non-digit is 'B', but since 'B' is a unit? Or not. Wait, the problem says that the example is '500K', so perhaps the 'B' is part of the unit but the actual unit is K. So perhaps we need to check if the unit is 'B' then the multiplier is 1, but otherwise, other letters are the units. Wait, but 'KB' is the abbreviation for kilobytes, so the actual unit is K, and the B is part of the abbreviation. So in that case, the code should ignore the 'B' and look for the preceding character.

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to split the string into two parts: the number part and the unit part. So the unit is the last letter that is not a digit or a decimal point. Let me see.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

- Take the string and split it into the numeric part and the unit by finding the last occurrence of a unit character (like K, M, G, etc). So, first, find the index of the last non-numeric character (excluding the decimal point?), and then separate the parts.

Wait, perhaps we can process the string as follows:

Loop through each character in the string from the end towards the start until we find a character that is not a digit or a decimal point. That character is the unit. So for '500KB', the last non-digit is 'B', but since 'B' is a unit (bytes?), but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps 'KB' is considered as the unit being 'K' (since the 'B' is part of the abbreviation). So maybe the code should consider that the unit is the first non-numeric character when reading from the end, but if that's 'B', then perhaps look back one more character? Or maybe the 'B' is part of the unit's name but not part of the actual unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the unit is the last alphabetic character in the string. So in '500KB', the last alphabetic is 'B', but that's not a valid unit except for bytes. Wait, but in that case, the code would treat 'KB' as bytes, which is wrong. So perhaps the valid units are K, M, G, T, etc., and the 'B' is part of the unit abbreviation but not part of the actual unit.

Hmm, maybe the correct way is to split the string into two parts. The unit is the last character, but if the last character is 'B', then perhaps the unit is the previous character. Wait, but how do we know that the previous character is part of the unit?

Alternatively, the function can look for the unit as the last letter (case-insensitive) that is one of the valid units (K, M, G, T, P, etc). So, perhaps the code can process the string by checking each suffix:

We can loop through the string from the end backwards, and check if the last character is a valid unit. If not, then check the previous character(s). For example:

Take the input string, and check the last character. If it's a valid unit (like K, M, G, etc), then that's the unit. Otherwise, if it's a 'B', then check the previous character. Because 'KB' is a valid unit (K), but 'B' alone would mean bytes.

Wait, perhaps the code can work as follows:

1. Remove all characters except the number and the unit. Or, more precisely, find the unit part.

2. Let's process the string to find the unit. Start from the end of the string and go backwards until we find a character that is a letter. The first such character is the unit. So for '500KB', the last letter is 'B', but since 'B' is a unit (bytes), then that would be the unit. But that's conflicting with the example where '500K' is 512000. So perhaps the 'B' is not considered a unit here. Wait, but the example shows that '500K' is 500 * 1024. So the 'B' is part of the abbreviation but the unit is K. So in '500KB', the unit is K, but the code would have to look for the first non-numeric before the B.

Hmm, maybe the code can process the string by first trimming any trailing 'B's (case-insensitive), then the last character is the unit. So for example:

input_str = size.strip().upper()

Then, process the input_str:

if the last character is 'B', then we can remove it and check the new last character. So for '500KB' → becomes '500K', then the unit is 'K'.

But for '500B', after removing the 'B', the string becomes '500', so the unit is none, so it would be treated as bytes (so 500 bytes). Wait, but then '500B' would become 500, but perhaps that's the case where the unit is B, which is bytes. So maybe the code should first check if the last character is a B, but then see if the previous character is part of a unit. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, here's a better approach: the unit is the last alphabetic character in the string, but we can ignore the 'B' if it's the last character. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Let me consider possible cases:

Case 1: '500K' → unit is K → 500 * 1024

Case 2: '500KB' → unit is K → same as above

Case 3: '500M' → M → 500 * 1024^2

Case 4: '500MB' → M → same as above

Case 5: '500' → no unit → 500 bytes.

Case 6: '500b' → the unit is 'b', but that's bytes, so 500 * 1 → 500?

Wait, but if the input is '500B', then the 'B' is the unit. So the code would need to handle that. So perhaps the 'B' is a valid unit (for bytes), but in that case, the value would just be the number. But in the example given, '500K' is treated as kilobytes. So perhaps the 'B' is part of the unit's name but not part of the unit code. So the code would consider that the unit is the letter before the 'B' if it exists.

Alternatively, the code can first check if the last character is 'B', then look at the previous character. So:

Take the input string, convert to uppercase (to handle case insensitivity). Then, check the last character. If it's 'B', then the unit is the previous character (if any). If the previous character is also a digit, then maybe the unit is 'B' (bytes). Wait, no, that might not work. Let me think of code.

Alternatively, here's a possible way:

Extract the unit part by taking the last character of the string. But if that character is 'B', then check the one before it. So, for example:

input_str = '500KB' → upper → '500KB'

last_char = 'B'

since it's 'B', then check the previous character which is 'K', so unit is K.

So the code can do something like:

number_part = ''
unit = ''
for c in reversed(input_str):
    if c.isdigit() or c == '.':
        number_part = c + number_part
    else:
        unit = c.upper()
        break

Wait, but that would take the first non-digit when going from the end. For '500KB', the reversed string is 'BK0005'. The first non-digit is 'K', but wait, let's see:

Wait, reversed('500KB') would be each character in reverse order. Let's see the original string: '5', '0', '0', 'K', 'B'. Reversed would be B, K, 0, 0, 5. So the first non-digit (other than '.' perhaps) would be 'B', but since we need to check if it's part of a unit, perhaps the code should check whether the unit is valid. So:

After getting the unit (the first non-digit character from the end), if the unit is 'B', then perhaps we have to check the next previous character. Wait, maybe not. Let's think:

Suppose the input is '500B', then the code would get 'B' as the unit. But 'B' is a valid unit (bytes), so the value is 500. So that's okay.

But for '500KB', the unit would be 'B' first, but since 'B' is not a valid unit (except for bytes), but the previous character is 'K', which is a valid unit. So perhaps the code should look for the first non-numeric character from the end, and if that's 'B', then check the previous character. So, here's an idea:

Initialize unit as the last character. If that is 'B', then check the previous character (the one before the last). So:

Take the input_str, which is the original string converted to uppercase and stripped of whitespace.

Check the last character. If it is 'B', then check the second last character. If that is a valid unit (like K, M, etc), then the unit is that character. Otherwise, the unit is 'B'.

Wait, but how do we handle that?

Alternatively, here's a code plan:

1. Strip any whitespace from the input string and convert to uppercase.

2. Find the unit by checking the last character. If it's a valid unit (like K, M, etc), then use it. Otherwise, check if the last two characters form a unit like 'KB', 'MB', etc. But perhaps it's better to split the string into the number and unit parts.

Another approach: split the string into the numeric part and the unit part by looking for the first non-numeric character starting from the end. So, for example, in '500KB', the non-numeric characters are 'K' and 'B'. Starting from the end, the first non-numeric is 'B', but since 'B' is part of the unit, but maybe the actual unit is 'K', we need to check if the 'B' is the unit (bytes) or part of a larger unit.

Hmm, perhaps the code can iterate through the string from the end until a non-numeric character is found. Then, if that character is 'B', we can check if there is a previous non-numeric character. But this could get a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can take the entire string, remove any trailing 'B's, then take the last character as the unit. So:

stripped = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')

then, the unit is the last character of stripped, if it exists. The number is the part before that.

Wait, let's see examples:

Original input: '500K' → stripped becomes '500K' → unit is 'K'

Original '500KB' → stripped becomes '500K' → unit is 'K'

Original '500MB' → stripped becomes '500M' → unit 'M'

Original '500B' → stripped becomes '500' (since we remove the B), so there's no unit → so the unit is 'B'?

Wait no. Because in that case, the stripped string would be '500', so the last character is a digit. So perhaps the unit is determined by the last non-digit character in the original string.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of the steps again.

The function needs to parse the input string. The unit is the last alphabetic character, but the 'B' at the end can be part of the unit abbreviation. So perhaps the code can process the string to find the unit as follows:

- Iterate over the string from the end backwards until we find a non-numeric (and non '.' for decimals) character. The first such character is the unit. But then, if that unit is 'B', perhaps check if there was a previous unit.

Wait, maybe the code can be written as:

num_str = ''
unit = ''
for c in reversed(size):
    if c.isdigit() or c == '.':
        num_str = c + num_str
    else:
        unit = c.upper()
        break
if unit == 'B':
    # then maybe check if there was a previous unit?
    # Wait, no, 'B' would mean bytes, so perhaps the code should treat 'B' as the unit, but in that case, the input was like '500B' → 500 bytes. But '500KB' would have 'K' as the unit because the B is part of the abbreviation. Wait, in the reversed loop of '500KB', the first non-digit is 'B', then the next non-digit is 'K'. So in that case, the code would have unit 'B' which is wrong. So this approach is not working.

Hmm, perhaps the code should first check if the string ends with 'KB', 'MB', etc. So, perhaps split the string into parts where the unit is the last letter before any trailing 'B's?

Alternatively, here's a better idea: The unit is the last non-digit character in the string, except if that is a '.' (for decimal points). So, for example, in '500KB', the non-digit characters are 'K' and 'B', so the last non-digit is 'B', but that's part of the unit abbreviation. Wait, but that's the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should consider that the unit is the first non-digit character when scanning from the end, but if that is 'B', then the code checks if the previous character is also a unit. Wait, perhaps the 'B' is part of the unit, but the actual unit is the preceding character. So, perhaps in the case where the last character is 'B', then the unit is the previous character (if it's a valid unit), otherwise, the unit is 'B' (so bytes). 

Alternatively, maybe the code can split the string into two parts, the numeric part and the unit, by finding the first non-numeric character from the end that is not a 'B'. But that might not be the best way.

Wait, perhaps the code can process the string by removing any trailing 'B's (case insensitive), then split into the numeric and unit parts. Let me try this approach.

Let's first process the input string:

size_str = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')

Then, the unit is the last character of this stripped string. The number is everything before that.

Wait, let's see examples:

Original input '500K' → stripped to '500K' → last character K. So unit is K, number is 500 → correct.

Original '500KB' → stripped becomes '500K' → same as above.

Original '500MB' → becomes '500M' → unit M.

Original '500B' → stripping the B gives '500' → so there's no unit, so the unit is empty. So in that case, the code would treat it as bytes (so return 500).

Original '500' → same as above, so return 500.

Original '500.5K' → stripping the B (but there is none), so '500.5K' → last character K. So unit is K, number is 500.5 → which would be 500.5 * 1024 → okay.

Another example, '1.5G' → becomes '1.5G' → unit G, so 1.5 * 1024^3.

What about '500KiB'? That's a different unit, but perhaps the function only handles K, M, G, etc. The problem's example uses 'K' so maybe we can ignore the 'i' in 'KiB'. So the function might not handle those cases, only the single letter units.

So, perhaps the code can first process the string by stripping any trailing 'B's (case-insensitive), then take the last character as the unit. That way, 'KB' becomes 'K', 'MB' becomes 'M', etc.

So:

size_upper = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')

Then, split the string into the numeric part and the unit. The unit is the last character of size_upper. The numeric part is everything before that.

But how to split?

Take the size_upper, and find the last character that is a letter. Let's see:

unit_part = size_upper[-1:]

number_part = size_upper[:-1]

But if the size_upper is empty, then that's an error. Also, if the unit_part is not a valid unit (like if the input was '500'), then the unit_part would be the last character (but there are none, so the number_part is the entire string, and the unit is empty, so the multiplier is 1).

Wait, let's see:

If the input is '500', then after stripping, size_upper is '500', which has no letters. So, unit_part would be an empty string, so the unit is none → so it's bytes. So that's okay.

Another example: '500MB' → stripped becomes '500M', so unit is 'M', number is '500'.

But what if the input is '500MBB'? Stripping the B's gives '500M', so that's okay.

So, the steps would be:

1. Convert the input string to uppercase and remove trailing 'B's and whitespace.

2. Check if the resulting string has any letters. If not, then the unit is 'B' (bytes), so the number is the entire string, and multiply by 1.

3. Else, split the string into the numeric part and the unit part. The unit is the last character. The numeric part is everything before that.

Wait, but how do I check if there is a letter in the string?

Wait, after stripping, if the length is zero, it's an error. Otherwise, if the last character is a letter (like K, M, etc), then that is the unit. Otherwise, perhaps the entire string is the number, and the unit is empty → so bytes.

Wait, perhaps the code can do:

stripped = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')

if not stripped:  # in case it was just 'B's? Not likely, but handle edge case.

But normally, stripped would have the numeric part plus the unit.

So, the last character of stripped is the unit. Let's see:

Take the stripped string. The unit is the last character. The numeric part is the string up to that.

So:

unit = stripped[-1]

number_str = stripped[:-1]

But if stripped is length 1, then unit is stripped[0], and the number_str is empty? That can't be. So for example, if the input is 'KB', after stripping, it's 'K', so unit 'K', but the number_str is empty. So that would be an error.

Hmm, so the code needs to handle cases where the number is empty. So perhaps first, check that the stripped string is not empty, and that the numeric part is a valid number.

So, first, the code can process the input:

size_str = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')

if not size_str:

    raise ValueError("Invalid input")

Then, check if the last character is a letter. Let's see:

unit = size_str[-1] if size_str[-1].isalpha() else ''

Wait, no, perhaps the unit is the last character if it's a letter. So:

unit_char = size_str[-1]

if unit_char not in ['K', 'M', 'G', 'T', 'P', 'E']:

    # then it's not a unit, so the entire stripped string is the number, and unit is empty?

Wait, but what if the unit is something like 'B'? Like '500B' → stripped becomes '500', so the unit is empty, so we treat as bytes. Which is correct.

Wait, but '500B' → after stripping, the 'B' is removed, so the number is 500, and the unit is none → so the function would return 500 bytes, which is correct.

Wait, but in that case, the original '500B' would become 500, but the unit is none. So that's okay, because the unit is 'B' but the code is treating the absence of unit as 'B'?

Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the original '500B' → stripping the B gives '500', so the unit is empty. So the code would treat it as bytes, but the number is 500. So the result is 500 bytes, which is correct. Because '500B' would mean 500 bytes.

But the code would need to check if the unit is present. So:

if unit_char is a valid unit (like K, M, etc), then proceed. Else, the unit is empty, so the entire string is the number.

Wait, but how to get the unit?

So, let's process the size_str variable:

unit_part = ''

number_part = ''

if size_str[-1].isalpha():

    unit_part = size_str[-1]

    number_part = size_str[:-1]

else:

    # no unit, so the entire string is the number, and unit is empty (bytes)

    number_part = size_str

    unit_part = ''

But then, how to check if the unit_part is a valid unit?

We can have a dictionary mapping the unit characters to their multipliers:

units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}

Wait, but what about 'B' as the unit? Because if the input was like '500', then the unit is empty, so it's bytes. So perhaps the default is 1.

So, the code would be:

if unit_part:

    multiplier = units.get(unit_part, 1) 

Wait, no. Wait, the units would have K as 1024, M as 1024^2, etc, and the default is 1 (so if the unit is not in the dictionary, it's treated as bytes). But in that case, if someone inputs '500X', then it would be treated as 500 bytes, which is an error. So perhaps the function should raise an error if the unit is not in the dictionary.

Wait, but the docstring says the function returns the size in bytes. So perhaps it's better to check if the unit is valid. So, if the unit_part is not in the units dictionary, then raise an error?

Hmm, but the problem statement's example uses '500K', so maybe the function should accept any of the common units. Let me see what the standard units are. Typically, K is kilo (1024), M is mega (1024^2), G is giga, etc. So the code can check if the unit is in the units list, otherwise, it's invalid.

So steps:

- Process the input to get stripped_str (size_str).

- Check if the last character is a letter. If so, the unit is that letter, else, no unit (so bytes).

Wait, but in the case of '500KB', after stripping, it becomes '500K', so unit is K. So that works.

Another example: '500B' → stripping gives '500', so unit is none, so it's bytes. So 500 bytes.

So, the code would need to split into number_part and unit_part as above.

Then, check if unit_part is in the units dict. If not, then it's an error. Wait, but what if the unit is empty (meaning bytes)? So the default is to use 1.

Wait, here's a possible code outline:

stripped_str = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')

if not stripped_str:

    raise ValueError("Invalid input")

unit = stripped_str[-1] if stripped_str[-1].isalpha() else ''

number_str = stripped_str[:-1] if unit else stripped_str

if unit:

    if unit not in units:

        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")

    multiplier = units[unit]

else:

    multiplier = 1

Then, parse the number_str as a float (or integer?), then multiply by the multiplier.

Wait, but number_str can be empty? Like if the stripped_str was 'K', then unit is 'K', and number_str is stripped_str[:-1] → which is empty. So the number would be 0? Which is invalid. So the function should check that the number_str is a valid number.

So, putting this together:

First, process the stripped_str.

Then, split into number_str and unit.

Check that unit is valid (if it's present).

Then, parse the number_str to a float (since could have decimals like '1.5K').

Multiply by the multiplier.

Wait, but the input is given as a string. So the code can do:

After getting the number_str, we can convert it to a float. But if it's empty, then that's invalid. So:

number = float(number_str)

But in cases where the number_str is empty, that would be a ValueError, so the function should handle that.

So, the code steps:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:

    size_upper = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')

    if not size_upper:

        raise ValueError("Invalid input")

    unit = ''

    if size_upper[-1].isalpha():

        unit = size_upper[-1]

        num_str = size_upper[:-1]

    else:

        num_str = size_upper

        unit = ''

    if not num_str:  # like input was 'KB' → stripped_str is 'K', so num_str is empty. So invalid.

        raise ValueError("Invalid number")

    try:

        number = float(num_str)

    except ValueError:

        raise ValueError("Invalid number")

    units_dict = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}

    if unit and unit not in units_dict:

        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")

    multiplier = units_dict.get(unit, 1)

    return int(number * multiplier)

Wait, but let's test this code with some examples:

Test case '500K':

stripped_str is '500K'

unit is 'K', num_str is '500'

number is 500.0 → 500 * 1024 → 512000 → correct.

Test case '500KB':

stripped_str is '500K' → same as above → correct.

Test case '500M':

stripped_str is '500M' → unit 'M' → 500 * 1024^2 → correct.

Test case '500B':

stripped_str is '500' → unit is '' → so multiplier 1 → 500 *1 → correct.

Test case '500' → same as above → correct.

Test case '1.5G':

stripped_str is '1.5G' → unit 'G' → 1.5 * 1024^3 → correct.

Test case '1.5GB':

stripped_str becomes '1.5G' → same.

Edge case 'KB' → stripped_str is 'K', so num_str is empty → raises ValueError "Invalid number".

Another edge case '500Kb' → after upper and stripping B, becomes '500K' → okay.

What about '500MB' → becomes '500M' → correct.

What about '500.5K' → stripped_str '500.5K' → unit 'K', num_str '500.5' → 500.5 * 1024 → returns the integer? Wait, the function returns an int. So 500.5 * 1024 would be 512032, but as a float, but converting to integer. So maybe the function should return an integer, so the code can cast to int.

Wait, but what if the number has a decimal part, like '1.5K' → 1.5 * 1024 = 1536 → correct.

Another case: '500KiB' → the stripped_str would be '500KIB' → wait, no, the code rstrips 'B', so '500KiB' → upper is '500KIB' → rstrip('B') gives '500KI' (since the 'B' is at the end). Then, the last character is 'I', which is a letter but not in the units_dict. So that would raise an error.

So the code would reject 'KiB' as an invalid unit, which is correct.

Another test case: '500X' → stripped_str is '500X', unit is 'X', which is not in the dict → error.

So, this seems okay.

Now, handling the case where the unit is 'B' → but in the code, the 'B' is stripped from the end. So '500B' becomes '500', so unit is empty → treated as bytes. So that's okay.

What about '500KB' → stripped becomes '500K', so unit 'K', correct.

Now, what about '500MB' → same as '500M'.

Another test case: '500' → returns 500 *1 → correct.

Now, what about '500K' → correct.

Now, what about '500' → correct.

Now, the code also needs to handle leading or trailing whitespace in the input. For example, ' 500 K ' → stripped becomes '500K', so it's okay.

Now, what about the unit being at the end but not followed by B? Like '500K' → correct.

What about the unit is part of a longer string? Like '500KB' → which works.

Now, the code uses float, so it can handle decimals. The function returns an int, so it will convert to integer, which is correct.

So putting all this into code.

Wait, but in code, the 'rstrip' is case-sensitive. Because the code converts to uppercase first. So in the example '500KB' → after upper becomes '500KB', then rstrip('B') removes the 'B' → '500K'.

Yes.

But the original 'KB' is in lowercase? The code converts to uppercase first, so that's okay.

So the code would look like:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1048576, 'G': 1073741824, 'T': 1099511627776, 'P': 1125899906842624, 'E': 1152921504606846976}
    size_upper = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')
    if not size_upper:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    unit = ''
    num_str = ''
    if size_upper[-1].isalpha():
        unit = size_upper[-1]
        num_str = size_upper[:-1]
    else:
        num_str = size_upper
    if not num_str:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    multiplier = units.get(unit, 1)
    return int(number * multiplier)

Wait, but let's check for the case where the unit is 'K', but the num_str is empty. Like the input ' K ' → stripped becomes 'K', then unit is 'K', num_str is empty → which would throw an error. That's correct.

Another case: '500' → returns 500 * 1 → correct.

Now, what about '500.5K' → num_str is '500.5', unit 'K' → 500.5 * 1024 → 512032 → correct.

Now, the units dictionary can be written as:

units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}

But in code, 1024**2 is 1048576, so that's okay. So using exponents would be better. So perhaps better to compute them as 1024 ** (exponent), so the code can do:

units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}

Yes.

Now, let's code this.

Wait, but in the code, the 'rstrip' is done on the uppercase string, so the 'B' is stripped regardless of case. So that's okay.

Another edge case: '500KB' → stripped_str is '500K', so unit is 'K', num_str is '500' → okay.

Another case: '500b' → stripped_str is '500' → unit is empty, so returns 500.

Wait, but '500b' → the 'b' is lowercase, but after upper it's '500B', then rstrip('B') leaves '500', so unit is empty. So that's correct.

What about '500k' → becomes '500K', so unit is K → correct.

Now, what about '500' → no unit → returns 500 bytes.

What about '500k' → 500 * 1024 → correct.

Now, what if the input is '500Kb' → stripping 'B' would leave '500K', so unit is K, correct.

So that code should handle the cases. Also, the code raises errors for invalid inputs.

Wait, but in the code, the 'unit' is determined from the last character of the stripped_str. So in '500K', the stripped_str is '500K' → the last character is K, so unit is K.

But what about a string like '500KB' → the code works as before.

Another case: '500MB' → stripped becomes '500M', so unit is M.

Now, the code uses the 'units' dictionary. Let me check:

For unit 'K', multiplier is 1024. So correct.

Now, what about leading zeros or other invalid numbers? The code tries to parse the num_str as a float. So '0500K' → stripped_str is '0500K' → num_str is '0500' → which is 500.0 → okay. But if the input is something like '500Kg', then stripped_str would be '500K' (since 'g' is part of the unit? Wait, no. Let's see:

input '500Kg' → after upper becomes '500KG', then rstrip('B') → '500KG' (since 'G' is not B). Then the last character is 'G', so unit is G. The num_str is '500K' → but 'K' is a letter. Wait, that would be a problem here. Because the num_str would be '500K' → which is invalid because K is part of the unit. Wait, so in that case, the code would have:

size_upper = '500KG' → then after rstrip('B'), since 'G' is not B, the rstrip doesn't remove anything. So the last character is 'G', so unit is G, num_str is '500K' → which is not a number. So the 'float(num_str)' would fail, and the code raises "Invalid number".

Which is correct, because '500K' is part of the number? No, the unit is G, so the number_str would be '500K', which is invalid. So the code would correctly raise an error.

Another example, '500K' → correct.

Now, what about '500.5MB' → becomes '500.5M' → unit is M, num_str is '500.5' → okay.

Now, the code returns an int, so even if the number is a float, like 1.5 * 1024^3 → it would return the integer part? Wait no, because 1.5 * 1024^3 is 1.5 * 1073741824 → which is 1610612736, so converting to int is okay.

Wait, but in Python, float(1.5) is precise, so when multiplied by 1024^3 and cast to int, it gives the correct integer.

So that's okay.

Now, the code needs to handle the case where the unit is not present (so return the number as bytes).

Another case: '500' → returns 500.

Now, code structure. The function starts with the units dict. Then processes the input string.

Wait, but the code can be written more concisely. Let me see:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}
    s = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')
    if not s:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    if s[-1].isalpha():
        num_str = s[:-1]
        unit = s[-1]
    else:
        num_str = s
        unit = ''
    if not num_str:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    return int(number * units.get(unit, 1))

Wait, this is more concise. Let me see.

Yes, that code should work.

Testing the code with '500K' → s is '500K', last char is K (alpha). So num_str is '500', unit K. 500 * 1024 → 512000 → correct.

For '500B' → s becomes '500', then since last character is not alpha, unit is empty. So num_str is '500' → 500 *1 → correct.

For '500' → same as above → correct.

For '500.5K' → s is '500.5K', so unit K, num_str '500.5' → correct.

What about '500K' → same as first case.

Now, what about '500KB' → s is '500K', so unit K → correct.

What if the input is '500KBb' → stripping the trailing B's (since s is uppercase, rstrip('B') would remove all B's at the end. So '500KBb' becomes '500KB' → upper becomes '500KB', then rstrip 'B's → '500K' → correct.

Another case: '500MB' → becomes '500M' → correct.

What about '500.5' → returns 500.5 as a float → but multiplied by 1 → so 500.5 → but the function returns an int, so that would be 500?

Wait, no. Because the code converts to float, then multiplies by the unit's multiplier (1 in this case), then returns as an int. So '500.5' → the float is 500.5 → multiplied by 1 → 500.5 → cast to int gives 500. But that's a problem because the user might have intended to have a fractional number, but since the function returns an int, it would lose the decimal part. So, perhaps the function should return the integer, so even if the number is fractional, like 1.5K, the code returns 1536 (correct), but 500.5 becomes 500.5 → cast to int gives 500, but that's not correct. Wait, but the function's return type is int, so perhaps it's okay. Because in human-readable terms, sometimes you have fractions but the actual bytes must be an integer. Or maybe the input is expected to be an integer. The problem's example uses '500K', which is an integer. The docstring says the input is a string like '500K', but perhaps fractions are allowed. So the code is correct in that.

Wait, but in the code, '500.5' would be parsed as a float, 500.5 → multiplied by 1 → 500.5 → cast to int gives 500. But that's a loss of precision. However, the problem's docstring says to return an int, so perhaps that's acceptable. Because bytes are integers, so the function should return an integer. So fractional numbers like 1.5K are okay (since 1.5 * 1024 is an integer), but 500.5 would become 500.5 → 500.5 is not an integer, but the function would return 500.5 as a float, but then cast to int → so 500.

Hmm, but perhaps the function should require that the number is an integer? The problem's example uses an integer, but the docstring doesn't specify. The function signature says the return is an int, so maybe it's okay to return the integer part. But perhaps it should raise an error if the number isn't an integer when there is no unit?

Wait, the code uses float(num_str), so even if the input is '500.5', it would parse as 500.5 → multiply by 1 → 500.5 → int gives 500. But maybe the user intended to have 500.5 bytes? But bytes are whole numbers. So perhaps it's okay to return the integer part, but maybe the function should accept decimal numbers even for bytes. For example, '1.5' → that's 1.5 bytes, but in reality, you can't have half a byte, but the function's docstring says to return an int, so perhaps it's acceptable to return the integer value. Or maybe the function expects that the input is a valid number for the unit. Like, when the unit is K, the number can be a float, but when there is no unit, it's bytes, so the number must be integer? Not sure. The problem's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the code is okay as written.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should only accept integer values except for the case where the unit is present. Hmm, but that complicates things. Let me see what the problem expects. The example uses '500K' → which is an integer. But the code allows for decimal numbers. So I think it's okay.

So the code as written seems to handle all cases.

Now, possible edge cases:

Test case '0K' → 0 * 1024 → 0. Correct.

Test case '0KB' → same as '0K' → correct.

Test case '0' → 0 bytes → correct.

Test case '1234' → returns 1234.

Test case '1234.5K' → 1234.5 * 1024 → which is 1264, 320? Let me compute 1234.5 * 1024 = 1234.5 * 1024 → 1234.5 * 1024 = 1234 * 1024 = 1,264,  1234 * 1024 is 1264,  1234.5 * 1024 = 1234.5 * 1024 = 1234 * 1024 + 0.5 * 1024 → 1264,  512 → total 1265536? So when cast to int, it would be correct.

Now, what about invalid units like '500Z'? The stripped_str would be '500Z', so unit is 'Z', which is not in the units dict → error.

Another invalid case: '500KX' → stripped_str is '500KX' → last character is X (alpha). So unit is X, but the num_str is '500K' → which is invalid because 'K' is part of the unit. So in the num_str, '500K' can't be parsed as a float → error.

So the code should handle that.

Now, what about the unit being before the B? Like '500b' → becomes '500', so unit is empty → correct.

Another case: '500kb' → becomes '500K' → unit K → correct.

So the code seems to handle all that.

Now, in the code, the 'units' dictionary is defined inside the function. That's okay.

Now, the code's structure:

First, process the string to get s (stripped and uppercase, with trailing B removed).

Then check if s is empty → invalid.

Then split into unit and num_str based on the last character being alpha.

Then check that num_str is not empty → otherwise, invalid.

Parse the number → if not possible, invalid.

Check that the unit is known → else error.

Multiply and return as int.

Yes.

Now, let's code this properly, handling all steps.

Wait, in the code, after getting s, if the last character is alpha, then unit is s[-1], and num_str is s[:-1]. But what if the s is like '500K' → that's okay.

Wait, but in '500K', s is '500K', so unit is 'K', num_str is '500' → correct.

Another example '500Kg' → s would be '500KG' → after rstrip('B'), since the last character is G (not B), so s remains '500KG'. Then the code checks if last character is alpha → yes, so unit is G, and num_str is '500K' → which has a 'K', so when parsed as a float, it's invalid. So the code would raise an error on the float conversion, which is correct.

So that's handled.

Another case: '500K' → correct.

Now, what about the case where the unit is not at the end, but in the middle? Like '500Kb' → but the code would process the 'b' as part of the trailing B. So '500Kb' → upper becomes '500KB', then rstrip('B') gives '500K' → correct.

So the code works.

Now, let's write the code exactly as per this logic.

Wait, in the code:

The units dictionary is defined as:

units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}

But in code, exponents can be calculated as 1024 ** exponent.

Alternatively, the code can use exponents:

units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}

Yes.

Now, the code:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}
    s = size.strip().upper().rstrip('B')
    if not s:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input")
    if s[-1].isalpha():
        num_str = s[:-1]
        unit = s[-1]
    else:
        num_str = s
        unit = ''
    if not num_str:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    return int(number * units.get(unit, 1))

Wait, but the code uses the 'get' method with default 1, so if unit is empty, it uses 1. So that's correct.

But in the case where the unit is present but not in the dictionary (like '500X'), then the code raises an error. So that's okay.

Testing the code:

Test case '500K' → returns 500 * 1024 → 512000 → correct.

Test case '500KB' → same as '500K' → correct.

Test case '500' → returns 500 → correct.

Test case '500.5M' → stripped_str is '500.5M' → unit M → num_str '500.5' → 500.5 * 1024^2 → 500.5 * 1048576 = 526,  let's see: 1024^2 is 1048576. 500.5 * 1048576 = 524,  800.5 * 1048576 → wait, 500.5 * 1048576 = 525, 312, 800? Maybe the code can handle that correctly.

Edge case '1.5K' → 1.5 * 1024 → 1536 → correct.

Edge case '500.5' → returns 500.5 → cast to int is 500 → but the function expects bytes, so perhaps it's okay. The user might have intended to have a non-integer when using a unit, but without a unit, the input must be an integer?

Well, the problem's docstring says the input is a string like '500K', so maybe the code should require that when there's no unit, the number is an integer. Otherwise, '500.5' would be a float, but in bytes it's an integer. So maybe the function should raise an error in that case.

Hmm, but the problem didn't specify that. So perhaps the function should accept any number, even fractions, but when there's no unit, it's just bytes (so the number must be an integer? Or can it be a float?)

The problem's example uses '500K' which is an integer. But the function's return is an int. So, if the input is '500.5' (no unit), the code would return 500.5 *1 → 500.5 → cast to int gives 500, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says to return an int, so even if the user inputs a float with no unit, that's allowed? Because bytes can't be fractional, but the function would return an integer.

So maybe the code is okay as written, but perhaps the function should enforce that the number is an integer when there's no unit?

Hmm, that's a possible edge case. Let's see.

Suppose the input is '500.5B' → after stripping 'B's, the stripped_str is '500.5' → unit is empty. So the code would return 500.5 as a float → then cast to int gives 500. But the actual value would be 500.5 bytes → but bytes can't be fractional. So maybe the code should only allow integer numbers when there is no unit.

Hmm, but the problem's docstring doesn't specify this. The function's return is an int, so perhaps it's okay. Because the function would return the integer part, but maybe that's not what the user expects. Alternatively, the code could check if there is no unit and the number is a float (non-integer) → then raise an error?

That's a possible addition, but the problem's example doesn't mention that. Since the problem didn't specify, perhaps the current code is acceptable. The function just returns the integer conversion of the float.

Alternatively, the function could return the exact value, so 500.5 would be converted to 500.5 → but since it must return an int, it's rounded down. That's a possible issue, but perhaps the problem allows for it.

Alternatively, maybe the input is always an integer when there is no unit, so the code is okay.

Well, given the problem's example and the function's return type, perhaps the current code is okay.

Now, the code should also handle leading zeros or other numbers like '05' → which is 5, but in Python, when you do float('05') it's 5 → okay.

What about '500K' → correct.

Now, let's code this as per the above steps.

Wait, but in the code, the 'units' dictionary uses K, M, etc. So that's correct.

Another possible edge case: 'K' → stripped_str is 'K' → then unit is K, num_str is empty → the code raises "Invalid number".

Yes, correct.

Another case: '500Kb' → stripped_str becomes '500K' → correct.

Now, the code.

Wait, perhaps I can make the code even more concise. Let me see.

Alternatively, the code can use a regular expression to extract the number and the unit. Maybe that would be better?

Hmm, using regex might be more reliable. Let's think about that approach.

The regex could look for a number followed by an optional unit (one of K,M,G,T,P,E), and possibly followed by a B (for bytes). For example, the regex could be:

^(\d+\.?\d*)([KMGTP]?)B?$

Wait, perhaps the regex can capture the numeric part and the unit part.

Let me think:

The regex pattern would be something like:

r"([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)\s*([KMGTP]?)\s*B?$"

Wait, but maybe it's better to split the input into the number and the unit, ignoring any trailing 'B's.

Alternatively, the regex could be:

([0-9.]+)[KMGTP]?B?$

Wait, perhaps the pattern can be:

([0-9.]+)([KMGTP]?)B?$

So, the first group is the numeric part (digits and optional decimal point), the second group is the unit (like K, M, etc), and then an optional B at the end.

So, for example:

'500K' → matches 500 and K, B is optional (since there's none, the B part is not present). So groups would be '500', 'K'

'500KB' → matches 500, K → B is present but matched as optional.

'500B' → matches 500, then unit is empty, and B is matched as the optional B at the end → so groups '500', ''

'500.5M' → groups '500.5', 'M'

'500.5MB' → same as above.

'500' → groups '500', ''

'500X' → would not match, since the unit is X not in the allowed list.

'500Kg' → becomes '500KG', but the regex would look for K as the unit, but then 'G' is part of the string. Wait, the regex would capture '500K' as the first group (the [0-9.]+ would stop at the 'G', so group1 would be '500K' → but that's invalid. Hmm, perhaps the regex is not the best approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex should capture the number as everything before the last unit character.

Hmm, perhaps using regex can make it easier.

Let me think of the regex approach:

The regex could be:

^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)([KMGTP]?)B?$

This would match a number (with optional decimal) followed by an optional unit (one of K, M, G, T, P, E), followed by an optional B at the end.

So, the groups would be:

Group1: the number part (like 500, 500.5, etc)

Group2: the unit (like K, M, etc) or empty string.

The B at the end is optional.

So, for '500K', group1 is '500', group2 is 'K'

For '500KB' → group1 '500', group2 'K'

For '500B' → group1 '500', group2 ''

For '500.5MB' → group1 '500.5', group2 'M'

For '500X', the second group would be 'X', but it's not in the allowed units → so the code would check and raise an error.

For '500Kg' → the 'g' is not part of the allowed units, so group2 would be 'K' (since the [KMGTP]? would capture up to the first letter, but the 'g' is not in the allowed letters? Wait, no. Let's see:

The regex pattern's second group is [KMGTP]? → so if the next character after the number is 'G', then group2 would be 'G'. But in '500KG', the regex would match the first group as '500K', but the second group is 'G'? Because after the number part (500K), the next is 'G', so group2 would be 'G'.

Wait, maybe the regex is not capturing correctly. Let me think again:

The regex:

^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)([KMGTP]?)B?$

The first group is the number part. The second group is the optional unit (one of those letters, once), and then an optional B.

Wait, the second group is [KMGTP]? → which means a single character from those letters, or nothing.

Wait, the problem is that the unit is only one character. So in the case of '500KB', the regex would capture group1 as '500', group2 as 'K', and the B is matched as the optional B at the end.

In '500K', the B part is not present, so group2 is 'K' and the B is not matched.

In '500G', group2 is 'G'.

In '500MB' → group1 '500', group2 'M'.

But in '500KG', the regex would not match because after the number (500), the next characters are 'K' and 'G'. So the regex would capture group1 as '500K', group2 as 'G'? Wait no, because the regex is:

The first group is the number (digits and optional decimal). The second group is a single optional letter (K, M, etc). Then, the B is optional at the end.

Wait, so in '500KG', the regex would see:

After the number part (500), the next character is 'K', which is part of the unit? Wait, no. The first group would take the digits and decimal, so '500K' is not part of the first group because 'K' is not a digit or decimal.

Ah right, so the first group is the numeric part, so the regex would have the first group as '500' (since after that comes 'K', then 'G', but the regex requires the unit to be a single character. So '500KG' would not match the regex, so the code would have to raise an error.

So with regex, perhaps the code can be written as:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}
    match = re.match(r'^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*([KMGTP]?)B?$', size.strip().upper())
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    if not num_str:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    return int(number * units.get(unit, 1))

Wait, but this regex might not be perfect. Let's see.

The regex pattern is:

^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*([KMGTP]?)B?$

Wait, let's parse this:

- ^ matches start of string.

- (\d+(?:\.\d+)?): captures the number part. It can be an integer (like '500'), or a float (like '500.5' or '0.5'). The ?: makes the second group non-capturing, so the entire is group1.

- \s*: allows for whitespace between the number and the unit.

- ([KMGTP]?): captures the optional unit (one of those letters, once). The ? makes it optional, so the second group can be empty.

- B?: an optional 'B' at the end (case is handled by converting to upper before matching).

- $ end of string.

Wait, but the original size is stripped of whitespace, so the \s* might not be necessary. So perhaps the regex can be written without that.

Wait, the code is using size.strip().upper(), so leading and trailing whitespace is already removed. So the regex can be:

r'^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*([KMGTP]?)B?$'

Wait, but in the stripped string, there are no leading or trailing spaces. So the \s* between the number and unit is for possible spaces in between. Like '500 K' would be stripped to '500 K', then the regex would match the space between them. So the regex allows for that.

Hmm, but perhaps that's overcomplicating. The problem's example doesn't have spaces, so maybe the function can assume no spaces? The docstring's example is '500K', so maybe spaces are not allowed. So perhaps the regex can be simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should not allow spaces. So the regex can be:

r'^([0-9.]+)([KMGTP]?)B?$'

Wait, let's see:

For '500K' → matches group1 '500', group2 'K' → correct.

'500KB' → group1 '500', group2 'K', B is matched as optional → correct.

'500.5MB' → group1 '500.5', group2 'M' → correct.

'500B' → group1 '500', group2 empty → correct.

'500' → group1 '500', group2 empty → correct.

'500Kg' → becomes '500KG' → the regex would try to match:

The first part is '500', then the second group is 'K', then the 'G' is part of the string, but the regex would look for the next part after group2 (the unit) being followed by an optional B and then end. So '500KG' would not match, because after the 'K' (group2) there is a 'G' which is not allowed. So the regex would fail, raising an error.

So that's good.

But this approach requires the regex to be properly formed, and the groups to be captured correctly.

Testing this regex:

Test string '500K' → regex matches. Groups are '500', 'K'

Test '500KB' → '500', 'K'

Test '500MB' → '500', 'M'

Test '500' → '500', ''

Test '500.5' → '500.5', ''

Test '500.5K' → '500.5', 'K'

Test '500K' → same as first.

Test '500G' → '500', 'G'

Test '500X' → no match, so error.

Test '500Kg' → after stripping and upper, '500KG' → the regex tries to capture group1 as '500', then group2 as 'K', then the next character is 'G', which is not allowed (since after group2, there can be an optional B and then end). So the regex would not match, so it raises an error.

That's better than the previous approach, because the regex ensures that the entire string is parsed correctly.

So using regex might be better.

Let me try to write the code with regex:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}
    pattern = r'^([0-9.]+)([KMGTP]?)B?$'
    s = size.strip().upper()
    match = re.match(pattern, s)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    if not num_str:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    return int(number * units.get(unit, 1))

Wait, but in the regex, the second group is [KMGTP]? → so it can be one of those letters or empty. The B is optional at the end (the 'B?' part). So the regex would match '500K' → yes.

But what about '500KiB'? The stripped_str is '500KIB', which would not match the regex. Because the second group would capture 'K', but the remaining characters are 'IB', which would not be allowed. So the regex would fail. So that's okay.

Another case: '500' → matches, groups '500', ''

'500B' → matches, groups '500', ''

'500KB' → groups '500', 'K'

Yes, this seems better.

Wait, the regex is:

^([0-9.]+)([KMGTP]?)B?$

So the first group is the number (digits and optional '.' and more digits). The second group is an optional unit (one of K,M,G,T,P). Then an optional B at the end.

So for '500KB', the entire string after stripping and upper is '500KB', so the regex would:

- first group is '500' → because after that comes 'K', which is part of the second group.

Wait, no. Let's see:

The regex is:

The first group is [0-9.]+ → which would capture all digits and dots until the next part.

The next part is [KMGTP]? → so in '500KB', the first group is '500', then the second group is 'K', then the 'B' is matched by the B? at the end.

So yes, that works.

Another example: '500MB' → groups '500', 'M', and the 'B' at the end is matched by B? → so yes.

Now, for '500Kg', the stripped_str is '500KG', the regex would try to capture first group as '500', then second group as 'K' (since the next character is 'G', but the second group is optional. Wait, the second group is [KMGTP]? → so in '500KG', after the first group '500', the next character is 'K', so the second group captures 'K', then the regex expects the remaining characters to be either an optional B and end. But after the 'K' in group2, there's 'G', so the regex would not match. So the '500KG' would not match, so the code would raise an error. Which is correct.

So this approach might be better.

Now, what about leading or trailing '.' in the number?

Like '500.' → the regex would capture group1 as '500.' → which is parsed as 500.0 → okay.

'.5K' → becomes '.5K' → group1 '.5', group2 'K' → so 0.5 * 1024 → 512 → okay.

But the problem's example uses '500K', which is okay. So the regex allows for numbers like 0.5, etc.

Now, what about '500.5.6K' → that would not match the regex, so correct.

So this regex approach might be better. Let's proceed with that.

Now, in the code, the unit is captured as the second group, which is optional. So if there is no second group, then unit is empty. The B at the end is optional. So the code works.

But what about the case where the unit is present but followed by another letter? Like '500MB' → the 'M' is captured as the unit, then the 'B' is the optional B at the end → okay.

Another case: '500G' → groups '500', 'G' → unit is 'G' → correct.

Now, let's see the code with this approach.

Wait, the code uses 're.match' which checks the entire string from the start. The pattern starts with ^ and ends with $, so it must match the entire string.

Yes. So, the regex is:

r'^([0-9.]+)([KMGTP]?)B?$'

So the entire string must be matched.

Testing '500K' → matches.

Testing '500' → matches.

Testing '500.5MB' → yes.

Testing '500KB' → yes.

Testing '500MB' → yes.

Testing '500B' → yes.

Testing '500.5' → yes.

Testing '500Kg' → '500KG' → the regex would first capture '500' as group1, then group2 'K', then the remaining part is 'G', which is not allowed. So the regex would not match, so error.

So this is better.

Now, the code:

But the regex's second group is [KMGTP]?, so '500' → group2 is empty → correct.

Now, what about '500' → unit is empty → correct.

Now, in the code:

The match.groups() will return two groups. The first is the number, the second is the unit (could be empty).

So, in the code:

if not match → invalid input.

Then, num_str and unit = match.groups()

But if the second group is empty, then unit is empty → correct.

So the code would handle that.

Now, the code also checks if unit is in the units dict. So '500X' → the regex would not match, since X is not in the second group's options. So the regex returns no match → error.

Yes.

Another case: '500' → correct.

Another case: '500.5K' → correct.

So this approach might be better.

Now, what about '500.5' → returns 500.5 → but as an integer, it would be 500.5 → which when cast to int is 500. But the function is allowed to return that, as per the problem's requirements.

So the code is okay.

Now, let's write the code accordingly.

Wait, the regex pattern may also have to allow for cases where the unit is present but followed by a B.

Yes.

Now, code:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}
    pattern = r'^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)([KMGTP]?)B?$'
    s = size.strip().upper()
    match = re.match(pattern, s)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    if not num_str:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    return int(number * units.get(unit, 1))

Wait, I adjusted the regex to use \d+ instead of [0-9] for better readability. Also, the first group is \d+ (so at least one digit) followed by optional decimal part.

Wait, but in the regex, the first group is (\d+(?:\.\d+)?) → so it can capture numbers like '500', '500.5', '0.5', but not '.5' → because the first part is \d+ → so the '0.5' is okay, but '.5' would have no digits before the '.' → which is invalid. So the regex requires at least one digit before the decimal point, so '.5K' would not be matched. So that's a problem?

Hmm, the regex requires at least one digit before the decimal. So input like '.5K' → stripped becomes '.5K' → the regex would not match because the first group starts with '.' → no \d+ before the decimal.

So that's invalid. So the function would raise an error for such inputs, which is correct because the number must have at least one digit before the decimal point.

So that's okay.

Another case: '1234.56G' → stripped → '1234.56G' → the regex matches group1 '1234.56', group2 'G' → correct.

So this approach is better.

Now, let's check the code:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}
    pattern = r'^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)([KMGTP]?)B?$'
    s = size.strip().upper()
    match = re.match(pattern, s)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    if not num_str:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    return int(number * units.get(unit, 1))

Wait, but the second group is optional, so in the case of '500', the unit is the second group which is empty. So that's okay.

Now, testing the regex for '.5K' → stripped becomes '.5K', which would not match the first group's requirement of \d+ → so no match → error. That's correct.

What about '500.' → that would match. The first group is '500.' → which is a valid float (500.0).

So, the code would handle that.

Now, what about '500K' → yes.

Now, the code uses the entire regex approach, which is better for handling edge cases.

So this is a better approach.

Now, let's see the code again.

Wait, in the regex, the second group is [KMGTP]?, which allows units like 'K', 'M', up to 'E'. So 'E' is allowed (exa bytes?), which is okay.

Now, the code's steps:

- Convert the input to uppercase and strip whitespace → s.

- Match the regex. If no match, raise error.

- Extract num_str and unit from groups.

- Check that num_str is not empty (but the regex ensures that, because the first group is required). So that check may be redundant.

Wait, in the regex, the first group is required, since it's not optional. So the match would only occur if the first group exists, so the 'num_str' will always be present. So the check 'if not num_str' is redundant and can be removed.

So the code can be adjusted:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}
    pattern = r'^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)([KMGTP]?)B?$'
    s = size.strip().upper()
    match = re.match(pattern, s)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    return int(number * units.get(unit, 1))

That's better.

Now, testing '500' → groups '500', '' → correct.

Testing '500K' → groups '500', 'K' → correct.

Testing '500KB' → groups '500', 'K' → correct.

Testing '500MB' → groups '500', 'M' → correct.

Testing '500B' → groups '500', '' → correct.

Testing '500.5MB' → groups '500.5', 'M' → correct.

Testing '1234.56G' → groups '1234.56', 'G' → correct.

Testing '500XYZ' → after stripping and upper, '500XYZ' → regex doesn't match → error.

Testing '500Kg' → becomes '500KG' → regex tries to match the first group as '500', then the second group as 'K', then the 'G' is not allowed (the B? would only take the B, but here the next is G → so the regex doesn't match → correct.

So this code should handle the cases better.

Now, what about '500k' → after upper, '500K' → correct.

Another case: '500MB' → correct.

So this code seems better. I think using regex is a better approach here. Let's proceed with this code.

Now, the code uses the 're.match' function. The pattern must match from the start (^) to the end ($).

Now, the regex's second group is [KMGTP]? → so units like 'K' are allowed, but also 'M', etc.

Now, let's see the units. The problem's example uses 'K', so the code includes K. The other units are included.

Now, the code should return an integer, so even if the number is a float like 1.5 * 1024 → correct.

Now, the code should handle all cases.

So I think this is the better approach. Now, let's write the code as such, without any markdown formatting and only the code.

Wait, but the problem says to output only the code in Python markdown format, but in the thinking, I need to output the code without any explanations.

Wait, the user's instruction says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, perhaps the 'python markdown format' means to write the code within triple backticks or something? But maybe the user just wants the code without any explanations.

So, in the final code, I need to provide the function def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int: with the docstring, and then the code inside.

So here's the code:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert human readable file size to bytes

    Args:
            size: str, a string representing a human readable file size (eg: '500K')
    Returns:
            int: file size in bytes
    """
    units = {'K': 1024, 'M': 1024**2, 'G': 1024**3, 'T': 1024**4, 'P': 1024**5, 'E': 1024**6}
    pattern = r'^(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)([KMGTP]?)B?$'
    s = size.strip().upper()
    match = re.match(pattern, s)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    try:
        number = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number")
    if unit and unit not in units:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
    return int(number * units.get(unit, 1))

Wait, but in the regex, the second group is optional. So when there is no unit, then unit is empty.

Yes.

Now, the units are defined correctly.

Now, what about the 'B' being part of the unit? Like '500B' → the regex matches group1 '500', group2 empty, so returns 500 *1 → correct.

Now, the code also converts to upper, so case is handled.

Now, this code should work.

Testing '500KB' → after stripping and upper → '500KB' → regex matches:

The first group is '500', the second group is 'K', and the B at the end is matched by the B? → so correct.

Another test case '500.5K' → '500.5K' → groups '500.5', 'K' → correct.

Edge case '500' → groups '500', '' → correct.

Edge case '500K' → correct.

Edge case '500Kb' → becomes '500KB' → groups '500', 'K' → correct.

Edge case '500B' → groups '500', '' → correct.

Edge case '500.5MB' → '500.5MB' → groups '500.5', 'M' → correct.

Edge case '500G' → '500G' → groups '500', 'G' → correct.

Edge case '500.5' → returns 500.5 → cast to int → 500.5 → but as an integer, it's 500. So the function returns that. But the problem allows that?

The problem says to return an int, so perhaps it's okay. The function is converting to bytes, which are integers, so even if the input is a float without a unit, it's possible, but the function returns the integer part.

Wait, no, the code uses float(num_str) → so '500.5' would be 500.5 → multiplied by 1 → 500.5 → cast to int is 500. So that's correct.

Hmm, but if the input is '500.5B', then after processing, the stripped_str is '500.5B' → but the regex would match:

The first group is '500.5', then the second group is empty (since after the number comes 'B' → the second group is optional, so unit is empty. The B at the end is matched by the B? → so yes.

Thus, the code would return 500.5 *1 → 500.5 → cast to int → 500.

So that's correct.

The function seems to handle all cases now. I think this is the better approach using regex.

Therefore, the code using regex is better. So I'll go with this code.
