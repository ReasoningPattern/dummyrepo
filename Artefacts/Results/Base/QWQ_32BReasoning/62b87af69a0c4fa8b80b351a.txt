Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_compute_el that checks if the given object's class has both fill and compute methods. Let's see. The function should take an object as input and return True if the class of that object has both methods, else False.

Hmm, how do I check if a method exists in a class? Oh right, maybe using hasattr. So for the object's class, I should check if 'fill' and 'compute' are present as methods. Wait, but how do I get the class of the object? Like, obj.__class__ gives me the class, right?

Wait, maybe I can just check the instance directly. Because sometimes, methods might be added to the instance itself. But the question says "class has the methods". So probably, it's better to check the class, not the instance. So using obj's __class__ attribute.

So the steps are: first, get the class of obj. Then check if that class has the 'fill' method and the 'compute' method. Both must be present.

So the code would be something like:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

Wait, but maybe the methods are defined in the class, not as instance methods. Like, if the class has a fill method, then cls.fill would exist. So using hasattr on the class should work.

Alternatively, maybe the methods are instance methods, so checking if the instance has them. But in Python, instance methods are looked up on the class. So hasattr(obj, 'fill') would also return True if the class has it. However, the problem specifies to check the class, not the instance. So the first approach is better.

Wait the function's docstring says "whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods". So the correct way is to check the class of obj. So yes, using the cls variable as obj.__class__.

Wait, but sometimes people might have added the methods to the instance dynamically. But according to the problem statement, it's about the class having them, so instances that have the methods but not via the class probably don't count. So the function should check the class, not the instance.

Therefore, the code should use hasattr on the class. So the return statement is the logical AND of the two hasattr calls. That's straightforward.

Wait, what if the object is None or not an instance? Like, if obj is a class itself? Then obj.__class__ would be type. But the function's name suggests that maybe it's checking an instance's class. The problem says "obj class", so I think it's safe to assume that obj is an instance. But maybe the function should handle that? The problem's docstring doesn't mention any exceptions, so perhaps just proceed as is. The user might expect that it works even if the object is a class, but the question is about the class of the obj. Wait, if obj is a class, then its __class__ is type. So in that case, the function would check if type has fill and compute, which it doesn't. But I think the function is intended to be used on instances. The problem's description says "the obj class", so the function is correct as written.

So the final code is as I thought. Just return the two hasattr checks on the class. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Oh right, the function's name has '_el' at the end. Maybe that's a typo or part of the name? The user provided the function signature as is_fill_compute_el, so I'll stick with that.

Yes, the code should be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')

Wait, maybe I can combine them into a single line. That's exactly what I did here. So that's the code. Let me test this in my mind. Suppose a class has both, then it returns True. If either is missing, returns False. That's correct. I think that's all.
