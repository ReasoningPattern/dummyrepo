Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The method is called 'keys' and it returns the __keys property as a list. Hmm, the function is part of a class since it's using 'self'. The docstring says it returns the __keys property, so I think __keys is a private attribute of the class. 

Wait, the method is defined as def keys(self):, so inside a class. The user probably wants this method to access the __keys property. But in Python, to access a private variable, you'd use self.__keys. But maybe the actual property is using a decorator like @property? Or is __keys a regular private attribute?

The docstring mentions returning the __keys property, so maybe it's a property. But the function's purpose is to return that property. Maybe the __keys is stored as an underscored variable, and the keys() method is a public way to access it. Like, perhaps the actual attribute is named _keys, but the doc refers to __keys. Wait, in Python, double underscores at the beginning denote name mangling. So if the class has an attribute like __keys, accessing it directly would require self._ClassName__keys. But maybe the user just wants to return it directly as a list. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __keys is a property that's defined with some getters and setters. But the method here is called keys, so maybe it's the getter itself? Like, maybe the class has a property __keys and the keys() method is its getter. But in Python, properties are usually accessed without parentheses. Wait, the function's docstring says "Returns the __keys property of a class as a List", so perhaps the __keys is a protected or private variable, and the keys method is simply returning that variable. 

So the code would be straightforward. The method should return self.__keys. But I need to make sure that the __keys is indeed a list. Wait, the function's return is supposed to be a list. So the __keys property is a list. But the code just needs to return that. 

Wait, but in Python, if the __keys is a private attribute, the user might have to use the name mangling, but maybe the class is designed such that __keys is directly accessible via self.__keys. Or perhaps the class is written in a way that the __keys is stored as an instance variable. 

The problem is to write the code for the keys method. The docstring is clear. So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return self.__keys

But I should check if there's any possible issues here. Like, if the __keys is a property with a getter, but maybe the user just wants to return it as is. Since the function's docstring specifies returning the __keys property, not a list of keys from some other structure, it's probably just a direct return. 

So the code is as simple as that. The method returns self.__keys. That's all. I don't need to do anything else. The user didn't mention any other details, so just the function with the return statement. I'll make sure to format it correctly in the code block. Also, since the function is part of a class, but the code only needs the method's definition, that's okay. The user probably has the __keys defined in the class already. 

Wait, maybe the __keys is a list, so the method can just return it. No conversion needed. The doc says "as a List", but perhaps __keys is already a list. So the code is correct. Alright, I think that's the solution.
