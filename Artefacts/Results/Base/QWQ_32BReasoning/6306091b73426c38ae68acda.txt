Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called plugins_manager and it's a class method since it takes cls as an argument. The docstring says it gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

Hmm, so the function's purpose is to retrieve the plugin manager from a service. The cls._get_service() must be a method that returns some service, and then using the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER to access the specific plugin manager. Wait, but how exactly? Maybe the _get_service method takes a service name as an argument and returns the corresponding service instance. So the plugins_manager function is probably a convenience method to get that specific service without having to call _get_service every time with the hardcoded name.

So the code should be something like: return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER). But I need to make sure I'm following the right structure. Let me think again. The function is a decorator? Or just a class method. The signature is def plugins_manager(cls), so it's a method. 

Wait, maybe the cls._get_service() is a method that when called with an argument (the service name) returns the plugin manager. So the function should call cls._get_service and pass the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER constant. 

Wait, the wording in the docstring says "via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER", so perhaps the correct way is to use that specific service name as the key. So the code would be straightforward. 

Wait, maybe ServiceName is an enum or a class that has a PLUGINS_MANAGER attribute. The function is supposed to get the plugin manager by using that service name. So inside the method, the code would be to call cls._get_service with the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER as an argument. 

Therefore, the function body would simply be a return statement calling that method with the given service name. Let me make sure there's no additional setup needed. The docstring doesn't mention any parameters or other steps, so the method is probably a one-liner. 

Wait, but what if _get_service is a static method or a class method that requires the service name? The function plugins_manager is a class method, so when it calls cls._get_service, that method must exist on the class. 

The code should be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But I need to check if ServiceName is imported or defined. The problem statement doesn't mention that, so I guess it's assumed that ServiceName is already available in the scope. The user probably just wants the method's code as per the docstring, so that's it. 

Wait, the user said "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Oh right, so I have to present it as code within markdown. The thinking is done, so the code should be correct.
