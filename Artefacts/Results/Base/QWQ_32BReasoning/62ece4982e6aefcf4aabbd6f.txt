Okay, I need to write a Python function called get_repo_archive that takes a URL and a destination path, downloads the .tar.gz file, extracts it, and returns the extraction path. Let me think about the steps here.

First, the function should download the archive from the given URL. I can use the requests library for that. Wait, but maybe using urllib is better? Hmm, the standard way might be requests.get, but I have to make sure to handle streaming so it doesn't load the whole file into memory. Oh right, because for large files, streaming download is better. So I'll go with requests.

Wait, but the user didn't mention installing any packages. Oh well, the function's signature is given, so I can assume that the necessary imports are already there. Wait, actually, I need to include the imports in the code. Oh right, the function needs to be standalone. So I should import requests and Path from pathlib, maybe.

Wait the destination_path is a Path object, so the function uses the Path class from pathlib. So I need to import Path from pathlib. Also, for handling the download and extraction, I'll need to write the file to a temporary location first, then extract it to the destination path.

Alternatively, maybe download the tar.gz into a temporary file, then open it and extract. Let's see. So steps:

1. Download the URL to a temporary file. Since it's a .tar.gz, I can save it as a .tar.gz file, but maybe just use a BytesIO to hold the downloaded data without writing to disk first? Wait, but extracting might require writing to disk anyway. Hmm, maybe better to download to a temporary file, then extract from there. Because sometimes the downloaded data can be large, so using a file might be more memory efficient.

Wait, but how to get the filename from the URL? The URL might end with .tar.gz, so I can split it to get the filename part. Like, parse the URL to get the last component. For example, if the URL is https://example.com/somefile.tar.gz, the filename would be somefile.tar.gz. Then, I can create a temporary file with that name, but maybe the destination path is where to extract, so the actual archive is stored in a temp directory, then extracted. Alternatively, maybe just download the file to a temp location, extract it, then move the extracted directory to the destination path. But the user wants to extract to destination_path, so perhaps we can write the archive to a temp file, then extract into destination_path. Wait, but extracting a .tar.gz would create a directory, possibly. The doc says the archive contains a 'desc' file for each package. Wait, maybe each package in the archive has its own directory with a desc file. So when extracting, the contents go into destination_path, and the function should return that path.

So first, download the archive. Let's see, using requests.get with stream=True. Then, write the content to a temporary file. But maybe I can just download it directly to a file in the system's temp directory. Or use a NamedTemporaryFile? Or perhaps just a regular temporary file that gets deleted after extraction? Hmm, perhaps the best way is to download the file to a temporary file, then use tarfile to extract it.

Wait, the steps would be:

- Create a temporary file to store the downloaded .tar.gz.

- Download the URL into that temporary file.

- Then, open the temporary file as a tar archive and extract all into destination_path.

- Once extracted, delete the temporary file.

Wait, but the destination_path needs to exist? Maybe the function should create the destination directory if it doesn't exist. Or perhaps the user is responsible for that. The doc says "extract archive to destination_path", so perhaps the function should create it if needed.

So code outline:

import requests
from pathlib import Path
import tarfile
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    # Download the archive to a temp file
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    # Check if the response is okay
    response.raise_for_status()
    with NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
            if chunk:  # filter out keep-alive new chunks
                tmp.write(chunk)
        tmp_path = Path(tmp.name)
    
    # Now extract the temp file to destination_path
    with tarfile.open(tmp_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    
    # Remove the temporary file
    tmp_path.unlink()
    
    return destination_path

Wait, but maybe the archive when extracted has a top-level directory. Like, if the tar.gz is named 'package.tar.gz', extracting might create a 'package' directory inside destination_path. But the doc says that the extracted archive contains 'desc' files for each package, so maybe the structure is such that each package is a directory with its own desc. So the extraction is to the destination_path, and the return is that path. That's okay.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the path where the archive is extracted to. Since we extracted to destination_path, that's what we return. So that's correct.

Wait, but what if the URL is not a .tar.gz? The function's doc says it's given a .tar.gz, so maybe we can assume that. Also, need to handle possible exceptions. Like, if the download fails, or the extraction fails. The code above uses response.raise_for_status() to handle download errors. The extraction part will raise an error if the archive is invalid or can't be extracted, but the function's doc doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps that's okay. The user is supposed to handle exceptions via try blocks.

Hmm, but maybe using a more efficient way. The NamedTemporaryFile with delete=False allows us to get the name, but after closing, we can delete it. Wait in the code above, the tmp is closed when the with block exits, and then we can unlink it. So that's correct.

Alternatively, could use a context manager for the temporary file, but perhaps this approach is okay.

Wait, another thing: the destination_path should be a Path object. So the function's parameters are correct. Also, the return is destination_path, which is the path where it's extracted. But maybe the archive when extracted creates a subdirectory, so the actual extracted directory is a subdirectory of destination_path. Then the return value should be that subdirectory. Wait, but the doc says "returns the path where the archive is extracted to". So if the archive is extracted to destination_path, then the return is destination_path. Unless the archive has a single top-level directory. For example, if the tar contains a directory named 'repo', then extracting would put that in destination_path. So the actual extracted directory would be destination_path/'repo', but the function would return destination_path. Hmm, but the doc might mean that the entire archive is extracted into destination_path, so the return is destination_path. The user's doc says "returns the path where the archive is extracted to", so I think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the extracted files are placed directly into destination_path, without a top-level folder. So the function just returns the destination_path.

So the code above should work, but let me check the steps again.

Wait, the code uses NamedTemporaryFile, which is created in the system's temp directory, but after writing the chunks, the tmp is closed. Then, we open the tarfile from tmp_path. Then, after extraction, delete the temporary file. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe the chunk writing can be done more efficiently. The response.iter_content is okay. Alternatively, maybe using a with statement for the temporary file. Wait, the code already uses a with block for the tmp, so when the with exits, the file is closed. Then, we can proceed.

Wait, but in the code above, the NamedTemporaryFile is created in a with block, but the tmp_path is assigned after the with? Wait no, in the code inside the with block, the tmp is open, and we write the chunks. Then, after the with block, the tmp is closed, and we can get its path. Wait the NamedTemporaryFile, when used in a with, is closed when the block exits, but the file is not deleted because delete=False. So that's okay.

Wait, the code uses 'r:gz' as the mode for tarfile.open, which is correct for reading a gzipped tarball.

Hmm, but maybe the function should check if the destination_path exists, and create it if not? Because otherwise, extracting might fail. So adding:

destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

At the beginning. That way, if the directory doesn't exist, it's created.

So modifying the code:

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    response.raise_for_status()
    with NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
            if chunk:  
                tmp.write(chunk)
        tmp_path = Path(tmp.name)
    
    with tarfile.open(tmp_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    
    tmp_path.unlink()
    return destination_path

Wait, but maybe the user expects the function to handle the creation of the destination directory. That makes sense. So adding that line first.

Wait, but the function's return is the destination_path, which is the extraction path, so that's correct.

Another possible issue: the chunk_size. Using 8192 is okay, but maybe a larger chunk size would be better. However, the default is 1k, but 8k is fine.

Wait, also, the function should return the Path object, so perhaps the destination_path is already a Path, so returning it is okay. The function's return type is Path, so yes.

Wait, but maybe the extracted content has a specific subdirectory, and the return should be the actual directory where the files are. But according to the problem statement, the function should return the destination_path where the archive is extracted to. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should test this code. Let me think of possible cases. Suppose the URL is valid, and the extraction works, then yes. But what if the archive is not a .tar.gz? The function might fail when opening the tarfile. But the doc says the archive is a .tar.gz, so it's the user's responsibility to provide a correct URL. The function doesn't need to check the file type beyond the URL's ending?

Alternatively, perhaps the code can check the URL ends with .tar.gz, but the doc says the input is a .tar.gz, so maybe not necessary. The function can proceed as is.

Wait, another approach: using the Path.write_bytes to download the entire content. But for large files, that might not be efficient. The requests.get with stream=True is better for large files.

Hmm, maybe using a context manager for the temporary file. Wait, in the code above, the tmp is created with NamedTemporaryFile, which is good because it's cleaned up properly except for the case when the extraction fails, but in the code, after extraction, the tmp is unlinked. So if extraction fails, the temp file remains. Oh, but in that case, the code might leave a temporary file. To avoid that, perhaps we should use a try/finally block?

Alternatively, the function could proceed as such. Let's see. Suppose the extraction throws an error, then the unlink is not called. So the temp file would stay. That's a problem. So to handle that, we need to ensure the tmp_path is deleted even if an error occurs during extraction. So maybe the code should use a try block.

Hmm, so perhaps better to structure it like this:

import requests
from pathlib import Path
import tarfile
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    response.raise_for_status()
    with NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp_file:
        tmp_path = Path(tmp_file.name)
        with open(tmp_path, 'wb') as f:
            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
                if chunk:
                    f.write(chunk)
    try:
        with tarfile.open(tmp_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
            tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    finally:
        tmp_path.unlink()
    return destination_path

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the NamedTemporaryFile is already open in write mode. So maybe I can just write to tmp_file directly. Let me correct that:

Wait, in the first code, the NamedTemporaryFile is opened, and we write to it via tmp.write(chunk). So that's correct. The second code example was incorrect. So the first version is better. So the initial code was okay except for the directory creation.

Wait, but in the first code, after creating the destination directory, the download proceeds. The extraction then happens into that directory. The temp file is unlinked after extraction. So that's okay.

Wait, but what if the extraction throws an error? Then the tmp_path.unlink() is not called, so the temp file remains. So the code should handle that. So perhaps the unlink should be in a finally clause? But in the current structure, the tmp is closed, but the unlink is after the extraction block. So if extraction fails, the unlink doesn't happen. So to handle that, maybe:

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    response.raise_for_status()
    tmp_path = None
    try:
        with NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp:
            for chunk in response.iter_content(8192):
                if chunk:
                    tmp.write(chunk)
            tmp_path = Path(tmp.name)
        # Now extract
        with tarfile.open(tmp_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
            tar.extractall(destination_path)
    finally:
        if tmp_path is not None:
            tmp_path.unlink()
    return destination_path

Hmm, but the NamedTemporaryFile is in a with block, so the tmp is closed. But the tmp_path is assigned. Then, the finally block would delete it regardless of whether the extraction succeeded. So this approach is better. Wait, but the with NamedTemporaryFile as tmp: block, when it exits the with, the file is closed. The code after that is outside the with, so the tmp is closed, but the tarfile can still be opened. So that's okay. Wait, but in this case, the tmp is closed, so the tmp.write is inside the with block. The try block here includes the creation of the temp file and the download, then the extraction. The finally would delete the tmp even if extraction fails.

Wait, but the try block here is encompassing both the download and the extraction. Wait, perhaps it's better to split. Let me think again.

Wait, in the first version, the tmp is written, then the tar is opened and extracted. The tmp_path is stored. So if extraction fails, the code after the with (tarfile.open) will still execute the tmp_path.unlink? No, because if extraction throws an error, the code after that will not execute. So the unlink would not be called. Hence, the code would leave the temp file. So the try/finally approach is better.

Hmm, so to structure it properly, I need to ensure that the temp file is deleted even if an exception occurs during extraction.

So the revised code would be:

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
    response.raise_for_status()
    with NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
            if chunk:
                tmp.write(chunk)
        tmp_path = Path(tmp.name)
    try:
        with tarfile.open(tmp_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
            tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    finally:
        tmp_path.unlink()  # Delete the temporary file
    return destination_path

Wait, but in this case, the tmp is closed when the with block exits. Then, the tmp_path is a Path to the temporary file. The try block tries to extract, and in the finally, the file is unlinked. That's correct. So this way, even if extraction fails, the temp file is deleted.

Yes, this is better. So that's the code.

Wait, but the NamedTemporaryFile is created in the system's temp directory, right? So after closing, the file is still there until we delete it. So that's okay.

Another thing: the 'r:gz' mode. The tarfile module's open function can auto-detect the compression, but specifying 'r:gz' ensures it's a gzipped tar. So that's okay.

So putting it all together, the code should have those imports.

Wait, the user's function uses Path as the destination_path. So the code must import Path from pathlib, and also the other modules. So the code needs to start with the necessary imports.

Wait, the problem says to output the code in Python markdown format, but the user is a Python engineer so the code must be correct with the necessary imports. So the code should include:

import requests
from pathlib import Path
import tarfile
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile

But in the code above, the first version without the try/finally might have left the temp file if extraction failed, but the second version with the try/finally block ensures it's deleted. So I should use that structure.

Wait, but in the code as written, the 'with NamedTemporaryFile...' is followed by the try block. Wait, the tmp_path is assigned inside the with block. So the tmp is closed, but the file still exists until we call unlink. The try block then uses the tmp_path. So that should be okay.

Wait, another thing: the destination_path is created with mkdir before downloading, so that when extracting, the directory exists. The extraction will then put files there.

Hmm, I think that's all. Let me check again.

The function's parameters are url (a string) and destination_path (a Path). The return is a Path. The code creates the directory first, downloads the file into a temp, then extracts, then deletes the temp. That should work.

Wait, but the NamedTemporaryFile's delete is set to False, so the file isn't automatically deleted when the with block ends. The code then unlinks it in the finally clause, so that's correct.

Yes, this should be the correct code.
