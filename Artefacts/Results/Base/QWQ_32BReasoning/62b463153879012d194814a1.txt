Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method add_rendition based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function signature is def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path): and the docstring says to assign the file path, which is obtained via the filepath() method in the class, to the key "lang" within the _renditions dictionary of the class. 

Wait, so the parameters are lang and file_path. The method should store the file_path in _renditions under the lang key. But the docstring mentions "invoke by filepath() in the class"â€”does that mean that the file_path provided is actually the result of calling another method called filepath()? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the docstring again. It says "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions in the class." Hmm, maybe there's a typo there. Perhaps it should be "invoked by" or "retrieved by". Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the file_path as the value to assign. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to use the result of the instance's own filepath() method? But that might not make sense. Let me think again. The wording is a bit unclear. The docstring says "the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class". So maybe the correct interpretation is that the file_path passed to this method is the one returned by the class's filepath() method. Wait, but then why pass it as an argument? Maybe the add_rendition method should call the class's own filepath() method and use that result as the value for _renditions[lang]. Or maybe the user made a mistake in the wording, and the intention is to assign the given file_path to the _renditions dictionary under the lang key. 

Alternatively, maybe "invoke by" is a mistake and should be "to be invoked via". Like, when someone calls the filepath() method, it should return the value stored in _renditions for the given lang. So the add_rendition method would store the file_path into _renditions[lang], so that when the class's filepath() method is called, it can retrieve it based on the current language or something. 

Wait, the problem says to generate code based on the function's signature and the docstring. The function's parameters are lang and file_path, so perhaps the correct approach is to simply set self._renditions[lang] = file_path. But maybe the docstring is implying that the file_path should be the result of calling the class's own filepath() method. But that would require using self.filepath(), but the parameter is called file_path. That's confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to store the file path obtained by calling the class's filepath method with some parameters. But since the parameters given to add_rendition are lang and file_path, perhaps the file_path is already the path to store. The wording of the docstring is a bit unclear, but given the parameters, I think the intended code is to add an entry to the _renditions dictionary where the key is the 'lang' argument and the value is the 'file_path' argument. 

So the code would be something like:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    self._renditions[lang] = file_path

But I should also make sure that _renditions is a dictionary that's part of the class's instance variables. So maybe the method should check if _renditions exists, but since the problem says to base it on the given signature and docstring, perhaps we can assume that _renditions is already initialized. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to call another method called filepath() to get the path. But the parameters include file_path, so that's probably not the case. Let me read the docstring again: "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions in the class." 

Wait, maybe the "filepath()" is a method that returns the path, and the add_rendition method is supposed to store that path under the 'lang' key. But then why is file_path passed as an argument here? That would be redundant. Unless perhaps the method is supposed to use the return value of the class's own filepath method, but the parameters include file_path. 

Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the wording, and the actual intention is to assign the given file_path to the _renditions[lang] key. So the code would be straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set the file_path as the one that would be returned by the class's filepath() method. But that's unclear. 

Given the ambiguity, but since the parameters are lang and file_path, I think the correct code is to set self._renditions[lang] = file_path. 

So the code would look like:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    """
    Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions in the class.
    """
    self._renditions[lang] = file_path

Wait, but maybe the method needs to check if the key already exists and handle that? The docstring doesn't mention any such requirement, so probably not. Just assign it. 

Therefore, the code is simply adding the key-value pair to the _renditions dictionary. 

I should also make sure that the method is part of a class that has the _renditions attribute. Since the problem doesn't mention initializing it, perhaps the user expects that the method will create it if it doesn't exist? But that's probably beyond the scope here. The docstring says "in the class", so maybe _renditions is already a dictionary in the class's instance variables. 

So the final code is as I thought. Just assign the file_path to the _renditions[lang] key.
