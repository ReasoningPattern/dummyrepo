Okay, I need to write a Python function called _shuffled that takes a sequence of strings and returns a shuffled list. The docstring says to use a fixed random seed. Hmm, right, using a fixed seed means the shuffling will be deterministic every time. So the steps are: I have to import the random module. Then, set the seed using random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED), but wait, what's the actual value of the seed? The problem mentions using the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. Oh, maybe I should check if the seed is provided in the problem. Wait, looking back, the user didn't specify the seed value. Oh, but the function's docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". Wait, perhaps that's part of the code? Like, maybe the seed is a constant in the code. Oh right, the user probably expects me to define a constant like FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = some number, maybe 42? Or maybe it's supposed to be a specific value. Since the problem didn't specify, but the function's docstring says 'given', maybe I should just use a fixed number. Let's pick 42 as a common default.

So first, the function needs to shuffle the sequence but in a reproducible way. The standard way to do that is to set the seed before shuffling. But wait, each time you call random.shuffle with the same seed, will it produce the same result? Let me think. The random module's functions are stateful. So if I set the seed every time before shuffling, then yes, the result will be the same each time. Because the internal state of the random number generator is reset each time the seed is set. So that's the approach.

Wait, but how do I do that without affecting the global state of the random module? Because if I just call random.seed() inside the function, that would change the seed for all subsequent calls. That's a problem. Because if someone calls this function multiple times, the seed would be set each time, so the shuffle would be the same for each call. Wait, actually, the problem says to use the fixed seed. So the seed should always be the same. Therefore, every time the function is called, the same seed is used, so the shuffle will be the same each time. Wait, but that's not a real shuffle. Because if you set the seed to the same value each time and then shuffle, the order will always be the same. So the function would return the same shuffled list every time given the same input. That's the point here. The user wants a deterministic shuffle.

Wait, but how to implement this correctly. Let me think. The function takes a sequence. To shuffle it with a fixed seed, I can create a list copy, set the seed, shuffle it, and return. So here's the plan:

First, create a list from the input sequence. Because sequences can be of various types, but we need to shuffle a list. So list_seq = list(seq). Then, set the random seed to the fixed value. Let's say FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is 42. Then, shuffle that list in place. Wait, but the function returns the shuffled list. So the steps would be:

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    from random import shuffle, seed
    seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    result = list(seq)
    shuffle(result)
    return result

Wait, but where do I define FIXED_RANDOM_SEED? Since the problem says "given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", maybe it's a constant in the code. Let me check the problem again. The user's function signature includes "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". The wording suggests that the seed is a fixed value, so I should define a constant inside the function or outside? Probably outside the function, but the function is supposed to use it. So perhaps I need to define a constant at the top of the code. Like:

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 123  # Or some other number. Wait, but the user didn't specify the value. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use a specific seed, but since it's not given, perhaps I can just choose a number like 42.

Alternatively, maybe the seed is supposed to be a parameter but the function signature doesn't include it. Wait, looking back, the function's parameters are only 'seq', so the seed is fixed. Therefore, I can set the seed to any fixed value. Since the problem says "given", maybe the seed is provided as a variable in the code. Since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps I have to define it myself. So I'll set it to 42 as an example. Let me choose 42 as the seed value.

Wait, but when setting the seed each time, that would reset the random state every call. So each call to _shuffled with the same input would produce the same shuffled list. That's exactly what we want here. So the code would be:

Wait, but I need to make sure that the import is correct. Let me structure the code properly. Also, the function should not have any side effects, so setting the seed inside the function is okay as long as it's reset each time. Wait, no, because the seed is fixed, so each time we call the function, we set the seed to the same value, then shuffle, so the result is deterministic. So the code would work.

Wait, but I have to import Sequence from typing. The function's parameter is annotated as Sequence[str]. So perhaps the code should include the necessary imports. Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring, but they didn't mention including the imports. However, the code needs to be self-contained. Wait, the function's first line has from __future__ import annotations? Not sure, but in Python 3.9+, maybe the Sequence is acceptable without importing. Wait, no, the Sequence is a generic type from the typing module, so the code would need to import it. But the user's problem didn't mention that. Wait, but the function signature includes it. So I should include the import. Wait, but the user's code is supposed to output the function as written. So maybe the function is part of a module where the imports are already present? Or perhaps the user expects me to include the necessary imports in the code.

Wait, the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". So the code must include the function, with the correct type annotations. Therefore, I should import Sequence from typing. So the code would start with:

from typing import Sequence
import random

Then the function. Wait, but maybe the user expects the function to use the standard shuffle. Let me see.

Alternatively, to avoid global state issues, perhaps I can create a local copy of the random generator. Like, using the secrets module isn't necessary here. The problem says to use the fixed seed, so using random.seed with a fixed value each time is the way to go. 

Wait, but when you call random.seed() multiple times, each time you set the seed again, the generator is reinitialized. So in the function, every time it's called, the seed is set to the same value, then shuffled. So the same input would always produce the same output. That's exactly what the problem requires, right? Because a fixed seed would make the shuffle deterministic. So that's correct.

So putting it all together:

First, define the fixed seed. Let's pick 42 as a common example. Then, inside the function, set the seed, make a copy of the sequence as a list, shuffle it, return it. 

Wait, but the function's name is _shuffled with an underscore. That's okay, just follow the signature.

Wait, here's the code:

import random
from typing import Sequence

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result

Wait, but is there a better way to avoid the side effect of setting the seed every time? Because if another part of the code uses random and relies on the seed, this could interfere. But the problem states that the function must shuffle with the given fixed seed, so perhaps that's acceptable. Since the function's purpose is to use that fixed seed, it's okay.

Alternatively, maybe using the seed in a way that doesn't affect the global state. Like creating a new Random instance each time with the fixed seed, then using that to shuffle. That way, the global random module's state isn't altered. That's a better approach. Let me think about that.

Yes, the better approach is to use a local random instance. Because setting the seed on the module-level random each time could have side effects if other code uses the same module's state. So to avoid that, use a separate instance.

So modifying the code:

from random import Random
from typing import Sequence

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # Wait, but where is this defined? The problem says "given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", but in the code, I need to have a constant. So perhaps the user expects the constant to be in the function, or at the top level. 

Alternatively, maybe the seed is supposed to be a constant that's already defined. Since the problem mentions "the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", perhaps the variable is supposed to be in the code. But since the user hasn't provided its value, maybe I need to pick a value. Let's go with 42.

Wait, in the code, I can set the seed inside the function using a local variable. Wait, but the problem says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". So maybe the variable is named FIXED_RANDOM_SEED, but I need to define it. So I'll define it as a constant before the function.

Wait, let me structure it correctly. So:

from typing import Sequence
from random import Random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    lst = list(seq)
    rng = Random()
    rng.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    rng.shuffle(lst)
    return lst

This way, each time the function is called, it creates a new instance of the Random class, seeds it with the fixed value, and shuffles. That way, the global random state isn't touched. That's better.

So the imports would be from random import Random, and from typing import Sequence. The code would need to have those imports. Also, the function uses the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED variable. So I should define that as a constant. Since the problem didn't specify the value, I'll choose 42. 

Wait, but the user's function signature's docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". So maybe the seed is a parameter? But no, the function's parameters are only 'seq'. Therefore, the seed must be a fixed constant in the code. So that's the way.

Putting it all together, the code would need to import the necessary modules and define the constant. So the code would be:

from typing import Sequence
from random import Random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    lst = list(seq)
    rng = Random()
    rng.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    rng.shuffle(lst)
    return lst

Alternatively, perhaps using the standard random module but in a way that doesn't affect the global seed. But that's tricky. The standard approach is to use a separate instance. So the above code is better.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects the code to use the module's seed and shuffle. But that could have side effects. However, given the problem's constraints, perhaps it's acceptable. Let me think again. The problem's instructions say to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and not to include any explanation. So I need to make sure the code is correct.

Another way: Using the same seed each time, then shuffle. Let's see:

import random
from typing import Sequence

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    shuffled = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled)
    return shuffled

But in this case, each time you call the function, you reset the global random seed. So if the function is called multiple times, that's okay because the seed is fixed. But if other parts of the code use random functions, this would interfere with their randomness. However, the problem probably expects this approach since the function's docstring mentions using the fixed seed. 

Hmm, but the first approach with the local Random instance is better because it doesn't touch the global state. So I should use that. 

Wait, but in the first code I wrote with the Random class, the code is:

from random import Random
from typing import Sequence

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    lst = list(seq)
    rng = Random()
    rng.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    rng.shuffle(lst)
    return lst

Wait, but when you create a Random instance and seed it, then use that instance's shuffle method, it's safe. So that's better. 

So I need to make sure that the code uses a separate instance so that the global random module isn't affected. 

Therefore, the code should be structured that way. 

Wait, but the problem didn't specify the value of the seed. Should I perhaps define it as a constant inside the function? Like, maybe the seed is 0, or another number? Well, since the problem says "given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", perhaps the variable is already provided, but since the user didn't include it, I have to define it. So I'll set it to 42. 

Alternatively, perhaps the seed is a parameter passed somehow, but the function's signature doesn't have it. So I think the correct approach is to use a fixed constant. 

So the code should look like that. Now, check the imports again. The function uses Sequence from typing, so the import from typing is needed. 

Wait, the code starts with the necessary imports. 

Wait, the code for the function must be correct. Let me see if there's any possible mistake here. 

Another point: The original sequence must not be modified, so converting it to a list first is correct. 

Yes, so the steps are:

1. Convert the input sequence to a list (so we can shuffle it in place without affecting the original).
2. Create a new Random instance (so it doesn't interfere with the global state).
3. Seed that instance with the fixed seed.
4. Use the instance's shuffle method on the list copy.
5. Return the shuffled list.

That's the correct approach. 

Now, the code should have the docstring as specified, and the function signature. The constants need to be defined. 

Therefore, the code I need to output is:

from typing import Sequence
from random import Random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    lst = list(seq)
    rng = Random()
    rng.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    rng.shuffle(lst)
    return lst

Wait, but maybe the seed should be set in a different way. Like, using the seed parameter correctly. The Random.seed() method can take an integer. So using 42 as the seed is okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the seed to be a different number, but since it's not provided, 42 is a common choice. 

Yes, this should work. Let me test it with an example. Suppose the input is [1,2,3], but wait, the input is a sequence of str. Let's say the input is ['a', 'b', 'c']. With seed 42, what's the shuffled result?

Wait, I can't test right now, but the code is correct in approach. 

Wait, another thing: The function is supposed to return a list of strings. So the code must work for any Sequence[str], like tuples, lists, etc. Converting to list(seq) is correct. 

Yes, so that's the code. I think this is the correct way to do it.
