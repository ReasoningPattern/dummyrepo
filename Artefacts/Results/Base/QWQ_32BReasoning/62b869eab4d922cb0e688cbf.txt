Okay, so I need to write a Python function called generate_default_observer_schema that takes an app as an argument. The docstring says it's supposed to generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in the spec.manifest where a custom one hasn't been specified. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should figure out where the app's manifest is stored. The function mentions spec.manifest, so maybe the app has a spec attribute, and within that, a manifest. I'll need to loop through each resource in that manifest. 

Wait, each Kubernetes resource in the manifest might be a dictionary or some structure. Probably, the manifest is a list of resources. So for each resource in app.spec.manifest, I need to check if it already has an observer schema specified. If not, set the default one.

What's the default observer schema? The question doesn't specify, but maybe it's a standard value. Let's assume that the default is something like "DefaultObserver" or maybe a specific structure. Since the problem doesn't give details, I might have to make a reasonable guess. Maybe it's a key like "observer" set to "status" or another common value?

Alternatively, perhaps the function needs to add a default schema to each resource that doesn't have a custom one. The exact structure of the schema isn't clear, but maybe each resource has an 'observer' field, and if it's not present, we set it to a default.

Wait, maybe the observer schema is part of the resource's definition. So each resource in the manifest might have an 'observer' key. The function's job is to loop through all resources in the manifest and set the observer to the default if it's not already set.

So the steps would be:

1. Iterate over each resource in app.spec.manifest.
2. For each resource, check if the observer schema is already defined (maybe look for a key like 'observer' in the resource's spec or metadata).
3. If it's not present, add the default schema.

But how exactly are the resources structured? Let's think in terms of typical Kubernetes YAML structures. Each resource in the manifest is a dictionary with keys like 'apiVersion', 'kind', 'metadata', 'spec', etc. Maybe the observer is part of the metadata or the spec?

Alternatively, perhaps the 'observer' is a top-level key in the resource. So for each resource in the list, if 'observer' isn't present, set it to the default value. Let's assume that the default is "DefaultObserver" or maybe "json" as a common observer type in some contexts.

Wait, maybe the default is "Observer" or something else. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the function just adds a default value where the key is missing.

Let me structure the code. The function will probably look like this:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer' not in resource:
            resource['observer'] = 'DefaultObserver'

But wait, maybe the observer is part of a deeper structure. For example, maybe each resource has an 'observer' field under 'metadata' or 'spec'? The problem's wording says "for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified." So perhaps the resources already have an 'observer' key, and if not, we add it.

Alternatively, maybe the 'observer' is part of a 'status' or another section. Without more details, I'll proceed with the simplest approach: check if the 'observer' key exists in the resource. If not, set it to the default.

Wait, but the function is called generate_default_observer_schema. Maybe the schema is a more complex structure. Perhaps each resource has an 'observerSchema' key, and if that's not present, we assign a default schema.

In that case, the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    default_schema = {"kind": "DefaultObserverSchema", ...}  # some default structure
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = default_schema

But since the problem doesn't specify the exact structure of the default schema, maybe the default is a simple string, like "Default" or "Generic". The function's name suggests it's generating a schema, so perhaps the default is a dictionary with certain keys. But without specifics, I might have to go with a placeholder.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where each resource can have an 'observer' field, and the default is to set it to a particular value, such as "json" or "events".

Alternatively, maybe the default observer schema is a standard that's applied to each resource. Let me think of possible scenarios. For example, in some frameworks, the observer schema might need to have certain fields. But the problem's docstring is pretty vague.

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to loop through each resource in the app's spec.manifest, and for each resource, if there's no 'schema' specified under its observer settings, then create a default schema. But again, without knowing the exact structure, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe the 'spec.manifest' is a list of Kubernetes resource definitions, and each of them may have an 'observer' key. The function's job is to set each resource's 'observer' to a default (like 'All') unless it's already present. So the code would be something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer' not in resource:
            resource['observer'] = 'Default'

But the problem mentions 'observer schema', so maybe the key is 'observerSchema'? Or perhaps the function is adding a schema field to each resource's existing structure.

Alternatively, maybe the default is a specific schema that's applied, such as specifying the fields to observe. For example, the default might be a dictionary that includes all fields, so if a resource doesn't have an observer schema, we assign that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is meant to return a new schema, but the problem says "generate" which implies modifying the existing resources. The function's return type isn't specified, but the docstring says it's generating for each resource, so maybe it's modifying the app's manifest in place and returning it, or just the list of resources with defaults applied.

Wait, the function's return isn't mentioned in the problem. The user wants the code, so perhaps the function modifies the app's manifest directly by adding the default observer schema where missing.

Assuming that each resource is a dictionary, and the key is 'observer' or 'observerSchema', perhaps:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not resource.get('observerSchema'):
            resource['observerSchema'] = {'kind': 'Default', 'apiVersion': 'v1'}

Alternatively, maybe the default is a string, like 'Default', so:

resource['observer'] = 'Default'

But the problem's wording says "schema", which is more likely a structure. Since the user hasn't provided specifics, perhaps the function just adds a default key-value pair where the observer is missing.

Alternatively, maybe the default is determined based on the resource's kind. For example, Deployments might have a different default than Services. But again, without specifics, that's hard to code.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the simplest approach. Let's say the default is setting the 'observer' key to "Default" if it's not present. Or perhaps the 'schema' is part of a 'spec' section. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a system where the 'observer schema' is a separate structure. Maybe the app has an observer schema field, but the question is about each resource in the manifest. So for each resource in the app's manifest, check if they have their own observer schema. If not, assign a default.

Wait, maybe the default is to use a generic schema for all resources not specified. So the code would loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest, and for each, check if there's an 'observer' key. If not, set it to the default.

Alternatively, perhaps the function needs to return a dictionary mapping each resource's kind to the default schema. But the function's name suggests it's generating the schema for each resource present in the manifest, so modifying the app's manifest.

Another thought: the function could be adding a default 'schema' field to each resource. Like, each resource has an 'observer' field, and the schema is part of that. Or maybe the 'observerSchema' is a key in the resource's top-level.

Alternatively, maybe the 'observer' is a part of the resource's 'metadata' annotations? That's possible. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the function just adds a key called 'observer' with a default value to each resource in the manifest that doesn't have it.

Let me go with that. So the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer' not in resource:
            resource['observer'] = 'Default'

Wait, but maybe the observer is part of a deeper structure. For example, in some cases, the observer might be under 'spec' or 'status'. The problem says "present in spec.manifest", so perhaps the 'spec' is part of the app's structure, and the manifest is a list of resources. Each resource is a dict, so the function checks each resource's own keys.

Alternatively, maybe each resource in the manifest is a dictionary, and we need to check if they have an 'observer' key. If not, set it to a default. That's the most straightforward approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'observerSchema' is a key that's part of the resource, and if it's not present, set it to some default structure. So:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    default = {"kind": "ClusterServiceVersion", "apiVersion": "operators.coreos.com/v1", ...}
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = default

But again, the default's structure is unknown. Maybe the problem expects a simple approach where the default is a string like "All" or "Generic".

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the schema for the app, but the question says it's for each resource in the manifest. So the function is modifying the app's manifest.

Wait, the function's name is generate_default_observer_schema for each resource. So the output is per-resource, but the function's return isn't specified. The problem says to generate the default, so maybe it's modifying the app's manifest in-place, adding the default schema where missing.

Another possibility is that the default observer schema is a standard value, such as "json" or "list". Maybe the default is to set the observer to "All" or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the default is to use the Kubernetes resource's own schema. But how would that be implemented?

Alternatively, maybe each resource in the manifest is an object with an observer schema property, and the function sets that property if it's not already set. But in Python, if they're dictionaries, then checking for the key is the way.

Hmm. Since the problem is a bit vague, I need to make some assumptions here. Let's proceed with the code that loops through each resource in app.spec.manifest and sets a default 'observer' key if it's missing. The exact default value can be a placeholder, but perhaps the user expects a certain structure.

Alternatively, maybe the 'schema' refers to a structure that needs to be added. For example, each resource might need an 'observer' field with a 'schema' subfield. But without knowing, perhaps the function is simply adding the 'observer' key with a default value.

Alternatively, maybe the default is to set the observer to "Status" or "Spec", common in some operator frameworks. For instance, in Kudo, the observer can be set to "spec" or "status".

Alternatively, perhaps the default is to have the observer watch all fields, so the schema is a wildcard. Maybe the default is an empty schema, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a new list of resources with the default observer schema applied. But since the function's return is not mentioned, maybe it's modifying the existing app's spec.manifest.

Let me write the code as follows. The function iterates over each resource in app.spec.manifest, checks if the 'observer' key exists. If not, sets it to 'DefaultObserver'. Or perhaps the key is 'schema'? The problem mentions 'observer schema', so maybe the key is 'observerSchema'.

Wait, the function's name is generate_default_observer_schema. So maybe each resource has an 'observer' and 'schema' field, or a combined one. Let me think of the key as 'observerSchema'.

So:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = {'kind': 'Default', 'apiVersion': 'v1'}

Alternatively, maybe the default is a string, like "Default", so:

resource['observer'] = 'Default'

But the problem says "schema", so it's more likely a dictionary.

Alternatively, perhaps the default schema is a specific structure that includes all fields. Maybe the default is an empty dictionary, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a schema that includes all necessary fields, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the default observer schema is to use the 'metadata' and 'spec' fields. But again, without specifics, it's hard to know. The problem might expect a simple check and adding a default key.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'observer' is part of the resource's 'metadata' and the schema is part of the 'spec'? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is adding a 'schema' field to each resource's 'observer' section. Like, if the resource has an 'observer' key, then check if 'schema' is present. But the problem states that the custom observer schema hasn't been specified, so maybe the absence of the entire 'observer' field.

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to check for the presence of 'observer' in the resource. If not, assign a default. Let's proceed with that.

Wait, the function's docstring says "for each Kubernetes resource present in spec.manifest for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified". So the default is applied to the resource's own observer schema. So each resource in the manifest can have their own observer schema. If it's not present, we add the default.

So the code would loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest, and for each, if they don't have an 'observerSchema' key, then set it to the default.

Assuming the default is a dictionary with some standard keys, but since the user didn't specify, maybe just a simple default value. Let's pick a placeholder like {'type': 'default'}.

Alternatively, perhaps the default is to set the observer to "All" and the schema to something else. But without more info, I'll go with the first approach.

Another thought: maybe the observer schema is part of a 'status' or 'spec' field. For example, in some operator frameworks, the observer might look at certain fields. So the code might need to check a deeper structure.

Alternatively, maybe the 'schema' is a separate object. Let me think of an example. Suppose each resource in the manifest is a dictionary like:

{
    'apiVersion': 'v1',
    'kind': 'Pod',
    'metadata': {'name': 'example'},
    'spec': {'containers': [...]},
    'observer': {'schema': 'some value'}
}

Then, if 'observer' is not present in the resource, the function adds it with the default schema. Or if 'schema' is not present under 'observer', then set it.

The problem states "custom observer schema hasn't been specified", which could mean that the entire 'observer' field is missing. So the code would check if the 'observer' key is present in the resource. If not, add it with a default schema.

Alternatively, maybe the 'observerSchema' is a key in the resource. So the code would look for that key.

Alternatively, maybe the default is to use the Kubernetes resource's own kind as part of the schema. But again, not sure.

Given the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest, and for each resource, if it does not have an 'observer' key, set it to a default value. Let's pick a simple default of 'All' as a string.

Alternatively, perhaps the default schema is a dictionary with a 'kind' and 'apiVersion' similar to the resource itself. Like, for a Deployment, the observer schema would have the same kind and apiVersion, but that might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the default is to set the observer to 'Generic' or something like that.

So, the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer' not in resource:
            resource['observer'] = 'Default'

But perhaps the key is 'observerSchema', so:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = {'kind': 'Default', 'apiVersion': 'v1'}

Alternatively, maybe the default is a string, like 'Status' or 'Spec'. Let me think of possible scenarios. For example, in some contexts, the observer type could be 'json' or 'events', so the default might be 'json'.

But since I have to make a choice, I'll go with the first approach where the function adds a key called 'observer' with the value 'Default' if it's missing. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the schema, but the problem says "generate" which implies modifying the resources in place.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of an operator that uses a specific framework, like KUDO or OLM, where the observer schema is a required field. But without knowing, I'll proceed with the basic code.

Wait, maybe the 'schema' is a separate structure. Maybe the default is to create a schema that includes all the necessary fields for the observer to track. But how to represent that in code?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a default schema for each resource type, so for a Deployment, the schema is different than for a Service. But without more info, that's hard to do.

Alternatively, perhaps the default is a generic schema, so the code just adds a default entry where missing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each resource's default is set, but since the parameters include the app, perhaps it's modifying the app's manifest directly.

In any case, the code needs to loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest and set the observer schema if not present.

I think the best code is to loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest and check for the presence of 'observerSchema' key. If not, set it to a default. Let's choose a default that's a simple dictionary, maybe with some generic fields.

Alternatively, maybe the default is to have the observer schema as a string. Let's see. The problem says "schema", which could be a string indicating the type.

Alternatively, perhaps the default is to set the 'schema' field within the 'observer' section. Like:

if 'observer' not in resource or 'schema' not in resource['observer']:
    resource['observer'] = {'schema': 'default'}

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to decide.

Hmm, maybe the function is part of a system where each resource in the manifest can have an 'observer' field, and the default is to set that to a specific value. Let's go with the simplest code that makes sense based on the given info.

The function's name is generate_default_observer_schema, so perhaps each resource needs a schema for the observer. The default could be an empty schema or a standard one. Let's assume that each resource should have an 'observer' key with a default value. Let's use 'Default' as the value.

So the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer' not in resource:
            resource['observer'] = 'Default'

Alternatively, maybe the key is 'schema' under an 'observer' section. Like, if there's no 'observer' key, add it with a 'schema' subkey. Or if the 'schema' is missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'observerSchema' is a separate top-level key. Let's try:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not resource.get('observerSchema'):
            resource['observerSchema'] = 'DefaultSchema'

But again, the exact structure is unclear. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I think the best approach is to assume that each resource in the manifest is a dictionary, and the function checks for the presence of a key called 'observer' or 'observerSchema', and sets it to a default value if it's missing.

Looking back at the problem statement, the function's purpose is to generate the default for resources where a custom one hasn't been specified. So the code should check if the resource already has that key. Let's proceed with the 'observer' key.

Wait, perhaps the 'observer' is part of the 'spec' of the resource. Like, the resource has a 'spec' that includes an 'observer' field. In that case:

for resource in app.spec.manifest:
    if 'observer' not in resource.get('spec', {}):
        resource['spec']['observer'] = 'Default'

But that's making an assumption about the structure. Since the problem mentions 'spec.manifest', maybe the app's spec has a 'manifest' key, which is a list of resources, each of which can have their own 'observer' key. So the first approach is better.

Alternatively, maybe the 'observer' is a top-level key in each resource.

Hmm, given the lack of specifics, I'll go with the code that loops through each resource in the app's spec.manifest and sets 'observer' to 'Default' if it's not present.

Alternatively, maybe the default is 'Status' or 'Spec', but I can't be sure. Since the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps the simplest possible code that fits the description is acceptable.

So, the code would be something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer' not in resource:
            resource['observer'] = 'Default'

Wait, but maybe the 'schema' part is important. So perhaps the key is 'schema' under an 'observer' field. Like:

if 'observer' not in resource or 'schema' not in resource['observer']:
    resource['observer'] = {'schema': 'default'}

Alternatively, the key is 'observerSchema', so the code checks for that. Let me choose 'observerSchema' as the key. So:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = 'default'

But the user might expect a more structured schema. Let's think of a possible structure. Maybe the schema is a dictionary with 'kind' and 'apiVersion', similar to the resource's own kind. For example, the default schema for a Deployment would have the same kind and apiVersion as the Deployment itself. But how would that be implemented?

Alternatively, maybe the default is a fixed schema that applies to all resources. Like:

default = {"kind": "CustomResource", "apiVersion": "api.example.com/v1", "metadata": {"name": "default"}}

Then, for each resource without an observerSchema, set it to that default.

But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the default is an empty dictionary or a simple string.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a list of schemas, but the function's parameters suggest it's modifying the app's manifest.

Hmm. Let's try to write code that adds a 'schema' field to each resource's 'observer' if it's not present. So:

for resource in app.spec.manifest:
    observer = resource.get('observer', {})
    if not observer.get('schema'):
        observer['schema'] = 'default'
    resource['observer'] = observer

Wait, but that's assuming the 'observer' is a dictionary. Maybe the 'observer' is a string, so that approach wouldn't work. Alternatively, perhaps the 'observerSchema' is a separate key.

Alternatively, maybe each resource in the manifest has an 'observer' key, and if it's not present, the default is applied. Let's proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is adding a default 'schema' to each resource in the manifest, and the key is 'schema' under 'observer'. But without more info, I'll proceed with the simplest code.

Let me go with the code that loops through each resource in app.spec.manifest and sets the 'observer' key to 'Default' if it's missing. That's straightforward and fits the problem's description.

Wait, but the function's name is generate_default_observer_schema. Maybe the 'schema' is part of the 'observer' field. For example:

Each resource has an 'observer' field which can have a 'schema' subfield. So the code would check if 'schema' is present in the 'observer' dictionary. If not, set it to the default.

But then the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        observer = resource.get('observer', {})
        if 'schema' not in observer:
            observer['schema'] = 'default'
        resource['observer'] = observer

But that requires that the 'observer' exists. If the 'observer' itself is not present, maybe we need to create it.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'observer' is a top-level key and the 'schema' is a nested key. Or maybe the 'schema' is the entire structure. This is getting too ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the 'observer' is a separate field and the default is just a string. Let me proceed with that first approach.

Another possibility: the 'spec.manifest' contains resources that are in the form of dictionaries with 'kind', and the default observer schema is determined based on the kind. But again, without specifics, I can't code that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a schema that includes all the resources, but the problem says "generate" for each resource in the manifest.

Hmm. I think the best approach here is to loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest and add a default 'observer' key if it's missing. The exact value can be a placeholder like 'default'.

Alternatively, maybe the default schema is to set the 'schema' field to a specific value, like 'Kubernetes', so:

resource['schema'] = 'Kubernetes'

But the problem mentions 'observer schema', so perhaps combining both 'observer' and 'schema' into a single key 'observerSchema'.

So the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    default = {"kind": "Default"}
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = default

Alternatively, perhaps the default is an empty dictionary, but that might not be useful. Maybe the default is a string.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set the 'observer' field to "All" and the 'schema' to something else. But again, without knowing, I have to make a decision.

Another thought: maybe the 'observer' schema is a separate object that the function constructs. For each resource in the manifest, if they don't have an observer schema specified, then create one with default values. The exact structure is up to the function, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code just adds a key like 'schema' with a default value.

Alternatively, perhaps the default is to set the observer to watch all fields, so the schema is a wildcard. But how to represent that?

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to return a schema for the app that includes all the resources, but the problem states it's for each resource in the manifest where a custom one hasn't been specified. So the code needs to process each resource individually.

Given that the user wants code without any explanation, I need to choose a structure that's plausible. Let's assume each resource in the manifest is a dictionary and the function adds a 'observer' key with a default value if it's missing. Let's pick 'All' as the default.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is adding an 'observer' field with the default value of 'Default' to each resource in the app's spec.manifest that doesn't have it.

Thus, the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer' not in resource:
            resource['observer'] = 'Default'

Alternatively, maybe the 'schema' is part of the 'observer' field. Like, 'observer' is a dictionary with 'schema' as a key. So:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer' not in resource or 'schema' not in resource['observer']:
            resource['observer'] = {'schema': 'default'}

But this requires that the 'observer' is a dictionary. Maybe that's better.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'observerSchema' is a top-level key, so:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    default = {"kind": "ClusterServiceVersion", "apiVersion": "operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1"}
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = default

But I don't know if that's correct. Maybe the default is just a simple 'default' string.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is adding a 'schema' field to each resource's 'observer' section. So:

for resource in app.spec.manifest:
    if not resource.get('observer', {}).get('schema'):
        resource['observer'] = {'schema': 'default'}

But that would overwrite the entire 'observer' dictionary if it existed without the 'schema' key. Maybe that's not desired.

Alternatively, the function should check if the 'observer' exists and has a 'schema' key. If not, then set the 'schema' key to default.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a framework where each resource in the manifest has an 'observer' key, and the 'schema' is part of that. So the code would look for the 'schema' inside the 'observer' dictionary.

Alternatively, the 'observerSchema' is a separate key. Let me think of common practices. In Kubernetes, resources have a schema defined by their apiVersion and kind, so maybe the default is to use the same apiVersion and kind as the resource itself. But how to implement that.

For example, each resource has 'kind' and 'apiVersion', so the default schema could be a dictionary containing those:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = {
                'kind': resource['kind'],
                'apiVersion': resource['apiVersion']
            }

This makes sense because the observer schema would be based on the resource's own type. That could be a reasonable default.

But the problem says "custom observer schema hasn't been specified", so if the resource has an 'observerSchema' key, we leave it as is. If not, we create one using the resource's own kind and apiVersion.

This approach seems plausible. Let me code that.

Wait, but what if the resource doesn't have 'kind' or 'apiVersion'? Probably, every Kubernetes resource has those, so that's okay.

So the code would loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest, check if 'observerSchema' is present. If not, create it by taking the resource's own kind and apiVersion.

Alternatively, maybe the 'observerSchema' is a separate structure, but I think this is a good approach given the information.

Alternatively, maybe the default schema is a fixed value, not dependent on the resource's type. But the question doesn't say that.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects that each resource gets a default schema that's generic, like {'type': 'default'}.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a list of schemas, but the problem's function signature doesn't specify return type. Since the user said to output the code, perhaps it's modifying the app's manifest in place.

In any case, I think the best approach here is to loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest, and for each that doesn't have 'observerSchema', set it to a default based on their own kind and apiVersion. Let's proceed with that.

So the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = {
                'kind': resource.get('kind', 'DefaultKind'),
                'apiVersion': resource.get('apiVersion', 'v1')
            }

Wait, but if the resource doesn't have 'kind' or 'apiVersion', then perhaps we can't do that. But in Kubernetes, every resource has those, so maybe we can safely assume they are present.

Alternatively, maybe the default is a generic schema, not dependent on the resource's type. Like:

resource['observerSchema'] = {'type': 'generic'}

But the problem says "for each Kubernetes resource", so maybe the default should be specific to the resource's kind.

Alternatively, maybe the default is a fixed schema, like 'Kubernetes' or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'observer' is a top-level key, and the schema is part of that. But the problem's wording says "schema", so maybe the function is setting the 'schema' field within the 'observer' section.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set the 'schema' key in each resource to a default value if it's not present.

Hmm, given the time constraints and the need to provide code, I'll proceed with the first approach where the 'observerSchema' is a key in the resource's dictionary, and if it's missing, it's set to a default with the same kind and apiVersion as the resource.

So the code would look like this:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            resource['observerSchema'] = {
                'kind': resource['kind'],
                'apiVersion': resource['apiVersion']
            }

This way, each resource's observer schema defaults to its own kind and apiVersion, which makes sense. But I need to make sure that 'kind' and 'apiVersion' are present in each resource. If they are, then this works. Otherwise, maybe use a default value.

Alternatively, to avoid KeyError, perhaps use .get() with a default:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observerSchema' not in resource:
            kind = resource.get('kind', 'Unknown')
            api_version = resource.get('apiVersion', 'v1')
            resource['observerSchema'] = {'kind': kind, 'apiVersion': api_version}

This handles cases where the resource might not have those keys, but in Kubernetes, they should be present. So maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the default schema is a simple string like "Kubernetes" or "Generic". But the problem says 'schema', so a dictionary makes more sense.

Alternatively, maybe the observer schema is a list of fields to watch. But again, without specifics, it's hard to say.

Given that, I think the code I wrote earlier is the best bet. Let me check again. The function's purpose is to generate the default for resources where a custom one hasn't been specified. So if the 'observerSchema' key is missing, set it to a default based on the resource's own kind and apiVersion. That seems logical.

Alternatively, perhaps the default is a fixed structure, like:

{'type': 'io.k8s', 'version': 'v1'}

But again, without knowing, I'll go with the first approach.

Another possibility: the 'observer' is a separate field, and the 'schema' is another. But the function's name combines them, so perhaps the key is 'observerSchema'.

Okay, I'll proceed with that code.
