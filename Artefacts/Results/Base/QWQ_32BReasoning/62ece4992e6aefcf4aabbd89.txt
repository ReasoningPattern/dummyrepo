Okay, I need to write a Python function called gaussian that calculates the Gaussian value for a given x with the parameters μ=0.2 and σ=0.1. Let's see, the Gaussian formula is (1/(σ*sqrt(2π))) * e^(-((x-μ)^2)/(2σ²)). 

First, I should import the necessary math functions. The exponent part will use math.exp, and the square root needs math.sqrt. Also, π is math.pi. 

The function starts with def gaussian(x):. The docstring says u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1, so those are constants here. I'll assign them inside the function. 

Wait, but since μ and σ are fixed, I can just use the values directly. So, subtract x by 0.2 in the exponent. Then divide by 2*(0.1)^2. 

The denominator in the first part is σ multiplied by sqrt(2π). Let me make sure I get the order right. The formula is 1 over (σ * sqrt(2π)), right?

Putting it all together: compute the exponent term first, then the numerator, then the denominator. So, the steps would be:

1. Calculate the exponent: - (x - 0.2)^2 / (2 * 0.1^2)
2. Compute e raised to that exponent.
3. Multiply by 1 divided by (0.1 * sqrt(2 * π))).

Wait, but in code terms, I have to use math.exp and math.sqrt. Let me structure that step by step. 

Maybe:

exponent = - ( (x - 0.2)**2 ) / (2 * (0.1)**2 )
denominator = 0.1 * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi)
result = (math.exp(exponent) ) / denominator

Then return the result. 

Wait, the formula is (1/(σ√(2π))) * e^(- (x-μ)^2/(2σ²) ), so yes, that's correct. 

I should also make sure to import the math module at the beginning. So the code will start with import math. 

Wait, but sometimes people write it as from math import exp, sqrt, pi to avoid the math. prefix. But the standard way is to use the module name. So probably better to do import math.

Putting it all together. The function body would be:

import math

def gaussian(x):
    """
    Calculate Gaussian centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1.
    """
    mu = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2*(sigma**2))
    return (math.exp(exponent)) / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))

Hmm, but wait, the parameters are given as u is 0.2. Oh right, μ is the mean, so that's u. So the code uses mu as the variable. 

Alternatively, maybe the variables can be set directly without assigning to mu and sigma. Like, just plug in 0.2 and 0.1. But using variables makes it clearer and easier to adjust if needed. The problem states they are fixed, so it's okay. 

Wait, the function's docstring says "centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1". So those are the parameters. Therefore, the code must use those exact values. 

So, the code is correct as written. Let me check the formula again. The Gaussian probability density function is indeed (1/(σ√(2π))) * e^(- (x-μ)^2/(2σ²) ). 

Yes, so the code should correctly compute that. Let me think if there's any possible error. Oh, operator precedence: the exponent calculation must have parentheses around (x - mu) squared, and the denominator 2*(sigma squared). 

The calculation of exponent: (x - mu)**2 is in the numerator, divided by (2 * sigma**2). The negative sign applies to the entire fraction. 

So the parentheses are correctly placed here. 

I think that's it. The code should be straightforward. Let me just write it out again.
