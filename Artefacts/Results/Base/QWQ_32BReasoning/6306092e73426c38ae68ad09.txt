Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function validate_length_args based on the provided docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says to check if the value of the given args is not longer than the specified length. Wait, but the parameters are a bit unclear. The function's parameters are self and args. Hmm, maybe args is a dictionary containing the arguments to check, each with a specified maximum length? Or perhaps each argument has a length constraint that needs to be validated.

The function's name is validate_length_args, so maybe it's part of a class where each instance has some predefined length constraints for certain fields. The args parameter might be the values to check against those constraints. But the docstring mentions "the given args" which could mean that each argument in args has a key that corresponds to a length in another structure, like a dictionary stored in the class instance. Alternatively, maybe each argument in args is supposed to have a maximum length that's specified in the function's parameters, but the current signature only includes 'args' as a parameter. Wait, the docstring's first line says "Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified." So perhaps each argument in the args has a maximum length that's already defined somewhere, maybe in the class's attributes. Like, for each key in args, there's a corresponding length in self.lengths or something similar?

Alternatively, maybe the args is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the argument name and its maximum allowed length. But the function's parameters only have 'args', so I need to look at the docstring again. The parameters listed are just args, but the description says "the given args" which might refer to each of the arguments passed in. Wait, perhaps the function is expecting a dictionary where each key is an argument name, and the value is a tuple containing the actual value and the maximum allowed length. Or maybe the args is a dictionary where each key is the argument name and the value is the maximum length, and the actual data to check is stored elsewhere. That's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a validation system where each argument has a specified length. The function could loop through each key in the args, get the value from some place (like another dictionary), and compare its length to the specified maximum. But without more details, I have to make some assumptions here.

Looking at the function's parameters, it's def validate_length_args(self, args). The docstring says that the args are the received arguments. So perhaps each argument in the args (maybe a dictionary) has a value that needs to be checked against a predefined maximum length. The problem is, how do we know the specified length? Maybe the class has an attribute like self.max_lengths which is a dictionary mapping argument names to their maximum allowed lengths. So the function would iterate over each key in args, check the length of the value against self.max_lengths[key], and raise an error if any value is too long.

Wait, but the docstring mentions "the length specified" but the parameters don't include a length. So perhaps the length is part of the args structure? Like each element in args is a tuple (name, value, max_length). Or maybe the args are passed as a list of arguments where each argument has an associated maximum length. Hmm, the function's parameters are just 'args', so maybe args is a dictionary where each key is the argument name, and the value is another dictionary containing the actual value and the max length. Or perhaps each key in args corresponds to an attribute in self that has a 'max_length' property.

Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to take a dictionary where each key is the argument name and the value is the maximum allowed length. Then, the actual data to check is in another parameter, but the current signature only has 'args' and self. Wait, the docstring says "the given args" as the parameters. The function's parameters are self and args. The first line of the docstring says to check if the value of the given args is not longer than the specified length. The wording is a bit ambiguous here. Maybe each of the arguments in args has a value, and each has a specified maximum length that is stored in another part of the class, like a configuration. 

Alternatively, perhaps the args parameter is a list of tuples where each tuple is (argument_name, value, max_length). But the function's parameters don't have that. The docstring says "the received arguments" so maybe args is a dictionary where each key is the argument name and the value is the actual data. Then, the class has a separate way to know the maximum allowed length for each argument. For example, maybe there's a dictionary in the class that defines the max lengths for each field. The function would check each value in args against the max length from that dictionary. 

Assuming that the class has a max_lengths attribute, which is a dictionary mapping argument names to their maximum allowed lengths, then the code could be something like:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    for key, value in args.items():
        max_len = self.max_lengths.get(key)
        if max_len is not None and len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"The value for '{key}' exceeds maximum allowed length of {max_len}.")
    return True

But wait, the function's docstring says "Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified." So perhaps each argument in the args has a 'length specified' somewhere. Since the function is part of a class, maybe each argument's maximum length is stored in the class instance. So the code would loop through each key in args, get the max length from self's attributes, compare the length of the value, and raise an error if any is too long.

Alternatively, maybe the args are a list where each element is a tuple (field_name, max_length), and the actual value is stored in another place, but that doesn't fit with the parameter being called 'args' as the received arguments. 

Another possibility: the function is supposed to check that each value in the args dictionary has a length not exceeding a certain predefined length. But since the function's parameters don't include the length, perhaps the length is a class attribute or instance variable. For example, maybe each key in args has a corresponding key in self.length_constraints, which holds the maximum allowed length. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a form validation class where each field has its own maximum length. So in the class, there might be a method to get the max length for each field, and this function checks each field in args against that.

Without more context, I'll have to make an assumption here. Let's assume that the args is a dictionary where each key is the name of an argument, and the value is the actual data (like a string or list) that needs to be checked. The class has another dictionary (like self.max_lengths) that maps each argument name to its maximum allowed length. The function loops through each key in args, checks the length of the value against self.max_lengths[key], and raises an error if any value's length exceeds the specified max.

Wait, but the function's parameters only include 'args', so maybe the max length is part of each argument's structure. Like each argument in args is a tuple where the first element is the name, the second is the value, and the third is the max length. But then the parameter 'args' would be a list of such tuples, and the function would loop through them. But the docstring says "the given args" are the received arguments. Hmm, perhaps the args are a dictionary where each key is an argument name and the value is a tuple of (data, max_length). Then, the function would check each data's length against the max_length. 

Alternatively, maybe the args is a list of arguments, each with a 'max_length' attribute. But that's unclear. The docstring's first line is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified." The 'length specified' might refer to a length that is part of the arguments. For example, maybe each argument in args is a key-value pair where the value's length must be <= some length that is stored in the class. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check that the length of the arguments (like the number of arguments passed) is not longer than a specified length. But that's less likely given the wording. The function's name is validate_length_args, so it's more about the length of the values of the arguments, not the number of arguments.

Hmm, maybe I should structure the function to loop through each argument in args, get the value's length, and compare it to a predefined maximum. But since the parameters don't include the length, I have to assume that the max length is stored elsewhere in the class. So the code would look for each key in args, check against self's max lengths for that key, and raise an error if any are too long. 

Alternatively, perhaps the args are passed as a list of (field, value) pairs, and there's a separate configuration for each field's max length. But again, the code would need to access that. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to take a dictionary of arguments where each key is the argument name and the value is the data to check. Then, the class has a max_lengths attribute. So in the code, for each key in args, we check if the key is in self.max_lengths. If it is, we check the length of args[key] against that. If it's longer, we raise an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where each argument in the args has a corresponding 'max_length' parameter, but the function's parameters don't include that. Wait, the docstring says "length specified" but doesn't mention where. Maybe the function is supposed to have the lengths specified in the args themselves. Like each element in args is a tuple (name, value, max_length). But that would require the args to be structured that way. 

Alternatively, maybe the args are a list of strings, and the function checks each string's length against a fixed length. But the docstring says "the given args" so perhaps it's a dictionary. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is expecting a list of arguments, and each argument has a 'length' attribute that's specified. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a method where each argument passed to it has a maximum length. For example, in a data validation class, the args could be a dictionary of fields and their values, and the class has a separate dictionary that defines the maximum length for each field. 

So the code would loop through each key in the args dictionary. For each key, get the max length from self's max_lengths (or similar) for that key. If the length of the value exceeds that, raise an error. 

But since the user hasn't provided any other details, I have to go with the most common scenario. Let's think of a typical use case where you have a set of fields with maximum allowed lengths, and you pass the current values to validate. So the args are the values to check, and the max lengths are stored in the class. 

Alternatively, maybe the args is a list of arguments where each is a dictionary with 'name', 'value', and 'max_length' keys, but that seems a bit more complex. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take a single argument which is a dictionary, and for each key in that dictionary, the value's length must not exceed a certain length, which is perhaps passed via another parameter not listed here? But the function signature only has 'args'. 

Hmm. The problem is that the function's parameters are only self and args, and the docstring says the length is specified but doesn't clarify where. Maybe the function's purpose is to check each argument in the args (like a list) has a length not exceeding some value. But without knowing where the length is specified, perhaps the function is missing parameters. Wait, perhaps the function is part of a system where the maximum length is a class attribute. Like for each key in args, the class has a corresponding attribute for the max length, such as self.field_max_length. Or maybe the function is supposed to check the total length of all arguments combined? But the wording says "value of the given args", which suggests each individual argument's value.

Alternatively, maybe the function is expecting each argument in the args to have a 'length' attribute, but that's not standard. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a system where the args are passed as a dictionary where each key is the field name, and the value is the data. The class has a dictionary that maps each field name to its maximum length. So the function would loop through each key in args, check if the field's maximum length exists (maybe via self.max_length.get(key)), and then compare the length of the value to that. 

Given that, I think the code would be something like:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    for key, value in args.items():
        max_len = self.max_lengths.get(key)
        if max_len is not None and len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"Value for '{key}' exceeds maximum length of {max_len}.")
    return True

Wait, but the function's name is validate_length_args, and the docstring says to check if the value is not longer than the specified length. So maybe the function is supposed to return True if all are valid, else raise an error. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check each argument's length against a specified maximum that is part of the args structure. Like each argument in the args has a 'max_length' attribute, but that would require args to be objects with such attributes, which isn't clear from the problem description. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'args' is a list of arguments, each of which is a string, and the length is specified in another parameter. But since the function's signature doesn't have that, perhaps the length is a fixed value in the class. But then the function's name and docstring would be ambiguous. 

Hmm, perhaps I should look for similar patterns in Python code. For instance, in a form validation class, you might have a method that checks each field's value against its maximum length. The method would take the fields and their values as a dictionary (args), and the maximum lengths are stored in another part of the class. 

Assuming that's the case, then the code would loop through each key-value pair in args, check the length against self.max_lengths[key], and raise an error if any value is too long. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check the total length of all arguments? But that's unlikely given the wording. 

Another thought: perhaps the 'args' is a list of arguments, and each is a string, and the function checks each string's length against a length specified in the method's parameters. But the parameters only have 'args', so that can't be. 

Wait, maybe the function is part of a class where each instance has a 'length' attribute, and the function checks that the number of arguments in 'args' is not longer than that length. But that's a stretch. The function's name suggests it's validating the length of the arguments' values, not the count. 

Alternatively, maybe each argument in the args has a 'length' parameter in their own data structure. For example, each argument could be a dictionary with 'value' and 'max_length' keys. Then the code would loop through each argument in args, check the length of the value against max_length. But in that case, args would be a list of such dictionaries. 

Alternatively, perhaps the args are passed as a dictionary where each key is the field name, and the value is the data. The class has a separate dictionary (like self.field_max_lengths) which holds the maximum allowed length for each field. 

So the code would look like that. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the length of the arguments (the total number of arguments) doesn't exceed a certain value, but again, the wording says "the value of the given args", which implies the values of the arguments, not the count. 

Hmm, I think the best approach here is to assume that the args is a dictionary where each key is an argument's name and the value is the data (like a string), and the class has a max_lengths attribute which is a dictionary mapping those argument names to their maximum allowed lengths. Then the function iterates over each key in args, checks if the length of the value exceeds the max length for that key, and if so, raises an error. 

So the code would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    for key, value in args.items():
        max_len = self.max_lengths.get(key)
        if max_len is not None and len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"Value for '{key}' exceeds maximum length of {max_len}.")
    return True

Wait, but what if the key isn't present in self.max_lengths? Maybe we should only check those keys that have a specified maximum length. So the function skips those without a max length. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check all keys in args, and if any of them has a length longer than their specified maximum (which is stored in the class), then raise an error. 

Another possible edge case: what if the value is not a string? Like a list or another object. The len() function works for those as well, so it's okay. 

I think that's a reasonable approach. The function raises an error if any value in the args dictionary exceeds the maximum length specified in the class's max_lengths dictionary. 

Now, since the user wants the code generated without any explanation, just the code in markdown format. So I need to structure it correctly. 

Wait, the function is inside a class. So the code would be part of the class. But the user didn't mention the class structure, so the function is written as a method. 

The function's parameters are self and args. 

The docstring says to check if the value of the given args is not longer than the specified length. So each value in the args (the dictionary) must have a length <= the specified max for that key. 

Therefore, the code would loop through each key-value pair in args, get the max length from self's max_lengths (or similar), and if the value's length is too big, raise an error. 

So I'll proceed with that code. Let me make sure to include the docstring as given. 

The user's docstring has a note about parameters: \n:param args: The received arguments. So the code must have that docstring. 

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for key, value in args.items():
        max_len = self.max_lengths.get(key)
        if max_len is not None and len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"Value for '{key}' exceeds maximum allowed length of {max_len}.")
    return True

Wait, but in the code, the function may not have self.max_lengths. So perhaps the code is expecting that the class has a max_lengths attribute. Since the user didn't specify, but in a typical scenario, that's the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the max length as part of the args, but given the parameters, I think the first approach is better. 

Another possible issue: maybe the args are not a dictionary but a list. But the docstring says "the given args" as the parameter, which could be a dictionary. The function's name is validate_length_args, which suggests multiple arguments. 

So I think that's the way to go. The code should loop through each key-value in args, check the length against the max_lengths stored in the class. 

Wait, but the user's function may have a different structure. Let me see the original problem again. The user provided the function signature and the docstring. The docstring says to check if the value of the given args is not longer than the specified length. The parameters are args, which are the received arguments. 

Hmm, perhaps the args are passed as a list of (field, value, max_length) tuples, but then the function would need to loop through each tuple. But in that case, the code would be different. 

Alternatively, maybe the args is a single argument, but the function is supposed to check its length against a specified value. But then the name would be singular. 

Wait the function name is plural, so probably multiple arguments. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that each argument's value is not longer than a certain length, but that length is specified as an attribute of the argument. But without more info, this is hard. 

Hmm. Given the problem constraints, perhaps the most straightforward solution is to have the function check each value in the args dictionary against a predefined maximum length stored in self.max_length for each key. 

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class where each instance has a 'max_length' attribute for each argument. But that would require each argument to have its own attribute, which may not be efficient. So using a dictionary is better. 

Therefore, the code I wrote earlier should be correct. 

Wait, but in the code, self.max_lengths is assumed. Since the user's code may have that, but in the given problem, there's no mention. But the function is part of a class, so it's okay to refer to self's attributes. 

I think that's the best approach here. So the final code would be as above. Let me also check for possible exceptions, like if the value is not a string or something that can have a length. But the problem says "value of the given args" so len() must be applicable. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check the length of the arguments' keys? Probably not. 

So I'll proceed with the code I have. Also, note that the user's docstring has a \n:param args: which needs to be preserved exactly. 

Wait, the docstring's first line ends with a period, then the next line is the parameter. So when writing the code, the docstring should exactly match what was given. Let me make sure the docstring is written correctly. 

The user's docstring is:

"""
Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
"""

Hmm, the \n is probably a mistake, maybe they meant to have a new line with the param. But in the code, the docstring should be written as is. So the line after the first has \n:param args: which would show as a newline in the string. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have the parameters section as part of the docstring, using the standard format. Like:

"""
Check if the value of the given args is not longer than the specified length.

:param args: The received arguments.
"""

But since they wrote it with \n:param args: then the code must include that exactly. 

So in the generated code, the docstring must have that \n. 

Therefore, the code would have the docstring as given. 

So putting it all together:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for key, value in args.items():
        max_len = self.max_lengths.get(key)
        if max_len is not None and len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"Value for '{key}' exceeds maximum allowed length of {max_len}.")
    return True

Wait, but perhaps the function should return a boolean instead of raising an exception? The docstring doesn't say whether it raises an error or returns a boolean. The first line says "Check if...", which suggests that it might return a boolean indicating validity. But in the code, if it's raising an error, then it's more like a validation that throws exceptions on failure, and returns True on success. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return True if all are valid, else False, but then how does it know which ones are invalid? The standard way in Python for validation is to raise exceptions. 

Looking at the function's name, 'validate_length_args', and the presence of a return statement (return True), that suggests that the function is returning a boolean. But in the code above, it raises an error when invalid, and returns True otherwise. 

So the code is structured that way. 

Another possible point: maybe the 'args' is a list of arguments, not a dictionary. Then, the code would need to check the length of each argument. But the problem says "the given args" which are the arguments, and the function is supposed to check their values. 

Alternatively, perhaps the args are a list where each element is a tuple (name, value, max_length). Then, the code would loop through each element in args and check. 

But given the current parameters, the function is given 'args' as a parameter. The code I have assumes args is a dictionary. 

Alternatively, maybe the args is a list of strings, and the function checks each string's length against a specified length. But the function's parameters don't include the length. 

Hmm, this is a bit of a problem. The function's signature has only 'args', but the docstring mentions a "length specified" without indicating where. 

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to check the length of the arguments themselves, like the total number of arguments in the list. But that would be a count, not the length of their values. 

Alternatively, maybe each argument in the args list has a specified maximum length, and the function checks each one. For example, if args is a list where each element is a dictionary with 'value' and 'max_length', then the code would loop through each element. 

But without knowing the structure of 'args', it's hard. 

The problem might be expecting a different approach. Let me think again. 

The function's name is validate_length_args, and the docstring says to check if the value of the given args is not longer than the specified length. The parameter args is the received arguments. 

Maybe the function is supposed to check that each argument in args (the list) has a length not exceeding a certain value. Like, each argument is a string, and they all must be <= some length. But then where is the length specified? 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class where each instance has a 'length' attribute, so the function checks that each value in the args (maybe a list) is <= self.length. 

But the function's parameters are self and args. 

Wait, maybe the args are a dictionary where each key is the argument name and the value is the maximum allowed length. Then, the actual data to check is in another parameter. But that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, the function could be expecting a list of arguments where each has a 'max_length' attribute, but that's unclear. 

Hmm. Given the ambiguity, I think the best assumption is that the args is a dictionary of field-value pairs, and the class has a max_lengths dictionary that holds the maximum allowed lengths for each field. The function iterates over each field, checks the length, and raises an error if any exceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the args are passed as a list of tuples where each tuple is (field_name, value), and the max lengths are stored in a class attribute. Then, the code would be:

for field, value in args:
    max_len = self.max_lengths.get(field)
    etc. 

But in that case, args would be a list of tuples, so the code would need to loop through those. 

But the function's parameter is called 'args', which is a common name for a dictionary of arguments. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a system where each argument's maximum length is specified in the args themselves. Like, each argument in the args is a key-value pair where the key is the field name and the value is a dictionary containing the actual value and the max length. 

For example, args could be something like: {'name': {'value': 'John', 'max_length': 10}, ...}. But that's getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of arguments and a length, but the signature only includes 'args'. The user might have made a mistake in the signature. But I have to go with what's given. 

Hmm, maybe the function is part of a system where each argument in args has a 'length' parameter. Like, each argument is an object with a length attribute. But again, not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the args is a single value, but the function name is plural. 

Wait, perhaps the 'args' is a list of arguments, and each has a specified maximum length. For instance, each element in args is a tuple (value, max_length). Then the code would loop over each tuple and check. 

In that case, the code would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    for value, max_len in args:
        if len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError("Value exceeds maximum allowed length.")
    return True

But that's different from the first approach. 

The problem is that without knowing how the args are structured, it's hard to choose. 

Looking back at the docstring: "Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified." The wording "the given args" could mean that each arg has its own specified length. 

Alternatively, maybe 'args' is a list where each element is a dictionary with 'value' and 'length' keys. 

Hmm. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the first approach is better. Let me go with that. 

Another thought: perhaps the 'args' is a list of arguments, and the length specified is the length of the list. But that's not likely. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the total length of all arguments (sum of their lengths) doesn't exceed a certain value. But again, the parameters don't include that. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class where each instance has a 'length' attribute, and it's supposed to check that the length of each argument (like each string in the args) is less than self.length. 

In that case, the code would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    for arg in args:
        if len(arg) > self.length:
            raise ValueError("Argument is too long.")
    return True

But then the parameter 'args' would be a list of arguments, each of which is a string. 

But which approach is more likely? 

The function's name is validate_length_args, which suggests that each argument's length is validated. The docstring mentions "value of the given args", implying each individual value. 

If the args is a dictionary, then the code can check each field's length. 

Alternatively, if it's a list, then each item's length. 

The problem's description doesn't specify, but given that the parameter is named 'args' and the function is part of a class, maybe the first approach is more plausible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a data validation class where each field has a maximum length. For example, when creating a user, you have fields like 'username' which must be under 20 characters. The args here would be the fields and their values, and the class has a max_lengths dictionary. 

Therefore, the code I initially thought of would be appropriate. 

So the code would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for key, value in args.items():
        max_len = self.max_lengths.get(key)
        if max_len is not None and len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"Value for '{key}' exceeds maximum allowed length of {max_len}.")
    return True

Wait, but the user's docstring has the parameter line with \n, which in the code would create a new line. But in Python docstrings, the parameters are usually listed in a separate section. However, the user's docstring is written as:

"""
Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
"""

This means that the parameter section is on a new line but with the \n. So the docstring should exactly match that. 

So the code's docstring must have that exact text. 

Now, the code assumes that self has a max_lengths attribute, which is a dictionary. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the function is supposed to have another parameter, but the signature is as given. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check the length of the args themselves. Like, the length of the arguments (the number of keys in the dictionary) is not longer than some specified length. But that would be a different check. 

The problem states "value of the given args", so it's more likely the values' lengths are being checked. 

Another possible approach: perhaps the 'args' is a single argument, and the function checks its length against a specified value stored in the class. For example, self.length. 

But then the function's name would be validate_length_arg (singular). 

Hmm, the function's name is plural, so that's probably not the case. 

So I'll proceed with the first code I had. 

Wait, but in the code, the error message uses "maximum allowed length" but the docstring says "length specified". Maybe the message should use "specified" instead of "allowed". 

Like, "exceeds the specified maximum length of {max_len}". 

But the user's docstring doesn't give any examples. 

Alternatively, the message can stay as written. 

Also, the function returns True after checking all keys. 

Another edge case: what if the max_len is None? Then the function skips that key. So only keys present in self.max_lengths are checked. 

That's acceptable. 

I think this is the best I can do given the information. Now, I'll write the code exactly as that, without any extra comments or explanations, just the code in triple quotes as markdown. 

Wait, the user says to output only the code in Python markdown format. So they want the code enclosed in triple backticks, with the Python syntax. 

Wait, the user's instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be within ```python ... ``` tags. 

Wait, but the code is a method, so it's inside a class. But the user didn't mention the class structure. 

Hmm, perhaps the function is a standalone function, but the signature has 'self', so it must be a method. 

Therefore, the code will be written as a method, part of a class. 

But the user hasn't provided the class structure, so the code must be written as is. 

Therefore, the code is as above, with the function definition and the docstring. 

Wait, but in the code above, the function uses self.max_lengths, which isn't defined in the function's parameters. So the user's class must have that attribute. 

But the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps the code should raise an error if the key is not present in the max_lengths. Or maybe the function is supposed to have a different structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the args is a list where each element is a tuple of (value, max_length). For example, args = [('John', 10), ('Doe', 15)]. Then the code would loop over each tuple and check. 

In that case:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    for value, max_len in args:
        if len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"Value exceeds maximum allowed length of {max_len}.")
    return True

But then the parameter 'args' is a list of tuples. 

The docstring's parameter says "The received arguments" which could be a list of tuples. 

Hmm, but how would the function know which key to reference in the error message? 

Alternatively, the function could be designed to take a dictionary where each key has a value and a max_length stored in a tuple. Like args is a dictionary where each value is (actual_value, max_length). 

Then the code would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    for key in args:
        actual_value, max_len = args[key]
        if len(actual_value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"Value for '{key}' is too long.")
    return True

But then the parameter 'args' is structured as a dictionary with tuples. 

The problem's description isn't clear, but given the function's name and the docstring, I think the first approach (dictionary of fields with values, and class has a max_lengths dict) is better. 

Alternatively, perhaps the args are a list of strings, and the function checks each string's length against a predefined length stored in the class. Like self.max_length. 

Then the code would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    for arg in args:
        if len(arg) > self.max_length:
            raise ValueError("Argument exceeds maximum length.")
    return True

But that's a different interpretation. 

Hmm, given the ambiguity, but the presence of the 'args' parameter and the function being part of a class, I think the first approach is more plausible. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with the code I first wrote. 

Wait, but the user's docstring's parameter line has \n:param args: which in the code would be part of the docstring. So the docstring's first line ends with a period, then a new line with the param. 

So when written in code, the docstring would have that exactly. 

The final code would then be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for key, value in args.items():
        max_len = self.max_lengths.get(key)
        if max_len is not None and len(value) > max_len:
            raise ValueError(f"Value for '{key}' exceeds maximum allowed length of {max_len}.")
    return True

But I need to make sure that the code is correct and that the parameters are handled properly. 

Alternatively, maybe the args is a list of the arguments' values, and each has a corresponding maximum length stored in the class. Like, self.max_lengths is a list where each index corresponds to the argument's max length. 

But then the code would have to loop through the list and check each element's length against self.max_lengths[i], which would require that the lengths are in the same order as the arguments. That seems less likely. 

Hmm, perhaps the user expects the function to take a dictionary where each key is the name of the argument and the value is the data, and the maximum length is specified in the function's parameters but the signature is wrong. But since I have to follow the given signature, I can't change it. 

Therefore, the code I have is the best possible with the given information. I'll proceed with that.
