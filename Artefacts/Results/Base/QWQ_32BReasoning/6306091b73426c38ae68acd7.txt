Okay, I need to generate Python code for the ansible_config_manager class method based on the given docstring. The docstring says it should get the ansible config manager using ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER from cls._get_service(). 

First, I should figure out the structure. Since it's a class method, I'll use @classmethod decorator. The method will take 'cls' as the first parameter. 

The key part is accessing the service. The docstring mentions ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER, so I probably need to import ServiceName from a module. Wait, but the user didn't specify any imports. Hmm, maybe the ServiceName is part of the same class's namespace or another module. Since the function is part of a class, perhaps the service is retrieved via cls._get_service(), which likely returns a dictionary or some structure that maps service names to instances.

So the steps are: call cls._get_service() to get the service dictionary, then look up the key ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in that dictionary. The method should return the value associated with that key.

Wait, but how is ServiceName defined here? I might need to assume that ServiceName is an enum or a class that has this attribute. The code should reference ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER as the key. 

Putting it together, the method would be something like:

@classmethod
def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    service = cls._get_service()
    return service[ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER]

But I need to make sure that ServiceName is imported. Since the user didn't mention the import, maybe they expect that the code just uses it as is, assuming that the necessary imports are already handled elsewhere. So I'll proceed without adding any import statements, just the code as per the instructions.

Wait, the function's return is implied by the docstring. The code should be straightforward. Also, the user wants only the code in Python markdown format. Oh right, the code should be enclosed in triple backticks. Let me make sure to format that correctly.

So the final code would be the class method with that logic. Let me write it out.
