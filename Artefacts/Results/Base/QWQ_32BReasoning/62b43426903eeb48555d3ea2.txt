Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method _create_converter that returns a _Converter instance from the _converting module. Let me start by understanding the function signature and the docstring. The function is an instance method, so it takes self as the first parameter. The return type is specified as _converting._Converter, which suggests that the Converter class is imported from a module named _converting. 

The docstring says it creates the parameter style converter and returns it. The return line mentions the class using :class:`._converting._Converter`, which is a Sphinx-style reference. So the code should import the _Converter class from _converting. 

Wait, the function is supposed to be part of a class, probably in the same module or another. But the user just wants the code for this specific method. Since the method is inside a class, the code should be the body of this function. The user didn't provide any more context, so I need to assume the minimal necessary.

Hmm, the method's purpose is to create the converter. The simplest way is to instantiate _Converter and return it. But maybe there's some setup involved. Since the function is part of a class, perhaps the converter needs some parameters from the instance. Like, maybe the self has some attributes that are passed to the converter. But the docstring doesn't mention any parameters, just that it returns the converter. 

The user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring. So I should just write the function that returns a new _Converter instance. But how is the _Converter class structured? Since I don't have that info, I'll assume that the converter can be instantiated without parameters. Alternatively, maybe the method needs to create it with some specific arguments. But without more details, the best I can do is return an instance of _Converter directly. 

Wait, maybe the converter is created using some attributes of self. Like, perhaps the class has a style parameter that determines how the converter is set up. But the docstring doesn't specify that. The function's name is _create_converter, so perhaps it's a factory method that initializes the converter. 

Alternatively, maybe the converter is a simple instance and the method just returns a new one each time. Let me check the return type again. It's supposed to return an instance of _Converter. So the code would be something like:

from ._converting import _Converter  # or whatever the import is

def _create_converter(self) -> _Converter:
    return _Converter()

But the user's code might have the import already. Since the function is part of a class, the actual code might not need the import statement here. The user probably expects just the method's code. 

Wait, the function is written as part of a class. So the code inside the method would be the instantiation. Let me make sure I don't add any extra lines. The docstring is given, so I need to include that exactly. The return statement should be correct. 

Wait, maybe the converter requires some arguments. For example, maybe the style is determined by some instance variables. Since the docstring mentions "parameter style converter", perhaps the converter's style is based on a parameter of the class. Like, if the class has a style attribute (e.g., qmark, numeric, etc.), then the converter might need that. 

But without more context, I can't know. The problem says to generate code based solely on the provided signature and docstring. Since the docstring doesn't specify any parameters or setup beyond returning the converter, the code should be straightforward. 

So the method would simply create and return a new _Converter instance. The code would be:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    """
    Create the parameter style converter.

    Returns the parameter style converter (:class:`._converting._Converter`).
    """
    return _converting._Converter()

Wait, but in Python, when you import, you have to reference the module. So if the _Converter is in the _converting module, then the code would need to have imported that. However, the function's return type annotation is _converting._Converter, which suggests that the module is already imported. 

Alternatively, maybe the class is imported via from ._converting import _Converter, so the code would just use _Converter(). But the annotation uses the module name, so perhaps the import is as follows: perhaps the module is imported as import _converting, so the class is accessed as _converting._Converter. 

So the correct code would be to return a new instance of _converting._Converter. 

Therefore, the method's body is just returning that instance. Since the function's docstring is provided, the code must include that exactly. 

Wait, but the user wants the code in Python markdown format. Oh right, maybe they mean just the code block, properly indented. Let me structure that correctly. 

The function is a method, so inside a class. But the code they want is the method's definition. So the code would be:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    """
    Create the parameter style converter.

    Returns the parameter style converter (:class:`._converting._Converter`).
    """
    return _converting._Converter()

But maybe the _Converter's constructor requires parameters. Since the method is part of a class, perhaps self has some attributes that are needed. For example, maybe the style is stored in self.style, and the converter needs that. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention that. 

The user's instructions say not to include any explanation, just the code. So I have to go with the minimal possible code that fits the given signature and docstring. 

So the code is as above. Let me check again. The return type is specified with the module, so in the code, the instantiation has to include that. So the return line is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the converter is created with some parameters. But since there's no info, the simplest is to return an instance with no arguments. 

Yes, that's the way to go. So the code is as written.
