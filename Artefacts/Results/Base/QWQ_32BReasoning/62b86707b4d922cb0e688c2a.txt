Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method on(self, hook) which is supposed to return a decorator to add a handler to a registry in the class. Let's start by understanding the problem. The function is a method of a class, so self refers to an instance. The decorator should allow the user to add a new handler to a specific hook in the registry.

Hmm, the method should return a decorator. So the structure is that when someone uses @instance.on(hook), it should add the decorated function to the registry. The registry is probably a dictionary in the class that maps hook names to lists of handlers. Wait, the doc mentions the registry is in the class, so maybe it's a class-level attribute rather than an instance one. 

First, I need to define the registry. The class should have a class variable like _registry or something similar. Each hook in the registry would be a key pointing to a list of functions. 

The on method takes a hook name. It needs to create a decorator that, when called, adds the function to the registry's list for that hook. The decorator itself is a function that takes another function as an argument. 

Wait, the standard way to create a decorator with arguments is to have the outer function return the actual decorator. So the on method is the outer function here. The returned function will be the decorator. 

So the steps are: 

1. In the class, have a class-level registry, maybe a dictionary.
2. The on method checks if the hook is already a key in the registry. If not, it initializes an empty list.
3. The returned decorator function (let's call it decorator) will take a function (handler) as an argument.
4. The decorator adds the handler function to the registry's list for the given hook.
5. The decorator should return the original function unmodified so that it can still be called normally.

Wait, but how do I handle adding the function to the class's registry? Since the method is called on an instance, using self, but the registry is class-based. So the method should probably modify the class's registry, not the instance's. So in the code, when we add the function, we need to access the class's registry. 

So in the on method, maybe the registry is stored as a class variable, like __registry. Then, within the on method, we can get the class of self and modify the registry there. 

Let me think of the code structure. 

First, the class would have a class variable:

class SomeClass:
    __registry = {}

Then the on method:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry under the hook
        cls = self.__class__
        if hook not in cls.__registry:
            cls.__registry[hook] = []
        cls.__registry[hook].append(func)
        return func  # or return some wrapper, but the user might want the original function
    return decorator

Wait, that's the general idea. But the method on is supposed to return the decorator function. So the outer function is on, which when called with hook, returns the inner decorator. The decorator then adds the function to the class's registry. 

Wait, but in the code above, the on method is part of an instance, but the registry is a class variable. So when you do self.__class__.__registry, that's correct because the class variable is shared among all instances. 

Wait, but in Python, if you have a class variable, and you try to set it via the instance, sometimes it can create an instance variable instead. So to ensure that we are modifying the class variable, perhaps we should use the class directly. Like, cls = self.__class__ then cls.__registry[hook].append(func). 

Yes, that's right. Since __registry is a class variable, accessing it through the cls variable (the class itself) is necessary. 

Now, the code needs to be written in such a way. Let me see if I can structure that correctly. 

Wait, the user wants the code to be generated, so I need to make sure that the class has a registry. But the function is part of a class, so the code should be inside the class. 

Wait, the problem statement is to generate the code for the on method, given the signature and the docstring. So the code should include the on method, and the class would have the registry as a class variable. 

Wait, but in the code that the user is asking for, the method on is part of a class. So the code should start with the class definition, then the __registry, then the on method. 

Wait, but the user only provided the function signature and docstring for the on method. So maybe the class structure is already in place, but the code must include the necessary parts. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be part of a class, so the generated code should have the class with the registry. 

Wait, the problem says "in the class" so the registry must be a class-level attribute. 

Putting it all together, the code would look like this. Let me make sure that the on method is properly structured. 

Wait, the on method is an instance method, so self is the instance. But modifying the class's registry. 

Another thing: the decorator should return the original function, so the decorator returns func. 

Wait, but maybe the user wants to add the function to the registry and then return the function, so that the decorator can be used without wrapping. 

Yes, that's standard. 

So putting this into code:

Probably, the class will have a __registry as a class variable. Then, the on method returns the decorator. 

Wait, but the code should only be the on method. Or does the user expect the full class code?

Looking back at the problem statement: the function signature is def on(self, hook), so it's part of a class. The user wants the code for this function. But the function is supposed to refer to a registry in the class. So the code must include the setup of the registry. 

Wait, but the problem says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the code should include the class structure, with the registry and the method. 

Because otherwise, if the method is written without the class having a registry, it would fail. So the code needs to have the class with the registry. 

Therefore, the code would look something like this:

class RegistryClass:
    __registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(func):
            if hook not in self.__class__.__registry:
                self.__class__.__registry[hook] = []
            self.__class__.__registry[hook].append(func)
            return func
        return decorator

Wait, that's possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the registry is a dictionary of lists. So when a new function is decorated, it's added to the list for the hook. 

Yes. So the code above would work. Let me check again. 

The decorator function is returned by on. When someone writes @instance.on(hook), the on method is called with hook, then the decorator is applied to the function. 

Inside the decorator, the code checks if the hook exists in the class's registry. If not, create a new list, then append the function. 

Wait, but in the code above, using self.__class__.__registry, which is correct. 

Wait, but in Python, if the class has a class variable __registry, then accessing it via self.__class__.__registry is the right way. 

Yes. 

Another point: the __registry is a class variable, so all instances of the class share the same registry. 

The user's docstring says "in the class", so that's correct. 

Therefore, the code should be as above. 

Wait, but perhaps the __registry should be initialized in the class. Like:

class Something:
    __registry = {}  # or a defaultdict?

Wait, in the code, when checking if hook is in __registry, if not, it initializes the list. So using a regular dictionary is okay. 

Yes. 

So the code should be:

Wait, the user's function is part of a class, so the code should include the class with the registry and the on method. 

Therefore, the code would be the class with the __registry and the on method as described. 

Wait, but the user's function is called on, so the code must have that. 

Yes. 

Now, the function's docstring says "add a new handler to the 'hook' in the registry in the class". 

So the code should do exactly that. 

Wait, but in the decorator, we need to make sure that the function is added to the class's registry. 

Another possible way: using a class method? But the method is an instance method. 

Alternatively, maybe the registry is stored as a class variable. 

So the code should be:

class SomeClass:
    __registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(func):
            cls = self.__class__
            if hook not in cls.__registry:
                cls.__registry[hook] = []
            cls.__registry[hook].append(func)
            return func
        return decorator

Wait, that's the same as before. 

Wait, but the user's code may not have the class name. Since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature, perhaps the code should just be the method inside the class, but the class has to be there. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written as a class with the method. 

The problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is the method as part of a class. 

But to make it work, the class must have the registry. 

Therefore, the code should include the class definition with the registry and the method. 

Yes. 

So the final code would look like that. 

Wait, but the user didn't specify the class name, so maybe I can use a generic name like 'Registry' or just 'class'? 

Probably, the code should use a class, but the name can be arbitrary. Let's use a class named 'Registry' for example. 

Wait, perhaps the code should be written in a way that the class is defined with the registry as a class variable. 

Alternatively, maybe the class is already given, but the code needs to define the on method. 

The problem says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. Since the function is a method, the code must be part of a class. So I should write a class that contains this method and the necessary registry. 

Therefore, the code would start with the class, then the __registry, then the on method. 

So I think that's the code. Let me make sure that the decorator returns the function. 

Yes, because the decorator is supposed to take the function and add it to the registry, then return the function. 

Wait, in the code above, the decorator returns func. So the decorated function is the same as before. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Another possible thing: maybe the registry is stored per instance. But the doc says "in the class", so it's a class variable. 

So the code is correct. 

Wait, but maybe the __registry is better as a dictionary of lists. 

Alternatively, perhaps using a defaultdict. But since the code is supposed to be straightforward, using a regular dict and checking if the key exists is better. 

Yes. 

So I think that's the code. Let me write it properly. 

Wait, the user's code must have the function signature exactly as given. 

The function is def on(self, hook): ... 

So the code must have that. 

Putting it all together, the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    __registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(func):
            if hook not in self.__class__.__registry:
                self.__class__.__registry[hook] = []
            self.__class__.__registry[hook].append(func)
            return func
        return decorator

Alternatively, maybe using cls = self.__class__ to make it clearer. 

Like:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        cls = self.__class__
        if hook not in cls.__registry:
            cls.__registry[hook] = []
        cls.__registry[hook].append(func)
        return func
    return decorator

Wait, that's the same as before, but perhaps using a variable for cls is better. 

Yes, so the code can be written that way. 

Wait, but in the first version, self.__class__.__registry is accessed directly. 

Either way is okay. 

Hmm, perhaps to avoid multiple accesses, it's better to assign to a variable. 

So, the code would be as written. 

Wait, but the __registry is a class variable. So when we do self.__class__.__registry, that's correct. 

Wait, but in Python, if the class has a __registry, then self's class (cls) will have that attribute. 

Yes. 

So that's the code. 

I think that's the correct approach. Let me check again. 

Suppose someone uses it like this:

class MyRegistry:
    def on(self, hook):
        ... 

Then, an instance:

reg = MyRegistry()
@reg.on('some_hook')
def handler():
    pass

Then, MyRegistry's class registry should have 'some_hook' pointing to a list containing handler. 

Yes. 

So the code should work. 

Another possible point: the __registry is a dictionary, but in Python, if another instance modifies it, it's okay because it's a class variable. 

Yes. 

Therefore, the code is correct. 

So the final code is as above. 

Wait, but the user's function is called on, so the class must have that method. 

Yes, so the code is okay. 

Now, I should output only the code in Python format, without any markdown or explanations. 

Wait, the user says to output "ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Wait, maybe they mean code blocks with triple backticks? Or just the code as is, with the class and method? 

Wait the problem says "output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps the code should be enclosed in a markdown code block. 

Wait, but the user's instructions are a bit conflicting. Let me read again: 

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Hmm, maybe the user is confused. They probably want the code in a code block, but not any markdown formatting. Wait, but the "python markdown format" might mean just the code, not using any markdown syntax. Wait, perhaps the user wants the code as plain text, but the instruction says "in python markdown format". Maybe they mean within a code block. 

Wait, the thinking part says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps the code should be enclosed in triple backticks, with the language specified. 

Wait, but the user said "do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting". So perhaps the markdown formatting refers to other things. Wait, maybe they want the code in a code block, but not adding any other markdown. 

Alternatively, maybe they just want the code as is. 

Hmm, the exact instruction says to output the code in Python markdown format, but not include any other markdown. 

Wait, perhaps the code should be presented in a way that when rendered, is in a code block. But the user might be asking for the code itself, not the markdown. 

Wait, maybe the user wants the code to be in a code block using markdown syntax. 

So the code would be inside:

```python
class SomeClass:
    __registry = {}
    def on(self, hook):
        ... (the code here) ...
```

But the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format, so that's probably it. 

Wait, but the function's docstring must be exactly as provided. 

Yes, so the code must include the docstring. 

Putting it all together, the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    __registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(func):
            if hook not in self.__class__.__registry:
                self.__class__.__registry[hook] = []
            self.__class__.__registry[hook].append(func)
            return func
        return decorator

Wait, but the class name can be anything. Since the problem didn't specify, perhaps the user expects the class to have a generic name. 

Alternatively, maybe the class is supposed to be a metaclass or something else? 

No, the function is an instance method. 

I think this is correct. So I'll write this code.
