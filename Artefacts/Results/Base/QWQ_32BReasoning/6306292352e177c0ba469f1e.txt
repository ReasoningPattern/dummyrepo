Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function process_text_links based on the given docstring. The docstring says to process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links. Hmm, so what does that mean exactly?

First, linkifying textual links probably means converting plain URLs into actual hyperlinks. Like, if the text has "http://example.com", it should become a clickable link. But how do I detect URLs in a string? Oh right, I can use regular expressions for that. The re module in Python. I remember there's a regex pattern for URLs. Wait, maybe I should look up a good URL regex pattern. But since I can't do that now, I'll have to recall one. Something like r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+' maybe? That's a common one, but I'm not sure if it's perfect. Alternatively, maybe use a more precise pattern to capture URLs correctly.

Then, adding some attributes to the links. The attributes probably mean when you create an <a> tag, you need to add certain HTML attributes like target="_blank" or rel="nofollow". So the function should replace found URLs with <a> tags that include those attributes.

Wait, but how do I structure the function? Let's think: the input is a text string. The output should be the processed text where URLs are turned into links with the attributes. So the steps are:

1. Find all URLs in the text.
2. For each URL found, wrap it in an <a> tag with the desired attributes.
3. Return the modified text.

So the main approach is using re.sub with a regex pattern that matches URLs. The substitution would be something like <a href="\g<0>" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">\g<0></a>, but I need to make sure that the regex groups are correct. Wait, maybe the pattern should capture the entire URL as a group so that I can reference it in the substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex is straightforward, and the replacement just takes the entire match as the URL. Let's see. The regex pattern might be (https?://\S+), so that it matches http or https followed by non-space characters. That's simpler. Then in the substitution, each match will be replaced by an anchor tag with the URL as href, and the attributes.

Wait but maybe that's too simplistic. The URL might end with punctuation, like a period or comma. So the regex should avoid matching those. Hmm, perhaps adjust the pattern to ensure that it captures the URL without trailing punctuation. Like, maybe using something like (https?://\S+?(?=[\s\.,])) or something. But maybe for simplicity, just match the URL part and then in the substitution, make sure that the link is properly formed.

Alternatively, the problem might not require handling such edge cases, so maybe the basic approach is okay. The user didn't specify any particular edge cases, so perhaps proceed with a simple regex.

So the plan is: use re.sub to find URLs in the text, and replace them with <a href="..." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">...</a> where ... is the original URL. But also, maybe add other attributes as needed. The docstring says "adding some attributes" so probably the standard ones like target and rel.

Wait, but the function's name is process_text_links. So maybe the input text has some existing links that need attributes added, and also plain text URLs that need to be turned into links. Or maybe it's just about linkifying plain URLs and adding attributes to them. The description isn't entirely clear, but given the docstring, I think it's the latter. So the function should scan the text for any URLs not already in a hyperlink, turn them into hyperlinks, and add the attributes.

But how to distinguish between existing links and plain text URLs? That might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to process all URLs in the text, whether they are already links or not. Wait, maybe the function is part of a larger system where links are already in a certain format, and we need to add attributes. Or maybe it's just about linkifying any URLs present in the text, turning them into HTML links with the specified attributes.

Assuming the latter, the function can be written as follows:

Import re.

Define the regex to find URLs. Let's go with a simple pattern first.

The substitution function would take the match object and return the anchor tag with href set to the matched URL, plus the attributes.

Wait, but using re.sub with a lambda function might be better. Like:

def process_text_links(text):
    url_pattern = re.compile(r'(https?://[^\s]+)')
    return url_pattern.sub(lambda m: f'<a href="{m.group(1)}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{m.group(1)}</a>', text)

Wait, but maybe the URLs can have other characters, like parentheses if they're in a markdown or something. Hmm, but the problem says to process links in text. The example might be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the regex should be more precise. Let me think of the pattern again. A common URL regex might be:

r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\(\), ]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F]^2))'

Wait, perhaps I should use a more standard one. Maybe the pattern from Django's urlize? Or just a basic one.

Alternatively, the pattern can be r'(https?://\S+)' to capture any sequence of non-whitespace characters following http:// or https://. That might work. The substitution would then take the entire match as the URL, and replace it with the anchor tag.

Wait, but the replacement would put the entire URL in the link's text, which is okay. For example, "Check this out: http://example.com" becomes "Check this out: <a href="http://example.com" ...>http://example.com</a>."

Alternatively, maybe the text should display the domain name, but that's more complex. Since the problem says "linkifying textual links," perhaps just making the URL itself a link is sufficient.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    pattern = re.compile(r'(https?://\S+)')
    return pattern.sub(lambda m: f'<a href="{}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{m.group(1)}</a>', text)

Wait, no, the replacement should have the URL in the href and the display text as the URL. Wait, in the substitution, the group(1) is the URL, so the href is set to that, and the link text is also the URL. But maybe that's exactly what the function is supposed to do.

Alternatively, perhaps the display text should be shortened, but the problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps just display the URL as the link text.

So the code would look like:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    return re.sub(r'(https?://\S+)', r'<a href="\1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">\1</a>', text)

Wait, using raw string substitution with \1. But in Python's re.sub, using raw strings for the replacement might be okay. Alternatively, using a lambda function to format the string with the group. Let me think: using the re.sub with a replacement string. The \1 refers to the first group. So the regex must have parentheses to capture the URL.

In the code above, the regex is (https?://\S+), so the first group is the entire URL. Therefore the replacement will work.

Wait, but the original regex's group is the entire URL, so substituting with <a href="\1" ...>\1</a> would replace each occurrence with the anchor tag. That's correct.

So this code should work. But perhaps I need to handle cases where the URL is already part of an HTML link. Like if the text already has <a href="...">, then processing it would add more attributes? Or maybe the function is only meant to linkify plain text URLs, not modify existing links. In that case, the regex should exclude existing HTML links. Hmm, but that's more complicated.

The problem's docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe it's okay to just replace any URL in the text with the link. So the code above is sufficient. Let me test this logic in my mind.

Suppose the input is "Visit google at https://www.google.com." The output would be "Visit google at <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com</a>." That seems to fit the requirement.

Another example: if the URL is already in an <a> tag, like "Check <a href='http://example.com'>here</a>.", the regex would match 'http://example.com' as a group, and replace it with the anchor tag, which would result in nested <a> tags, which is invalid HTML. So that's a problem. But maybe the function is intended to only process plain text URLs, not those already in links. How to handle that?

Hmm, the problem might not require that. The user might not care about existing links, or maybe the function is supposed to add the attributes to existing links. Wait, the docstring says "adding some attributes" which could mean modifying existing links to include those attributes, but "linkifying textual links" implies turning plain text into links.

This is a bit ambiguous. But given the problem's instruction, perhaps the first approach is acceptable. Since the user hasn't specified handling existing links, maybe the function is only for turning plain URLs into links with the attributes. So proceed with the code as above.

Wait, but maybe the regex should avoid matching URLs that are already within an anchor tag. To do that, the regex would need to check that the URL is not preceded by a href=" or something. That's more complex. But maybe beyond the scope here. Since the problem says to "process links in text", perhaps the input text has plain URLs, and the function is to turn them into links. So the first approach is okay.

Another thing: the regex might capture too much if there's a space in the URL. For example, "http://example.com some text". The \S+ would stop at the space, so that's okay.

So the code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    return re.sub(r'(https?://\S+)', r'<a href="\1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">\1</a>', text)

Wait, but in the replacement, the \1 is the matched URL. So that's correct. But maybe using a lambda function would be better for clarity. Let me see:

def process_text_links(text):
    pattern = re.compile(r'(https?://\S+)')
    return pattern.sub(lambda m: f'<a href="{m.group(1)}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{m.group(1)}</a>', text)

This might be more readable. Also, using an f-string here requires the lambda to have access to m.group(1). Either way works. The first version uses the raw string with \1, which is okay. Both are valid approaches.

Another consideration: the regex might need to account for case insensitivity? Like HTTP vs https. But the pattern already has http and the s is optional, so that's covered.

Wait, the regex is written as https?:// which covers both http and https. So that's okay.

What about URLs starting with www? Like www.example.com. But the current regex won't capture that unless it starts with http. So those won't be linkified. The problem says "textual links" which probably refers to URLs starting with http. Maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, the pattern could also include checking for www, but that's a different case. The problem's docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe it's okay.

Another possible edge case: the URL has parameters or anchors, like http://example.com/path?query=1#anchor. The regex with \S+ would capture that correctly up to the next whitespace.

Okay, so the code is probably okay. Let's proceed with that. The user wants the code in Python, so I need to make sure to import re.

Wait, in the function, the code must be inside the function. So the code would start with importing re, but the function is supposed to be self-contained. Oh, the import has to be inside the code, but the function is to be written as per the signature. So the code should include the import statement before the function.

Wait, the user says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code should start with the import, then the function definition.

Putting it all together:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    return re.sub(r'(https?://\S+)', r'<a href="\1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">\1</a>', text)

Hmm, but maybe the regex should be adjusted to avoid matching too much. Let me think again. The \S+ will stop at any whitespace, so that's okay. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps the pattern should be more precise, but given the problem's brevity, this is probably sufficient.

Wait, another thing: the target="_blank" and rel="nofollow" are the attributes to add. Are there any other attributes? The docstring says "adding some attributes", so perhaps those are the ones. So the code is correct.

I think that's the solution. Let me write the code accordingly.
