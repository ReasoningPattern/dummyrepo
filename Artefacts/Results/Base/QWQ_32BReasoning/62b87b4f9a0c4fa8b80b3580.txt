Okay, I need to write a Python function called integral that takes two parameters: bins and edges. The docstring says it should calculate the area of the overall graph. Hmm, right, so this is probably about computing the integral of a histogram given its bins and edges. 

Let me think. The bins would represent the heights of each bar in the histogram, and the edges are the bin edges. The area is the sum of each bin's area. Each bin's area is the height (from bins) multiplied by the width of the bin. 

Wait, how are the edges structured? Oh right, for a histogram, edges is an array where each consecutive pair represents the start and end of a bin. So if there are N bins, there should be N+1 edges. Like, for example, if edges are [1,2,3,4], then the bins are [1-2], [2-3], [3-4], so three bins. So the length of bins must be one less than the length of edges. 

So the steps are: for each bin in the bins array, calculate the width between edges[i] and edges[i+1], multiply by the bin's value, and sum all those products. 

Wait, but what if the edges array is not properly formed? The function probably assumes that the edges are correctly provided. So I don't have to check for errors here. 

So the code would be something like this: sum over each bin index, take the value of bins[i], multiply by (edges[i+1] - edges[i]), and add all those together. 

Let me make sure. Let's say bins is [3, 5, 2], edges is [0, 1, 2, 3]. Then the first bin's width is 1-0=1, so area 3*1 =3, second 5*(2-1)=5, third 2*(3-2)=2. Total is 3+5+2 =10. 

Yes, that's correct. So the loop would iterate from 0 to len(bins)-1, but since the edges are length len(bins)+1, each bin i corresponds to edges[i] and edges[i+1]. 

Wait, actually, the loop should go from 0 to len(bins)-1, and for each i, the width is edges[i+1] - edges[i]. So the code would be:

sum(b * (edges[i+1] - edges[i]) for i, b in enumerate(bins))

Wait, but enumerate gives the index and the bin value. So for each bin in bins, which has an index i from 0 to len(bins)-1, the corresponding edge is edges[i] and edges[i+1]. So the width for each bin is edges[i+1] - edges[i], and the bin's height is b. 

So the function can be written as a generator expression inside sum, then return that. 

Wait, but what if the bins are not the same length as edges minus one? Then the code would still work because the enumerate would loop over all the elements. But the problem statement probably ensures that the inputs are valid. 

So putting that into code. The function is called integral, parameters bins and edges. 

The code would be:

def integral(bins, edges):
    return sum(b * (edges[i+1] - edges[i]) for i, b in enumerate(bins))

Wait, that's it? Let me test with an example. Let's say bins is [4, 5], edges [0, 2, 5]. Then the first bin is from 0 to 2, width 2, area 4*2=8. Second bin is 2 to 5, width 3, area 5*3=15. Total 23. The code would compute for i=0, edges[1]-edges[0] =2, then i=1, edges[2]-edges[1]=3. So yes, that works. 

Another example: edges have length 4, bins length 3. So the loop runs for i in 0,1,2. Each time edges[i+1] - edges[i], so the three widths. 

Yes, that seems correct. So the code should return that sum. 

Alternatively, maybe using a loop for clarity, but the list comprehension or generator expression is more concise. Since the problem says to generate code based on the docstring, and the docstring is brief, this one-liner should be okay. 

Wait, but I should make sure that the edges are in order and so on, but I think the function is supposed to take them as valid inputs. 

Therefore, the correct code is as above.
