Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_run_el that checks if the given object's class has a run method. Let's see. The function should take an object as an argument. So first, I should figure out how to get the class of the object. Oh right, in Python, you can use the built-in function type() to get the class of an object. Alternatively, maybe using the __class__ attribute directly. 

Wait, but the question is about checking if the class has the method. So, once I have the class, I need to check if 'run' is among its methods. How do I do that? Oh right, maybe using the hasattr() function. Like, hasattr(obj, 'run') would check if the instance has the attribute. But the docstring specifies checking the class's methods, not the instance's attributes. Wait, maybe there's a difference here. Because the run method could be a method of the class, but not an instance method. Hmm, no, in Python, if the class defines a run method, then the instance will have it as an attribute, unless it's a class method or static method, but even then, the instance might still have it. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to check if the class (the type of the object) has a run method. So perhaps I should check the type of the object. 

Alternatively, maybe using the dir() function to list all attributes of the class. But the correct approach would be to use the hasattr function on the class itself. Wait, maybe I should do something like: 

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run')

Wait, that's possible. Or, another way is to check if 'run' is in the __dict__ of the class. But hasattr is probably the right way here. Because sometimes the method could be inherited from a parent class. So hasattr would check all the way up the MRO, whereas looking directly in the class's __dict__ would only check if it's directly defined in that class, not in its base classes. 

The docstring says "has the run method", so maybe it's sufficient to check if the instance's class (or any of its superclasses) has that method. Therefore, using hasattr on the object's class is the way to go. 

Alternatively, maybe I can check if the method exists in the instance's attributes. But hasattr(obj, 'run') would check the instance's own attributes and also the class's. But some classes might have a run method that's a class method, so the instance would still have it as an attribute. Wait, perhaps the question is ambiguous here. The function's docstring says "the obj class has the run method", so maybe the correct approach is to check the class's attributes, not the instance's. 

So, to clarify, the function needs to determine whether the class of the object has a run method. So the steps would be: 

1. Get the class of the object (using type(obj) or obj.__class__).
2. Check if that class has an attribute called 'run'.
3. Return True or False accordingly. 

Wait, but in Python, methods are attributes of the class. So for example, if a class has a method def run(...), then the class's attribute 'run' would be the function object. So using hasattr on the class should work. 

So the code would be something like:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run')

Alternatively, using type(obj) instead of obj.__class__:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(type(obj), 'run')

But I think both are equivalent here. The __class__ attribute of an instance refers to its class. 

Wait, but maybe there are some edge cases where the object is an instance of a class that uses __slots__ or something, but I think hasattr would still work. 

Another approach could be to use the inspect module, but that might be overcomplicating. The problem seems to require a straightforward check. 

Let me think of some examples. Suppose there's a class A with a run method. Then an instance a = A() would return True. If a class B doesn't have run, then it would return False. What if the class inherits from a superclass that has run? Then hasattr would return True, which is correct. 

Yes, so this code should work. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The function's name is is_run_el, maybe short for 'is runnable' or something. The docstring is clear. 

Wait, but maybe the method is a bound method. For instance, when you check obj.run, that's a bound method. But the class's attribute would be the function. So using hasattr on the class's 'run' would correctly identify whether the method exists. 

Therefore, the code should be as simple as returning whether the class has that attribute. So the code would be:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run')

Hmm, that seems right. Let me see if there's another way. Like using the dir() function on the class and checking if 'run' is in the list. But dir() includes all attributes, including those from parent classes, so that's the same as hasattr. 

Alternatively, maybe using the 'in' operator with the class's __dict__, but that would only check the immediate class's attributes. So for example, if the method is inherited, it would return False, which is incorrect. So the hasattr approach is better. 

I think that's the correct solution here. So the code is straightforward.
