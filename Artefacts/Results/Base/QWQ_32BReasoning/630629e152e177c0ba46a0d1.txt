Okay, I need to write a Python function called try_retrieve_webfinger_document that takes a handle as a string and returns an Optional string. The docstring says it should try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document and not raise if it fails. Hmm, right, WebFinger is a protocol for discovering information about a user or entity on the web. The RFC7033 specifies how to do that, I think.

First, I remember that WebFinger requests are typically made via HTTP. The handle is in the form of a username@domain, so I need to parse that. The function should extract the domain from the handle. Let's see, split the handle at the @ symbol to get the domain part. Wait, but what if the handle doesn't have an @? The function is supposed to not raise, so maybe handle that by returning None?

Next, the URL for the WebFinger request is usually constructed like this: https://<domain>/.well-known/webfinger with query parameters. The required parameter is 'resource', which should be an acct URI. So the resource would be "acct:" followed by the handle. Or wait, the handle is already the full address, so maybe the resource is "acct:" + handle?

Wait, the handle is the full identifier, so yes. The resource is "acct:" + handle. The other parameters might be 'rel' and 'jrd' version, but according to RFC7033, the format is probably JSON. So maybe the query parameters are just resource=acct:handle. The Accept header can specify application/jrd+json.

So the steps are: split the handle into local and domain parts. If there's no @, return None. Then build the URL. Use the requests library to make a GET request. But since the function shouldn't raise exceptions, I need to handle any possible exceptions like connection errors, timeouts, etc.

Wait, but the function's return is Optional[str], so it can return None on failure. So the code structure would be something like:

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        # parse handle into parts
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        local_part, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        # construct the URL
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
        params = {"resource": f"acct:{handle}"}
        headers = {"Accept": "application/jrd+json"}
        # make the request
        response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers, timeout=10)
        # check if the response is okay
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.text
        else:
            return None
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return None

Wait, but splitting on @ might have cases where there are multiple @, but the split with 1 ensures only the first is taken. So if the handle is like user@sub.domain.com, that's okay. But what if the handle is malformed? Like no @, then we return None. 

Also, the parameters for the GET request: the resource is the acct URI, and the well-known URL is correct. The headers need to accept the correct MIME type. The timeout is important to prevent hanging indefinitely.

But maybe the function should also check the response's content type? Not sure, since the RFC might require that. But according to the spec, if the server returns a valid document, the content type should be application/jrd+json. But the function's job is just to retrieve the document, not validate it. So maybe that's okay. The function can just return the text if the status is 200.

Wait, but what about using HTTPS? The URL is constructed with https, but maybe the domain doesn't have a HTTPS endpoint. Then the request would fail, but since we're catching exceptions, that's handled.

Wait, also, the .well-known/webfinger path must be correct. So the URL is correct.

So putting it all together: first check if the handle has an @, split into parts, then build the URL and parameters. Then make the request, and handle any exceptions. Return the response text on success (200), else return None.

Wait, but the function's return is supposed to be the document as a string, so if the request is successful, return the text. Otherwise, return None. So the code structure is correct.

But I need to make sure to import requests and the Optional type. Oh right, but the function signature already has Optional from typing, I assume. So the user will have to have the requests library installed. Alternatively, maybe use urllib instead? But requests is more user-friendly here. The problem is that the function doesn't raise, so any exception during the request (like connection error, SSL issues, etc) should just result in returning None.

Wait, the try block includes the entire GET request. The except clause catches all RequestExceptions, which covers connection errors, timeouts, etc. So that's good.

Wait, what about if the domain is invalid, like an IP address or something? But the split would still work as long as there's an @. The requests library would handle that, maybe raising an exception if the domain can't be resolved, which would be caught.

Another thing: the handle could have spaces or other invalid characters? Probably, the function should just pass it as is, since the user is responsible for that. The function's job is to make the request and not error out.

So I think that's the plan. Now code:

Wait, also, the function must not raise. So all possible exceptions from the requests.get() need to be caught. The split on '@' could also raise a ValueError if there are multiple @? Wait, no, the split with maxsplit=1 would take the first one, but if there's no @, the split would fail. Wait, the code first checks if '@' is in handle. So if it's not present, return None. So the split is safe.

Wait, handle.split('@', 1) will split into two parts only if there's at least one @. So if the handle is "user@domain", then local_part is "user", domain is "domain". But if the handle is "user@domain@other", then the split would still take the first @, so local_part is "user", domain is "domain@other". But according to the RFC, the handle should be a valid email-like address, but the function is supposed to just try. So maybe it's okay. The server will return an error if the resource is invalid, but the function will just return None in that case. So the code is okay as written.

Wait, but the function's purpose is to retrieve the document. So even if the handle is not properly formatted, it just returns None. That's in line with the requirements.

So the code is as above. But I should also note that the function requires the requests module. The user might have to install it via pip. But the problem says to generate the code, so that's okay.

Wait, but maybe the function should use a timeout? I added timeout=10, which is reasonable. But the exact value could be adjusted, but since the user didn't specify, it's okay to include a default.

Putting it all into code now. The function uses try/except, returns None on any error, and returns the text on 200.

Wait, also, the parameters are passed as a dictionary. The 'params' argument in requests.get appends the query parameters. So the URL would end up as ...webfinger?resource=acct%3Auser%40domain.com (since the @ in the handle is part of the URI, it needs to be URL-encoded). Oh, but the requests library will handle the encoding automatically when using the params parameter, right? Because when you pass the 'resource' in the params dict, it will URL-encode the value. So that's correct.

Wait, let me check: if handle is "alice@example.com", then the resource parameter would be "acct:alice@example.com", which when URL-encoded becomes "acct%3Aalice%40example.com". So that's correct.

So the code is okay.

Wait, but maybe the split is better done as splitting on @ and taking the last part as the domain. Wait, no, because for cases like "user@sub.example.com", the split on the first @ gives the correct domain. So splitting into two parts with maxsplit=1 is correct.

Hmm, I think that's all. So the code should be as written above. Let me make sure I include all the necessary parts.
