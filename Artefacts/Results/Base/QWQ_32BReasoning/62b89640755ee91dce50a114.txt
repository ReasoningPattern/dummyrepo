Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function tzname_in_python2 based on the given docstring. The docstring says it should change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2. Hmm, right, in Python 2, strings are bytes by default, and unicode strings need to be encoded. So the function probably takes a function that returns a unicode string and wraps it to return a byte string instead.

Wait, the name of the parameter is namefunc. So the idea is to create a decorator that modifies the output of that function. The decorator should check if the current Python version is 2. If so, then when the decorated function is called, it should convert any unicode return value to a bytestring using the appropriate encoding, maybe UTF-8. But I should make sure that it only does this in Python 2, because in Python 3, strings are unicode and bytes are different.

How do I detect the Python version? Oh right, there's sys.version_info. So I'll need to import sys. Then, if sys.version_info.major is 2, proceed with the conversion. Otherwise, just return the original value.

So the structure would be something like this: the decorator tzname_in_python2 takes namefunc as the function to wrap. Then, it returns a new function that calls namefunc, gets the result, and if in Python 2, converts it to a byte string. But how exactly?

Wait, in Python 2, a unicode object can be encoded to a string. So if the result is a unicode instance, we encode it. Otherwise, maybe leave it as is? But the doc says to change unicode into bytestrings. So perhaps we check if the result is a unicode string, then encode to bytes, else return as is.

So the code for the wrapper function would be: result = namefunc(*args, **kwargs), then if in Python 2, check if isinstance(result, unicode), then return result.encode('utf-8') or whatever encoding. But what's the default here? Maybe the function's output is supposed to be in the system's default encoding, but the problem doesn't specify that. The doc just says to turn unicode into bytestrings, so perhaps using UTF-8 is safe.

Alternatively, maybe the original function is returning a unicode string, and the decorator needs to convert it to a byte string using the default encoding or something. Wait, but in Python 2, the default might vary, so maybe better to use the 'utf-8' encoding explicitly?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use the 'ascii' encoding with 'latin1' or something else? Or maybe just encode with the default? Hmm, the doc isn't specific. Maybe the standard approach here is to encode to UTF-8. Let's go with that.

So putting it all together:

First, import sys and the unicode type. In Python 2, unicode is a built-in type, but in Python 3, it's str. So to handle that, maybe we can do something like:

import sys

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            result = namefunc(*args, **kwargs)
            if isinstance(result, unicode):
                return result.encode('utf-8')
            else:
                return result
        return wrapper
    else:
        return namefunc

Wait, but in Python 3, the 'unicode' isn't a built-in name. So to make that work, I might need to check if 'unicode' is defined. Alternatively, I can use a try block. Wait, maybe better to import unicode from somewhere if possible. Alternatively, within the decorator, in Python 2, the code can use unicode, and in Python 3, it just returns the original function.

Wait, the function is supposed to be a decorator that only affects Python 2. So in Python 3, the original function is returned as is, since in Python 3, strings are already unicode and we don't need to change them. But in Python 2, the wrapper will check if the result is a unicode instance and encode it.

But how to get the unicode type in a way that works in both versions? Because in Python 3, 'unicode' is not a built-in. So perhaps we can do:

try:
    unicode_type = unicode
except NameError:
    unicode_type = str  # or something else?

Wait, no. Maybe in the wrapper function, we can do the check inside the try. Alternatively, we can use six, but the problem probably expects a solution without third-party libraries.

Alternatively, in the code, the 'unicode' type is only checked in Python 2. Since the code is only executed in Python 2 when the version is 2, then the 'unicode' would be available there. Because the else clause returns the original function, so the wrapper is only defined in Python 2. So when the code runs under Python 3, the if condition would be false, so the else returns the original function, which doesn't have the unicode check. That makes sense.

Wait, but in the code above, the 'unicode' name would be undefined in Python 3. But the code for the wrapper is only created if the version is 2. So in that case, the code block under the if (Python 2) would have access to the 'unicode' type. So that should work.

Wait, the code inside the if block (for Python 2) would have 'unicode' as the built-in type. So the wrapper function can use that. So the code would be correct.

Wait, but what if the original function returns a list of strings, or multiple values? The doc says "output" which implies the return value of the function. So the decorator is only handling the case where the return value is a single unicode string. So the code above should work.

Therefore, the code would be:

First, import sys.

Wait, but in Python 2, the 'unicode' type is built-in. So the code would need to reference it. So the code would start with:

import sys

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    """
    Change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2
    """
    if sys.version_info[0] == 2:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            res = namefunc(*args, **kwargs)
            if isinstance(res, unicode):
                return res.encode('utf-8')
            return res
        return wrapper
    else:
        return namefunc

Wait, but the condition can be simplified to checking if the major version is 2. So using sys.version_info[0] < 3 would also work. The code can be written as:

if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    ... 
else:
    ...

Either way is okay. The key is that in Python 2, the wrapper is used, which converts the return value from unicode to a byte string. In Python 3, the original function is returned, so no changes.

Wait, but in Python 2, the 'unicode' is a type. So the code will work. Let me think of possible issues. What if the function returns a list of unicode strings? Then the wrapper would return the original list, which might not be desired. But the doc says "output into bytestrings", so maybe the function is supposed to return a single string. So the decorator works for that case.

Therefore, the code should be as above. Let me also note that the encoding might need to be specified. The problem says "change unicode into bytestrings", but the encoding is not mentioned. The default might be 'utf-8', but in some cases, maybe 'ascii' with errors? But perhaps the question expects just the standard encoding. Let's proceed with 'utf-8'.

Wait, but maybe the correct approach is to encode using the system's default encoding? Or perhaps the 'ascii' encoding with 'latin1'? Hmm, the problem's doc is a bit vague. Since the question is about Python 2, and in that case, the default string is str, which is bytes. The standard way to convert a unicode to a string in Python 2 would be to encode it. But the encoding depends on the context. Maybe the original function is returning a timezone name which is in some encoding. But without more info, perhaps the correct approach is to encode using 'utf-8' or maybe the 'default'?

Alternatively, perhaps in Python 2, when you call tzname(), it returns a string (bytes) but some libraries might return unicode. So the decorator is to ensure that even if the function returns unicode, it's converted to bytes.

So the code seems okay. Let me write it again properly. Also, make sure to use the correct syntax. The wrapper function uses *args and **kwargs to accept any arguments. The result is checked, and encoded if it's a unicode instance.

Wait, in Python 2, the 'str' is bytes, 'unicode' is the other. So the code is correct. So the code should be:

import sys

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            res = namefunc(*args, **kwargs)
            if isinstance(res, unicode):
                return res.encode('utf-8')
            return res
        return wrapper
    else:
        return namefunc

Wait, but in Python 3, the 'unicode' is not defined. So when the code is run in Python 3, the first part (if version <3) is false, so the else returns the original function. The wrapper is only defined in the Python 2 case. So the code is okay. Because in the Python 2 case, the 'unicode' type is available. So that's correct.

I think this should work. Let me test in my mind. Suppose in Python 2, the function returns u"something", then encode to bytes. In Python 3, returns the same. But in Python 3, the original function's return is str, so if it's a string, the decorator leaves it as is. Since the doc says to change in Python 2, this should be correct.

Yes, that's the code.
