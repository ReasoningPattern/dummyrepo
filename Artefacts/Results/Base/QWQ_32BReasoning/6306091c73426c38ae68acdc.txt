Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function validate_from_content based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function is a class method since it has 'cls' as the first parameter. The purpose is to validate that the YAML content has all the required fields. If any mandatory data is missing, it should raise an IRValidatorException. And it returns a dictionary from the spec file.

Hmm, first, I should parse the YAML content. The function probably uses PyYAML for that. So I'll need to import yaml. Wait, but the user didn't mention any imports, so maybe I should include that at the top? The problem says to output only the code generated, so I guess I have to include the import inside the method or at the top. But since the function is part of a class, maybe the import is already there. Well, the code needs to work, so I should include the import statement for yaml. Let me think, the function's docstring mentions that it returns a dictionary loaded from the YAML file, so parsing must be part of this function.

Wait, the parameters: spec_content is optional, defaulting to None. But if it's None, how do we handle that? Maybe the function requires it, so we should check if it's None and raise an exception? Or perhaps the spec_content is provided, and we need to parse it. Let me read the doc again. The raise is when mandatory data is missing. So maybe the function first loads the YAML into a dictionary, then checks for required fields.

The function's return is the dictionary after validation. So the steps are:

1. Check if spec_content is provided. If not, maybe raise an exception? But the parameter has a default of None. The doc says it's supposed to validate the content passed, so perhaps if spec_content is None, it's an error. Wait, but the parameter is optional. Maybe the function can read from a file if not provided? But the function's name is validate_from_content, so probably the content is passed as a string. So the function must parse that string into a dictionary.

Wait, but the function's parameter is spec_content=None, so if someone calls it without providing it, it would be None, but then how to proceed? The doc says it's supposed to validate the spec content. Maybe the function is supposed to require the spec_content, so if it's None, we should raise an exception. Alternatively, maybe there's a default file it uses. But the problem doesn't specify that. Since the parameter is optional, but the function needs to process it, perhaps in the code, we first check if spec_content is None and raise an error?

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class where the spec_content is stored, but since the parameter is there, I think the function expects it to be provided. So first, parse the YAML content. If the content is invalid, maybe raise an exception here. But the doc specifically mentions raising when mandatory data is missing, so perhaps the parsing is done first, and then the checks.

Wait, the function's return is the dictionary loaded from the YAML. So the first step is to load the YAML into a dictionary. Let's see. So using yaml.safe_load(spec_content). But if the YAML is invalid, that would throw an error, but the doc only mentions raising when mandatory data is missing. So maybe the exception handling for YAML parsing is not part of this function, or perhaps the function expects that the YAML is already valid and only checks for required fields. Alternatively, maybe it should handle parsing errors and raise the exception in that case. The doc says "when mandatory data is missing", so perhaps the parsing is okay, but the data is missing in the parsed dict.

So the steps would be:

- Parse the spec_content into a dictionary. Let's call this data.

- Then check if all required fields are present in data. If any are missing, raise IRValidatorException with an appropriate message.

- Return the data.

But what are the required fields? The problem doesn't specify. Since this is a function in a class, maybe the required fields are defined as a class attribute, like cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS. So the code can check each required field in that list exists in the data.

So putting it together:

Import yaml at the top? Probably, but since the user wants the code generated based on the function's signature and doc, maybe the class is part of a module where yaml is already imported. But the code needs to work standalone. So I should include the import inside the function? Wait, no, that's not standard. It's better to have the import at the top. But the problem says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code should start with the function, but without the import. Wait, but the function can't run without it. Hmm, maybe I have to include the import in the code block. Let me check the problem statement again. The user says to generate the Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So the function itself must be written, and any necessary imports should be included in the code.

Wait, the code is to be output in Python markdown format. Oh right, like ```python ... ```, but the user wants just the code, so maybe I should start with the import statements.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so maybe the class is defined elsewhere, but in the code we have to write, we can assume that the class has a list of required fields. Since the function is a class method, perhaps the required fields are stored in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS.

So the code would be something like:

import yaml
from some_package import IRValidatorException  # But the import path isn't given. Maybe the exception is in the same module, so no need for import? Or maybe the user expects to have it as part of the code.

Wait, the exception is raised, so it must be imported. Since the problem doesn't mention where it's coming from, perhaps the code should have a try-except block for the YAML parsing, but the doc only mentions raising IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing, not for parsing errors. So maybe the function assumes that the YAML is valid, and only checks for presence of required fields.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should first parse the YAML, then check for required keys. Let's proceed.

So the code:

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    """
    validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

    :param spec_content: content of spec file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data
    is missing in spec file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
    """
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be provided")
    data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    missing = []
    for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
        if field not in data:
            missing.append(field)
    if missing:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {', '.join(missing)}")
    return data

Wait, but what if the YAML parsing fails? The doc doesn't mention handling that, so maybe that's outside the scope of this function. The function's responsibility is to check for required fields once the data is loaded. So perhaps that's okay.

But the parameters: the function's first parameter is cls, so it's a class method. The user must have the class defined elsewhere. But in the code, I can just proceed with the method as written.

Wait, the function is called as a class method, so the code should be inside the class. But the problem only asks for the code of the function itself, so the code I need to output is just the function. But the code needs to include the necessary imports. So I'll have to include the import statements.

Wait, the code example in the problem's think section shows the function with the import? Let me see. The user's example shows the function's code, so I should include the imports at the top of the code block. But in Python, the imports are at the top of the module, so the code should start with import statements.

Wait, the code is to be output in Python markdown format, which would be inside a code block. So the code should include the necessary imports. Let me make sure.

First line: import yaml. Also, the exception: since the raise uses IRValidatorException, which is probably a custom exception, but unless told otherwise, I can assume that it's imported from some module. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the exception is defined in the same module, so no need for an import. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of the same class's module. Since I can't know, perhaps the code just raises that exception, assuming it's already imported. Alternatively, maybe the exception is defined in the same file, so the code doesn't need an import. But the user might have to define that elsewhere. Well, the problem says to generate the code based on the signature and docstring, so I can proceed with that.

Wait, but the code can't work without yaml. So I must include the import. Let me adjust. So the code would start with:

import yaml

from .exceptions import IRValidatorException  # maybe, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the exception is in the same module.

Alternatively, maybe the code doesn't need to import the exception because it's part of the class's own module. But since the function is in a class, the exception might be imported elsewhere. Since the problem doesn't mention it, perhaps the code should just use the exception, but in practice, that would require the import. Hmm, this is a problem. The user might expect the code to include the necessary imports. Since the exception is raised, I have to include the import for it. But without knowing where it's from, maybe I can just make a note. Alternatively, perhaps the exception is in the same file, so no need for an import. But I can't be sure. Let me proceed, assuming that the exception is in a module named exceptions, so perhaps:

import yaml
from exceptions import IRValidatorException

But maybe the user expects the code to not have any dependencies except the YAML parsing. Alternatively, maybe the exception is a class in the same file, so the code doesn't need to import it. Well, since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps I should just write the code as is, using the exception, and include the yaml import.

Putting it all together, the code would have the imports at the top, then the function.

Wait, the function is a class method, so it's part of a class. But the code as written is just the function. So maybe the code should be inside a class, but the problem only requires the function's code. So I think the code can be written as:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = [...]  # but the problem didn't specify which fields are required. So perhaps the code is written in a way that the class has this attribute.

Wait, but the problem's function is part of the class, so the code should be written as the method. Since the user didn't give the class name, but the function is a class method, perhaps the code is written as part of a class. However, the problem only wants the function's code, so maybe I can just write the function, assuming that the class has the REQUIRED_FIELDS.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that the class is not shown, but the function is standalone. Wait, no, because it's a class method. So the code must be inside a class. But the problem's instructions say to generate the code based on the function's signature and docstring. So maybe the code is just the function, and the imports are included before it. But in Python, the class would have to have the REQUIRED_FIELDS.

Hmm, perhaps the code is part of a class, but the user is only asking for the function. So I can write the function as a class method, assuming the class has the required fields. The code would look like:

import yaml

class SomeValidatorClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']  # but this is an example. Since the problem didn't specify the actual required fields, maybe the code just uses cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS.

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        if spec_content is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be provided")
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        missing = []
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                missing.append(field)
        if missing:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {', '.join(missing)}")
        return data

Wait, but the problem's function is written with def validate_from_content(cls, ...), so it's a class method. So the code must be inside a class. But the problem doesn't give the class name, so I can just use a placeholder like the example above. However, the user might want the function to be written without the class context. Wait, no, because it's a class method. So the code must be part of a class.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code is just the function, but that's not possible because it's a class method. So the code must include the class, but the problem didn't specify the class name. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the code is written as a standalone function, but the signature says it's a class method. So I have to include the class.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the code to be written as a method of a class, even if the class isn't fully defined here. So perhaps the code starts with the import, then the function.

Wait, but how can the function be a class method without being inside a class? Oh right, the code must be part of the class. But the problem's function is the one to write. So perhaps the code is written as the method, assuming that the class has the required fields.

Wait, maybe the code can be written as:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
    if spec_content is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("Spec content is required")
    data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
    required = cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS
    for field in required:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

Wait but that's not in a class. So the function can't be a class method unless it's inside a class. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to include the code inside a class, but since the problem's function is a class method, perhaps the code is written as part of a class. But the problem didn't mention the class name, so maybe the code is written with a generic class, but the user might just need the function's code. Wait, the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." The function is part of a class, so the code must be written as a class method inside the class. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written as a standalone function, but that would contradict the 'cls' parameter. So I have to assume that the class is defined elsewhere, and the code is just the method. But in that case, the code must be inside a class. So the user might expect the code to be written as part of a class. Let me think of the minimal code that fits the given function.

Wait, the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the code block is just the function, but with the necessary imports. However, since the function is a class method, it's unclear. But maybe the code is written as follows:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SpecValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['name', 'version', 'other']  # example fields, but the problem didn't specify, so maybe the code uses cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS which is assumed to exist.

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        if spec_content is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be provided")
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        missing = []
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                missing.append(field)
        if missing:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {', '.join(missing)}")
        return data

Wait, but the problem's function's docstring mentions the parameters and return. The code must be written in a way that the function is part of a class. Since the user didn't specify the class name, I can choose a name like 'SpecValidator' as above, but the actual class might have a different name. However, since the problem's function is part of the class, the code must be inside the class.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be written as a standalone function, but that's not possible because of the cls parameter. So I think the code needs to be part of a class. Therefore, I'll write the code with a class that has the method. But since the required fields are not specified, the code must rely on the class having a REQUIRED_FIELDS attribute. So the code will have that class, but the actual fields are left as an example or just assumed.

Wait, but the problem's function is supposed to be part of the class. The user probably expects the code to be written as the method, so the code would be inside a class. But the problem didn't give the class name. So maybe I can just write the code with the function inside a class, using a placeholder class name like 'SomeClass' and then the method. But the user might want the code exactly as per the function signature, so the class is whatever, but the method is as described.

Alternatively, maybe the code is written as a class method, so the @classmethod decorator is present, and the code uses cls. The user might not need the full class, just the method. But how can the method be written without the class? It must be part of a class. So the minimal code would include the class with the method and the REQUIRED_FIELDS.

Hmm, but the problem's docstring says "when mandatory data is missing in spec file", so the code must check that all fields in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS are present. Therefore, the code can't work unless the class has that attribute. But since the problem didn't specify, maybe the code just proceeds with that assumption.

Wait, perhaps the code doesn't need to define the class, just the method. But in Python, the method must be inside a class. So I'll have to create a class for it, even if it's minimal. Let's see. The code would start with the imports, then the class, then the method.

Wait, but the user might have the class defined elsewhere, and this is just the method. But since the problem is to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring, perhaps the code should include the class. Let me try to structure it as:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SpecValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = [...]  # but the actual fields aren't specified. Maybe leave it as a placeholder, but in the function code, use cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS.

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        if spec_content is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be provided")
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        missing = []
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                missing.append(field)
        if missing:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {', '.join(missing)}")
        return data

But the problem's function doesn't mention the class name, so perhaps the code should just have the function, but that's not possible because of the cls parameter. Therefore, I think the code should be written as part of a class, but since the class name isn't given, I have to choose a name. Let's pick the class name as 'Validator' for simplicity.

Wait, but the exception's import is also an issue. If the exception is in the same module, then the code can define it. Let's see:

So, in the code, first import yaml. Then define the exception. Then the class with the method. That way, all the necessary parts are there. The user can adjust the class name and required fields as needed.

Wait, but the problem's function is supposed to be part of the class. The code must include the class. So the code would look like:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SpecValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['required1', 'required2']  # example, but actual fields are up to the class.

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data
        is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("Spec content must be provided")
        data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        missing = []
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                missing.append(field)
        if missing:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {', '.join(missing)}")
        return data

That's better. The class has a list of required fields. The function checks each of them. The exception is defined in the same module. The user can replace the REQUIRED_FIELDS with their actual list.

Wait, but the problem's function signature says 'def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):', which is part of the class. So this code structure is correct. The code includes the necessary imports and the class with the method. The exception is also defined here. That's probably the way to go.

Now, let's think about edge cases. What if the spec_content is an empty YAML? Then data would be an empty dict, and all required fields would be missing. The code should catch that. Also, if the YAML is invalid, the code would raise an error from yaml.safe_load. But the doc doesn't mention handling that, so the function may not be responsible for that. But the doc says to raise when mandatory data is missing, so maybe the YAML parsing is considered a separate issue. The code as written will raise a yaml.YAMLError, but the problem's exception is IRValidatorException. So perhaps the user expects that the YAML is already parsed correctly, and this function just checks the required fields. So the code is okay.

Another point: the function returns the data after validation. So that's correct.

Wait, the first check is if spec_content is None. The parameter has a default of None, so if someone calls the function without providing spec_content, then it's None, and the code raises an exception. That's necessary because otherwise data would be loaded from an empty string. So that's good.

So the code I have above seems to fit. The only thing is that the user didn't specify the required fields, so the code uses cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS, which is a class attribute. The user's class must define that. The code is correct as per the given docstring and function signature.

Wait, but in the code, the exception is raised when mandatory data is missing. The doc says "when mandatory data is missing in spec file". So the error message should probably mention that the spec file is missing required fields, but the code does that. The message includes the missing fields.

Yes, this should work. So the code is as written above. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The function is a class method, so @classmethod is needed. The code checks for spec_content being None, parses the YAML, checks each required field, collects missing ones, and raises if any are missing. Then returns the data. The exception is properly raised. The imports are included for yaml and the custom exception.

Therefore, the final code would be like that. Let me write it again, properly formatted with the exception class and the class that has the method.
