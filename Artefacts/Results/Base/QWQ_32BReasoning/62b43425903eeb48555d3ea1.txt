Okay, I need to create a Python method called _create_in_regex that returns a Pattern object. The docstring says it's for an in-style parameter regular expression. Hmm, what does an in-style parameter look like? Probably something like a variable that's part of a list, maybe using the IN keyword in SQL or similar syntax.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so maybe it's for parsing something like :name IN (value1, value2, ...). So the regex should match parameters where the parameter name is followed by IN and then a list of values in parentheses. But how exactly is the syntax here? Let me think.

The parameter might be written as :param_name IN (val1, val2), so the regex needs to capture the parameter name and the values. But the function's job is just to create the regex pattern, right? Not to actually extract the values, but to form the pattern that can identify such parameters in a string.

So the regex should look for the colon, then the parameter name (which is probably alphanumeric and maybe underscores), followed by ' IN ', case insensitive maybe? Or is case important here? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's case-sensitive unless told otherwise. Then parentheses with some values inside. The values could be separated by commas, possibly with whitespace.

The pattern needs to be a compiled regular expression. So I should construct a regex string and then compile it using re.compile. Let me outline the components:

- Start with a word boundary or ^ to ensure the parameter starts at the beginning of a word? Or maybe just the colon. The parameter name is preceded by a colon, so the regex could start with \b:\w+ to capture the name. Wait, but the parameter name might be more than just letters and numbers. Like maybe underscores or hyphens? The standard for variable names varies, but maybe just \w+ is sufficient here.

Then the IN keyword. So after the parameter name, there should be a space, then IN, then another space. So something like IN\s+\( to match the opening parenthesis. The values inside the parentheses can be any characters except the closing parenthesis, but maybe they can have escaped ones? Or perhaps it's simpler to match up to the next closing parenthesis, allowing for spaces and commas in between.

Wait, the regex needs to capture the parameter name and the list of values. So the pattern should have groups. Let me structure it:

The regex would look for something like :name IN (value1, value2, ...). So the structure is:

^:(\w+)\s+IN\s+\((.*)\)$

But that's probably too simplistic. The problem is that the values can be separated by commas and have spaces. Also, the entire parameter might not be at the start or end of the string, so maybe we need to use word boundaries?

Wait, maybe the parameter is part of a larger string, so the regex should not anchor to the start or end. Let me think again. The parameter part is a substring that starts with a colon followed by the name, then IN, then the list in parentheses. So perhaps:

\b:([\w]+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]*)\)

But need to make sure that the IN is properly matched. Also, the parameter name should be captured as the first group, and the values (the part inside the parentheses) as the second group. The values part can include commas and spaces. So maybe the second group is non-greedy, but with a closing parenthesis as the end.

Alternatively, the values can be any characters until the closing parenthesis, but not including it. So the pattern would be something like:

re.compile(r':(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]+)\)')

Wait, but the IN part might have varying cases? Like "in" or "In" or "IN"? If the function is supposed to be case-insensitive, then maybe we should use re.IGNORECASE. But the docstring doesn't mention that. Let me check the problem statement again. The docstring says "Create the in-style parameter regular expression." So maybe it's specifically for the 'IN' keyword in uppercase. So case-sensitive.

Also, the parentheses need to be properly escaped in the regex. So the left parenthesis is \(. The right is \). So the regex string should have those.

The function's return is a Pattern object, so after creating the regex string, we need to compile it with re.compile.

Putting it all together: The regex should match a colon followed by a word (parameter name), then ' IN ', then an opening parenthesis, followed by some content (the values) until the closing parenthesis. The values part is captured as a group so that the caller can process them.

Wait, but the content inside the parentheses might have commas and spaces. So maybe the second group is (?:[^)]*) to capture everything except the closing parenthesis. But the group is necessary here for extraction. So the regex would be:

The pattern is r':(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]+)\)'

But perhaps there's more to it. For example, the parameter name could have more characters. Maybe it's better to use \w+ which includes letters, numbers, and underscores. That's standard for variable names in many contexts. So that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the parameter name is case-sensitive, but the IN could be in any case. But the problem's docstring doesn't say that, so probably not. Let's stick to the case-sensitive approach unless told otherwise.

So the code would be something like:

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    return re.compile(r':(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]+)\)')

Wait, but the return type is Pattern, which is from the re module. So yes, compiling the regex into a pattern object is correct.

Wait, but maybe the IN part can have varying amounts of whitespace. Like " IN ", "IN(", or " IN ( " etc. So perhaps the regex should account for optional whitespace around the IN and parentheses.

So adjusting the regex:

The IN keyword can have any amount of whitespace around it, and the parentheses can also have spaces around them. So maybe:

\s*IN\s*\(

That way, spaces before and after IN and the parenthesis are allowed.

So the full regex becomes r':(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]+)\)'

Wait, but the closing parenthesis may have spaces before it? Like (value1, value2 ) ?

Hmm, the values inside the parentheses can have spaces, so the closing parenthesis is the end. So maybe the closing part is \s*\)'?

Wait, the opening is after IN, so the regex should be:

r':(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]+)\s*\)'

Wait, perhaps better to have the entire IN part with optional spaces around the keyword and the parentheses. Let me structure it again.

The parameter part is :name followed by IN, possibly with some whitespace between the name and IN. The IN can have any amount of whitespace (including zero) before and after. The parentheses also can have whitespace around them. So the regex should have:

:([\w_]+)\s*IN\s*\(\s*([^)]*)\s*\)

Wait, but the group for the values would include everything between the parentheses, including any leading or trailing whitespace. Maybe the second group can be ([^)]*), but with possible spaces inside.

Alternatively, split into groups for the name and the values, but the values can be anything except a closing parenthesis, so the regex would capture up to the next closing parenthesis. So the pattern is:

:([a-zA-Z_][\w_]*)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]+)\)

Wait, maybe the parameter name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by more letters, numbers, or underscores. The \w includes that, but maybe the first character is more restricted. But the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps just \w+ is okay for the parameter name.

So the regex should be something like r':(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]+)\)'

Wait, but the IN and the parentheses must be exactly there. So the IN is case-sensitive, and the parentheses are literal. The spaces around IN can be any, including zero? For example, ":nameIN(value)" would still be matched. That might be necessary.

But in typical syntax, like SQL, it's "IN ( ... )", so maybe the regex requires the spaces around the IN and the parentheses. Hmm, but the user might have varying spacing. So to be flexible, maybe:

The regex is r':(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]+)\)'

Wait, but the closing parenthesis may have spaces before it. The second group would stop at the first closing parenthesis. So the regex would capture everything between the first '(' and the next ')'.

Alternatively, maybe the entire content inside the parentheses can have any characters except a closing parenthesis, so the regex is okay.

Testing this regex:

For input like ":name IN (val1, val2)", it would capture 'name' and 'val1, val2'.

Another example: ":user_id IN ('a', 'b')" would capture 'user_id' and "'a', 'b'".

Yes, that seems to work.

So the code would be to compile this regex. But I need to make sure that it's properly escaped in Python raw strings. The parentheses are okay as \(. but in the raw string, we can just use ( and ), but they need to be escaped if they're not part of a group. Wait, in this case, the parentheses are part of the literal syntax. So the opening parenthesis after IN is a literal, so in regex it's \(, and the closing is \). But in the regex string, using raw strings, so we can write them as \( and \).

Wait, the regex string would be written as r':(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]+)\)'

Breaking it down:

- : matches the colon.
- (\w+) captures the parameter name (group 1).
- \s* allows any whitespace (including none) after the name.
- IN is the keyword, case-sensitive.
- \s* allows any whitespace between IN and the parenthesis.
- \( matches the opening parenthesis.
- ( [^)]+ ) captures the values (group 2). The + ensures there is at least one character. But maybe the values can be empty? Like ( )? Not sure. The problem may require that there are values, but perhaps the regex can still handle it.

Wait, the function's purpose is to create the regex for in-style parameters, so the regex must match such patterns. So if the user inputs :name IN (), then the values group would be empty. Maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the values group should be non-empty. But the problem doesn't specify, so proceed as is.

So compiling that regex. Therefore, the code would be:

import re
from typing import Pattern

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    return re.compile(r':(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]+)\)')

Wait, but in the function, self is present. So this method is part of a class. The imports are necessary. However, the user didn't mention including imports. The question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. Since the function returns a Pattern, which is re.Pattern, we need to have from typing import Pattern, but perhaps the user expects that the code uses re.compile and returns that. Since the function is inside a class, the code should just have the method, but the re module must be imported somewhere.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. Wait, the user wrote "/think" which might be a typo, but the actual output should be the code without explanations, just the code. So the method's code is just the return line with the re.compile. But I need to make sure that the regex is correct.

Another consideration: The IN part must be in uppercase? The docstring doesn't specify case insensitivity, so the regex is case-sensitive. So "in" lowercase would not match. That's okay.

Another possible edge case: What if the parameter name has underscores or hyphens? The \w includes underscores, but hyphens would not be included. If hyphens are allowed in parameter names, then maybe the regex should be adjusted. But since the problem doesn't specify, stick with \w+.

So the code is as above. Wait, but maybe the regex should also account for possible trailing commas or different separators? But the regex just needs to capture the entire content inside the parentheses, so splitting the values can be done later.

Therefore, the correct code is to return re.compile with that pattern.
