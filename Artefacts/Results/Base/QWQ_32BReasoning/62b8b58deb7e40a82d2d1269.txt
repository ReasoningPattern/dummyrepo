Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function directlyProvidedBy(object) based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns the interfaces directly provided by the object, and the return type is an IDeclaration from zope.interface.interfaces.

Hmm, I remember that in Zope Interface, there's a way to get the interfaces that an object directly provides. The function probably uses the zope.interface module. Oh right, the providedBy function from zope.interface returns a Declaration, but that might be for all interfaces, including those inherited. Wait, the question specifies "directly provided", so maybe I should use something else.

Wait, the providedBy function returns an IDeclaration that includes all interfaces directly declared on the object. Let me check. Oh, yes, zope.interface providedBy gives the interfaces that the object or its class explicitly declare, but maybe the Declaration includes all, not just the immediate ones. Or perhaps the directlyProvided function is part of the module? Wait, maybe the user is asking to implement a version of that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the zope.interface API. Let me recall. The providedBy() function from zope.interface returns a Declaration that includes the interfaces directly provided by the object's class, but not including those from superclasses. Wait, no, actually, the providedBy() returns all interfaces that the object implements, both directly and through its class hierarchy. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the Declaration includes all interfaces declared via the class's __implemented__ attribute, which includes the direct declarations and the ones from the class's own bases? Or does it collect the interfaces from the class's __implemented__ and the bases' __implemented__?

Wait, the user's function is called directlyProvidedBy, so maybe it's different from providedBy. The zope.interface module has a method called directlyProvidedBy, which returns the interfaces that are directly provided by the object, not including those from its class. Or perhaps the other way around. Wait, perhaps the function should return the interfaces that the object's class directly declares. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the zope.interface module's directlyProvided method. Wait, I think the correct approach here is to use the zope.interface module's providedBy function, but then extract the directly declared interfaces. Wait, maybe the providedBy function actually returns a Declaration that includes all interfaces, including those from the class's __implemented__ and the bases. But the directlyProvided function would only return the ones explicitly declared on the class itself, not inherited from superclasses.

Wait, perhaps the code should be importing the zope.interface module and using the directly() function. Oh right, in Zope Interface, there's a function called directly() which returns the interfaces directly declared on the object's class. Wait, let me check the API again.

Looking up, I recall that providedBy(obj) returns an adapter that knows the interfaces provided by the object, but when you get the declaration from that, it includes the interfaces from the class and its bases. However, the directly() function can be used to get the interfaces declared directly on the class (excluding those from the bases). So, maybe the correct code is to get the declaration from the providedBy object's bases, but only the direct ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should return the interfaces that are directly declared on the object's class, which can be done using zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy. Wait, no, maybe directlyProvidedBy is the function that's part of the module. Wait, actually, the zope.interface module has a function called directlyProvidedBy which returns the interfaces directly declared by the object. Wait, perhaps that's exactly what the user wants. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard zope.interface functions include:

- providedBy(obj) returns an interface that represents all interfaces the object provides, including those from the class hierarchy.

- directlyProvidedBy(obj) is a function that returns the interfaces that are directly declared on the object's class, not inherited.

So maybe the code is straightforward: import the necessary parts and return directlyProvidedBy(object). But I need to make sure the return type is an IDeclaration.

Wait, the docstring mentions that the return is an IDeclaration. So perhaps the code is:

from zope.interface import providedBy
from zope.interface.declarations import Declaration

Wait, but maybe the correct approach is to use zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy. Wait, I think I need to check the actual zope.interface functions.

Wait, according to the Zope Interface documentation, the directlyProvidedBy function returns the interfaces that were directly declared on the object's class. Wait, perhaps the code is as simple as:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    from zope.interface import providedBy
    return providedBy(object).directly()

Wait no, maybe not. Let me think again. Alternatively, there's a directly() function that takes the class and returns the interfaces directly implemented. So maybe the function should use zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy. Wait, perhaps the function is already part of the zope.interface module. Let me recall the API.

Ah, here's the thing: the zope.interface module has a function called directlyProvidedBy which returns the interfaces directly declared on the object's class. So perhaps the code is as simple as importing that function and wrapping it, but the user's function is supposed to be named directlyProvidedBy, which is exactly the same as the zope function. Wait, maybe the user is asking to implement this function, but in that case, they might need to use the internal methods.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class has declared directly, using the __implemented__ attribute. But how do you get that?

Alternatively, the code might be using the providedBy() function and then getting the directly declared part from it. The providedBy returns an adapter that has a directly() method, perhaps? Or maybe the Declaration object has a way to get the direct ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct code is to import the directlyProvidedBy function from zope.interface and just return that. Let me check.

In the zope.interface module, there's a function called directlyProvidedBy which takes an object and returns the interfaces directly declared on it, which is a Declaration. So maybe the code is:

from zope.interface import directlyProvidedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return zope.interface.directlyProvidedBy(object)

Wait, but the user wants us to write the function, not just re-export it. Wait, the question says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". So perhaps the user expects us to implement the function using the zope.interface module's existing functions, or maybe they are part of a framework where this function is to be defined.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using the zope.interface and the function is just a wrapper. But in the docstring, it's specified that the return is an IDeclaration, so perhaps the code is as simple as importing the necessary functions and returning that.

Wait, perhaps the user's function is part of the zope.interface framework, and the code is to be written using their API. So in that case, the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return providedBy(obj).directly()

But I'm not sure if that's the right method. Alternatively, maybe the providedBy returns an IObjectSpecification, which has a .direct() method or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the directly() function from zope.interface. Let me think again. The zope.interface module has:

- directlyProvides() to set the directly provided interfaces for an object.

- directlyProvided() is a function that returns the directly provided interfaces of an object.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the functions. Let me check:

Looking up in zope.interface, there's a directlyProvided function which returns the interfaces directly provided by the object, which are those set via directlyProvides() and those declared in the class's __implemented__ (if any). Wait, perhaps the function directlyProvided is the one to use here. The function the user is asking for is called directlyProvidedBy, so maybe there's a typo here, but according to the problem statement, the function should be named directlyProvidedBy, so perhaps the code is:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

Wait, but the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. The directlyProvided function returns a Declaration, which is an IDeclaration. So maybe that's the correct code. But why the name? Oh, perhaps the user's function is supposed to be called like that. Wait, maybe the original function is in the zope.interface module as directlyProvided. So perhaps the correct code is to import that function and just return it. But the user's function is named directlyProvidedBy, so perhaps that's just a renaming. So the code would be as simple as:

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

But then the user's function would have to import the directlyProvided function from zope.interface. So the code would need to have:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me confirm. The providedBy function returns an IObjectSpecification, which is an object that includes all interfaces, including those from the class hierarchy. The directlyProvided function returns the interfaces that are directly declared on the object (i.e., the ones that are set via directlyProvides, plus the ones declared in the class's __implemented__ attribute, but not those from superclasses). Wait, no, perhaps the class's __implemented__ includes both direct and inherited. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the directlyProvided function returns the interfaces that are directly provided by the object's class, not including the bases. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to get the interfaces declared on the object's class, not the object itself. For example, if the object's class has an __implemented__ attribute, that's a Declaration of the interfaces directly provided by that class, including any added via classImplements.

Wait, in that case, the code would need to get the class of the object and then get the __implemented__ attribute. But if that's not present, then perhaps it's empty. However, Zope Interface uses the class's __implemented__ attribute to track directly provided interfaces. So the function could be:

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return getattr(cls, '__implemented__', None) or Declaration()

Wait, but that might not account for the bases. Wait, no, the __implemented__ attribute is a Declaration that combines the class's own interfaces with those from the bases? Or does it only hold the ones directly declared?

Hmm, the __implemented__ attribute is a Declaration that lists the interfaces directly declared on the class, and then the bases' __implemented__ are considered when building the full specification. So for the class's directly provided interfaces, you can just look at the __implemented__ attribute. But the function is supposed to return the interfaces directly provided by the object. Wait, perhaps the object might have interfaces directly set on it, like using directlyProvides. So the function should return the union of the interfaces set on the object and those declared in the class's __implemented__?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of the zope.interface's own API, and the correct code is to use their internal functions. Let me think again. The zope.interface module has a function called directlyProvided, which returns a Declaration of the interfaces that are directly provided by the object. That includes both the __implemented__ on the class and any interfaces set on the object's own __provides__ attribute?

Wait, maybe I should check the zope.interface documentation. Since I can't do that right now, I'll have to recall. The providedBy function returns all interfaces that the object implements, including those from the class hierarchy. The directlyProvided function returns the interfaces that are directly provided by the object, which are those explicitly set on the object (like via directlyProvides) plus the __implemented__ of the class. Wait, no, maybe the class's __implemented__ is part of the directly provided. Or perhaps the directlyProvided function is exactly the interfaces declared on the class, not the object's instance.

Alternatively, maybe the function is to return the interfaces declared on the class's __implemented__ attribute. So, the code would be:

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return obj.__class__.__dict__.get('__implemented__', None)

But that would return a Declaration or None, but according to the docstring, it should return an IDeclaration. So perhaps the code should use the zope.interface module's directlyProvided function.

In any case, the most straightforward solution is to import the directlyProvided function from zope.interface and return it. So the code would be:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

Wait, but the function name in the problem is directlyProvidedBy, but the actual function in zope.interface is directlyProvided. So maybe there's a typo here. The user might have intended to name the function as in the zope module. But according to the problem's function signature, the user wants the function named directlyProvidedBy. So perhaps the correct code is to import directlyProvided from zope.interface and return that. Alternatively, maybe the user's function is supposed to be similar to providedBy but only the direct ones. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the providedBy function returns an IObjectSpecification, which is an object that has a method to get the directly declared interfaces. Like:

spec = providedBy(obj)
direct = spec.directly()

But I'm not sure if that's how it's done. Alternatively, maybe the spec has a directly attribute.

Alternatively, maybe the code should check the __implemented__ attribute of the class. Let me try writing it that way. The function would get the class of the object, then check if it has __implemented__ attribute, and return that. If not present, maybe return an empty Declaration?

Wait, but the zope.interface's Declaration is the correct type. So the code could be:

from zope.interface.declarations import Declaration
from zope.interface import Interface

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    if hasattr(cls, '__implemented__'):
        return cls.__implemented__
    else:
        return Declaration()

But that's a possible approach. However, the zope.interface module might have a more standard way. Let me see, perhaps using the directly() function. Wait, there's a directly() function that takes a class and returns its directly provided interfaces. Like:

from zope.interface import directly

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directly(obj.__class__)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the zope.interface module has directlyProvided and providedBy. Let me think again. The providedBy function gives all interfaces, including those from the class hierarchy. The directlyProvided function gives the interfaces that are directly declared on the object's class plus any directly set on the object itself. Wait, maybe the function in the problem is exactly that. So, using directlyProvided from zope.interface would do the job. Therefore, the code would be:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

But the problem's function name is directlyProvidedBy, which might be a typo. Because the zope function is directlyProvided. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the class's directly provided interfaces, so maybe the function should return directlyProvided on the class, not the object. In that case, perhaps:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj.__class__)

Wait, but then the function would return the interfaces provided by the class. Hmm. The original problem's docstring says "directly provided by the given object". So maybe it's the object's own directly provided interfaces, which could include class-declared ones and any set on the instance. So the first approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's function is part of a framework that uses a different approach. But given that the return is an IDeclaration from zope.interface.interfaces, the best way is to rely on the zope.interface's existing functions.

So putting it all together, the code should be importing directlyProvided from zope.interface and returning it. So the code is:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

Wait, but the function's name in the problem is different. The user's function is named directlyProvidedBy, but zope's is directlyProvided. So maybe that's a mistake, but since the problem specifies that function name, the code must be as per that.

Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between the object and the class. The function might be intended to return the interfaces declared directly on the object's class, not the object's instance. So in that case, the code would use directly on the class. Let me see, in zope.interface, there is a directly() function that takes a class and returns its directly provided interfaces. Wait, perhaps the correct code is:

from zope.interface import directly

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directly(obj.__class__)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The zope.interface directly() function returns the interfaces directly implemented by the class. So yes, that's probably the right way. Alternatively, the user might have meant the same as the zope's directlyProvided function, but named differently. The problem's function is called directlyProvidedBy, but the zope function is directlyProvided. That might be a typo. But given that the user's function signature is exactly that, perhaps the code should use the correct zope function.

Alternatively, maybe the user's function is part of the providedBy method. For example, providedBy returns an object that has a directly() method. So:

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return providedBy(obj).directly()

But I need to check if that's the case. Let me think: providedBy returns an IObjectSpecification, which is a specification for the object. The specification has a .direct() method that returns the interfaces directly provided by the object (i.e., not from superclasses). So maybe:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return providedBy(obj).direct()

Wait, that makes sense. Because providedBy gives all interfaces, but the .direct() method would give the ones directly declared, like on the object's class and any added via directlyProvides.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is called directly. Let me check the zope.interface docs again mentally. The IObjectSpecification has a .direct() method that returns the directly provided interfaces. So, if that's the case, then the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return providedBy(obj).direct()

Wait, but the return type is supposed to be an IDeclaration. The IObjectSpecification's direct() method returns a Declaration, which implements IDeclaration. So that's correct. Therefore, the function would import providedBy from zope.interface, then call .direct() on it. 

Hmm, so I think the correct code is using providedBy's direct() method. Let me try to write that.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility: the directlyProvidedBy function is part of the zope.interface module. Let me see, perhaps the function is called directlyProvided, and that's exactly what the problem wants. So the user might have made a typo in the function's name. But given the problem's exact function name, I should follow it. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the class's interfaces. So the code could be:

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj.__class__)

But then, the function directlyProvided takes an object, not a class. Wait, no, perhaps directlyProvided can take a class as an argument. Let me see: the zope.interface directlyProvided function is for an object, so the class is an instance of type. So, perhaps that's okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

But the problem's function name is different. So maybe that's the way. However, the user's docstring says "the given object", so perhaps they mean the instance, not the class. So in that case, using directlyProvided is correct, even though the function name is different. 

Wait, perhaps the user's function is named correctly, and the correct code is to use directlyProvided. But the function name here is directlyProvidedBy. So the code would be as above. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is following an older version of zope.interface, but I think in the current version, the function is called directlyProvided. So given that, the correct code would be to import that and return it. 

Therefore, the code is:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

Wait, but the problem's function's docstring says "Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object". The zope's directlyProvided returns the interfaces directly declared on the object (instance) and its class's __implemented__ but not the ones from the bases. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should make sure that the code is using the correct import. Let me also think about the possible imports. The zope.interface module's directlyProvided is a function that returns a Declaration. 

So the code would be:

from zope.interface import directlyProvided

def directlyProvidedBy(obj):
    return directlyProvided(obj)

But I have to make sure that the user's function's name is correctly matched. Since the problem says to generate the code with the function signature def directlyProvidedBy(...), then this is correct. 

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The zope.interface module has:

- directlyProvided(obj) → the interfaces directly provided by the object (i.e., those set on the object's __provides__ or the class's __implemented__).

- providedBy(obj) → all interfaces provided by the object, including those from the class hierarchy.

The problem's function is to return the directly provided ones, so the code should use directlyProvided from zope.interface, and the function's name is as per the problem's requirement, even if it's a different name. 

Therefore, the code is as above. Let me confirm again. The docstring says the return is an IDeclaration, which is what directlyProvided returns. 

Yes, I think that's the correct approach. So I'll write the code with that.
