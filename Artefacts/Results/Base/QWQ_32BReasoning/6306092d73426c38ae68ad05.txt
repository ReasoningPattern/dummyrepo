Okay, so I need to generate Python code for the method get_option_spec based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's see. The function is part of a class since it's a method with self as the first parameter. The parameters are command_name and argument_name. The docstring says it gets the specification for the specified option name. It also mentions to get options of the command using self.get_parser_option_specs(). 

Hmm, so the task is to retrieve the spec for a particular option. The method should probably first get all the options for the command using that get_parser_option_specs function. Then, loop through those options to find the one where the argument_name matches. But wait, how are the options structured? The get_parser_option_specs() likely returns a list of option specs. Each spec might be a dictionary with keys like 'name' or 'argument_name' and other details.

So the steps would be: call self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name) to get all options for that command. Then iterate over each option in the returned list. For each option, check if its name matches the argument_name provided. Once found, return that option's spec. If not found, maybe return None or raise an error? The docstring doesn't specify, but since it's a get method, returning None makes sense if it's optional.

Wait, the function is called get_option_spec, so probably when the option isn't found, it returns None. So the code would look something like this:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    for option in options:
        if option['name'] == argument_name:
            return option
    return None

But I need to make sure about the key names in the option dictionaries. The docstring says "specification for the specified option name", so the argument_name is the name of the option. Assuming that the options from get_parser_option_specs() have a 'name' key. Alternatively, maybe the key is 'argument_name'? The function's parameter is called argument_name, but the options might use 'name' as the key. Let me think. The parameter is named argument_name, but in the context of options, they are often referred to as options, like --verbose or -v. So the key in the spec is probably 'name'.

Alternatively, maybe the options have a 'flags' key and a 'dest' or something else. But since the doc mentions "option name", which is likely the name that's being passed as argument_name. Let's stick with 'name' as the key. 

So the code would loop through each option in the list returned by get_parser_option_specs, check if the 'name' matches argument_name, and return that option. If none found, return None. 

That's probably it. Let me make sure there's no typos. The function is supposed to take command_name and argument_name. So the first line is correct. The for loop iterates over options, and the if condition checks the name. 

I think that's the right approach. Let me write the code accordingly.
