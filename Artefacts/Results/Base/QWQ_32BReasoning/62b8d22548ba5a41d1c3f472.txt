Okay, I need to generate a Python decorator called cachedmethod based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's see. The parameters are cache, key which defaults to hashkey, and lock which is optional. 

The decorator should cache the results of a method. So the basic idea is that when the method is called, it checks the cache using a generated key. If the key exists, return the cached value; otherwise, compute it, store it in the cache, and then return it.

Wait, but how do decorators work when they have arguments? Oh right, the outer function (cachedmethod) takes the parameters and returns the actual decorator. So the structure would be something like:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        ... setup ...
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            ... compute key ...
            if key in cache:
                return cache[key]
            else:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Hmm, but the key parameter is a function, right? Because the default is hashkey, which I assume is a function to generate the key. So the user can pass a custom key function. The key function would take the function's arguments and return a unique key. Wait, maybe the key function is supposed to generate the key from the function's arguments. Like, for a method, the first argument is self, so the key might need to consider all the arguments passed to the function. So when the wrapper is called, it should generate the key by passing the args and kwargs to the key function. 

Wait, the default key is hashkey, but I don't know what hashkey is. Maybe it's a function that creates a key based on the arguments. So the key function would take the function's arguments and return a hashable key. So in the wrapper, the key is generated as key_func(*args, **kwargs) or something like that. 

Wait, actually, the parameters to the decorator are cache, key, and lock. So the key is a function that generates the key for the cache. So when the wrapper is called, it uses the key function to create the key from the function's arguments. 

So the steps are: the decorator takes the cache, the key function, and an optional lock. The wrapper function will compute the key by applying the key function to the arguments of the method. Then check if that key is in the cache. If it is, return the value. If not, compute the function's result, store it in the cache with that key, and return it. 

Also, if a lock is provided, we need to handle concurrent access. Since it's a method, maybe it's for a multi-threaded environment. So the lock should be acquired before checking the cache and storing the result. But how to handle that properly?

The lock is an optional parameter. So in the case where lock is not None, we should use it to synchronize access to the cache. So the code would need to acquire the lock when checking and updating the cache. 

Wait, the standard pattern for memoization with a lock would involve checking the cache while holding the lock, but maybe the key function can be called outside the lock. Let me think. The key generation should be thread-safe on its own? Probably, since it's just a function that takes the arguments. So the steps would be:

Inside the wrapper:
- Generate the key using key(*args, **kwargs)
- If lock is present, acquire it
- Check if key is in cache:
   - if yes, get the value and release the lock if held
   - if no, compute the function, store the result in the cache, release lock, return result
- Else (no lock), just check and compute as before.

Wait, but the key function might need to have access to the function's name or something? Wait no, the key function is passed the arguments of the method. The original function's arguments are what's passed to the key function. So when the decorator is applied to a method, the key function would take the method's arguments (including self) to generate a key. 

Wait, but in the decorator's parameters, the key is a function that is supposed to generate the key. So the key function's signature must accept the same arguments as the decorated function. For example, if the method is something like instance_method(self, a, b), then the key function would be called as key(self, a, b, ...). So the key is generated based on all the arguments passed to the function. 

Therefore, in the wrapper, when the function is called, we call key = key_func(*args, **kwargs). Wait, no. Wait, the key parameter here is the function. So inside the wrapper, when the function is called, the key is generated by key_func(*args, **kwargs). 

Wait, the parameters to the decorator are: cache, key=hashkey, lock=None. So the key is a function that the user can provide. The default is hashkey, but I don't know what that is. Maybe hashkey is a function that creates a key based on the arguments. So the user can pass their own function to create the key. 

So the code structure would be something like:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    defdecorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            k = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if k in cache:
                        return cache[k]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but wait, the key is called with the same arguments as the function. But when the function is a method, the first argument is self. So the key function would need to handle that. The user can choose any key function, but the default must work for methods. 

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and its arguments. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parameters. Let me check the function signature again: key=hashkey. So the key is a function, which probably takes the arguments of the function and returns a hashable key. 

The problem is that in the wrapper, the function is called with *args and **kwargs. So the key function must accept those same arguments. 

Wait, but in the example, the default key is hashkey. Maybe hashkey is a function that takes the arguments and returns a tuple or something. Like, perhaps the default key is to combine the function's name and the arguments. Wait, but the decorator is supposed to be for any method, so maybe the key function is supposed to take the arguments and return a key. 

Hmm, maybe the key function should be a function that, given the function's arguments, returns a unique key. So in the wrapper, we can compute k by key(*args, **kwargs). 

Wait, but if the function has default parameters or uses *args and **kwargs, then the key function must handle that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key function is supposed to take the function's instance (for methods) and its arguments. Wait, but in the parameters of the decorator, the key is a function, so the user can pass a function that takes the arguments of the decorated function. 

So the code structure I have in mind is correct. 

Wait, but in the case where a lock is provided, the code needs to handle the cache check and write atomically. So the lock should be held during the check and the storage. 

Wait in my previous code, when using the lock, the code is inside a with lock block. So the check for k in cache, and the subsequent call to func, and then setting cache[k] = result all happen under the lock. That should prevent race conditions where two threads compute the same result. 

Wait, but in the case without a lock, there's a possibility of multiple threads computing the same result if they check the cache at the same time. So the lock is important for thread safety. 

Now, the problem is the parameters. The user can pass a cache object, which is presumably a dictionary-like structure. The key function is called with the function's arguments to produce the key, and the lock is an optional lock for concurrency. 

Wait, but the key function might need to know the function being decorated? Like, for example, if the function's identity is part of the key. But the way the parameters are given here, the key is a function that is passed as an argument to the cachedmethod. So the key function must be able to generate the key based on the arguments passed to the method. 

Wait, perhaps the key function is supposed to generate a key from the function's arguments. So the default hashkey function would do something like that. Let's assume that hashkey is a function that takes the arguments and returns a hashable key. 

So the code is as above. 

Wait, but in the code I wrote earlier, when using lock, the code inside the with lock block calls func again. That's a problem. Because in the case where lock is present, the code would first compute k outside the lock, then acquire the lock, check the cache again (maybe someone else added it while the lock was being acquired?), then if not present, call the function. Wait no, because the key is computed first, then the lock is taken. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The code in the case of a lock would do:

with lock:
    if k in cache:
        return cache[k]
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    cache[k] = result
    return result

Wait, but in that scenario, if two threads are trying to compute the same k, they would both compute k, then one gets the lock, checks the cache, computes the result, stores it, and releases the lock. The other thread then enters the lock, checks again, sees the key is there, and returns. That works. 

But in the code above, when there's a lock, the key is computed outside the lock. Suppose two threads compute the same key, then one acquires the lock, checks the cache (not there), computes the result, stores it. The other thread then enters the lock, checks again, finds it, and returns. So that's okay. 

The problem would be if the key generation is not deterministic, but that's the user's responsibility. 

So the code structure is okay. 

Now, the code I have is almost correct, but I need to make sure that the key is generated correctly. 

Wait, in the code above, the key is generated as key(*args, **kwargs). But the key function is passed as the 'key' parameter. Wait, the parameters to the decorator are cache, key=hashkey, lock=None. So the key here is the function that is passed. 

Wait, in the code, the 'key' variable in the wrapper's scope is the key function from the outer scope. So when the user passes a custom key function, it's used here. 

Yes, that seems right. 

Now, the problem is that in the case without a lock, the check and store may not be atomic, so if multiple threads are accessing, they might both check and then both compute the result. But that's up to the user to provide a lock if they need thread safety. 

Another thing to note is that the wrapper must handle the function's arguments properly. So using *args and **kwargs is correct. 

Wait, but for methods, the first argument is self. So the key function must account for that. The default hashkey function probably takes all the arguments into account. 

Now, the code's structure. Let me write it properly. 

Wait, the decorator is supposed to be a decorator factory. So the outer function (cachedmethod) returns the decorator function. The decorator takes the function and returns the wrapper. 

Wait, perhaps the key function is supposed to be called with the function's arguments. So in the wrapper, the key is generated by key(*args, **kwargs). 

Wait, but the key function might have a different signature. Like, maybe it takes the function and its arguments. Hmm, but according to the parameters, the key is passed as an argument to cachedmethod, which is separate from the function. 

Wait, perhaps the key function is supposed to take the function's arguments. The user can pass a key function that, given the arguments of the function, returns the key. So the code is okay. 

Wait, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function's arguments and the function itself. But the current parameters don't include that. The decorator's parameters don't have the function yet, so the key function can't refer to the function. 

Hmm, maybe the key function is supposed to take the arguments and return a key. 

Therefore, the code as above should be correct. 

Wait, but in the case without a lock, there's a race condition. Suppose two threads check the cache at the same time, both not find it, and then both compute the result. That's a problem, but the user can pass a lock to prevent that. 

Now, the code structure. Let me see. 

Wait, in the code, when there's a lock, the entire check and computation is done under the lock. So that's safe. 

But when there's no lock, two threads might call the function at the same time, both compute the key, see it's not in the cache, and then both compute the result. 

So the lock is needed for thread safety. 

Now, the code. Let me write it properly. 

Wait, the key function is passed as an argument. So in the wrapper, the key is generated by key(*args, **kwargs). 

Wait, but what if the key function requires the function's instance (for a method) or something else? The user's key function is responsible for that. 

The code is okay. 

Wait, but in the code above, when there's a lock, the function is called inside the lock. That could be a problem if the function takes a long time. But that's the standard way to avoid race conditions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the lock is only needed for checking the cache and storing the result, but not for the actual function call. 

Wait, but in that case, the function could be called by multiple threads, but the cache would only be updated once. So the steps would be: 

- Compute the key outside the lock. 

- Acquire the lock. 

- Check if key is in cache. 

   - If yes, return it. 

   - Else, release the lock, call the function, then reacquire the lock and store the result. 

But that would require rechecking after acquiring the lock again. 

Hmm, but that's more complicated. The current approach is to have the lock held during the entire process, which ensures that only one thread can proceed to compute the function if the key is not present. 

So that's the right approach. 

Now, the code. Let me structure it. 

Wait, in the code, the key is generated before acquiring the lock. That's okay, because generating the key is not a problem. 

Wait, but the key could be generated with the function's arguments, so that's fine. 

Now, the code's syntax. Let me make sure. 

The outer function is cachedmethod, which takes cache, key, lock. 

Then the decorator is defined inside, which takes the function. 

Then the wrapper function is defined. 

Wait, in the code I wrote earlier, the 'lock' variable in the wrapper is the lock parameter passed to cachedmethod. So yes, that's correct. 

Wait, but in Python, the variables in the outer scope are accessible. So the wrapper can refer to key and lock from the cachedmethod's parameters. 

Yes. 

Now, in the case where lock is None, the code doesn't use a lock. 

Now, code structure. Let me write it again, using proper indentation and syntax. 

Wait, perhaps the code can be written more concisely. 

Also, maybe using a helper function to get the key and handle the lock. 

Alternatively, here's the code:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            k = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    cached_value = cache.get(k)
                    if cached_value is not None:
                        return cached_value
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but in the case with lock, perhaps using cache.get is better than checking k in cache, to avoid a race condition where another thread added it after the check. Wait, no, because under the lock, the check is atomic. So inside the lock, if k is in cache, then return it. If not, compute, store, return. 

Alternatively, using get might be slightly more efficient, but the logic is the same. 

Hmm, perhaps the code can be written as:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
            cache_key = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock:
                with lock:
                    if cache_key in cache:
                        return cache[cache_key]
                    res = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[cache_key] = res
                    return res
            else:
                if cache_key in cache:
                    return cache[cache_key]
                res = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[cache_key] = res
                return res
        return wrapped
    return decorator

Yes, that's better. Using wrapped as the name. 

Wait, but what if the key function returns a value that's not hashable? That's the user's responsibility. 

Also, note that the cache is passed as an argument, so it's the same for all calls. So the decorator is designed to use an external cache. 

Wait, the parameters to cachedmethod are cache, which is the cache storage. So the user must pass a cache object (like a dict) to the decorator. 

This seems okay. 

Now, in the case of a method, the self is part of the arguments. So the key function will include the self in its hash. But if two different instances call the same method with the same other arguments, their keys will be different because self is different. 

That's correct. So the cache is per instance if the key includes self, but if the user wants a class-level cache, they need to handle that. 

Wait, but maybe the user wants to cache based on the arguments excluding self. That's possible, but the key function is their responsibility. 

So the code is correct as written. 

Wait, but in the code above, when there is a lock, the lock is acquired, and then check the cache. If it's there, return. Else, compute, store, return. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Hmm, I think that's the code. Now, I need to make sure that the parameters are properly handled. 

Wait, the key parameter is a function. The default is hashkey, but in the code I have here, the user can pass their own function. 

Wait, but in the code, the key is called with *args and **kwargs. So that's correct. 

Yes, I think this code should work. 

Wait, but in the original code example, the key function is passed as key=hashkey, so maybe hashkey is a function that is part of the module. But in the generated code, the user is expected to pass a key function that can generate the key based on the arguments. 

So the code is correct. 

I think that's the code. Let me write it properly with correct syntax and indentation.
