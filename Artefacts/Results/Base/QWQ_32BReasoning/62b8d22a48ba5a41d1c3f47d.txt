Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the pop method based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):. The docstring explains that if the key is found, it removes it and returns the value. If not found, it returns the default if provided, otherwise raises a KeyError.

Hmm, so the first thing I remember is that this is probably a method for a dictionary-like class, maybe a subclass of dict. The default parameter has a default value of __marker. Wait, I think __marker is a special object used to indicate that the default was not provided. So in the code, I should check if the key exists. If it does, remove it and return the value. If it doesn't, then check if a default was given. If not, raise KeyError. But how do I handle the __marker?

Right, in the standard dict.pop, they use a sentinel object. So maybe here, the default is set to a similar marker. The user passes in key and maybe default. So inside the method, I first try to get the value from the dictionary. But since it's a method of the class, perhaps using self.data or something like that to store the actual items. Wait, but the user's code might have a different name. Oh, but in the problem, the function is part of the class, so assuming that the class has a dictionary to store its items, maybe using a __dict__ or a specific storage variable. Since the code needs to be general, perhaps the class uses a dictionary as its underlying data structure, like in a UserDict or similar.

So the steps are: check if the key is in self. If it is, remove it (using del) and return the value. If not, then if default is the marker, raise KeyError. Otherwise, return default.

Wait, but how do I check if the key exists? Using self.get(key) might not be sufficient because that could return a value if the key is present and its value is None. So better to check using a try/except block. Or use the in operator. Let me think.

Alternatively, the standard way to implement pop is to use a try block:

try:
    value = self[key]
except KeyError:
    if default is __marker:
        raise KeyError("key not found") from None
    else:
        return default
else:
    del self[key]
    return value

But how is self implemented here? Since this is a method of a class that acts as a dictionary, maybe the actual data is stored in a dictionary attribute like self._data. Or perhaps it's using a __getitem__ and __delitem__ that accesses some other structure. Wait, maybe the class is a subclass of dict, so self can be treated as the dictionary itself. But then, using self.get might not be the way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, if the class is a dictionary, then self is the dict. So the code can be written as:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but that's a bit redundant. Let me check how the actual dict's pop is implemented. Oh right, the C code does it, but in a Python implementation, using the approach above should work.

Wait, but the __marker is a unique object used to detect if the default was provided. The user's code must have that __marker defined. Since the function signature includes default=__marker, the __marker must be a sentinel. So the code inside the method must check if the default is still that marker.

Wait, in the parameters, the default is set to __marker, which is probably a private sentinel. So in the code, when the user calls D.pop(k), the default is __marker. If the key is not found, then we check if default is __marker. If yes, then raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

So the code structure would be:

if key in self:
    remove the key and return the value
else:
    if default is __marker:
        raise KeyError
    else:
        return default

But how to get the value before deleting? Maybe first get the value, then delete the key. But in a dictionary, you can do:

value = self[key]

But that would throw KeyError if it's not present, so perhaps the better approach is to check first. Like:

if key in self:
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return value
else:
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but in the case where key is not present, and default is given, then we can just return default. But in the code above, the else clause handles that.

Wait, but how is __marker defined here? The user's function uses it as the default parameter. So perhaps __marker is a private variable in the class. Or maybe the code should use an object() instance as the sentinel. Wait, in the problem description, the user provided the function signature with default=__marker, so that __marker must be a class-level attribute. So I should use that.

Putting it all together, the code would be something like that. Let me make sure. Also, in the case where the key is not present and default is provided, we return the default. Otherwise, we raise.

So the code:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but in the else case, maybe we can just do:

return default if default is not __marker else raise KeyError.

Wait, but the code needs to check if default is the marker. So that's correct. However, when the key is not present, and the default is given (so default is not the marker), then return the default. So that code should work.

Wait, but how exactly is the key checked? Since self is the dictionary, the 'in' operator works. So this should be okay.

Another possible approach is to use a try/except block. Let me see:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    try:
        value = self[key]
    except KeyError:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)
    else:
        del self[key]
        return value

But the first approach using 'key in self' might be better in terms of efficiency, since it would check once, whereas the try/except would require a second lookup in the except block. Wait, no: in the try block, accessing self[key] would throw the key error. So if the key is not present, the except block would catch it, then check if default is given. But if the key is present, then the try block gets the value, then deletes it. But deleting would again require a lookup. Hmm, but in Python's dict, the in and getitem are O(1), so the difference is negligible. However, perhaps the first approach is more straightforward.

Wait, but in the first approach, if the key is not present, then we check for the default. So first, check if key is in self. If not, then proceed. But the code would have to do two lookups: one for 'in', and then if the default is needed, perhaps none. But when using the first approach, the code first does a 'key in self' (which is O(1)), then if it is present, it gets the value and deletes. So the total is two lookups (the in and then the __getitem__). But in the second approach (try/except), the code does one __getitem__ call. If that fails, then check the default. But when it's successful, then it has to do a del, which is another O(1) operation. So both approaches are similar in terms of time.

Which one is better? The first approach uses two separate lookups, but perhaps it's clearer. Alternatively, the standard Python dict's pop is implemented with a try block. Hmm, but in any case, either approach should work. Let me check the Python documentation's implementation.

Wait, looking at the UserDict in the collections module, perhaps the code would be similar. Alternatively, in the standard dict's pop, the code is in C, but the Python equivalent would be using the try block. However, for the code here, using the 'in' check is acceptable.

Wait, but in the first approach, the code would have to do a 'key in self' check, then if true, get the value, then delete. So for the first case:

if key in self:
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return value

But when key is present, the 'in' check is O(1), then getting the value is another O(1), then deleting is O(1). So three steps but all O(1). The alternative approach using try would do one O(1) for getting the value, then if no exception, do the del and return. So same number of steps.

Alternatively, the code can use a popitem-like approach, but no, because pop takes a specific key.

So the code structure should be as follows. Let me make sure the code matches the docstring's explanation. The docstring says D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value. If key is not found, return d if given, else raise KeyError.

Wait, in the code, when key is not present, and default is provided, return the default. But in the code, the first approach's else clause does exactly that.

Wait, the code in the first approach's else:

if default is not __marker, return default. Else, raise KeyError. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the code's parameters, default is set to __marker. So when the user calls pop(key), then default is __marker, so if the key is not present, we need to raise KeyError. If they call pop(key, some_default), then default is that value. So the code is correct.

Wait, but in the first approach, the code would have to do:

Wait, when the key is not present, the code goes to else. Then, if default is not the marker, return it. Otherwise, raise KeyError with the key.

Yes, that's exactly what the docstring says.

So the code would be correct. Now, the problem says to output the code in Python markdown format, but I think that's a mistake. The user probably means just the code, without any explanations. Wait, looking back at the problem:

"Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. /think"

Wait, maybe they want the code wrapped in triple backticks? Or perhaps they meant to just write the code as is. The instruction says to output the code in Python markdown format, which typically would be enclosed in ```python ... ```.

But the user also said "Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting." Wait, maybe they want just the code, but the output should be in a markdown code block. Let me re-read.

The user's instructions: Generate Python code based on the signature and docstring. Do not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in Python markdown format.

Hmm, perhaps the code should be written as a code block, so with triple backticks and 'python' as the language. But the function is a method, so part of a class. Wait, but the function signature is given as def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, so the code must be part of a class. So the full code would need to be in a class context. Wait, but the user hasn't provided the entire class structure. So perhaps the code is to be written as a standalone function? But that can't be, since it's a method with self.

Wait, maybe the user just wants the code for the pop method, written as a code block. So perhaps the code should be enclosed in triple backticks. Let me see. So the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but in the else clause, perhaps I can write it as:

if default is __marker:
    raise KeyError(key)
else:
    return default

Wait, but the first approach is correct. Wait, the code uses __marker as the default parameter. So the code is correct.

Wait, but in the code, when the key is not present, and default is given, the code returns the default. That's correct.

Wait, but in the code, the 'del' is only done when the key exists. So that's right. The method removes the key only if found.

Another thing: the docstring mentions "remove specified key and return the corresponding value". So the code does that.

Wait, but in the first approach, when the key is present, the code first checks if it's in the dict, then gets the value, deletes it, returns it. So that's correct.

Now, I need to make sure that the code uses the default=__marker as the parameter. So the code must have that. Also, the code should use the same __marker variable that was passed in. So in the code, the default parameter is compared against __marker. But how is __marker defined here? The function's parameter uses it, so the __marker must be a variable in the class's scope. Wait, but in the function signature, the default is set to __marker, which implies that the __marker is a variable that exists in the outer scope. So the code can assume that __marker is defined in the class, or perhaps in the module. Since the user hasn't provided the class structure, the code must use that variable as given. So the code is okay.

Another point: in the code, when the key is not present, and default is given, we return default. So the code is correct.

Wait, but in the code, the first part uses 'key in self' which is the correct way to check existence. So that's correct.

So putting it all together, the code is as I wrote above.

Wait, but in the code, the else clause has an if statement. So the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but in the else clause, the first condition is if default is not the marker. So when it is the marker, we raise. That's right. So the code is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the code should first get the key, but that's the try approach. Let me think again which is better. The first approach uses two lookups (in and get), but the second approach uses one. However, since in is O(1) for a dict, it's okay.

Wait, but in the first approach, if the key is present, it does 'key in self' (True), then gets the value (so that's a second lookup), then deletes. So three O(1) operations. The try approach would do one lookup (in the try block), then if it passes, delete (another O(1)), so same number. So either way is fine.

Hmm, perhaps the code using the try block is more concise. Let me try:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    try:
        value = self[key]
    except KeyError:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError(key)
        return default
    else:
        del self[key]
        return value

Wait, that's another way. Let me see. The try block tries to get the value. If found, proceed to else, delete and return. If not, it raises KeyError. Then in the except block, we check if default was given. So if default is not the marker, then return it. Otherwise, re-raise the KeyError with the key.

Wait, but in this code, when the except block catches the KeyError, we have to check the default. So in this case, it's better. Because in the first approach, the 'in' check and the self[key] are two separate lookups. Here, it's one lookup. So perhaps the try approach is better, as it only does one get operation.

Wait, but in the first approach, if key is present, then we do the 'in' check (which is O(1)), then get the value (another O(1)), then delete (another O(1)). The try approach would do the same: the first O(1) to get the value. So the same number of steps. But in the case of the key not being present, the try approach only does one check (the __getitem__ which raises KeyError). The 'in' approach does the 'in' check (O(1)), then proceeds to the except block, which would also be O(1) for the except case. Wait, no, in the first code, when key is not present, the code goes to else, then checks the default. So in that case, it's one check (the 'in') and then the default handling.

The try approach is better because in the case where the key is present, it only does one __getitem__ and then the del. So perhaps it's better to use the try approach. Let me see which is the standard way.

Looking at the Python's UserDict implementation, which is a dictionary wrapper, the pop method is implemented with:

def pop(self, key, *args, **kwargs):
    return self.data.pop(key, *args, **kwargs)

But that's because UserDict's instances use a data attribute which holds the actual dictionary. So for the code here, if the class is a subclass of dict, then perhaps the code can be written as:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    try:
        value = self[key]
    except KeyError:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError(key)
        else:
            return default
    else:
        del self[key]
        return value

Wait, but in this case, the else clause's del is redundant? Because if the key was present, then self[key] would have gotten the value, and then we delete it. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, in the try block, after getting the value, we can delete the key and return. The else is for when the try succeeded. So yes.

Hmm, perhaps the try approach is better. Let me see which is more efficient. Well, in Python, the try block can be a bit faster for the common case (when the key exists), because checking 'in' is an extra step. So the try approach avoids that. Since in the case where the key exists, the 'in' approach would have two lookups (the in and the __getitem__), while the try approach would have one. So the try approach is better.

Wait, but 'in' is O(1), so the difference is minimal. But in any case, both are correct. Since the user's docstring matches the standard pop behavior, perhaps using the try method is better.

But in the problem's function signature, the default is set to __marker. So the code must use that. Let me see. The code in the try approach would have the parameters right. The code as written in the try block would work.

Wait, but in the code above, when using the try, the except is catching KeyError. Then, if the user provided a default (so default is not the marker), return it. Otherwise, re-raise. The code in the except block would have to check if default is __marker. So in the except block, we can do:

if default is __marker:
    raise KeyError(key)
else:
    return default

Wait, but how do we know which key caused the error? Because the key is passed as the argument. So in the except block, we can just raise KeyError(key) again. So that's okay.

So the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    try:
        value = self[key]
    except KeyError:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError(key)
        return default
    else:
        del self[key]
        return value

Wait, but in the else clause, after getting the value, we have to delete the key. So the code deletes it, then returns the value. That's correct.

Wait, but the del is necessary even if the key was present. Because the pop method removes the key. So that's right.

So the code should be written as the try/except version.

Alternatively, perhaps the first approach is better. Let me think again. The user's docstring says that if the key is not found, and default is given, then return it. If default is not given, raise KeyError. So both approaches work.

Hmm, maybe the first approach is better because it uses 'key in self' and then self[key], but the second approach is more efficient. Since the problem didn't specify any constraints, I think either is acceptable. Let me see which one is more standard.

Looking at the Python's own dict implementation (in C), but in the Python docs, the pop method's description matches the try approach. So perhaps using the try approach is better.

Wait, but in the code, the parameters include default=__marker, so when the user calls D.pop(k), the default is set to __marker. Then, when the key is not present, we check if default is __marker. If so, raise. Else, return default.

Wait, in the try approach, after the except is caught, we check if default is __marker. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the code can be written as:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if default is __marker:
        # try to delete, but raise KeyError if not found
        return self.pop(key)  # wait no, that would loop
Wait, no, that's recursive and would cause an infinite loop. So that's not right. So no, must not do that.

So the code must use the underlying data structure's pop method, but perhaps in the case of a custom class, maybe they have their own __getitem__ and __delitem__. So the code must directly manipulate the data. Wait, but assuming the class is a subclass of dict, then self is the dict. So using self.pop would call the same method, leading to recursion. So no, that's not possible.

So the code must use the try block approach. So I think the better code is the try/except version.

Wait, but in the code above, after the try block, the else clause is entered. So in that case, the code gets the value, then deletes it, then returns. So that's correct.

Another possible code structure:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key not in self:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError(key)
        else:
            return default
    else:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value

Wait, this is the same as the first approach. But perhaps that's okay. The two approaches are equivalent in logic. Which is better? The first approach uses 'in' and then 'getitem' again, which is two lookups. The try approach uses one lookup (in the getitem), and then another del. The 'in' approach may be slightly less efficient, but for small code, it's okay.

Hmm, but perhaps the 'in' approach is more straightforward. Let me see.

The code with 'in':

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        raise KeyError(key)

Wait, in the else clause, after checking key is not in self, then if default was provided, return it. Otherwise, raise.

Wait, but in the else clause, the code can also be written as:

if default is __marker:
    raise KeyError(key)
else:
    return default

Wait, but in the code, the 'else' is when key is not present, so the first part of the else clause checks if the default is not __marker, so returns default, else raises. So that's correct.

Alternatively, the code can combine the conditions:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        del self[key]
        return self[key]
    elif default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but wait, that's not correct. Because if you first check if key is in self, then do del and try to return self[key], but after deleting, the key is no longer present, so self[key] would raise again. Oh right, that's a mistake. So I must first get the value before deleting.

Ah, right. So in that case, that approach is wrong. So that's why in the first approach, you have to first get the value, then delete.

So that's why the correct code must get the value first. So the first approach's code is okay.

Hmm, perhaps the code in the first approach is better. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the code can be written more concisely. Let me think again.

Wait, in the first approach, the code for the case when the key is present:

value = self[key], then delete, return value.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the code in the first approach may be better because it's clear.

But let me check for possible errors. Suppose the key is present, but after getting the value, the deletion is done. So that's okay.

Wait, but what if during the 'del' the key is somehow missing? But since we checked it's present, that's unlikely unless another thread is modifying the dict, but in Python's standard data structures, that's not an issue here.

So, the code seems okay.

Wait, the problem says that the default is __marker. So the code must compare the default parameter to that variable. But in the code, the default is passed as the parameter. So in the code, the 'if default is not __marker' is correct. Because the default parameter is set to the __marker that's in the outer scope. Wait, but how is __marker defined here? The function uses __marker in the default parameter, so the code must have that variable in the same scope. For example, in the class definition, maybe __marker is a private variable. But the user hasn't provided that, so the code must assume that __marker is already defined. So the code is okay as written.

Therefore, the code can be written either way. Let me choose the try approach, perhaps.

Wait, but the user's function signature uses default=__marker. So the code must have that. The try approach is:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    try:
        value = self[key]
    except KeyError:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError(key)
        return default
    else:
        del self[key]
        return value

Wait, but in the else clause, after getting the value, we delete the key. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the code, after getting value, we have to delete the key. So that's done via del self[key], which will also work.

Yes.

Alternatively, in the try block, after getting the value, can we just proceed to delete and return?

Yes, the else clause is triggered when the try block succeeds, so the key is present, so we can delete it and return the value.

So this code should work.

Wait, but what about the case where the key is present, but when we try to delete it, it's not? That's possible in some custom implementations, but assuming that the class is a proper dictionary, the del would work.

So I think either approach is correct, but perhaps the try/except version is better, as it's one lookup instead of two. Let me go with that.

Wait, but in the try approach, when the key is present, the code does:

value = self[key], then del, then return value. That's correct.

Now, the code must be written in Python, so the syntax must be correct. Also, the docstring is given, so I need to include it as the function's docstring.

Wait, the user provided the docstring as part of the problem. So the code must have the same docstring. Let me make sure.

The function's docstring is:

"""
D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
"""

So the code must include that docstring.

Therefore, putting it all together, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """
    D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
    If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
    """
    try:
        value = self[key]
    except KeyError:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError(key)
        return default
    else:
        del self[key]
        return value

Wait, but where is __marker defined? The user's function signature includes it, so the code must have that variable in scope. Since it's part of the function's default parameters, the __marker must be a variable in the class's namespace. So the code is correct as long as that's the case. So the user's code must have __marker defined somewhere, but since the problem doesn't ask for that, the code is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a sentinel object. But in the problem's function signature, the default is set to __marker, so the code must use that.

Yes, so the code is correct.

Wait, but in the except block, the code catches KeyError, which is correct. Then, if default is __marker, then raise KeyError with the key. But the original exception could have a different message, so perhaps better to re-raise the caught exception. Let me think.

The original code's except clause is:

except KeyError:

The caught exception could be stored, but in the current code, when re-raising, it uses raise KeyError(key). That's okay because the key is the one we're trying to pop. So the message is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps we should re-raise the original exception. But in the case of the code above, if the key is not present, then the __getitem__ will raise KeyError(key), so the except clause catches that. Then, if default is __marker, we raise KeyError(key) again. So the message is the same. So that's okay.

Alternatively, using:

except KeyError as e:
    if default is __marker:
        raise e
    return default

But in that case, the error message would be the same, but perhaps better to use the original exception. However, in the current code, it's okay.

So I think the code is correct.

Wait, but in the code, after getting the value, the del is done. The del is necessary to remove the key from the dictionary. So that's right.

Another possible error: in the try approach, when we do del self[key], that's redundant? No, because after getting the value, we need to remove the key. So that's correct.

Therefore, the code using the try block is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the code can be written using the 'in' check first. Let me see which one is more Pythonic. The standard way, perhaps, uses the try block. For example, in the CPython dict's pop method, they do a try to get the value, then proceed. So I think the try approach is better.

So I'll go with that.

Now, I need to output the code exactly as per the problem's instructions. The code must include the docstring and the function as given. Also, the user wants the code in Python markdown format. Wait, perhaps that means to enclose it in triple backticks? But the problem says to output only the code, so maybe just the function definition with the docstring.

Wait, the user's example shows that after /think, the code is presented as:

def pop(...):
    """docstring"""
    ...

So the code should be the function definition, including the docstring and the code inside.

So the code I have is:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """
    D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
    If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
    """
    try:
        value = self[key]
    except KeyError:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError(key)
        return default
    else:
        del self[key]
        return value

Wait, but in the first line, the default is set to __marker, which is a variable. The user's function signature includes that, so the code must have it. But how is __marker defined? The user must have it in their class, perhaps as a private variable. Since the problem doesn't require that, the code is okay.

Therefore, that's the code. Let me check again for any possible mistakes.

Wait, in the try block, when we get the value, then we delete the key. So the code is correct. The else clause returns the value. The except block checks if the default is the marker, then raises, else returns default.

Yes, that should work.

Another possible test case: if the key is not present and default is given, then return default. If default is not given, raise KeyError.

Testing with a dictionary:

Suppose self is a dict instance. Let's say:

d = {'a': 1}
d.pop('a') → 1, and then 'a' is removed.

d.pop('b', 2) → returns 2.

d.pop('b') → raises KeyError('b').

Yes, so the code should handle that.

Wait, in the code's except block, after the KeyError is caught, the code checks if default is the marker. If it is, then raise KeyError(key). So that's correct.

Yes, this code should be correct. I think that's the right approach.
