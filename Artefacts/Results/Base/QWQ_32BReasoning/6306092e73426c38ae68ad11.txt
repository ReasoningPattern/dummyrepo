Okay, I need to write a Python function called merge_extra_vars that takes a vars_dict and a list of extra_vars. The goal is to extend the vars_dict with the extra variables provided. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function signature is given. The parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars, which is optional (since it has a default of None). The docstring says to extend vars_dict with extra-vars. So the function should modify vars_dict in place or return a new dictionary? The problem says to extend, so probably update the existing vars_dict.

Wait, the parameters: vars_dict is the dictionary to merge into, and extra_vars is a list. But how are the extra variables represented in the list? Are they key=value strings? Like, maybe each item in the list is a string like "key=value" that needs to be split into the dictionary?

Hmm, I remember that in some contexts, extra_vars might be passed as a list of strings in the format key=value. So for each string in the list, split on '=' to get the key and value. Then, add those to the vars_dict. But what if the list is None? Then we can just return the original vars_dict without changes.

Wait the function's parameters have extra_vars default to None. So in the function, first check if extra_vars is not None. Then loop through each item in the list. Each item is a string, so split into parts. But what if a string has more than one '='? Like "key=with=equals=value". Then splitting on '=' would create a list with more elements. How to handle that? Maybe just split into two parts using the first '=' or split on the first occurrence. Or maybe split on the first '=' and the rest are part of the value. For example, "a=b=c" would become key 'a' and value 'b=c'. That seems reasonable.

So the steps would be:

1. If extra_vars is None, do nothing and return vars_dict? Or just return? Wait the function's purpose is to merge, so maybe it should update the vars_dict in place. Wait the problem says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". So perhaps the function should update the vars_dict directly. But in Python, dictionaries are mutable, so maybe the function should update the vars_dict and return it, or just modify it and return nothing? The docstring's return isn't specified. Let me check the parameters again. The function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring's parameters mention that vars_dict is the dictionary to merge into. The return isn't mentioned, so maybe the function doesn't return anything but modifies the input dictionary.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to return the merged dictionary. But the problem's wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The function's name is merge_extra_vars. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". So probably, the function should update vars_dict and return it, or just do the update in place. Let's see standard practices. The update() method of dictionaries modifies in place. So perhaps the function should process the extra_vars list into a temporary dictionary and then update vars_dict with that. So first, create a new temporary dict. Then for each item in extra_vars, split on '=', first part is key, the rest (joined by equals?) is the value. So for each var in extra_vars:

- Split the string into parts using split('=', 1). The 1 ensures that it splits only once, so the key is first part, value is the rest.

- Then, extract the key and value, and add to the temp dict.

Once all the key-value pairs are in the temp dict, then update vars_dict with that temp dict.

Wait but what if the extra_vars list has items that are not in key=value format? Like maybe a key without a value? Then splitting would result in a list with one element. So in that case, the key would be the first part, but the value would be an empty string? Or maybe raise an error? The problem doesn't mention handling invalid entries, so probably just proceed and if a split gives only one part, the value is empty string. So that's acceptable.

Putting it all together:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is not None:
        temp_dict = {}
        for var in extra_vars:
            parts = var.split('=', 1)
            if len(parts) == 1:
                # key only, no value. Maybe set to empty string?
                key = parts[0]
                value = ''
                temp_dict[key] = value
            else:
                key, value = parts
                temp_dict[key] = value
        vars_dict.update(temp_dict)
    return vars_dict

Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to return the merged dictionary? The original vars_dict is modified. Alternatively, perhaps the function returns nothing. Let me check the docstring again. The parameters are described, but the return is not mentioned. So maybe the function doesn't return anything, just modifies the vars_dict. Wait but in the code above, if I return vars_dict, that's okay. Alternatively, the function could just update and return None. Hmm, not sure. The problem says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", so probably the function modifies the original and returns it, or returns the modified one. But maybe the user expects to return the merged dict. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to return the updated vars_dict. Let me proceed with that.

Wait another thing: the extra_vars could be a list of strings, but perhaps some entries are already key-value pairs in another format? Like maybe a dictionary? Wait the problem says "List of extra-vars", so I think each element is a string in key=value format. So the code should process each string in the list.

Wait the function's parameters say extra_vars is a list. So if it's None, we can treat it as an empty list? Or just ignore it. The code I have does nothing if extra_vars is None. But maybe the function should accept a None and treat it as an empty list. Like, first check if extra_vars is None, set it to an empty list. Then proceed. That way, even if it's None, we can process. Let me see.

Alternatively, the code can first check if extra_vars is None, and if so, return vars_dict as is. Then, process the list. So the code as I wrote before would do that.

Wait in the code above, when extra_vars is not None, we process each item. So the code is okay. Let me think of possible test cases.

Suppose vars_dict is {'a': 1}, and extra_vars is ['b=2', 'c=d', 'e'].

Then, splitting each:

- 'b=2' → key 'b', value '2'

- 'c=d' → key 'c', value 'd'

- 'e' → key 'e', value ''

So the temp_dict would be {'b': '2', 'c': 'd', 'e': ''}, and merging into vars_dict would result in {'a':1, 'b':'2', 'c':'d', 'e':''}.

That seems correct.

Another case: if extra_vars is None, then the function does nothing, so just return vars_dict. Wait in the code, if extra_vars is None, the code skips the loop, so the vars_dict is unchanged, then returns it. That's okay.

Wait, but the function's parameters have extra_vars default to None. So when the user doesn't provide it, the code will not process anything. So that's correct.

Now, the function's return. The problem says "Generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring." The function's signature doesn't specify a return, so in Python that would mean it returns None unless there's an explicit return. Wait, but in the code I wrote, I have a return statement. The original docstring's parameters don't mention a return. Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to return the merged dictionary? Because the problem says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", so maybe the function returns the updated dict. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to update in place and return nothing. Let me think again.

The standard update() method for dictionaries modifies the dictionary in place and returns None. So perhaps the function should return the updated vars_dict. But the code as I have it does that. Alternatively, maybe it's better to return vars_dict. Let me proceed with that.

Wait, but in the code above, if I don't have a return statement, then the function would return None. But the user might want to have the merged dictionary. So adding return vars_dict makes sense. Let me check again.

The docstring says "Extend vars_dict with extra-vars". The function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The description says to merge, so perhaps the function should return the merged dictionary. So the code with the return is correct.

Wait, but the function's parameters have vars_dict as a parameter. The update is done in place, so the original dictionary is modified. The return statement would return the modified vars_dict. That's okay. Alternatively, perhaps the function should return None and just modify the dict. The problem's instructions aren't clear. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function should create a new dictionary and return it, leaving the original vars_dict untouched. But the docstring says "merge into vars_dict", implying it's modified. So the code is okay.

Wait, but what if the user passes a list with elements that are not strings? Like a dictionary or something else. But the problem states that extra_vars is a list of extra-vars. Maybe the function is supposed to handle only the key=value strings, so if an element in the list is not a string, it might cause an error. But since the problem doesn't mention handling such cases, perhaps it's beyond the scope here. So proceed with the code as written.

Another edge case: what if a key in the extra_vars list already exists in vars_dict? Then the update would replace it. That's standard behavior for dictionary updates, so that's correct.

Wait the code uses vars_dict.update(temp_dict). The update method will overwrite existing keys. So that's correct.

So the code should be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is not None:
        temp_dict = {}
        for var in extra_vars:
            parts = var.split('=', 1)
            key = parts[0]
            value = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''
            temp_dict[key] = value
        vars_dict.update(temp_dict)
    return vars_dict

Wait, that's a slightly more concise way. Instead of checking the length and handling both cases, split into two parts. If there's more than one part, take parts[1], else empty string. So yes, that works. So this code should be correct.

Wait, but in the original code, I had a temp_dict. Then the vars_dict is updated with that. That's correct. So this code should work.

Wait, but maybe the function should process each var in the list and add to the vars_dict directly, without a temp_dict. Like:

for var in extra_vars:
    parts = var.split('=', 1)
    key = parts[0]
    value = parts[1] if len(parts) >1 else ''
    vars_dict[key] = value

But using a temp_dict and then update might be better, but in this case, it's the same. Either way works. The temp_dict approach is okay.

So the code I have now is better. Let me check again.

Wait, in the case where extra_vars is None, the function just returns the original vars_dict. That's correct.

Testing the code with some examples:

Test case 1: vars_dict is empty, extra_vars is ['a=1', 'b=2']. The merged dict should be {'a': '1', 'b': '2'}, and the original vars_dict is modified.

Test case 2: vars_dict has {'a': 5}, and extra_vars has ['a=value', 'c=d=e']. The split would be 'a=value' → key 'a', value 'value', then 'c=d=e' → key 'c', value 'd=e'. So the final dict would have 'a' replaced by 'value' and add 'c' → 'd=e'.

So that's correct.

Another test case with an empty string as value: extra_vars has ['key'], then the value is empty string. So the key is added with that.

Okay, I think that's all. So the code should look like that. Let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. The function first checks if extra_vars is not None. Then, loops through each var in the list, splits into key and value, builds a temporary dictionary, then updates the original. Then returns the updated vars_dict. That's correct.

Wait, but in the code, the split is done with maxsplit 1, so even if there are multiple '=', it's okay. The code would take the first part as key, the rest (all parts after first =) as the value. So that's correct.

Yes, I think that's the solution.
