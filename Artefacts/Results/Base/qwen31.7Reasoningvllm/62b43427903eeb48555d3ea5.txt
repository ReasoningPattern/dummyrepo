Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called format, and it takes sql, params, and returns a tuple of a string and the params.

First, I need to look at the parameters. The sql is AnyStr, which is a bit vague, but probably means it's a string. The params are a Union of a dict with str or int keys and any value, or a sequence of any. The return is a tuple of a string and the params.

The docstring says it converts sql using self._converter.convert. So the function is supposed to take the sql and params, convert them using the converter, and return the converted SQL string and the params.

Wait, but the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and Union[Dict..., Sequence...]. So the first element is the converted SQL string, and the second is the params. But the params are passed in as either a dict or a sequence. So the function is probably just wrapping the conversion, maybe replacing the params with the converted ones?

Wait, the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert". So maybe the function is supposed to take the sql, convert it, and return the converted string and the same params. But how does the converter work? Maybe the converter is supposed to process the sql and return a new string, and the params are left as is.

But the function's return is a tuple of the converted sql and the params. So the code would be something like:

return self._converter.convert(sql), params

But wait, the params are passed as either a dict or a sequence. The function's parameters are params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]. So the function is supposed to take the params as they are, and return them as the second element of the tuple.

So the code would be:

def format(self, sql, params):
    converted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql)
    return (converted_sql, params)

But wait, the original function's parameters are sql and params, and the return is a tuple of the converted sql and the params. So the code is straightforward.

But the user provided the function signature with the parameters as sql: AnyStr, params: Union[...], and the return is Tuple[AnyStr, ...]. So the code would be:

def format(self, sql, params):
    return (self._converter.convert(sql), params)

But wait, the params are passed as either a dict or a sequence. The function's return is a tuple where the second element is the same params. So the code is as simple as that.

I need to make sure that the code matches the function signature. The parameters are sql and params, and the return is a tuple. So the code is correct.

So the generated code would be:

def format(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
	"""
	Convert sql using self._converter.convert
	"""
	return (self._converter.convert(sql), params)

Wait, but the parameters are passed as either a dict or a sequence. The function's return is a tuple of the converted sql and the params. So the code is correct.

Yes, that's the code. So the answer is the code as written.
