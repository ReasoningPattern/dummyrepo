Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function vertex3tuple. The docstring says that the function takes a list of vertices and returns a list where each element is a tuple containing the vertex and the two points on both sides. Oh right, and if the subscript is out of bounds, use 0 as the index.

First, I need to understand what the function is doing. For each vertex in the input list, I need to create three points: the vertex itself, and the two points adjacent to it. Wait, but how are the vertices arranged? Are they in a polygon, so each vertex is connected to two others? So for each vertex, the two points on both sides would be the previous vertex and the next vertex?

Wait, the docstring says "the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So for each vertex, we take the vertex, then the previous vertex (if exists), and the next vertex (if exists). But if the subscript is out of bounds, use 0. So for example, if the vertex is at index i, then the previous is i-1, and next is i+1. But if i is 0, then previous is len(vertices)-1, and next is 1. Similarly for the last element, previous is len(vertices)-2, next is len(vertices)-1.

So the function needs to process each vertex in the input list, and for each, create a tuple with the vertex, previous, and next. But wait, the function returns a list where each element is a tuple. So for each vertex in the input list, we create a tuple (vertex, previous, next), and collect all these tuples into a list.

But how to handle the indices? Let's think about the steps.

The input is a list called vertices. Let's say the vertices are in a list, like [v0, v1, v2, v3]. For each index i in 0 to len(vertices)-1:

- previous is i-1, but if i is 0, then previous is len(vertices)-1.
- next is i+1, if i is len(vertices)-1, then next is 0.

So for each i, the three points are:

vertex = vertices[i]

prev = vertices[i-1] if i>0 else vertices[-1]

next = vertices[i+1] if i < len(vertices)-1 else vertices[0]

Then, the tuple is (vertex, prev, next).

But wait, the function returns a list of these tuples. So the code would loop through each vertex, create the tuple, and append it to the result list.

So the code would be something like:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        vertex = vertices[i]
        prev = vertices[i-1] if i > 0 else vertices[-1]
        next_ = vertices[i+1] if i < len(vertices)-1 else vertices[0]
        result.append( (vertex, prev, next_) )
    return result

Wait, but what if the vertices list is empty? Well, the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that, but maybe the input is guaranteed to be non-empty. The problem says "vertices to be converted", so perhaps the input is a list with at least one element. But the code as written would handle empty lists by returning an empty list, which is correct.

Testing with an example. Let's say vertices is [A, B, C]. Then for i=0: prev is C, next is B. So the tuple is (A, C, B). For i=1: prev is A, next is C. Tuple (B, A, C). For i=2: prev is B, next is A. Tuple (C, B, A). So the result is [(A, C, B), (B, A, C), (C, B, A)].

Another example: vertices is [A, B]. Then for i=0: prev is B, next is A. Tuple (A, B, A). For i=1: prev is A, next is B. Tuple (B, A, B). So the result is [(A, B, A), (B, A, B)].

Yes, that seems correct.

So the code should be as written. The user didn't mention any edge cases, so the code handles all cases as per the docstring.
