Okay, I need to write a Python function called replace_dots that takes two arguments, value and arg. The docstring says it replaces all '.' in the string with arg. So the function should take a string (value) and a replacement string (arg), and return the modified string.

First, I remember that in Python, strings can be modified using the replace method. The replace method allows you to replace occurrences of a substring with another substring. So if I call value.replace('.', arg), that should do it. But wait, what if the value is not a string? Well, the docstring says value is an old string, so I can assume it's a string. So the function is straightforward.

The function needs to return the new string. So the code would be:

def replace_dots(value, arg):
    return value.replace('.', arg)

That's it. Let me check the parameters. The first argument is value, which is the original string. The second is arg, the replacement. The replace method takes the substring to replace (.) and the replacement (arg). Yes, that's correct.

I don't see any edge cases here. If the string has no dots, it returns the same. If the replacement is the same as the dot, it replaces them with themselves. But the function is supposed to replace all dots, so that's handled.

So the code is simple. Just return value.replace('.', arg). No need for any additional code. The docstring is already provided, so I just need to write the function as per that.
