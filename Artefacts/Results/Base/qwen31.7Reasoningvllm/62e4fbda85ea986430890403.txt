Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _shuffled that takes a sequence of strings and returns a shuffled version of it. The docstring mentions a FIXED_RANDOM_SEED, but the function signature doesn't include it. Wait, the function signature given is def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str], and the docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". Hmm, maybe the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant that's supposed to be used for shuffling, but the function doesn't have that parameter. Wait, the function's parameters are only seq. So perhaps the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a global variable or a constant that's defined elsewhere, and the function uses it to shuffle the sequence.

But the problem is, the function as given doesn't have the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED as a parameter. So how do I handle that? Wait, maybe the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant that's already defined in the code, and the function uses it to shuffle the sequence. But since the function's parameters don't include it, I need to assume that it's available elsewhere.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is given, and the docstring mentions FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. So perhaps the function is supposed to use a fixed seed for shuffling, but since the function doesn't take the seed as a parameter, maybe the seed is a global variable or a constant that's already set.

But in Python, if the seed is not provided, the random module uses the system's default seed. However, the docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", which implies that the function should use that seed. So the function needs to use that seed to shuffle the sequence.

But how to implement that? The standard way to shuffle a list with a fixed seed is to use the random module's seed function. So the steps would be:

1. Import random.
2. Set the random seed using the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED.
3. Shuffle the sequence.
4. Return the shuffled list.

But since the function doesn't have the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED as a parameter, I need to assume that it's a constant defined elsewhere. However, in the code generated, I can't reference a variable that's not defined. So perhaps the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant that's defined in the code, and the function uses it.

But the user's problem is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code must include the necessary imports and use the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED.

Wait, but the function's parameters don't include the seed. So the code would need to have the seed set, but since the function doesn't take it as a parameter, maybe the seed is a global variable. But in the code, how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a parameter that's supposed to be passed, but the function signature is missing it. But according to the given function signature, it's not there. So the code must use the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED as a constant.

But in the code, how to reference it? For example, if the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a variable, then the code would have to set it before shuffling. But since the function is part of a module, perhaps the seed is set before the function is called.

But the function is called as _shuffled(seq), so perhaps the seed is set in the code before the function is called. However, the function itself doesn't have the seed as a parameter. So the code would need to have the seed set, but since the function doesn't take it, maybe the seed is a global variable.

But the problem is that the user's code must generate the function as per the given signature. So the code would need to include the necessary imports and use the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED.

So the code would look like:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    # Set the random seed using the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    # Shuffle the sequence
    return list(seq)

But wait, the function is supposed to return a list of strings. The input is a Sequence[str], which is a generic sequence. So converting it to a list is necessary.

But the problem is that the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is not defined in the code. So the code would need to have that variable defined. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant that's defined elsewhere, and the code uses it.

But in the code generated, the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a variable. So the code would need to have that variable defined. However, the user's code may not have it, but the function is supposed to use it.

So the code would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    return list(seq)

But the problem is that the function doesn't take the seed as a parameter. So the code is correct as long as the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is defined elsewhere.

But the user's problem is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code must include the necessary imports and use the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED.

So the final code would be as above. However, the user's docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", which implies that the function uses that seed. So the code is correct.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a list of strings. The input is a Sequence[str], which is a generic sequence. So converting it to a list is necessary.

So the code is correct. The only thing is that the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a variable that's defined elsewhere.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
