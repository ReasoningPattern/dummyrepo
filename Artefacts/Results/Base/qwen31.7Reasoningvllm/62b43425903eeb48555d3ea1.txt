Okay, I need to generate a Python function called _create_in_regex that returns a re.Pattern object. The docstring says it creates an in-style parameter regular expression. Hmm, the function is part of a class, so I assume it's a method.

First, I need to figure out what the in-style regex might look like. Since it's a regular expression, maybe it's for matching certain patterns. The docstring doesn't give specific details, so I should make an educated guess. Maybe it's something like matching parameters in a specific format, like key-value pairs or something similar.

Wait, the function is named _create_in_regex, which suggests it's a private method. So the implementation would be inside the class. But the user just wants the code for the function, not the class. So I need to write the function's body.

Since the function returns a Pattern, I'll need to use the re module. The function doesn't take any parameters, so it's just returning a compiled regex pattern. Maybe the regex is something like r'(\w+):\s*(\w+)' to match key-value pairs. But without more info, I can't be sure. However, the user probably expects a standard regex for in-style parameters.

Alternatively, maybe it's a regex for matching parameters in a specific format, like a list of parameters. For example, something like r'\b(\w+):\s*(\w+)\b' to match words with a colon and space.

But since the docstring says "in-style parameter regular expression", maybe it's a regex that matches parameters in a certain style. Maybe it's a regex that matches parameters in a specific format, like key-value pairs with spaces.

So, perhaps the regex is something like r'(\w+):\s*(\w+)'.

But I need to make sure that the function returns a Pattern object. So the code would be:

import re
from re import Pattern

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    # Define the regex pattern
    pattern = r'(\w+):\s*(\w+)'
    # Compile the pattern into a regex object
    return re.compile(pattern)

Wait, but the function is part of a class. The user might have a class with this method. But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be the function itself.

But the user wants the code output in Python markdown format. So the code would be written as a Python function.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a Pattern. So the code would import re and then compile the pattern.

But the user might not have imported re. However, in Python, the re module is standard, so it's assumed to be imported.

So the code would be:

import re
from re import Pattern

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    pattern = r'(\w+):\s*(\w+)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

But maybe the user expects the function to be part of a class. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code would be the function as written.

Wait, the function is a method, so it's part of a class. But the user is asking for the code, not the class. So the code would be the function's definition.

So the code would be:

import re
from re import Pattern

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    pattern = r'(\w+):\s*(\w+)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

But perhaps the regex is more complex. Since the docstring says "in-style parameter regular expression", maybe it's a more general regex. For example, maybe it's for matching parameters in a specific format, like a list of parameters with a certain structure.

Alternatively, maybe the regex is for matching parameters in a specific style, like a key-value pair with a colon and space. So the code would be as above.

But since the user didn't provide specific details, I have to make an assumption. The most straightforward regex for key-value pairs is r'(\w+):\s*(\w+)'.

So the code would be as written.
