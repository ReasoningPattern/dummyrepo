Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me look at the function details.

The function is called _run_playbook and takes three parameters: cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. The docstring explains that it runs an Ansible CLI with the given variables and returns the results.

First, I need to figure out how to execute the Ansible CLI. The standard way is to use the subprocess module. So I'll need to run the ansible command with the provided arguments and variables.

Wait, the cli_args is a list of command line arguments. So the command would be something like 'ansible' followed by the cli_args. But I need to make sure that the variables are passed correctly. The vars_dict is a dictionary of variables to pass to Ansible using extra-vars.

So the command would be something like:

subprocess.run(['ansible'] + cli_args, env=os.environ, cwd=ir_workspace.path, check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)

But I need to pass the vars_dict as extra-vars. The Ansible command would have something like --extra-vars '{"key": "value"}' or similar. So I need to format the vars_dict into a string.

Wait, the vars_dict is a dictionary. To convert it into a string for the extra-vars, I can use json.dumps. But I need to make sure that the JSON is properly formatted. Also, the Ansible command might require the variables to be in a specific format, like key=value pairs.

So, the extra-vars part would be:

extra_vars = json.dumps(vars_dict)

But I need to make sure that the JSON is properly escaped. So using json.dumps with ensure_ascii=False might be necessary, but maybe the default is okay.

Then, the full command would be:

['ansible', '--extra-vars', f'{"{}", extra_vars}', *cli_args]

Wait, no. The --extra-vars option is passed as a string. So the command would be:

['ansible', '--extra-vars', f'{"{extra_vars}"', *cli_args]

Wait, but the extra_vars is a JSON string. So the command would be:

['ansible', '--extra-vars', f'{"{json.dumps(vars_dict)}"'], *cli_args)

But I need to make sure that the JSON is properly escaped. So using json.dumps(vars_dict) would handle that.

But wait, the Ansible CLI might require the --extra-vars to be a string with key=value pairs. So the JSON should be correctly formatted.

So the code would be:

import subprocess
import json

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    import os
    # Construct the command
    command = ['ansible']
    command.extend(cli_args)
    # Prepare extra-vars
    extra_vars = json.dumps(vars_dict)
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(command, env=os.environ, cwd=ir_workspace.path, check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result

Wait, but the cwd is set to ir_workspace.path. But what if ir_workspace is None? Well, the function parameters might assume that ir_workspace is provided. So the code should handle that.

But the function is supposed to return the ansible results. So the code would return the result of subprocess.run.

But I need to make sure that the command is correctly formed. The cli_args are passed as a list, so they are added to the command list. The extra-vars is added as a separate argument.

Wait, the --extra-vars is a flag that requires the value to be a string. So the command would be:

ansible --extra-vars '{"key": "value"}' ... 

So the code would need to pass the extra_vars as a string. So the command list would be:

['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars, *cli_args]

But in the code above, the command is built as ['ansible'] + cli_args, which would include the cli_args. But the --extra-vars is a separate argument. So the code is incorrect.

Oh right, the cli_args are the command line arguments for the ansible CLI. So the command list should include the --extra-vars as a separate argument. So the correct way is to have the command list start with 'ansible', then the --extra-vars, then the cli_args.

Wait, no. The cli_args are the arguments to the ansible command. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, like ansible-playbook someplaybook.yml, then cli_args would be ['ansible-playbook', 'someplaybook.yml'].

But in the function, the cli_args is a list of command line arguments. So the first element is 'ansible', and then the rest are the arguments. Wait, no. The function's cli_args is a list of command line arguments. So for example, if the user runs ansible-playbook with some arguments, then cli_args would be ['ansible-playbook', 'arg1', 'arg2'].

But in the function, the code is adding cli_args to the command list. So the command list would be ['ansible'] + cli_args, which would be ['ansible', 'arg1', 'arg2'], which is correct.

But the --extra-vars is a separate argument. So the code as written would not include --extra-vars. So the code is wrong.

Ah, I see. The problem is that the cli_args includes the ansible command itself. So the code is adding cli_args to the command list, which would include the ansible command. But the --extra-vars is a separate argument. So the code is incorrect.

So the correct approach is to construct the command list as follows:

command = ['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars] + cli_args

Wait, no. Because the cli_args are the arguments to the ansible command. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, then cli_args would be the list of those arguments. But the --extra-vars is a separate argument. So the command list should start with 'ansible', then the --extra-vars, then the cli_args.

Wait, no. The cli_args are the arguments to the ansible command. So if the user runs ansible-playbook someplaybook.yml, then cli_args would be ['ansible-playbook', 'someplaybook.yml']. So the command list would be ['ansible-playbook', 'someplaybook.yml'].

But in the function, the cli_args is a list that includes the ansible command. So the code is adding cli_args to the command list, which would include the ansible command. So the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct way is to have the command list start with 'ansible', then the --extra-vars, then the cli_args.

Wait, no. The cli_args are the arguments to the ansible command. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, then cli_args would be those arguments. So the command list would be ['ansible'] + cli_args.

But the --extra-vars is a separate argument. So the code should include that.

So the correct command list is:

command = ['ansible'] + cli_args

But then, the --extra-vars is not included. So the code is missing that.

Therefore, the code should be:

command = ['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars] + cli_args

Wait, but that would mean that the cli_args are the arguments to the ansible command, and the --extra-vars is a separate argument. So the command list would be ['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars] + cli_args.

But that would mean that the cli_args are the arguments after the --extra-vars. Which is correct.

So the code should be:

command = ['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars] + cli_args

But then, the cli_args are the arguments to the ansible command. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, then those are in cli_args. But the --extra-vars is a separate argument.

So the code would be:

command = ['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars] + cli_args

But then, the cli_args would be the arguments to the ansible command, including the --extra-vars? No, because the --extra-vars is a separate argument.

Wait, no. The cli_args is the list of command line arguments. So if the user runs ansible-playbook someplaybook.yml, then cli_args would be ['ansible-playbook', 'someplaybook.yml']. So the command list would be ['ansible-playbook', 'someplaybook.yml'].

But in the function, the cli_args is a list that includes the ansible command. So the code is adding cli_args to the command list, which would include the ansible command. So the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct approach is to have the command list start with 'ansible', then the --extra-vars, then the cli_args.

So the code should be:

command = ['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars] + cli_args

But then, the cli_args are the arguments to the ansible command. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, then those are in cli_args. But the --extra-vars is a separate argument.

So the code is correct.

But I need to make sure that the --extra-vars is passed as a separate argument. So the code would be:

command = ['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars] + cli_args

But then, the cli_args are the arguments to the ansible command. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, those are in cli_args. But the --extra-vars is a separate argument.

So the code is correct.

But then, the command list would be ['ansible', '--extra-vars', extra_vars] + cli_args. So the cli_args are the arguments after the --extra-vars.

But in the function, the cli_args is a list of command line arguments. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, then those are in cli_args. So the code is correct.

Therefore, the code should be:

import subprocess
import json

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    import os
    # Construct the command
    command = ['ansible', '--extra-vars', json.dumps(vars_dict)] + cli_args
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(command, env=os.environ, cwd=ir_workspace.path, check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result

Wait, but the cli_args is a list of command line arguments. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, then those are in cli_args. So the command list is ['ansible', '--extra-vars', ...] + cli_args.

But the --extra-vars is a separate argument. So the code is correct.

But what if the cli_args includes the --extra-vars? For example, if the user passes --extra-vars as an argument, then the code would include it in the command list. But the function's cli_args is supposed to be the list of command line arguments, which would include the --extra-vars. But that's not correct. The --extra-vars is a separate argument, so it should not be in cli_args.

Therefore, the code is correct.

But I need to make sure that the --extra-vars is passed as a separate argument. So the code is correct.

Another point: the ir_workspace.path is the current working directory. So the cwd is set to that.

Also, the function returns the result of subprocess.run, which is the ansible results.

So the code should be as above.

But I need to make sure that the JSON is properly formatted. So json.dumps(vars_dict) would convert the dictionary to a JSON string.

So the code should be:

import subprocess
import json

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    import os
    # Construct the command
    command = ['ansible', '--extra-vars', json.dumps(vars_dict)] + cli_args
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(command, env=os.environ, cwd=ir_workspace.path, check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result

But wait, the cli_args is a list of command line arguments. So if the user runs ansible with some arguments, then those are in cli_args. But the --extra-vars is a separate argument. So the code is correct.

But what if the cli_args includes the --extra-vars? For example, if the user passes --extra-vars as an argument, then the code would include it in the command list. But that's not correct. The --extra-vars is a separate argument, so it should not be in cli_args.

Therefore, the code is correct.

Another thing: the env is set to os.environ. But in some cases, the environment variables might need to be set. But the function is supposed to handle that.

So the code should be as above.

Now, the user asked for the code in Python markdown format, but the assistant should output only the code. So the final code is as written.
