Okay, I need to generate a Python function called get_versions that retrieves version information. The docstring says that if it can't get the info, the default value is returned. But wait, the function isn't implemented yet. Hmm, how do I get version information in Python?

Oh right, the standard way is to use the __version__ attribute of the package. But if the package isn't installed or there's an error, maybe it's not available. So the function should try to access __version__ and return it if possible. If it can't, return a default value, like 'unknown'.

Wait, but how do I handle cases where __version__ is not defined? Like if the module isn't imported or something. But the function is supposed to obtain the version info. So maybe the function just checks if __version__ exists and returns it, else returns the default.

So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    try:
        return __version__
    except NameError:
        return 'default_value'

But wait, the docstring says "If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned." So maybe the function should catch any exceptions that occur when trying to get the version. But __version__ is a module-level variable, so if it's not defined, like if the module isn't imported, then accessing it would raise an error.

But how to handle that? Maybe the function should try to get __version__ and return it, else return the default. So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    return __version__

But then, if __version__ is not defined, it would throw an error. So perhaps the function should handle that. But the problem is that the function is supposed to obtain the version info. So maybe the function is part of a package, and __version__ is defined there.

But the user is asking for the function to return the version info. So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    return __version__

But then, if __version__ is not defined, it would raise an error. But the docstring says that if it can't be obtained, return the default. So maybe the function should return a default value if __version__ is not available.

But how to check if __version__ is available? Well, in Python, if the module is not imported, then __version__ would not be defined. So perhaps the function should try to access it and return it, else return the default.

So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    try:
        return __version__
    except NameError:
        return 'default_value'

But then, the default value is not specified in the docstring. The user's docstring says "the default value is returned." But the actual default value is not given. So maybe the default is something like 'unknown' or 'default'.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the default value. However, the function must return a default if it can't get the version. So perhaps the default is 'default' or some other value.

But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the default is 'default' as a placeholder. So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    try:
        return __version__
    except NameError:
        return 'default'

But the original function signature is just the function definition. The docstring is given. So the code should include the try-except block to handle the case where __version__ is not available.

So the final code would be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return __version__
    except NameError:
        return 'default'

But wait, the user's docstring says "the default value is returned." But the actual default is 'default' as per the code. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the default is a specific string like 'unknown', but since it's not specified, using 'default' is okay.

So the code is as above.
