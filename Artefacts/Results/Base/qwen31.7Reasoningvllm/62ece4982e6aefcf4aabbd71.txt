Okay, I need to write a Python function called regex_dict that takes a dictionary as input and converts the keys into regex patterns. The docstring says that the keys are filenames with wildcards, and I need to convert them into regexes while leaving the values unchanged.

First, I remember that in Python, regular expressions can be handled with the re module. But how do I convert a filename with wildcards into a regex? For example, if the key is "file_2023*.txt", the regex should be "file_2023.*\.txt".

So the main task is to take each key in the dictionary and replace the wildcard characters (like * and ?) with their regex equivalents. Wait, but what about the actual characters in the filename? Like, if the filename has a literal * or ?, then those should stay as is. But the function is supposed to convert the keys into regexes, so I think the wildcards in the keys are the ones that need to be converted.

Wait, the function's argument is a dict where the keys are filenames with wildcards. So the keys are like "file_2023*.txt" and the values are whatever the original values were. The function needs to convert the keys into regex patterns, so for each key, replace the wildcards with their regex equivalents.

So for example, if the key is "a*b", the regex would be "a.*b". But what about the * and ? in the original key? Wait, the problem says that the keys are filenames with wildcards. So the wildcards are * and ? (maybe other characters? But the function is supposed to convert them into regex patterns. So the function should replace * with .*, and ? with .?.

Wait, but the problem says "convert *.cpp keys to regex keys". So maybe the wildcards are * and ? (like in regular expressions). So the function needs to take each key, replace * with .*, and ? with .?.

But wait, the function's docstring says that the keys are filenames with wildcards. So the wildcards are * and ? (maybe other characters, but the function is supposed to convert them into regex patterns). So the approach would be to take each key, replace * with .*, and ? with .?, and leave other characters as is.

But wait, what about the original key's characters? For example, if the key is "file_2023*.txt", then the regex would be "file_2023.*\.txt". So the * is replaced with .*, and the . is left as is. So the function needs to replace * with .*, and ? with .?.

So the plan is: for each key in the input dictionary, replace all * with .*, and all ? with .?.

But wait, what if the key has other wildcards? Like, if the key is "file_2023*?txt", then the regex would be "file_2023.*\.txt". So the function needs to replace * and ? with their regex equivalents.

So the code would be: for each key in the input dictionary, create a new key by replacing * with .*, and ? with .?.

So the code would look like:

def regex_dict(item):
    """
    Convert *.cpp keys to regex keys.
    Given a dict where the keys are all filenames with wildcards,
    convert only the keys into equivalent regexes and leave the values intact.
    """
    result = {}
    for key in item:
        # Replace * with .*, ? with .?
        new_key = key.replace('*', '.*').replace('?', '.?')
        result[new_key] = item[key]
    return result

Wait, but what about if the original key has other characters that are not * or ?? For example, if the key is "file.txt", then the regex would be "file.txt", which is correct.

But the problem says that the keys are filenames with wildcards. So the function is supposed to convert the wildcards into regex patterns. So the code above should work.

Testing with an example: if the input is {"a*b.txt": 123}, the output would be {"a.*\.txt": 123}.

Yes, that seems right.

So the code is as above. But I need to make sure that the function is correctly handling the replacement of * and ?.

Yes, the code replaces each * with .*, and each ? with .?.

So the final code is as written.
