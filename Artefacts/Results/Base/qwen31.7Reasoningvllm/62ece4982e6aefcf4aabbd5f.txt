Okay, I need to generate Python code for the paging function based on the given signature and docstring. Let's see. The function is called paging, takes response and max_results as arguments. The docstring says it returns a generator that splits the WAPI response into pages, each with max_results elements.

So, the goal is to create a generator that yields chunks of the response list, each of size max_results. The generator should handle the splitting logic.

First, I need to think about how to split the response. The response is a list, and I need to iterate through it in chunks of max_results. So, for example, if the response has 10 elements and max_results is 3, the generator should yield [0:3], [3:6], [6:9], and then the last chunk if there's any.

In Python, a generator can be created using a yield statement. So, the function will loop through the response list, taking elements in groups of max_results.

Wait, but how to handle the slicing? Let's think. For each iteration, we can take elements from the current position, up to the current position + max_results. Then, yield that slice, and move the pointer forward.

So, the steps would be:

Initialize a start index as 0.

Loop while start is less than len(response):

   Take a slice from start to start + max_results.

   Yield that slice.

   Set start to start + max_results.

But wait, in Python, list slicing is up to but not including the end index. So, for example, response[start:start + max_results] would give elements from index start to start + max_results - 1. So that's correct.

So, the code would look like:

def paging(response, max_results):
    """
    Return every response with the length of max_results
    Args:
        response (list): WAPI response.
        max_results (int): Maximum number of objects to be returned in one page.
    Returns:
        Generator object with WAPI response split page by page.
    """
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i + max_results]

Wait, but what if max_results is zero? Well, the function's parameters are supposed to be integers, and the docstring says max_results is an int. But in Python, if max_results is zero, the slice would be empty. But perhaps the function is intended to handle positive integers. However, the problem statement doesn't specify handling for zero, so maybe we just proceed as is.

So, the code would be as above. Let me check if that's correct.

Testing with an example: if response is [1,2,3,4,5], max_results is 2. Then the generator would yield [1,2], [3,4], [5]. Which is correct.

Yes, that seems right. So the code is straightforward.
