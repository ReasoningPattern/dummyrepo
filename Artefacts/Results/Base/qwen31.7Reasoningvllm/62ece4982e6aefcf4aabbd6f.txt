Okay, I need to write a Python function called get_repo_archive that takes a URL and a destination path, and downloads and extracts a .tar.gz archive. The docstring says it should return the path where the archive is extracted to. Let me think about how to do this.

First, I remember that Python has the requests library to download files. Also, the tarfile module can be used to extract archives. But since the archive is a .tar.gz, I'll need to use the tarfile module with the 'gz' compression.

Wait, the function's parameters are url and destination_path. The destination_path is a Path object, so I should use the Path class from the pathlib module. But the function's parameters are given as url: str and destination_path: Path. So the function is supposed to handle that.

So the steps are: download the .tar.gz file from the URL, then extract it to the destination path.

But wait, the function returns the path where the archive is extracted to. So the destination_path is the path where the extraction happens. So maybe the function should extract the archive into that path, and return that path.

But how to handle the extraction? Let me think. Using tarfile.open, but I need to specify the mode as 'r:gz' to handle the compressed archive.

Wait, the tarfile module's open function can take a file path and mode. But here, the file is being downloaded, so maybe I need to first download the file, then open it.

So the steps would be:

1. Download the .tar.gz file from the URL to the destination_path. Wait, but the destination_path is the path where the archive is extracted. So maybe the destination_path is the directory where the archive is extracted, and the downloaded file is saved there. Or maybe the destination_path is the path where the archive is stored, and then extracted there.

Wait, the function's docstring says that the destination_path is the path on disk where to extract the archive. So the function should download the archive to the destination_path, then extract it there.

Wait, but the URL might be a remote URL. So the function needs to download the archive to the destination_path. So the first step is to download the file to the destination_path, then extract it.

But how to handle the download? Using requests.get, but need to make sure the file is saved correctly. So the code would be something like:

import requests
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    # Download the archive
    response = requests.get(url)
    # Save the response content to the destination_path
    archive_path = destination_path / "archive.tar.gz"
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    # Extract the archive
    with tarfile.open(archive_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    # Return the destination_path
    return destination_path

Wait, but the function returns the path where the archive is extracted to. So the destination_path is the path where the extraction happens. So the code above would save the archive to destination_path, then extract it there. So the return value is destination_path.

But wait, what if the archive is already there? Well, the function is supposed to retrieve and extract it. So the code should handle that.

But what if the destination_path doesn't exist? The function should create it? Or does the extraction handle that? Well, the tarfile.extractall() method will create the necessary directories if they don't exist. So the function should be okay.

But the function's parameters are url and destination_path. The destination_path is a Path object, so the code uses that.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check the steps again.

Download the archive to the destination_path, then extract it there. So the code is correct.

But wait, the function returns the destination_path. So the code is correct.

But what about the file name? The function assumes that the archive is named 'archive.tar.gz' and saved in the destination_path. But what if the original archive has a different name? The docstring says that the archive is a .tar.gz, but the function's code assumes that the archive is named 'archive.tar.gz'. However, the function's parameters don't mention the archive name, so maybe the code is assuming that the archive is named 'archive.tar.gz' and saved in the destination_path. But the user might have a different name. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps the code is correct as is.

But the problem says that the archive contains 'desc' files for each package. But the code doesn't check that. The function's job is to retrieve and extract the archive, regardless of the contents. So the code is correct.

So the code would be as written above.

But I need to make sure that the code uses the correct modules. The requests library is needed for downloading, tarfile for extracting, and Path for the destination_path.

So the code would import those modules.

But the function is supposed to return a Path object. So the code uses the Path class from pathlib.

So the code would be:

import requests
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    # Download the archive
    response = requests.get(url)
    # Save the archive to the destination path
    archive_path = destination_path / "archive.tar.gz"
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    # Extract the archive
    with tarfile.open(archive_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    # Return the destination path
    return destination_path

But wait, the function's parameters are url and destination_path. The code assumes that the archive is named 'archive.tar.gz' and saved in the destination_path. But what if the archive has a different name? The function would fail. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that, so the code is correct as per the given information.

So this should be the correct code.
