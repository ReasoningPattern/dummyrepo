Okay, I need to write a Python function called string_to_int that converts a string into an integer using a given alphabet. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function takes two parameters: a string and a list of letters. The return value is an integer. The docstring says that the string consists of letters from the alphabet, so I don't have to handle invalid characters.

The key here is to determine the transition rule. The problem statement doesn't specify the exact rule, but since it's a common problem, I'm assuming it's a simple substitution where each character in the string represents a digit in a base-system. For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], maybe each character maps to 0, 1, 2 respectively. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the default is to use the position in the alphabet. Wait, but the function's name suggests that the alphabet is used as a base. Like, each character in the string is a digit in base len(alphabet).

Wait, but the function's docstring says "using the given transition rule". Since the problem doesn't specify the rule, maybe the intended rule is that each character in the string is mapped to its position in the alphabet. For example, 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc. But maybe it's a different rule. However, without more info, I need to make an assumption.

Assuming that the alphabet is ordered, and each character in the string corresponds to its index in the alphabet. So, for example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2. Then the string is converted to a number by treating it as a base-len(alphabet) number.

So, the steps would be:

1. Check that each character in the string is present in the alphabet. But the problem says the string consists of the letters in the alphabet, so maybe we don't need to handle that.

2. For each character in the string, find its index in the alphabet.

3. Convert the string to a number by treating it as a base-len(alphabet) number.

But how to do that in Python?

For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then the string 'abc' would be 0*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*3^0 = 0 + 3 + 2 = 5.

So, the code would need to:

- Iterate over each character in the string.

- For each character, get its index in the alphabet.

- Then, compute the value as the sum of (index * base^position), where base is the length of the alphabet.

But how to compute that in Python?

Alternatively, we can process each character in the string and accumulate the value. For example, start with 0, then for each character, multiply the current value by the base and add the index.

Yes, that's a common approach for converting a string to a number in a base system.

So, for example:

base = len(alphabet)

result = 0

for char in string:

    index = alphabet.index(char)

    result = result * base + index

return result

That's the approach.

But wait, the alphabet is a list. So, for each character in the string, we need to find its index in the alphabet. But if the alphabet is not sorted, but the problem says that the string consists of the letters in the alphabet, so the order is probably the order in the list. So, the index is the position in the list.

So, the code would be:

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:

    base = len(alphabet)

    result = 0

    for char in string:

        index = alphabet.index(char)

        result = result * base + index

    return result

But wait, what if the alphabet has duplicate characters? But the problem says the string consists of the letters in the alphabet, so each character in the string is present in the alphabet. So, alphabet.index(char) would work, but if there are duplicates, it would return the first occurrence. However, the problem says the string is composed of the letters in the alphabet, so perhaps the alphabet is a list where each character is unique. But the problem doesn't specify that. However, the function's parameters are given as a list of str, so maybe the alphabet is a list with unique elements. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the code should handle duplicates. But since the problem says the string consists of the letters in the alphabet, perhaps the alphabet is a list with unique elements, and the string is a valid string for that alphabet.

So, the code as written would work.

But wait, in Python, if the alphabet has duplicates, alphabet.index(char) would return the first occurrence. But since the problem says the string is composed of the letters in the alphabet, perhaps the alphabet is a list with unique elements, and the string is a valid string for that alphabet. So, the code is safe.

So, the code would be as above.

But let me check with an example. Suppose alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], string is 'abc'. Then:

base is 3.

result starts at 0.

First char 'a' → index 0 → result = 0*3 + 0 = 0.

Second char 'b' → index 1 → 0*3 +1 =1.

Third char 'c' → index 2 → 1*3 +2 =5. So returns 5. Which is correct.

Another example: alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], string 'ab' → 0*4 +1 =1.

Yes.

So the code seems correct.

So the Python code would be as written.
