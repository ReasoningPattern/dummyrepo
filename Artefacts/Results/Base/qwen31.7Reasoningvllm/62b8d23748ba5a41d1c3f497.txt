Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function is called popitem and is part of a class. The docstring says it removes and returns the (key, value) pair that's least frequently used. So, I need to implement this method.

First, I remember that in Python, the most common way to implement a least frequently used cache is using a dictionary along with a separate dictionary to track the frequency of each key. But since the problem doesn't specify the exact data structure, maybe the user expects a simple implementation.

Wait, but the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". The function signature is def popitem(self):, and the docstring is as given. So, the code needs to be a method that returns the least frequently used item.

But how to implement this? Let's think. The standard way is to use a dictionary for the actual data and another dictionary to track the frequency. However, since the problem doesn't mention any specific data structure, maybe the user expects a simple implementation using a regular dictionary and a separate counter.

Wait, but the problem might be expecting a specific implementation. For example, in a cache, the least frequently used item is usually determined by the number of times it's been accessed. So, the code would need to track the frequency of each key.

So, the steps would be:

1. Maintain a dictionary (data) that holds the actual key-value pairs.
2. Maintain a dictionary (freq) that tracks the frequency of each key.
3. When popitem is called, find the key with the minimum frequency.
4. Remove that key from the data dictionary and decrement the frequency of the key.
5. Return the (key, value) pair.

But how to efficiently find the key with the minimum frequency? If the frequencies are stored in a dictionary, then we can iterate through the items to find the one with the lowest count. However, this could be O(n) time, which is acceptable for small datasets.

But in Python, the standard way to implement a least frequently used cache is using a combination of a dictionary and a separate dictionary for frequencies, and using a priority queue. However, implementing a priority queue might be more complex.

Alternatively, since the problem doesn't specify any particular data structure, maybe the user expects a simple implementation using a regular dictionary and a counter.

So, the code would look something like this:

def popitem(self):
    # Find the key with the least frequency
    min_freq = float('inf')
    min_key = None
    for key, value in self.data.items():
        if self.freq[key] < min_freq:
            min_freq = self.freq[key]
            min_key = key
    # Remove the min_key from the data and freq
    if min_key is not None:
        val = self.data.pop(min_key)
        self.freq[min_key] -= 1
        return (min_key, val)
    else:
        # Handle case where no items are present
        raise KeyError("Pop from empty cache")

But wait, the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". The function signature is def popitem(self):, and the docstring is as given. So, the code needs to be a method that returns the least frequently used item.

But the problem might expect that the code uses a specific data structure. However, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed with the above approach.

But wait, in the docstring, it's mentioned that the method returns the (key, value) pair. So, the code needs to return that pair.

But in the code above, when we pop the key, we get the value from the data dictionary. So, that's correct.

However, there's a problem: if the same key is accessed multiple times, the frequency is incremented. But when we pop it, the frequency is decremented. So, the code should correctly track the frequency.

But in the code above, when we find the min_key, we pop it from the data and decrement its frequency. But what if the same key is accessed again? The frequency would be updated, and the next time it's popped, it would have a lower frequency.

But the problem is that the code as written would not handle the case where multiple keys have the same frequency. For example, if two keys have the same frequency, which one is chosen? The docstring says "the (key, value) pair least frequently used", which implies that if there's a tie, any of them can be returned. But the code as written would return the first one encountered with the minimum frequency.

But the problem doesn't specify handling ties, so the code is correct as is.

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the (key, value) pair least frequently used.
    """
    min_freq = float('inf')
    min_key = None
    for key, value in self.data.items():
        if self.freq[key] < min_freq:
            min_freq = self.freq[key]
            min_key = key
    if min_key is not None:
        val = self.data.pop(min_key)
        self.freq[min_key] -= 1
        return (min_key, val)
    else:
        raise KeyError("Pop from empty cache")

But wait, the problem says "Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So, the code should be in Python, and the user wants the code generated.

But the code above is in Python. However, the problem may expect that the code uses a specific data structure. For example, in a cache, the data is stored in a dictionary, and the frequency is tracked in another dictionary.

But since the problem doesn't specify, the code is correct as written.

Another thing to consider: the method should return the (key, value) pair. So, in the code, when we pop the key, we get the value from the data dictionary, and return (key, value).

But in the code, the 'value' is stored in the data dictionary, so that's correct.

So, the code should be as written above.

But in Python, the code would be:

class Cache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
        self.freq = {}

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the (key, value) pair least frequently used.
        """
        min_freq = float('inf')
        min_key = None
        for key, value in self.data.items():
            if self.freq[key] < min_freq:
                min_freq = self.freq[key]
                min_key = key
        if min_key is not None:
            val = self.data.pop(min_key)
            self.freq[min_key] -= 1
            return (min_key, val)
        else:
            raise KeyError("Pop from empty cache")

But the original function signature is def popitem(self):, so the code should be part of a class. However, the user didn't specify the class name, but the function is part of a class. So, the code would be as above.

But the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". So, the code should be the function itself, not the class.

Wait, the function is part of a class. So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the (key, value) pair least frequently used.
    """
    min_freq = float('inf')
    min_key = None
    for key, value in self.data.items():
        if self.freq[key] < min_freq:
            min_freq = self.freq[key]
            min_key = key
    if min_key is not None:
        val = self.data.pop(min_key)
        self.freq[min_key] -= 1
        return (min_key, val)
    else:
        raise KeyError("Pop from empty cache")

But the problem is that the code is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class definition. However, the function is part of a class, so the code is correct.

But the user wants the code generated, so the code should be the function itself, with the class context.

But since the user hasn't provided the class, the code is written as a method inside a class. However, the user might expect that the code is part of a class, but the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code is the function.

But the user's instruction says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". So, the code should be the function, with the class context implied.

But in the code, the function is part of a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class, so the code is written as a method.

But the problem says "Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the code should be the function, and the class is implied.

But in Python, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the (key, value) pair least frequently used.
    """
    min_freq = float('inf')
    min_key = None
    for key, value in self.data.items():
        if self.freq[key] < min_freq:
            min_freq = self.freq[key]
            min_key = key
    if min_key is not None:
        val = self.data.pop(min_key)
        self.freq[min_key] -= 1
        return (min_key, val)
    else:
        raise KeyError("Pop from empty cache")

But the problem is that the code uses self.data and self.freq, which are attributes of the class. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code is correct as written.

So, the final code is as above.
