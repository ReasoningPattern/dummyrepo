Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_from_file method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it loads and validates a YAML file, ensuring all required fields are present. If any mandatory data is missing, it raises IRValidatorException. The return value is a dictionary with the data from the YAML file.

First, I need to import the necessary modules. The YAML parsing would typically use PyYAML. So I'll need to import yaml.

Next, the method is a class method, so it should be defined as def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None). The parameter yaml_file is optional, so it's handled with a default value of None.

The function needs to load the YAML file. If the file doesn't exist, maybe it should raise an exception? But the docstring doesn't mention handling that. The docstring says it raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So perhaps the function assumes the file exists and is valid.

So the steps are: open the YAML file, load it into a dictionary, then validate the fields. But how to validate the fields? The problem is that the docstring doesn't specify which fields are required. Oh, wait, the function is supposed to validate that all required fields are present. But the docstring doesn't list the required fields. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe the actual implementation would have some default required fields, but the docstring doesn't mention them. 

Wait, the user provided the function signature and docstring, but the docstring doesn't list the required fields. So perhaps the actual implementation would have some default required fields, but the docstring isn't specifying them. But the user wants the code generated based on the given function signature and docstring. So maybe the code should include a check for required fields, but since the docstring doesn't specify which ones, perhaps the code is supposed to have a placeholder for that.

Wait, the user's docstring says "when mandatory data is missing in file". So the function is supposed to check that all required fields are present. But without knowing which fields are required, how can the code check that? Maybe the required fields are part of the class's attributes, but the function is supposed to validate them. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has some required attributes, and the validate_from_file method is supposed to check those. But the docstring doesn't mention that. So perhaps the code is supposed to have a way to check the required fields, but since the docstring doesn't specify, maybe the code is supposed to have a placeholder for that.

Wait, the user's example code might have a structure where the class has some required fields, but the function is supposed to validate them. For example, maybe the class has attributes like 'name', 'age', etc., and the function checks that they are present.

But since the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the code should include a check for some common required fields, but that's not clear. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, not to assume anything else.

So, perhaps the code will load the YAML file, then check that certain fields are present. But since the docstring doesn't mention which fields, maybe the code is supposed to have a placeholder for that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger class that has a specific set of required fields, but the docstring doesn't mention them. So the code would need to have a way to check those fields.

But without knowing the required fields, the code can't check them. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to have a way to specify the required fields, but the user hasn't provided that. This is a problem.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to validate the YAML file's structure, not the specific fields. For example, the YAML file might have certain keys that are required. But again, without knowing which keys, the code can't check them.

This is a bit of a dilemma. The user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So the code must include a check for missing data.

But how to implement that? The code would need to load the YAML file, then check that all required fields are present. However, the required fields are not specified in the docstring. So perhaps the code is supposed to have a way to specify the required fields, but the user hasn't provided that.

Wait, maybe the required fields are part of the class's attributes. For example, the class has attributes like 'name', 'age', etc., and the validate_from_file method checks that these are present. But the docstring doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate the YAML file's structure, like checking that it's a dictionary, but that's not enough.

This is a bit unclear. However, the user's example code might have a structure where the function loads the YAML and checks for certain fields. For example, maybe the required fields are 'name' and 'age', but the docstring doesn't mention them.

Given that the user hasn't provided the required fields, perhaps the code should include a placeholder for the required fields, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to have a way to check for the presence of certain keys.

But since the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the code should include a check for the presence of certain fields, but without knowing which, it's impossible. Therefore, maybe the code is supposed to have a way to specify the required fields, but the user hasn't provided that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a specific set of required fields, and the code is supposed to check those. For example, the class might have attributes like 'name', 'age', 'email', and the function checks that these are present.

But since the docstring doesn't mention that, perhaps the code is supposed to have a way to check for those fields. However, without knowing which, the code can't be written.

This is a problem. But perhaps the user expects that the code will have a way to check for the required fields, even if the docstring doesn't specify them. For example, maybe the code will check that the YAML file has a 'data' key, and that 'name' and 'age' are present.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should be written with a general approach, like checking that the loaded data is a dictionary and that certain keys are present.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to validate that the YAML file has a specific structure, like a 'config' dictionary with certain keys.

But without knowing, perhaps the code can be written to load the YAML and check for the presence of certain required fields, like 'name' and 'age', but that's just an example.

But the user's example code might not have that. So perhaps the code should be written with a general approach, like checking that the loaded data is a dictionary and that certain keys are present.

But how to implement that? Let's think.

The code would:

1. Import yaml.

2. Define the method as a class method.

3. Open the YAML file, load it into a variable.

4. Check that the loaded data is a dictionary.

5. Check that certain required fields are present.

But since the required fields are not specified, maybe the code is supposed to have a way to specify them. However, the user hasn't provided that.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to have a way to check that the YAML file has a 'data' key, and that 'name' and 'age' are present.

But without knowing, it's impossible. So perhaps the code is written with a placeholder for the required fields.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should include a check for the presence of certain fields, but the required fields are not specified. Therefore, the code might have a comment indicating that the required fields need to be specified.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, not to include explanations.

So perhaps the code will load the YAML, check that it's a dictionary, and then check for some required fields, but since the required fields are not specified, maybe the code is written with a placeholder.

But how to write that? For example:

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    import yaml
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file is required")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    # Check required fields here
    # For example, check if 'name' and 'age' are present
    if 'name' not in data or 'age' not in data:
        raise IRValidatorException("Missing required fields")
    return data

But this is just an example. However, the user's docstring doesn't mention the required fields, so this is an assumption.

But the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should include a check for the presence of certain fields, but since they are not specified, the code is written with a placeholder.

Alternatively, maybe the required fields are part of the class's attributes, but the function is supposed to validate them. For example, the class has attributes like 'name' and 'age', and the function checks that they are present.

But again, without knowing, it's impossible.

Given that, perhaps the code will load the YAML, check that it's a dictionary, and then check that certain keys are present. For example, check that 'data' is present, and that 'name' and 'age' are present.

But since the user hasn't provided that, the code is written with a placeholder.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

import yaml

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    """Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

    :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
    """
    import yaml
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file is required")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    # Check for required fields
    # Example: check if 'data' and 'name' are present
    if 'data' not in data or 'name' not in data:
        raise IRValidatorException("Missing required fields")
    return data

But the user's docstring doesn't mention the required fields, so this is an assumption. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code must include the check for missing data, but without knowing which fields, it's impossible. Therefore, the code must have a way to check for the presence of certain fields, but since they are not specified, perhaps the code is written with a placeholder.

But the user's example code might have a specific structure. However, without more information, this is the best approach.
