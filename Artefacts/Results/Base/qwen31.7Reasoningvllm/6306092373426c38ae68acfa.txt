Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_spec_defaults as described. Let me look at the function signature and docstring again.

The function is part of a class, and it's supposed to resolve arguments' values from the spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). The docstring says it's resolving arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults(). 

Wait, the function is called get_spec_defaults, and the docstring mentions that it uses self._get_defaults(). So the idea is that this function is responsible for fetching default values from the spec and other sources, and then using those defaults to resolve the arguments.

But the function as written is just a stub. The user hasn't provided the implementation of _get_defaults() or the spec. So I need to generate code that implements this function.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, without any explanation. So I need to write the code for get_spec_defaults, assuming that _get_defaults is implemented elsewhere.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the implementation of _get_defaults. So maybe the code should include a placeholder for that? Or perhaps the function is supposed to call _get_defaults()?

Looking at the function's purpose: it's supposed to resolve arguments' values from the spec and other sources with self._get_defaults(). So the function likely calls self._get_defaults() to get the default values, and then uses those defaults to resolve the arguments.

But the function as written is just a stub. So the code would need to implement the function, perhaps by calling _get_defaults() and then using that to set the arguments.

Wait, but the function's name is get_spec_defaults, and the docstring says it's resolving arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults(). So maybe the function is supposed to retrieve the default values from the spec and other sources, and then use them to set the arguments.

But without knowing the exact implementation of _get_defaults(), I can't write the code. However, the user probably expects that the function calls self._get_defaults() and returns the result.

So perhaps the code for get_spec_defaults is simply:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But that's just a simple call. However, maybe the function is supposed to do more than that. For example, maybe it's supposed to set the defaults for the arguments. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has some arguments, and this function is supposed to get the default values for those arguments. But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should implement the function as described. The docstring mentions that it uses self._get_defaults(), so the function likely calls that method.

So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But maybe the function is supposed to do more. For example, maybe it's supposed to set the defaults for the arguments. But without more info, I can't know. However, the function's name suggests that it's retrieving the defaults, so the code would be as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the default values, and the _get_defaults() method is responsible for fetching them. So the code would be a simple call.

So the final code would be the function as written, with the docstring as given. But the user wants the code generated, so I need to output that.

Wait, but the user's example shows that the code should be in Python markdown format. So the code would be written with the function definition and docstring.

So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But perhaps the function is supposed to do more. For example, maybe it's supposed to set the defaults for the arguments. But without more info, I can't know. However, the function's name suggests that it's retrieving the defaults, so the code would be as above.

Therefore, the generated code is the function as described.
