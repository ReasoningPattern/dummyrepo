Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function is called popitem and is part of a class. The docstring says it removes and returns the (key, value) pair that's least recently used. So, I need to implement this method.

In Python, the most common way to implement a cache or a dictionary with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction is using the collections module's OrderedDict. But since the problem doesn't specify using any particular library, maybe I should assume that the class has a data structure that supports this functionality.

Wait, but the user didn't mention any specific data structure. The problem is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the class has a dictionary that's being used as a cache, and the popitem method is supposed to remove the least recently used item.

But how to implement that? Well, in Python, the OrderedDict has a popitem method that removes and returns the oldest item. So if the class uses an OrderedDict, then popitem would work as intended.

But maybe the class has a different data structure. However, since the problem doesn't specify, I should assume that the class has an OrderedDict instance, and that the popitem method is supposed to use that.

So the code would look something like this:

def popitem(self):
    return self._cache.popitem()

But wait, the docstring says "Remove and return the (key, value) pair least recently used." So the OrderedDict's popitem() method does exactly that, removing the oldest entry.

So the code would be straightforward. But I need to make sure that the method is implemented correctly.

Wait, but in Python, the OrderedDict's popitem() returns the oldest item. So if the class uses an OrderedDict, then this method would work. However, if the class uses a regular dictionary, then the popitem method would not be available. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the class is designed to use OrderedDict.

Therefore, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    return self._cache.popitem()

But I need to make sure that the method is part of the class. The function signature shows that it's a method of the class, so the code would be as above.

Alternatively, if the class has a different data structure, but the problem doesn't specify, then the code would be as above.

So the final code is:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the (key, value) pair least recently used.
    """
    return self._cache.popitem()

But wait, the docstring is part of the function, so the code should include that. The user's example shows the docstring as part of the function definition.

So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the (key, value) pair least recently used.
    """
    return self._cache.popitem()

But I need to make sure that the method is implemented correctly. However, since the problem doesn't specify any particular data structure, this is the best approach.
