Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_valid and takes an identifier as a parameter. The docstring says that it returns True always, but the user mentioned (D) which I think is a placeholder for a specific condition, maybe a docstring tag. But the problem says not to include explanations, so I just need to write the code.

The base implementation returns True always. So the code is straightforward. The function is part of a class, so it's probably a method. The docstring is given as "Return True if identifier is valid. In this base implementation, always return True. (D)". The (D) might be a note, but the code just needs to return True.

So the code would be:

def is_valid(self, identifier):
    """Return True if identifier is valid. In this base implementation, always return True. (D)"""
    return True

That's all. No explanations, just the code. Make sure to use Python syntax correctly, including the class context. But since the function is part of a class, the code is as above. The docstring is included as specified.
