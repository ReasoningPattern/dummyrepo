Okay, I need to write a Python function called _legacy_mergeOrderings that takes a list of orderings as input and returns a list with no duplicate elements. The docstring says it combines multiple lists in the sequence of occurrence into a single list with no duplicates. 

Hmm, the function is named _legacy_mergeOrderings, which suggests it's part of an older codebase. The docstring mentions combining lists in the order they occur. So, maybe the input is a list of lists, and we need to merge them in the order they appear, but remove duplicates.

Wait, the function's purpose is to combine multiple lists into a single list with no duplicates. So, if the input is a list of lists, like [[1,2], [3,4], [1,3]], the output should be [1,2,3,4], but without duplicates. But how exactly?

Wait, the docstring says "combine multiple lists in the sequence of occurrence into a list with no duplicate elements." So perhaps the input is a list of lists, and we need to merge them in the order they appear, but remove any duplicates across all the lists.

For example, if the input is [[1,2], [2,3], [1,4]], the output should be [1,2,3,4], but with duplicates removed. So the function needs to merge all the elements from all the lists in the order they appear, but ensure that each element is only present once.

So the approach would be to flatten all the lists in the input, then create a set to remove duplicates, then convert back to a list.

But wait, the function's name is _legacy_mergeOrderings. Maybe the input is a list of orderings, each being a list. So the function would take a list of lists, merge them, and return a list with unique elements.

So the code would be something like:

def _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings):
    # Flatten all the lists in orderings
    flattened = []
    for ordering in orderings:
        flattened.extend(ordering)
    # Remove duplicates
    unique = []
    seen = set()
    for item in flattened:
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            unique.append(item)
    return unique

Wait, but the function is supposed to combine the lists in the sequence of occurrence. So if the input is a list of lists, like [[1,2], [3,4], [1,3]], then the flattened list is [1,2,3,4,1,3], and the unique list would be [1,2,3,4]. That's correct.

But what if the input is a single list? Like [[1,2,3]]? Then the output would be [1,2,3], which is correct.

So the code seems to handle that. But the function is named _legacy_mergeOrderings, which might be part of an older codebase. But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so I just need to implement it.

Another possibility: maybe the input is a list of orderings, each being a list of elements, and the function is supposed to merge them in the order they appear, but without duplicates. So the code would be as above.

So the code would be:

def _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings):
    """
    Combine multiple lists in the sequence of occurrence into a list with no duplicate elements.
    """
    flattened = []
    for ordering in orderings:
        flattened.extend(ordering)
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for item in flattened:
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            result.append(item)
    return result

Yes, that should work. The code flattens all the lists, then uses a set to track seen elements and builds the result list. That's efficient and meets the requirements.
