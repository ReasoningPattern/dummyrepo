Okay, I need to write a Python function called files_list that takes a path as an argument and returns the list of files in that directory. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, you can use the os module to list files in a directory. The os.listdir() function returns a list of filenames in the given directory. But I should make sure to handle any potential errors, like if the path doesn't exist or if it's not a directory.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Return the files in given path." So it's probably expecting a list of filenames. But maybe the user wants to include directories as well? The docstring isn't explicit, but the function's name suggests it's for files, not directories. So maybe just list the files, not subdirectories.

So the steps would be: import os, then use os.listdir(path), then return that list. But I need to handle possible exceptions. For example, if the path is not a directory, os.listdir might raise an error. So maybe wrap it in a try-except block?

Wait, the function's signature is def files_list(path):. The docstring says "Return the files in given path." So perhaps the function is supposed to return the list of files in the specified path, regardless of whether it's a directory or a file. But if it's a file, os.listdir would return the file's name, but maybe the user expects to get the list of files, not the file itself. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the list of files in the path, treating it as a directory. So even if the path is a file, os.listdir would return the file's name. But that's probably not intended. Maybe the function is intended to handle directories, and the path is a directory. So the code would be:

import os

def files_list(path):
    try:
        return os.listdir(path)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle errors, maybe return empty list or raise?
        return []

But the docstring doesn't mention error handling. The user might expect that the function returns the list of files, and if the path is invalid, it returns an empty list or raises an error. But since the function is supposed to return the files, perhaps it's better to return the list, and let the caller handle errors.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the list of files in the path, and if the path is not a directory, it returns an empty list. But how to check that? For example, if the path is a file, os.listdir would return the file's name. So maybe the function is intended to treat the path as a directory, and return the list of files in it.

So the code would be:

import os

def files_list(path):
    return os.listdir(path)

But then, if the path is not a directory, it would throw an error. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the list of files, and the caller is responsible for ensuring the path is a directory.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Return the files in given path." So the code would be to list the files in the path, which is what os.listdir does.

So the code would be:

import os

def files_list(path):
    return os.listdir(path)

But maybe the user wants to include the directory name? No, the docstring says "files in given path", so it's the filenames.

So the code is as simple as that. But perhaps the function should return a list of filenames, and the user might want to process them. But the function's signature is given, so the code is as above.

Wait, but in Python, os.listdir returns a list of filenames, but if the path is a file, it returns a list with one element, the filename. So the function would return the list of files, even if the path is a file. But that's probably not intended. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify, so the code is as written.

So the final code is:

import os

def files_list(path):
    return os.listdir(path)
