Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me look at the function again.

The function is called set_cut_chars and takes two parameters: before and after, both are bytes. The return type is None. The docstring explains that these bytes are used to delimit slice points.

Hmm, the task is to implement this function. But wait, the user said not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So I just need to write the code.

Wait, the function is supposed to set the cut characters. But in Python, bytes are handled as binary data. So the function probably modifies some internal state of the class to store these before and after bytes.

But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I need to assume that the class has attributes to store these values. Maybe the class has attributes like self.before and self.after, which are bytes.

So the function would assign the before and after bytes to these attributes. But the function is written as a method, so it's likely that the class has these attributes.

So the code would be:

def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
    self.before = before
    self.after = after

That's it. But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly typed. The function parameters are before and after, both bytes. The return type is None.

Yes, that's the correct implementation. The function just assigns the values to the instance variables. Since the user didn't provide the class definition, this is the standard way to implement such a method.
