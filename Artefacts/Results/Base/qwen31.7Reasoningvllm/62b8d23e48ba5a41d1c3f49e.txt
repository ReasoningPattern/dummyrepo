Okay, I need to generate a Python function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and is part of a class. The docstring says it finds, removes, and returns a random (key, value) pair using __choice.

First, I should recall that in Python, the __choice function is not a built-in function. Wait, maybe the user meant using the random module's choice function. Oh right, the docstring says "via __choice", but that's probably a typo. So the actual intention is to use random.choice.

So the function needs to randomly select a key-value pair from the class's dictionary. But wait, the class's dictionary? The function is part of a class, so maybe the class has a dictionary attribute, like self.data. So the function would need to randomly select a key from that dictionary and return the corresponding value.

But wait, the docstring says "popitem" which is a method typically found in dictionaries, like dict.popitem(). But here, the function is supposed to do the same but via __choice. So the function would need to select a random key from the dictionary and then remove and return that key-value pair.

So the steps are:

1. Generate a random key from the dictionary.
2. Remove that key-value pair from the dictionary.
3. Return the key-value pair.

But how to implement this in Python. Let's think.

The class has a dictionary, maybe called data. So self.data is the dictionary.

So the function would look like:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.data:
        # Handle empty dictionary case
        raise KeyError("dictionary is empty")
    key = random.choice(list(self.data))
    value = self.data.pop(key)
    return key, value

Wait, but the docstring says "via __choice", but in Python, the random module's choice function is called random.choice. So maybe the docstring is a typo, and the actual code uses random.choice.

So the code would use random.choice to select a key from the dictionary's keys.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a random (key, value) pair. So the code would select a key, then pop it, and return the pair.

But in Python, dictionaries don't have a popitem method. Wait, but the user is asking to generate code for a method called popitem. So the class must have a data attribute, perhaps a dictionary.

So the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.data:
        raise KeyError("dictionary is empty")
    key = random.choice(list(self.data))
    return key, self.data.pop(key)

But the docstring says "Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So maybe the __choice is a method in the class, but that's not standard. But the user wants the code to use __choice, but that's not a built-in function. So perhaps the docstring is a mistake, and the actual code uses random.choice.

So the code would use random.choice, and the docstring is a typo.

So the final code would be as above.

But the user says not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So just the code.

So the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class
    """
    if not self.data:
        raise KeyError("dictionary is empty")
    key = random.choice(list(self.data))
    return key, self.data.pop(key)

But wait, the docstring says "via __choice in the class". But in the code, we're using random.choice. So maybe the user intended to use a method called __choice, but that's not standard. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so we have to follow the docstring as given.

But the docstring says "via __choice in the class". So perhaps the code is supposed to use a method called __choice, but that's not a standard Python function. However, the user might have a custom __choice method in the class. But without knowing that, we can't assume. So perhaps the docstring is a mistake, and the actual code uses random.choice.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the docstring says "via __choice in the class", so perhaps the code is supposed to use a method called __choice. But that's not standard. However, the user might have a class with a __choice method, but that's not part of the standard library.

But since the user hasn't provided any other info, we have to proceed with the given docstring. So the code would use __choice, but that's not a built-in function. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring, and the actual code uses random.choice.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must follow the docstring as written. So even if __choice is not a valid function, the code would use it. But in Python, that's not possible. So maybe the user intended to use random.choice, and the docstring is a typo.

But since the user says to generate code based on the docstring, even if it's incorrect, we have to proceed. So the code would use __choice, but that's not valid. However, the user might have a class with a __choice method. But without knowing that, we can't assume.

But given that the user is asking for code, perhaps the correct approach is to use random.choice, and the docstring is a typo. So the code would be as I wrote earlier.

So the final code is:

import random

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class
    """
    if not self.data:
        raise KeyError("dictionary is empty")
    key = random.choice(list(self.data))
    return key, self.data.pop(key)

But the user's docstring says "via __choice in the class", so maybe the code is supposed to use a method called __choice. But that's not possible. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring, and the actual code uses random.choice.

In any case, the code as per the function signature and docstring would be as above.
