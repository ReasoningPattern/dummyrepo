Okay, I need to write a Python function called check_sender_and_entity_handle_match. The docstring says it checks if sender_handle is the same as entity_handle. If they are the same, return True, else False.

So the function takes two parameters, sender_handle and entity_handle. Both are probably strings, but the docstring doesn't specify. But since the function is comparing them, they should be comparable, maybe strings or tuples?

The function should return True if sender_handle == entity_handle, else False. So the code is straightforward.

Wait, the docstring says "if yes, return True. Otherwise, return False." So exactly, the function is a simple equality check.

So the code would be:

def check_sender_and_entity_handle_match(sender_handle, entity_handle):
    return sender_handle == entity_handle

That's all. No extra logic. Just compare the two handles.
