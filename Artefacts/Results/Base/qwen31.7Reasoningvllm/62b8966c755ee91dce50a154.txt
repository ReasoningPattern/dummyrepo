Okay, I need to create a Python function called isoparse that parses an ISO-8601 datetime string into a datetime.datetime object. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a parameter dt_str, which is a string or stream. The docstring explains the supported date and time formats, including common and uncommon ones. Also, there are notes about time zones and fractional seconds.

The main challenge is parsing the input string according to the specified formats. The ISO-8601 standard has specific rules for date and time components. For example, the date part can be YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYYMM, or YYYY-MM-DD, and the time part can be hh, hh:mm, etc.

I remember that Python's datetime module can parse ISO-8601 strings, but maybe I need to handle some of the special cases mentioned in the docstring. For instance, the ISO week and day formats (like YYYY-Www-D) are not standard in the datetime module, so I'll need to handle those.

Also, the time zone offsets are handled with dateutil.tz, but the function returns a datetime.datetime object, which might require converting to a timezone-aware object. Wait, the docstring says the return is a datetime.datetime, but the time zone offset is represented as a dateutil.tz.tzoffset. Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to return a naive datetime object, but the time zone is handled via the tzoffset. Or perhaps the function is supposed to handle the time zone correctly.

Wait, the docstring says that the return is a datetime.datetime, but the time zone offset is represented as a dateutil.tz.tzoffset. So maybe the function is supposed to return a naive datetime object, and the time zone is handled as part of the tzoffset. But the user might expect the datetime object to be timezone-aware, but according to the docstring, it's not. So perhaps the function is supposed to return a naive datetime, and the time zone is handled via the tzoffset.

But the problem is that the datetime module in Python doesn't support timezone-aware datetime objects by default. So maybe the function is supposed to return a naive datetime, and the time zone is handled as a separate component.

But the docstring says that the return is a datetime.datetime, which is a timezone-aware object. Wait, no. The datetime module's datetime object is timezone-aware by default. But in the case of the time zone offset, the function might be returning a timezone-aware object. However, the docstring mentions that the time zone offset is represented as dateutil.tz.tzoffset, which is a timezone object. So perhaps the function is supposed to return a timezone-aware datetime object, but the time zone is handled via the tzoffset.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about the steps needed.

First, parse the date and time parts. The date part can be in various formats, and the time part can be in various formats. The function needs to split the date and time parts using the 'T' separator.

So, the first step is to split the input string into date and time parts. For example, "2023-10-05T14:30:45" would split into date "2023-10-05" and time "14:30:45".

Then, parse each part separately. For the date part, the supported formats are:

Common:
- YYYY
- YYYY-MM or YYYYMM
- YYYY-MM-DD or YYYYMMDD

Uncommon:
- YYYY-Www or YYYYWww (ISO week)
- YYYY-Www-D or YYYYWwwD (ISO week and day)

For the time part, the supported formats are:

- hh
- hh:mm or hhmm
- hh:mm:ss or hhmmss
- hh:mm:ss.ssssss (up to 6 sub-second digits)

Also, the time zone offset is handled with the specified formats.

So, the plan is to split the input into date and time parts, parse each part, then combine them with the time zone offset.

But how to handle the different formats? The datetime module in Python can parse some of these, but not all. For example, the YYYY-MM-DD format is supported, but the YYYYMMDD is not. So, the function needs to handle these formats.

Wait, the common date formats are:

- YYYY (year only)
- YYYY-MM (year-month)
- YYYYMM (year-month-day, but without the day)
- YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day)

So, the date part can be parsed with different formats. For example, if the input is "2023", then it's YYYY. If it's "2023-10", then it's YYYY-MM. If it's "202310", then it's YYYYMM. If it's "2023-10-05", then it's YYYY-MM-DD.

So, the date part needs to be parsed with different formats. Similarly for the time part.

But how to handle the different formats in code? Maybe using the datetime.strptime function with the appropriate format strings.

But the problem is that the date and time parts are separated by 'T', so the first step is to split the input string into date and time parts.

So, the code would:

1. Split the input string into date_part and time_part using the 'T' separator.
2. Parse the date_part using the appropriate format.
3. Parse the time_part using the appropriate format.
4. Combine them into a datetime object, considering the time zone.

But how to handle the time zone? The docstring mentions that the time zone offset is represented as dateutil.tz.tzoffset, but the function returns a datetime.datetime. So perhaps the function is supposed to return a naive datetime object, and the time zone is handled as a separate component.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a timezone-aware datetime object, but the time zone is handled via the tzoffset.

But the problem is that the datetime module in Python doesn't support timezone-aware datetime objects by default. So perhaps the function is supposed to return a naive datetime, and the time zone is handled as a separate component.

But the docstring says that the return is a datetime.datetime, which is a timezone-aware object. So perhaps the function is supposed to return a timezone-aware datetime object, and the time zone is handled via the tzoffset.

But how to handle that? The dateutil.tz module is used for timezone handling. So, perhaps the function is supposed to parse the date and time, then create a datetime object with the time zone.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about the steps again.

First, split the input into date and time parts. Then parse each part.

For the date part, the supported formats are:

- YYYY
- YYYY-MM
- YYYYMM
- YYYY-MM-DD

So, the date format can be:

date_format = "%Y"  # for YYYY
date_format = "%Y-%m"  # for YYYY-MM
date_format = "%Y%m"  # for YYYYMM
date_format = "%Y-%m-%d"  # for YYYY-MM-DD

But the problem is that the input can have different lengths. For example, "2023" is YYYY, "2023-10" is YYYY-MM, "202310" is YYYYMM, "2023-10-05" is YYYY-MM-DD.

So, the code needs to check the length of the date_part and use the appropriate format.

Similarly for the time part.

But how to handle the different formats in code? Maybe using the datetime.strptime function with different format strings.

But the problem is that the date and time parts are separated by 'T', so the code needs to split the input string into date and time parts.

So, the code would:

- Split the input string into date_part and time_part using the 'T' separator.

But what if the input string doesn't have a 'T'? For example, "2023-10-05" is a date, but no time. According to the docstring, the function is supposed to parse an ISO-8601 datetime string. So, the input must have a 'T' separator. However, the docstring says that incomplete date formats (like YYYY-MM) may not be combined with a time portion. So, the input must have a 'T' separator, but the date and time parts must be correctly formatted.

So, the code can assume that the input string has a 'T' separator.

So, the code would:

1. Split the input string into date_part and time_part using the 'T' separator.

But what if the input string has multiple 'T's? Well, the docstring says that the input is a string containing only an ISO-8601 datetime string, so it's safe to split once.

Once the date_part and time_part are separated, parse each part.

For the date_part:

The supported formats are:

- YYYY (4 digits)
- YYYY-MM (4+2)
- YYYYMM (4+2)
- YYYY-MM-DD (4+2+2)

So, the code can check the length of the date_part and use the appropriate format.

For example:

if len(date_part) == 4:  # YYYY
    date = datetime.strptime(date_part, "%Y")
elif len(date_part) == 6:  # YYYYMM
    date = datetime.strptime(date_part, "%Y%m")
elif len(date_part) == 10:  # YYYY-MM-DD
    date = datetime.strptime(date_part, "%Y-%m-%d")
else:
    # invalid date format, but according to the docstring, the input is valid

But wait, the docstring says that incomplete date formats (like YYYY-MM) may not be combined with a time portion. So, the input must have a 'T' separator, but the date part must be complete. So, the code can assume that the date_part is valid.

Similarly for the time_part.

For the time_part, the supported formats are:

- hh (2 digits)
- hh:mm (2+2)
- hh:mm:ss (2+2+2)
- hh:mm:ss.ssssss (2+2+2+6)

So, the code can check the length of the time_part and use the appropriate format.

For example:

if len(time_part) == 2:  # hh
    time = datetime.strptime(time_part, "%H")
elif len(time_part) == 4:  # hhmm
    time = datetime.strptime(time_part, "%H%M")
elif len(time_part) == 6:  # hhmmss
    time = datetime.strptime(time_part, "%H%M%S")
elif len(time_part) == 8:  # hhmmssss
    time = datetime.strptime(time_part, "%H%M%S.%f")
else:
    # invalid time format, but according to the docstring, input is valid

Wait, but the time part can also have a fractional part. However, the docstring says that the fractional components other than seconds are not implemented. So, the code can handle up to 6 sub-second digits.

But the code needs to handle the different formats.

But how to handle the time zone offset? The docstring mentions that the time zone offset is represented as dateutil.tz.tzoffset. So, the code needs to parse the time zone offset part.

For example, if the time_part is "14:30:45+00:00", then the time is 14:30:45, and the timezone is +00:00.

But the code needs to parse the time zone offset part.

So, the code would split the time_part into the time and timezone parts.

Wait, but the time_part is the time part, which can have a timezone offset. For example, "14:30:45+00:00" is a time with a timezone offset. But according to the ISO-8601 standard, the time part can have a timezone offset, but the code needs to parse it.

But the problem is that the time_part is the time part, which may include a timezone offset. So, the code needs to parse the time_part as the time, and then parse the timezone offset as a separate part.

But how to handle this? For example, if the time_part is "14:30:45+00:00", the code needs to parse the time as "14:30:45" and the timezone as "+00:00".

But the code can split the time_part into the time and timezone parts. However, the time_part may not have a timezone, but according to the ISO-8601, the time part can have a timezone offset.

But the code needs to parse the time part and the timezone offset. However, the time part is the time, and the timezone offset is separate.

So, the code would first parse the time part, then parse the timezone offset.

But how to handle this in code? For example, if the time_part is "14:30:45+00:00", the code can split into time_part and timezone_part.

But the code needs to handle cases where the time_part has a timezone offset, or not.

This is getting complicated. Let me think about the steps again.

The function is supposed to parse the entire ISO-8601 string into a datetime.datetime object. So, the code needs to:

1. Split the input string into date_part and time_part using 'T' as the separator.
2. Parse the date_part into a date object.
3. Parse the time_part into a time object.
4. Combine the date and time into a datetime object, considering the time zone.

But how to handle the time zone? The code needs to parse the time zone offset from the time_part.

Wait, the time_part can have a timezone offset. For example, "14:30:45+00:00" is a time with a timezone offset. But the code needs to parse that as a time and a timezone.

But the problem is that the time_part is the time part, which may include a timezone offset. So, the code needs to parse the time_part as the time, and then parse the timezone offset as a separate part.

But how to do that? For example, if the time_part is "14:30:45+00:00", the code can split into time_part and timezone_part.

But the code needs to handle cases where the time_part has a timezone offset, or not.

Alternatively, the code can parse the entire string as a datetime object, but that's not possible with the standard datetime module.

So, perhaps the code can use the datetime.strptime function with a custom format that includes the time zone.

But the problem is that the time zone is not part of the ISO-8601 format. The time zone is part of the time part, but the ISO-8601 format allows for time zones in the time part.

So, the code needs to parse the time part with the timezone offset.

But how to handle this in code? For example, the time_part can be "14:30:45+00:00", which is a time with a timezone offset. The code needs to parse this as a time with the timezone offset.

But the code can split the time_part into the time and the timezone offset. For example:

time_part = "14:30:45+00:00"

Split into time_part and timezone_part:

time_part = "14:30:45"
timezone_part = "+00:00"

Then, parse the time_part as a time, and the timezone_part as a timezone offset.

But how to handle this in code? The code can split the time_part into the time and timezone parts.

But the code needs to handle different formats for the time_part. For example, the time_part can be "14:30:45", "14:30:45+00:00", "14:30:45+00", etc.

So, the code can first check if the time_part contains a '+' or '-' sign, and split it into the time and timezone parts.

But this is getting complex. Let me think of the steps again.

First, split the input into date_part and time_part.

Then, parse the date_part into a date object.

Then, parse the time_part into a time object, and also parse the timezone offset.

But how to handle the timezone offset? The code can parse the timezone offset as a separate part.

For example, if the time_part is "14:30:45+00:00", the code can split into time_part and timezone_part.

But the code needs to handle cases where the time_part is "14:30:45" (no timezone), or "14:30:45+00:00", etc.

So, the code can first check if the time_part contains a '+' or '-' sign. If it does, split into time and timezone parts. Otherwise, the timezone is UTC.

But how to handle this in code? For example:

if '+' in time_part:
    time_str, tz_str = time_part.split('+')
    tz_str = tz_str.strip()
elif '-' in time_part:
    time_str, tz_str = time_part.split('-')
    tz_str = tz_str.strip()
else:
    time_str = time_part
    tz_str = 'Z'

But this is just a rough idea. The code needs to handle cases where the timezone is present, and then parse the tz_str as a timezone offset.

Once the time_str and tz_str are parsed, the code can create a datetime object with the time_str and the timezone.

But how to handle the timezone in Python? The code can use the dateutil.tz module to create a timezone object.

So, the code would:

- Parse the time_str into a time object.
- Parse the tz_str into a timezone offset.

Then, combine them into a datetime object.

But the code needs to handle the different formats for the time_str and tz_str.

For example, the time_str can be "14", "14:30", "14:30:45", etc.

The code can use the datetime.strptime function for the time_str, and then the tz_str can be parsed into a timezone offset.

But this is getting quite involved.

Putting it all together, the code would:

1. Split the input string into date_part and time_part.
2. Parse the date_part into a date object.
3. Parse the time_part into a time object and timezone offset.
4. Combine the date and time into a datetime object, with the timezone.

But how to handle the timezone in the code?

The code can use the dateutil.tz module to create a timezone object.

So, the code would:

from dateutil import tz

Then, for the timezone offset:

if tz_str is 'Z':
    tz_obj = tz.tzutc()
elif tz_str is '+00:00':
    tz_obj = tz.tzutc()
elif tz_str is '-00:00':
    tz_obj = tz.tzutc()
else:
    # parse the timezone offset
    hours, minutes = map(int, tz_str.split(':'))
    tz_obj = tz.tzoffset(None, hours * 3600 + minutes * 60, 0)

But this is just a rough idea.

Putting all this together, the code would:

- Split the input into date_part and time_part.
- Parse the date_part.
- Parse the time_part into time_str and tz_str.
- Parse the time_str into a time object.
- Parse the tz_str into a timezone object.
- Combine the date and time with the timezone.

But the code needs to handle the different formats for the time_str and tz_str.

This is quite complex, but I think that's the way to go.

Now, the code:

First, the function is called isoparse, and it's part of a class. The docstring is provided, so the code needs to follow that.

The code would need to import necessary modules, like datetime and dateutil.tz.

So, the code would start with:

import datetime
from dateutil import tz

But the code may need to handle the time zone parsing.

But the code needs to handle the different formats for the date and time parts.

So, the code would:

def isoparse(self, dt_str):
    # Split into date and time parts
    if 'T' not in dt_str:
        raise ValueError("Invalid ISO-8601 string")
    date_part, time_part = dt_str.split('T', 1)
    
    # Parse date part
    # Handle different date formats
    # Common formats:
    # YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYYMM, YYYY-MM-DD
    # Uncommon formats: YYYY-Www, YYYY-Www-D
    
    # For date_part, try different formats
    # First, check if it's a valid date
    # But according to the docstring, the input is valid
    
    # Parse date_part
    # Try different formats
    # For example, if len(date_part) is 4, it's YYYY
    # If len is 6, it's YYYYMM
    # If len is 10, it's YYYY-MM-DD
    # Else, it's YYYY-MM (but with a different length)
    
    # So, check the length of date_part
    # For common formats:
    # YYYY: 4 digits
    # YYYY-MM: 6 digits (YYYYMM?), no, wait:
    # YYYY-MM is 4 + 2 = 6 digits, but the date_part is "YYYY-MM"
    # So, for example, "2023-10" is YYYY-MM, which is 6 characters.
    # So, the code can check the length of date_part:
    
    # Try different formats
    # First, check if it's a valid date
    # But the code can use strptime with different formats
    
    # For the date_part, try to parse with the following formats:
    # %Y, %Y-%m, %Y%m, %Y-%m-%d
    
    # So, create a list of possible formats
    date_formats = [
        "%Y",          # YYYY
        "%Y-%m",       # YYYY-MM
        "%Y%m",        # YYYYMM
        "%Y-%m-%d"     # YYYY-MM-DD
    ]
    
    # Try each format
    try:
        date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_part, "%Y")
    except ValueError:
        try:
            date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_part, "%Y-%m")
        except ValueError:
            try:
                date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_part, "%Y%m")
            except ValueError:
                try:
                    date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_part, "%Y-%m-%d")
                except ValueError:
                    # invalid date format, but according to docstring, input is valid
                    pass
    except ValueError:
        # handle other cases
        pass
    
    # Wait, this approach may not work for all cases. For example, if the date_part is "202310", which is YYYYMM, the code would parse it as YYYYMM, but the code above would try "%Y" first, which fails, then "%Y-%m" which also fails, then "%Y%m" which would parse as 202310 as YYYYMM, which is 4+2=6 digits. So, the code would parse it as 202310 as YYYYMM, which is correct.

    # So, the code can use the strptime with the different formats in order.

    # But how to handle the different formats in code?

    # Maybe use a loop to try each format in order.

    # Alternatively, use a single format that covers all possible date formats.

    # But that's not possible, since the date_part can be in different formats.

    # So, the code can try each format in order.

    # So, the code would:

    # Try the common formats first
    # For example:
    # Try "%Y" first
    # If fails, try "%Y-%m"
    # If fails, try "%Y%m"
    # If fails, try "%Y-%m-%d"
    
    # So, code:

    # Try to parse date_part with the common formats
    # Initialize date as None
    date = None
    for fmt in ["%Y", "%Y-%m", "%Y%m", "%Y-%m-%d"]:
        try:
            date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_part, fmt)
            break
        except ValueError:
            continue
    else:
        # if none of the formats worked, raise an error
        raise ValueError("Invalid date format")
    
    # Now, date is a datetime object for the date part.
    
    # Now, parse the time_part.
    
    # The time_part can have a timezone offset.
    # So, first, check if it contains a '+' or '-' sign.
    # Split into time_str and tz_str.
    # For example, "14:30:45+00:00" becomes time_str = "14:30:45", tz_str = "+00:00"
    # Or "14:30:45" becomes time_str = "14:30:45", tz_str = "Z"
    
    # So, split the time_part into time_str and tz_str
    if '+' in time_part:
        time_str, tz_str = time_part.split('+', 1)
        tz_str = tz_str.strip()
    elif '-' in time_part:
        time_str, tz_str = time_part.split('-', 1)
        tz_str = tz_str.strip()
    else:
        time_str = time_part
        tz_str = 'Z'
    
    # Now, parse the time_str into a time object.
    # The time_str can be "hh", "hh:mm", "hh:mm:ss", "hh:mm:ss.ssssss"
    
    # So, try different formats for time_str
    # For example:
    # "hh" -> "%H"
    # "hh:mm" -> "%H%M"
    # "hh:mm:ss" -> "%H%M%S"
    # "hh:mm:ss.ssssss" -> "%H%M%S.%f"
    
    # So, try the formats in order.
    time = None
    time_formats = ["%H", "%H%M", "%H%M%S", "%H%M%S.%f"]
    for fmt in time_formats:
        try:
            # Parse the time_str with the current format
            # But the time_str may have leading zeros, like "01:02:03"
            # So, the format should allow for that.
            # For example, "%H" would parse "01" as 1, but the code needs to handle leading zeros.
            # However, the datetime.strptime function will handle that.
            # So, the code can use the format as is.
            # But wait, the time_str is a string like "14:30:45", which is 2 hours, 30 minutes, 45 seconds.
            # So, the code can use the format "%H:%M:%S" for the time_str.
            # But the code needs to handle different formats.
            # So, the code can try each format in order.
            # For example, if the time_str is "14", then "%H" would parse it as 14, which is correct.
            # If the time_str is "14:30", then "%H%M" would parse it as 1430, which is 14 hours and 30 minutes.
            # But this is not correct. Wait, the time_str is "14:30", which is 14 hours and 30 minutes. So, the code needs to parse it as "14:30" as a time, which would be 14:30, but the format "%H%M" would parse it as 1430, which is 14 hours and 30 minutes. That's correct.
            # So, the code can use the time_formats in order.
            
            # So, the code would try each format in order.
            # For example:
            # time_str is "14:30:45"
            # try "%H" -> "14" (but the code needs to parse "14:30:45" as a time)
            # So, this approach may not work. Because the time_str is "14:30:45", but the code is trying to parse it with "%H" which would parse "14" as 14, but the actual time is 14:30:45.
            
            # So, the code needs to parse the time_str as a time, which can be done with the datetime.strptime function with the appropriate format.
