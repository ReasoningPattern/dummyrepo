Okay, I need to generate a Python function called validate_value that checks a value against a regular expression. The function's docstring says it's supposed to validate the value based on the corresponding regex. But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the specific regex pattern. Oh right, the user just gave the function signature and docstring, but no actual regex to use. Hmm, how do I proceed?

Wait, maybe the regex is part of the function's implementation. But the user hasn't specified it. Oh, maybe the regex is supposed to be a placeholder? Or maybe there's a standard regex that's commonly used here. But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. Since the regex isn't provided, perhaps the function is supposed to be a template that can be filled in with the actual regex?

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So maybe the regex is part of the function's logic. But without knowing the regex, how can I write the code? Wait, maybe the regex is supposed to be a variable inside the function? Like, the function could have a regex pattern that's defined elsewhere, but the user hasn't provided that.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake and forgot to include the regex. But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the regex is part of the function's implementation, but since it's not provided, I have to assume that the regex is a placeholder. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate against a specific regex, like for example, checking if the value is a certain format. But without knowing the exact regex, I can't write the code. Wait, maybe the user expects me to use a common regex, like checking for email addresses, or passwords, but that's just a guess.

Wait, the function's docstring says "validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression." So the regex is associated with the function. But since it's not provided, perhaps the user expects me to use a default regex. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the regex is part of the function's parameters, but the function signature doesn't have that.

Wait, looking back at the function signature: the function is def validate_value(value):. So the function takes a single argument, value. The docstring says it validates against a regex. But the regex isn't provided. So how can I write the code?

Ah, maybe the regex is supposed to be a variable inside the function, but the user hasn't provided it. But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the regex is part of the function's implementation, but since it's not given, I have to write a generic function that uses a regex, but the regex is not specified. That seems impossible.

Wait, maybe the user intended for the regex to be part of the function's parameters, but the function signature doesn't include it. But the function signature is given as def validate_value(value):, so no parameters. So the regex must be hardcoded inside the function.

But without knowing the regex, I can't write the code. This is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake and forgot to include the regex. But since the user is asking for code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the regex is supposed to be a placeholder, like a variable, but the user hasn't provided it.

Alternatively, maybe the regex is part of the docstring, but the user didn't include it. Wait, the docstring is given as:

def validate_value(value):
	"""
	Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression.
	"""

So the docstring mentions the regex but doesn't specify it. So the actual regex is not provided. Therefore, the code can't be written without knowing the regex. But the user is expecting me to generate code, so perhaps the regex is supposed to be a placeholder, like a variable, but the user hasn't provided it.

Wait, maybe the user intended for the regex to be a parameter, but the function signature doesn't have it. But the function signature is given as def validate_value(value):, so no parameters. Therefore, the regex must be hardcoded inside the function.

But without knowing the regex, I can't write the code. So perhaps the answer is to write a generic function that uses a regex, but the regex is not specified. But that's not possible. Therefore, maybe the user made a mistake and forgot to include the regex. But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring.

Hmm, this is a bit of a dead end. Maybe the user expects me to use a default regex, like checking if the value is a string, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the regex is supposed to be a variable that's defined elsewhere, but the code can't include that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate against a specific regex, like checking if the value is a certain format, but the user hasn't provided that. For example, maybe the regex is for email addresses, but that's just a guess.

In that case, perhaps I can write a function that uses a common regex, like checking for email addresses. But the user hasn't specified, so this is a guess. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a template that can be filled in with the actual regex.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So maybe the code is supposed to have a regex as a variable, but the user hasn't provided it. Therefore, the code would be:

def validate_value(value):
	"""
	Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression.
	"""
	import re
	regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
	# ... rest of the code

But since the regex is not provided, this is just a guess. However, the user might expect that the regex is part of the function's implementation. But without knowing it, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate against a regex that's part of the docstring, but the docstring doesn't include it. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a template, but the user hasn't provided the regex.

In this case, the correct approach is to write the function with a placeholder regex, but since the user hasn't provided it, I can't know. But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. Therefore, the code must include the regex. But since it's not provided, perhaps the user intended for the regex to be a variable, but the code can't include it. Therefore, the answer is to write the function with a placeholder regex.

But how to represent that? Maybe the code is:

def validate_value(value):
	"""
	Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression.
	"""
	import re
	regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
	if re.match(regex, value):
		return True
	else:
		return False

But this is just a guess. However, the user might expect that the regex is part of the function's implementation. So this is the best I can do given the information.
