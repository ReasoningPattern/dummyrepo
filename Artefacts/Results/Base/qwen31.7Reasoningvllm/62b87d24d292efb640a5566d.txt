Okay, let's see. The function is called plus_or_dot, and it takes a parameter called pieces. The docstring says that if the closest tag of the pieces contains a "+", return ".", else return "+". Wait, but what exactly does "closest-tag" mean here? Oh right, maybe the pieces are some kind of tags or elements, and the closest tag is the one that's closest to the current position. But how do I determine that?

Hmm, maybe the pieces are a list of strings, and each string is a tag. For example, if the pieces are ["<div>", "<span>"], then the closest tag would be the last one? Or maybe the first? Wait, the problem statement isn't clear. But the function's purpose is to check if the closest tag contains a "+". So perhaps the pieces are tags, and we need to look at the last tag, or the first?

Wait, maybe the pieces are a list of tags, and the closest tag is the one that's closest to the current position. But without more context, it's hard to tell. But the function's docstring says "the closet-tag of the pieces". Maybe the pieces are a list of tags, and the closest tag is the last one? Or maybe the first?

Alternatively, maybe the pieces are a list of strings, and the closest tag is the last element in the list. For example, if the pieces are ["<div>", "<span>"], then the closest tag is "<span>". But how does that relate to the "+" or "."?

Wait, the function's return value is either "." or "+". So perhaps the presence of a "+" in the closest tag determines the return value. But how do we check that?

Wait, maybe the pieces are a list of tags, and the closest tag is the last one. So, for example, if the pieces are ["<div>", "<span>"], then the closest tag is "<span>", and if that contains a "+", return ".", else "+".

But how do I check if the closest tag contains a "+"? So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the closest tag. Let's assume it's the last element in the pieces list.
2. Check if the closest tag contains a "+".
3. If yes, return ".", else return "+".

But why would the closest tag be the last element? Maybe the problem is about parsing HTML or something similar, where the closest tag is the one that's closest to the current position. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the function's docstring is the only clue.

So, the code would be:

def plus_or_dot(pieces):
    if pieces and pieces[-1].find('+') != -1:
        return '.'
    else:
        return '+'

Wait, but what if pieces is empty? The docstring says "the closet-tag of the pieces", so maybe pieces is not empty. But the function could still have empty pieces. But the problem says to return "." if the closest tag contains "+", else "+". So, if the pieces is empty, maybe return "+"? Or maybe the function is supposed to handle that case. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that pieces is not empty.

So the code would check the last element of the pieces list. If it contains a '+', return '.', else '+'.

So the code would be:

def plus_or_dot(pieces):
    if '+' in pieces[-1]:
        return '.'
    else:
        return '+'

But wait, the docstring says "the closet-tag of the pieces contains "+", so maybe the closest tag is the last one. So that's the logic.

So the code would be as above. But maybe the pieces are tags, and the closest tag is the last one. So the code is as written.

So the final code is:

def plus_or_dot(pieces):
    return '.' if '+' in pieces[-1] else '+'

Yes, that's the code. So the answer is that code.
