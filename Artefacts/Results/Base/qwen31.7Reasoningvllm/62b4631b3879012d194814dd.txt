Okay, I need to write a Python function called fix_namespace_prefix_w that takes content as an argument. The docstring says to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=". 

Hmm, so the function is supposed to process the content string and modify the prefixes. Let me think about how to do that. 

The simplest way is to use the string replace method. So, content.replace("w:st=", "w-st="). But wait, maybe there are multiple occurrences? The docstring doesn't mention anything about multiple instances, so maybe it's just a single replacement. 

But the function is named fix_namespace_prefix_w, which suggests that there might be multiple occurrences. However, the docstring doesn't specify, so I should assume that the replace method will handle it. 

So the code would be straightforward. The function returns the modified content. 

Wait, but what if the content is not a string? Well, the function's parameter is content, which is assumed to be a string here. 

So the code is just:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

That's all. No need for any additional steps. Just replace the prefix.
