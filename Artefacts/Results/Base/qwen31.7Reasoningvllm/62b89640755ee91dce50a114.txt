Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called tzname_in_python2, and the docstring says it changes unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2. 

First, I should understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions Python 2, so the function is likely handling the conversion from unicode to bytestrings. In Python 2, strings are unicode by default, and bytestrings are bytes. So, the function might be taking a function that returns a unicode string and converting it to a bytestring.

Looking at the function signature: def tzname_in_python2(namefunc). The namefunc is probably a function that returns a unicode string. The task is to convert that into a bytestring. In Python 2, the encode method can be used. So, the function would take the namefunc, call it, then encode the result to bytes using the default encoding, which is 'utf-8' unless specified otherwise.

Wait, but the docstring says "change unicode output into bytestrings". So, the function should take a function that returns a unicode string and return a bytestring. So, the code would be something like:

return namefunc().encode('utf-8')

But wait, in Python 2, the encode method is available. So, the function would take the namefunc, call it, then encode the result. But what if the namefunc returns a string that's not in utf-8? Well, the default encoding is utf-8, so it should work. However, maybe the function is supposed to handle different encodings? But the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps the code is as simple as that.

So the code would be:

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    """Change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2."""
    return namefunc().encode('utf-8')

Wait, but in Python 2, the encode method is called on the string. So, the function would take the namefunc, call it, then encode the result. But what if namefunc returns a string that's already a bytestring? Then encode would raise an error. But the function is supposed to convert unicode to bytestrings, so perhaps the namefunc is expected to return a unicode string. So, the code is correct.

So the final code is as above. But I need to make sure that the function is correctly handling the conversion. Also, the docstring is provided, so the code should match that.

So the code is:

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    """
    Change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2.
    """
    return namefunc().encode('utf-8')

Yes, that seems right. The function takes a namefunc that returns a unicode string, encodes it to bytes using utf-8, and returns that.
