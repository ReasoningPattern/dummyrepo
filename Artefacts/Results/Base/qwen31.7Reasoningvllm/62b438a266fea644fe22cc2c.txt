Okay, I need to write the Python function make_parsers as described. The docstring says it builds a top-level parser and its subparsers and returns them as a tuple. 

First, I remember that in argparse, the top-level parser is created using argparse.ArgumentParser(). Then, subparsers are added using add_subparsers(). So the function should create a parser, add subparsers, and return them.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a tuple. So maybe the top-level parser and the subparsers are returned as a tuple. But how are they structured? The top-level parser is the main one, and the subparsers are added to it. So the function would create the main parser, add subparsers, and then return the main parser and the subparsers as a tuple.

Wait, but subparsers are part of the main parser. So maybe the function returns the main parser and the subparsers as a list? Or maybe the subparsers are stored in a separate structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function returns the main parser and the subparsers as a tuple. For example, the main parser is the first element, and the subparsers are the rest. But how to structure that.

Wait, let's think step by step. The function makes a top-level parser. So:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    # Maybe add some subparsers here?
    return (parser, subparsers)

But the docstring says "return them as a tuple". So the tuple would be (parser, subparsers). But subparsers is an argparse._SubParsersAction object. So the function returns the main parser and the subparsers.

But the user might want to have the subparsers as a separate object. However, the function is supposed to return them as a tuple. So the code would be:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return (parser, subparsers)

But wait, the function is supposed to build the top-level parser and its subparsers. So the code is correct. But maybe the subparsers are not used, but the function is just returning them. The user might not need to do anything with them, but the function is supposed to return them.

So the code would be as above. But perhaps the subparsers are not needed, but the function is supposed to create them. So the code is correct.

But maybe the function is supposed to return the subparsers as a list or something else. But the docstring says "return them as a tuple", so the tuple is (parser, subparsers).

Therefore, the code is:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return (parser, subparsers)

Yes, that should do it. The function creates the main parser, adds subparsers, and returns them as a tuple.
