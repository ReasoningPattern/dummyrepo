Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_option_spec and it's part of a class. The docstring says it gets the specification for a specified option name, and mentions that getting options for a command name can be done with self.get_parser_option_specs().

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions that the function is meant to get the specification for an option name, and that the options for a command can be retrieved using another method. So, the get_option_spec function probably retrieves the options for a specific command and argument.

But the function itself is just a method that returns something. The docstring doesn't specify what the return value is. Wait, the user hasn't provided the actual implementation, just the signature and docstring. So I need to generate the code for this method.

Looking at the parameters: the method takes self, command_name, and argument_name. The docstring says that it gets the specification for the specified option name, and that getting options of the given command_name can be done with self.get_parser_option_specs(). So maybe the get_option_spec is a helper method that retrieves the options for a specific command and argument.

But the function's purpose is to get the specification for the option name. So perhaps the function is part of a parser, like in argparse, where each command has options. The get_parser_option_specs() would return a list of options for a command, and get_option_spec would retrieve a specific option's specification.

But how to implement this? The function is supposed to return something. Since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation, I need to assume what the function is supposed to do. Maybe it's returning the options for the given command and argument.

Wait, the docstring says "Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()". So perhaps the get_option_spec is a method that retrieves the options for a specific command and argument. But the function is called get_option_spec, which takes command_name and argument_name. So maybe the function is supposed to return the specification for that particular option.

But without knowing the actual implementation, I need to make assumptions. Maybe the function is part of a parser, and the specification is stored in some data structure. For example, perhaps the class has a dictionary that maps command names to their options, and the get_option_spec method retrieves the specification for a specific option.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the options for the given command and argument. But the function's name suggests it's for a specific option.

Wait, the function's name is get_option_spec, which implies that it's getting the specification for a particular option. So perhaps the function is part of a parser that allows retrieving options for a command and an argument.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I need to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring. The function is a method in a class, so the code would be part of a class.

So, the code would be something like:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    # Logic to get the specification for the option
    # Maybe return a dictionary or some object representing the option specification
    # Assuming that the specification is stored in a data structure
    # For example, if the class has a dictionary called _options, then:
    # return self._options.get((command_name, argument_name), None)
    # But this is just a placeholder
    return {}

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation, I need to generate a code that fits the signature and docstring. The docstring says that it gets the specification for the specified option name, and that getting options for the command can be done with self.get_parser_option_specs(). So perhaps the get_option_spec is a helper method that retrieves the options for a specific command and argument.

But the function's parameters are command_name and argument_name. So maybe the function is supposed to return the specification for that particular option. However, without knowing the actual data structure, I can't write the exact code. But the user wants the code generated based on the given signature and docstring.

So, the code would be a method that returns something, perhaps a dictionary or an object. The exact implementation would depend on the class's internal structure, but since the user hasn't provided that, I can't know. However, the user wants the code generated, so I'll have to write a placeholder that fits the signature and docstring.

Another possibility is that the function is part of a parser, and the specification is stored in a parser object. For example, in argparse, each command has options, and the parser can be used to get the options. But again, without knowing the actual implementation, it's hard to say.

In the absence of more information, the best approach is to write a method that returns a dictionary or some object representing the option specification. So the code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    # Assume that the specification is stored in a dictionary
    # For example, self._options is a dictionary mapping command names to their options
    # Each option is stored as a dictionary with 'name', 'type', 'help', etc.
    # So, return the specification for the given command and argument
    # But since the actual data structure is not provided, this is a placeholder
    return {}

But the user might expect that the function actually retrieves the options for the command and argument. However, the function's name suggests it's for a specific option. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the specification for a specific option, not the entire command's options.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a parser and the get_parser_option_specs() method returns all options for a command, and get_option_spec() is a way to get a specific option. But again, without knowing the actual implementation, it's hard to say.

In any case, the code must be generated based on the given signature and docstring. So the code would be a method that returns something, possibly a dictionary or an object. The exact implementation is up to the user, but the code must follow the signature.

Therefore, the generated code would be a method that returns a dictionary or similar structure, perhaps with the command and argument name as keys, and the specification as the value. But since the user hasn't provided the actual data structure, the code will be a placeholder.
