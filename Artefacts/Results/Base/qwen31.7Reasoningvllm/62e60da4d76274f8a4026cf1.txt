Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature. The function is called values and takes a variable number of keys. The docstring says it returns the keys filtered by self.index in the form of a list.

First, I should figure out what the self.index refers to. Since it's part of the class method, self.index is probably an attribute of the class instance. So, the function is filtering the keys based on the value of self.index.

The function is supposed to return a list of the keys that meet the condition of being equal to self.index. Wait, the docstring says "key filtered by self.index in the form of a list." So maybe it's filtering the keys where each key equals self.index. But the function is named values, which is a bit confusing. Usually, values might refer to the values of a dictionary, but here it's about filtering keys.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of keys that are equal to self.index. So, for example, if self.index is 5, then the list would contain all keys that are 5. But the function is called values, which is a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo, but I have to go with the given signature.

So the function takes *keys, which are the keys to filter. Wait, no. The function is called values, and the parameters are *keys. So the function is supposed to take a variable number of keys, and return those that are equal to self.index, as a list.

So the code would be something like:

def values(self, *keys):
    return [k for k in keys if k == self.index]

But wait, the docstring says "key filtered by self.index in the form of a list." So maybe the keys are the ones to filter, and self.index is the criterion. So the function returns a list of keys that are equal to self.index.

But the function is named values, which is a bit confusing. Maybe the actual purpose is to return the values, but the name is wrong. But according to the problem statement, I have to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring.

So the code would be:

def values(self, *keys):
    """
    Returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list.
    """
    return [k for k in keys if k == self.index]

But wait, the docstring says "key filtered by self.index", which could mean that the keys are filtered based on self.index. So if self.index is 5, then the list would contain keys that are 5. But the function is named values, which is a bit odd. Maybe the actual intention is to return the values, but the name is wrong. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, so I have to follow that.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to return the keys that are equal to self.index, but the parameters are the keys to filter. Wait, the function is called values, and the parameters are *keys. So perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of keys and return those that are equal to self.index. But the parameters are *keys, which is a variable number of arguments. So the function would take any number of keys and return those that are equal to self.index.

So the code would be as I wrote before.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check.

Yes, the code would filter the keys passed to the function (as *keys) and return those that are equal to self.index. So the list comprehension [k for k in keys if k == self.index] would do that.

So the code is as above. The docstring is as given.

Therefore, the generated code is:

def values(self, *keys):
	"""
	Returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list.
	"""
	return [k for k in keys if k == self.index]

But the user said to output only the code, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written with the function definition and the docstring.

Wait, the user said "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be in Python, with the function definition and the docstring.

So the final code is as above.
