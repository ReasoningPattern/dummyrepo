Okay, I need to generate the Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is called get, and it's a method of a class. The parameters are key and default, which is optional. The docstring says that if the key exists in the class, return its value; otherwise, return default.

First, I need to figure out how to implement this. In Python, classes can have dictionaries as attributes. So maybe the class has a dictionary that's stored as an attribute. For example, the class might have a __dict__ attribute that's a dictionary.

So the get method would check if the key is in the class's dictionary. If it is, return the value; else, return default.

Wait, but how is the class structured? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that the class has a dictionary as an attribute. So the code would look something like:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}

    def get(self, key, default=None):
        return self._data.get(key, default)

But the user's function signature is def get(self, key, default=None):. So the method is part of a class. The docstring says that if the key exists in the class, return the value; else, default.

Wait, but the class's __dict__ is a dictionary. So the method would check if the key is in the class's dictionary. But in Python, if you have a class with a dictionary as an attribute, then the key exists in the class's dictionary.

So the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    return self.__dict__.get(key, default)

But wait, the docstring says "If a key exists in the class", but in Python, the class's __dict__ is a dictionary. So if the key is in the class's __dict__, then return the value. So the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    return self.__dict__.get(key, default)

But the user's function signature is def get(self, key, default=None):. So the code would be as above.

But maybe the class has a different structure. For example, maybe the class has a dictionary called _data. But since the problem doesn't specify, the safest approach is to assume that the class has a __dict__ attribute which is a dictionary.

So the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    return self.__dict__.get(key, default)

But the user's docstring says "If a key exists in the class", which could be interpreted as the class's __dict__ having the key. So that's correct.

So the code is straightforward. The method checks if the key is in the class's dictionary and returns the value or default.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
