Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_hierarchy function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called validate_hierarchy and takes three parameters: validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings. The docstring says it validates the storage root hierarchy and returns the number of objects checked and how many were valid.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the code. Since it's a method in a class, I'll assume it's part of a class like a StorageManager or something similar. The function is supposed to validate objects and check digests, and possibly show warnings.

The return values are num_objects and good_objects. So the function needs to track how many objects are checked and how many are valid.

Let me think about the steps involved. The function probably loops through each object in the hierarchy, checks if it's valid, and accumulates the counts. But since the parameters are optional, I need to handle them.

Wait, the parameters are optional. The default values are validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False. So in the code, if they're not provided, they use the defaults.

But the function's docstring mentions that it returns the number of objects checked and good ones. So the code needs to track these counts.

I need to create variables to keep track of num_objects and good_objects. Initialize them to 0. Then, for each object in the hierarchy, increment these counters. Then, check if the object is valid. If it is, increment good_objects.

But how does the hierarchy work? Maybe the function is supposed to iterate over a list of objects, or perhaps it's part of a larger structure. Since the function is part of a class, maybe the hierarchy is stored in some data structure, like a list or a tree.

But the problem is that the code isn't provided, so I have to make assumptions. The function is supposed to validate the hierarchy, so perhaps it's checking each object in the hierarchy, and for each, checking if it's valid.

So, the code would look something like:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Assume there's a way to get the hierarchy objects
    for obj in self.hierarchy:
        num_objects += 1
        # Check if the object is valid
        if self.validate_object(obj, validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings):
            good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But wait, the function's parameters are passed as arguments. The validate_object method would need to be called with those parameters. However, the function's parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings. So the code would need to pass those to the validate_object method.

But the problem is that the function's parameters are not directly used in the code. The parameters are passed to the function, but the code inside the function needs to use them. For example, the validate_object method might use validate_objects and check_digests.

But since the code is not provided, I have to make assumptions. The function's parameters are used to determine whether to validate the objects and check digests. So, in the code, when checking each object, the validate_object method would use those parameters.

But how is the validate_object method structured? It's not provided, so I have to assume it's a helper method that checks if an object is valid. For example, it might check the digest, and if validate_objects is True, it checks the object's validity.

But since the code is not given, I have to write the function as per the given parameters and the docstring.

So, the code would look like:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Assume self.hierarchy is a list of objects to validate
    for obj in self.hierarchy:
        num_objects += 1
        # Check if the object is valid
        if self.validate_object(obj, validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings):
            good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But wait, the parameters validate_objects and check_digests are passed to the validate_object method. So the validate_object method would need to take those parameters. However, since the code isn't provided, I have to assume that the validate_object method is implemented elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the validate_object method is part of the class, and the code is supposed to call it with the parameters.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual code, so I have to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring.

Another point: the function returns num_objects and good_objects. So the code must return these two values.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self.hierarchy:
        num_objects += 1
        if self.validate_object(obj, validate_objects, check_digests, show_warnings):
            good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But I need to make sure that the validate_object method is called with the correct parameters. However, since the function's parameters are passed to the validate_object, the code would need to have that method.

But since the user hasn't provided the validate_object method, I can't know its implementation. So the code would assume that the validate_object method is available and is called with the parameters.

Therefore, the code is as above. But the user wants the code generated, so I need to write it in Python, using the given parameters and the docstring.

Wait, the docstring says that the function returns num_objects and good_objects. So the code must return those two values.

So the code is as written. But I need to make sure that the parameters are handled correctly. For example, if validate_objects is False, then maybe the object is not validated. But the code as written would check if the object is valid, which depends on the validate_object method.

But since the code is not provided, I have to proceed with the assumption that the validate_object method is implemented correctly.

Therefore, the final code is as written.
