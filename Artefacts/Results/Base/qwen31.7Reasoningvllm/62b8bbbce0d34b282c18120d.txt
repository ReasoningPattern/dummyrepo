Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_file_exist that checks if a given file name exists. Let me think about how to do this.

First, the function should take a file_name parameter. The goal is to determine if that file exists. In Python, I can use the os module's exists() function for this. Wait, but sometimes people use the os.path module too. Oh right, os.path.exists() is the correct way.

So the function will import os, but wait, the docstring says nothing about importing. The function itself doesn't need to import anything, but maybe it's better to include it. Wait, the function is supposed to be self-contained. So the code should include the import statement inside the function? No, that's not right. The function can't import modules inside itself. So the function should use os.path.exists or os.exists.

Wait, os.exists is available in Python 3.3 and above. But maybe it's better to use os.path.exists. Let me check. Yes, os.path.exists is the correct function here. So the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.exists(file_name)

But wait, the function is supposed to return a boolean. That's exactly what os.path.exists returns. So that's straightforward.

Wait, but what if the file name is not a valid file? Like, if it's a directory or something. The function should still return True if the path exists, regardless of whether it's a file or directory. So the function is correct.

So the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.exists(file_name)

But the user didn't mention importing os, but the function uses it. So the code must include the import. However, in Python, you can't have an import inside a function. So the code would need to have the import statement outside the function.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the import. So the correct code is:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.exists(file_name)

Yes, that's right. The function returns True if the file exists, False otherwise. The docstring is as given.

So the final code is as above.
