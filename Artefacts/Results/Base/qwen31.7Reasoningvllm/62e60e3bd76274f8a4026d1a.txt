Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the 'from_raw_values' class method. Let me look at the function signature and docstring.

The function is a class method, so it should be defined as def from_raw_values(cls, values). The docstring says it creates a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values. 

First, I need to figure out what the Bookmarks class looks like. Since the method is part of the Bookmarks class, the code will be inside that class. But the user hasn't provided the Bookmarks class definition, so I have to assume that the Bookmarks class has some attributes or methods that need to be accessed.

The function takes 'values' as a parameter, which is a list of string values. The goal is to create an instance of Bookmarks using these values. 

Wait, the docstring mentions "raw bookmark string values". So maybe each element in the 'values' list is a string that represents a bookmark. But how does that translate into the Bookmarks object's attributes?

Assuming that the Bookmarks class has a constructor that takes a list of strings, or perhaps some other parameters. But since the user hasn't provided the Bookmarks class, I need to make an assumption here.

In Python, when you create a class method, you can't directly instantiate the class inside the method. So the method would need to create an instance of the Bookmarks class. But without knowing the exact structure of the Bookmarks class, I have to make some assumptions.

Perhaps the Bookmarks class has a constructor that takes a list of strings, and the method 'from_raw_values' is supposed to initialize that list. So the code would be something like:

class Bookmarks:
    def __init__(self, values):
        self.values = values

Then, the class method would be:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    return cls(values)

But wait, the docstring says "Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values." So the method is supposed to create an instance of Bookmarks using the provided values.

But without knowing the exact structure of Bookmarks, I have to proceed with the most straightforward approach. Assuming that the Bookmarks class has a constructor that takes a list of strings, then the method would create an instance with that list.

So the code would be:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    return cls(values)

But maybe the Bookmarks class has some other attributes or methods. However, since the user hasn't provided that, this is the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class has a __init__ method that takes the values as a parameter. So the method would create an instance of Bookmarks with those values.

But since the user hasn't provided the Bookmarks class, I have to proceed with the assumption that the method is supposed to create an instance of the Bookmarks class using the provided values.

Therefore, the code would be:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    """
    Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
    """
    return cls(values)

But wait, in Python, when you use a class method, you need to use the class name. So the method would be:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    return cls(values)

But perhaps the Bookmarks class has a constructor that takes the values as a parameter. So the method would create an instance of Bookmarks with those values.

So the code is as above. The user probably expects that the method returns a new Bookmarks instance created with the given values.

Therefore, the code is straightforward. The function returns cls(values), which creates a new instance of the Bookmarks class with the values passed in.
