Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_deprecated_args based on the provided docstring. Let me start by understanding the function's purpose.

The docstring says that the function returns a dict with options that deprecate others. The comment mentions that the options are from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs(). So, the function is supposed to iterate over some option specs and collect the deprecated arguments.

First, I need to figure out how to implement this. The function is part of a class, so it's probably a method. The function returns a dictionary, which is the main output.

The key part is iterating over the option specs. Assuming that self.spec_helper is an instance of some class that has an iterate_option_specs method, which returns a generator or iterable of option specs. Then, for each option in that iterable, we need to collect the deprecated arguments.

But the problem is, the function is supposed to return a dict where the keys are the deprecated arguments and the values are the options that they deprecate. Wait, the docstring says "options which deprecate others." So maybe each option in the iterate_option_specs is a deprecated argument, and the dict maps those arguments to the options they deprecate.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to collect all the deprecated arguments and their corresponding options. For example, if an option is deprecated, then the dict might have the deprecated argument as the key, and the value is the option that it deprecates.

But the exact logic isn't clear. However, the function's purpose is to return a dict with these options. So the code would need to iterate through the option specs, collect the deprecated arguments, and build the dict.

Assuming that each option spec has some attributes, maybe the deprecated arguments are stored in a certain attribute. But since the problem doesn't provide specific details, I need to make assumptions.

Perhaps the function is supposed to collect all the deprecated arguments from the option specs and store them in a dictionary. For example, if each option has a deprecated argument, then the dict would map those arguments to the options they deprecate.

But without knowing the exact structure of the option specs, I'll have to make a general approach. Let's assume that each option in iterate_option_specs is a dictionary with a 'deprecated' key, and the value is the argument name. Then, the function would collect those arguments and build the dict.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to collect all the deprecated arguments and their corresponding options. For example, if an option is deprecated, then the dict has the argument as the key, and the value is the option that it deprecates.

But since the problem doesn't provide specifics, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function needs to iterate over the option specs, collect the deprecated arguments, and return a dictionary where each key is the deprecated argument and the value is the option that it deprecates.

So, the code would look something like this:

def get_deprecated_args(self):
    deprecated_args = {}
    for option in self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs():
        # Assume each option has a 'deprecated' key with the argument name
        if 'deprecated' in option:
            arg_name = option['deprecated']
            deprecated_args[arg_name] = option
    return deprecated_args

But since the problem says "options which deprecate others", maybe the dict maps the deprecated arguments to the options they deprecate. So, if an option is deprecated, then the dict has the argument as the key, and the value is the option that it deprecates.

But without knowing the exact structure, this is just a guess. However, the function's docstring says "returning dict with options which deprecate others." So the dict's keys are the options that are deprecated, and the values are the others they deprecate. But that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the dict maps the deprecated arguments to the options that they deprecate. For example, if an argument 'arg1' is deprecated, then the dict has 'arg1' as the key, and the value is the option that 'arg1' deprecates.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, I'll proceed with the code that iterates over the option specs, collects the deprecated arguments, and returns a dictionary where each key is the deprecated argument and the value is the option.

So the code would be:

def get_deprecated_args(self):
    """
    Return a dict with options which deprecate others. Options are from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs().
    """
    deprecated_args = {}
    for option in self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs():
        # Assuming each option has a 'deprecated' key with the argument name
        if 'deprecated' in option:
            arg_name = option['deprecated']
            deprecated_args[arg_name] = option
    return deprecated_args

But the problem says "options which deprecate others". So maybe the dict maps the options to the arguments they deprecate. But that's not clear. However, the function's docstring says "returning dict with options which deprecate others. options from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs()".

So the function returns a dict where the keys are the options that are deprecated, and the values are the arguments they deprecate. But that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, the keys are the arguments, and the values are the options they deprecate.

But given the ambiguity, the code I wrote earlier is the most logical approach. So I'll proceed with that.
