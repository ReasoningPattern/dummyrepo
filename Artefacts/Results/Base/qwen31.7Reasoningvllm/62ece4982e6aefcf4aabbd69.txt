Okay, I need to write a Python function called _replace_register that takes three parameters: flow_params, register_number, and register_value. The docstring says that it replaces the value of flow_params at register_number with the value at register_value and then deletes the entry at register_value.

First, I should check if the register_number is a valid index in flow_params. But the function doesn't seem to handle that, so maybe it's assumed that the register_number is valid. So I don't need to add error checking here.

The function needs to replace flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value]. But wait, if register_value is a key in flow_params, then after replacing, we need to delete that key.

So the steps are:

1. Replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value.
2. Remove the entry at register_value from flow_params.

But how to do that in Python. Let's think.

Assuming flow_params is a dictionary. So, for example, if flow_params is {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, and register_number is 'a', register_value is 'b', then after replacing, flow_params should have {'b': 2} (since the value of 'a' is replaced with 2, and then 'b' is removed.

Wait, no. Wait, the original flow_params has flow_params[register_number], which is the current value. So, if register_number is a key in flow_params, then we take flow_params[register_number], and replace it with flow_params[register_value]. Then, we need to delete the register_value key.

But wait, what if register_value is not a key in flow_params? Then, we just replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, but since register_value isn't a key, we don't delete it. But the docstring says to delete flow_params[register_value], so maybe the function is supposed to delete it regardless.

Wait, the docstring says: "delete flow_params[register_value]". So even if register_value is not a key in flow_params, we need to delete it. But that would be an error. So perhaps the function is supposed to assume that register_value is a key in flow_params.

But the function is supposed to handle that. So maybe the function is written such that register_value is a key in flow_params.

So the steps are:

- Check if register_number is a key in flow_params. If not, maybe raise an error? But the function doesn't have that, so perhaps it's assumed.

So, the code would be:

flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, what if register_value is not a key? Then, del flow_params[register_value] would throw a KeyError. But the function's docstring says to delete it, so perhaps the function is supposed to handle that. But maybe the function is supposed to assume that register_value is a key.

So, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    # Replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value
    # Then delete the register_value key
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, what if register_value is not a key? Then, del flow_params[register_value] would throw an error. But the function's docstring says to delete it, so maybe the function is supposed to handle that. However, in Python, if you try to delete a key that doesn't exist, it raises KeyError. So perhaps the function is supposed to assume that register_value is a key.

So the code as written would work if register_value is a key. But if not, it would throw an error. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps the function is written as such.

So the code is as above. But wait, the function is called _replace_register, which is a method, perhaps in a class. But the parameters are flow_params, which is a dictionary. So the code is as written.

So the final code is:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, what if register_number is not a key in flow_params? Then, flow_params[register_number] would raise a KeyError. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that. So perhaps the function is supposed to assume that register_number is a key.

So the code is as written.
