Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document based on the provided docstring. Let me start by understanding the function signature and the docstring.

The function is supposed to take a URL and an optional document_path. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary with url and document_path. So the goal is to create a dictionary that includes these two parameters, possibly with some formatting.

First, I'll check the parameters. The function has a required parameter url and an optional document_path. The docstring mentions that the returned dictionary includes these two. So the function should return a dictionary where the keys are 'url' and 'document_path', and the values are the respective parameters.

Wait, but the docstring says "including information such as url and document_path." So maybe the dictionary should have those keys. The function is probably supposed to return a dictionary with those keys, but the parameters are passed in. So the function would just return a dictionary with the given url and document_path.

But wait, maybe the function is supposed to do some processing. However, the docstring doesn't mention any processing, just returning the parameters. So the code is straightforward.

So the function would take url and document_path (optional), then return a dictionary with those keys. So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {'url': url, 'document_path': document_path}

But wait, the docstring says "returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path." The word "formatted" is a bit ambiguous. Does that mean the keys are in a certain format, or that the values are formatted in some way? Since the parameters are passed as url and document_path, maybe the formatting is just the keys. But the function is simple, so perhaps the code is as above.

I should check if the parameters are correctly handled. The document_path is optional, so in the return statement, it's included as a key with the default value. But in Python, if you don't specify a default, the parameter is required. Wait, the function's parameters are url (required) and document_path (optional). So in the return statement, document_path is optional. But in the return, if it's not provided, it would be None. However, the docstring says the dictionary includes document_path, so perhaps the function is supposed to include it even if it's None. But the docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the code just returns the parameters as is.

So the code is as simple as returning a dictionary with the two keys. Therefore, the code is:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {'url': url, 'document_path': document_path}

That's the code. I don't see any other processing needed. The function is just returning the parameters in a dictionary. So that's the answer.
