Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called plugins_manager and it's a class method. The docstring says it gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service().

Hmm, so the task is to implement this method. Let me think about how to approach this. The function is a class method, so it should be defined as def plugins_manager(cls):. The docstring mentions that it's getting the plugin manager using the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER, which I assume is a constant or a module-level variable.

Wait, the docstring says "via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So the plugin manager is obtained by calling cls._get_service() and then accessing the PLUGINS_MANAGER attribute of that service.

So the code would look something like this: return cls._get_service().PLUGINS_MANAGER. But I need to make sure that _get_service() is a method of the class. Since it's a class method, the caller would call it on the class.

Wait, the function is a class method, so the code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service().PLUGINS_MANAGER

But I need to make sure that _get_service() is a method of the class. The docstring says that it's called via cls._get_service(), so the method must exist.

So the code is straightforward. The function returns the PLUGINS_MANAGER attribute of the service obtained by calling _get_service() on the class.

I should check if there are any other considerations. Like, maybe the _get_service() method returns a service object, and PLUGINS_MANAGER is an attribute of that service. So the code is correct as is.

Therefore, the generated code is just the function definition with the return statement as described.
