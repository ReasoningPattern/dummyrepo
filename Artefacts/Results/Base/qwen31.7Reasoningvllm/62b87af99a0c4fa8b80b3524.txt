Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_run_el that checks if an object's class has a run method. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is supposed to take an object 'obj' as input. The docstring says it checks if the obj class has the run method. So, the goal is to determine if the class of 'obj' has a method named 'run'.

In Python, you can check if a method exists in a class using the hasattr() function. But wait, hasattr checks if the object has the attribute, not the method. Wait, no, actually, hasattr checks if the object has an attribute, which can be a method. So, if the class has a run method, then the object's class would have that method. So, maybe using hasattr(cls, 'run') where cls is the class of obj.

But wait, the function is called is_run_el, and it's supposed to return True or False. So, the function would check if the class of 'obj' has a method named 'run'.

So the code would be something like:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(type(obj), 'run')

Wait, but type(obj) gets the class of the object. So, if the object is an instance of a class that has a run method, then type(obj) would have the run method. So, yes, using hasattr(type(obj), 'run') would return True if the class has the run method.

But wait, what if the object is a function? Then type(obj) is function, and if the function has a run method, then it would return True. But the function's class might not have a run method. Hmm, but the function's class is the class of the function, so yes.

So the code would be:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(type(obj), 'run')

But wait, maybe the user wants to check if the method exists, not just the attribute. But in Python, hasattr checks for attributes, including methods. So, yes, this should work.

So the code is straightforward. The function returns True if the class of the object has a run method, else False.
