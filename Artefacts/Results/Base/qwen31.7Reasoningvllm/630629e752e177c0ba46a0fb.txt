Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the send_document function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the function parameters and the docstring.

The function is called send_document and takes url, data, timeout, method, and then *args and **kwargs. The docstring says it sends a response with data using the POST method. 

First, I need to figure out how to implement the sending of the data. Since the method is POST, I'll need to use the requests library. But wait, the user didn't mention using requests, so maybe I should use the built-in requests library. However, the user might expect that the code uses requests, but the problem says not to include any explanation, so I have to proceed.

Wait, the function is supposed to be a Python function. So, I need to include the necessary imports. But the user didn't mention any imports, so maybe the code will include the necessary imports. But in the code, I need to make sure that the function uses the requests library. Let me check the parameters.

The function has parameters url, data, timeout, method, and then *args and **kwargs. The method is set to "post" by default. So, the function will send a POST request with the data.

So, the code will need to make a POST request to the url, with the data as the payload. The timeout is set to 10 seconds. The function will use the requests library.

So, the code structure would be:

Import requests.

Define the function send_document with the parameters. Inside the function, use requests.post with the url, data, timeout, and method. Then return the response.

But wait, the data parameter is passed as a parameter. So, the function will send the data as the JSON payload, or as form data? The docstring says "data" is the data to send, but the method is POST. So, the data is sent as the payload. However, the way to send data depends on the content type. If the data is a dictionary, it's usually sent as JSON, but if it's form data, it's sent as form data.

But the function's parameters don't specify the type of data. So, perhaps the function assumes that data is a dictionary, and it's sent as JSON. Alternatively, maybe the data is sent as form data. But since the method is POST, the function needs to send the data in the request body.

In the absence of specific instructions, the function will send the data as JSON, using the requests library's post method. So, the code would be:

import requests

def send_document(url, data, timeout=10, method="post", *args, **kwargs):
    response = requests.post(url, data=data, timeout=timeout, method=method, *args, **kwargs)
    return response

But wait, the method parameter is set to "post" by default. So, the function will use that. However, the *args and **kwargs are passed along. But in the function definition, the method is set to "post", so the *args and **kwargs are passed as they are. But the function is supposed to use the method parameter. Wait, the function's parameters include method as a parameter, but the default is "post". So, the function will use that.

But the code needs to handle the *args and **kwargs. However, the function is supposed to send the data via POST. So, the code would include the *args and **kwargs in the request.

But the problem is that the function's parameters include *args and **kwargs, which are passed as additional arguments. However, in the function's code, they are passed along. But the function is supposed to send the data via POST. So, the code would include them in the request.

But perhaps the function is supposed to use the *args and **kwargs as additional parameters. However, in the case of requests, the *args and **kwargs are passed to the underlying requests library. So, the code would include them.

But the function's docstring says "Send a response containing data through the POST method." So, the function is supposed to send the data, and the rest of the parameters are passed along.

So, the code would be:

import requests

def send_document(url, data, timeout=10, method="post", *args, **kwargs):
    response = requests.post(url, data=data, timeout=timeout, method=method, *args, **kwargs)
    return response

But wait, the method is set to "post" by default. So, the function will use that. However, the *args and **kwargs are passed along. So, the code includes them.

But the user's function signature has *args and **kwargs as parameters. So, the code must include them. However, in the function, the *args and **kwargs are passed to the requests.post call. So, the code is correct.

But perhaps the function is supposed to use the method parameter, which is set to "post", and the *args and **kwargs are passed as additional parameters. So, the code is correct.

But the problem is that the function's parameters include *args and **kwargs, which are not used in the function's logic. However, the function is supposed to send the data via POST, and the rest of the parameters are passed along. So, the code includes them.

So, the final code would be as above.

But I need to make sure that the function uses the requests library. So, the code includes the import statement.

But the user didn't mention any imports, but the function uses requests, so the code must include the import.

So, the code would be:

import requests

def send_document(url, data, timeout=10, method="post", *args, **kwargs):
    response = requests.post(url, data=data, timeout=timeout, method=method, *args, **kwargs)
    return response

But wait, the method is set to "post" by default. So, the function uses that. The *args and **kwargs are passed along. So, the code is correct.

But perhaps the function is supposed to use the method parameter, which is set to "post", and the *args and **kwargs are passed as additional parameters. So, the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
