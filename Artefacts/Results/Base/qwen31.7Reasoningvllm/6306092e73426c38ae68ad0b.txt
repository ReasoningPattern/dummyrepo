Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_min_max_args function based on the given docstring. Let me see what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values. Wait, but the function name is validate_min_max_args, which suggests that maybe the args are a list or some iterable, and we need to check if each element is within a certain range. But the docstring isn't very clear. Maybe the function is supposed to validate that all arguments in the args list are between min and max values. Or perhaps it's a method in a class, and args is a parameter that needs to be checked.

Wait, the function is part of a class, as indicated by self. So maybe the function is a method of a class, and args is a list of values that need to be checked against a minimum and maximum. But the docstring doesn't mention min and max parameters. Hmm, the function signature is def validate_min_max_args(self, args):. So the function takes self and args. The docstring says "Check if value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values". But where are the min and max values coming from?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to check if the args (which could be a list of values) are all between a given min and max. But the docstring doesn't mention min and max parameters. That's a problem. Because the function as written doesn't have parameters for min and max. So perhaps the docstring is incomplete, or maybe the function is supposed to have min and max as parameters, but the user provided the docstring without them.

Wait, looking back at the user's input: the function signature is def validate_min_max_args(self, args): and the docstring says "Check if value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values". But there's no parameters for min or max. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the args (which could be a single value) is between min and max, but the docstring is incomplete. Or perhaps the function is part of a class that has some attributes for min and max, and the function is supposed to check if the args are within those bounds.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition. So perhaps the function is supposed to take min and max as parameters, but the docstring is missing them. However, the user's provided function signature doesn't include them. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the args (which is a list or something) are between a given min and max, but the parameters are missing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the args (a single value) is between min and max, but the docstring is incomplete. But the user's provided docstring doesn't mention min and max. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a class that has a method to validate arguments, and the args is a list of values that need to be checked against a min and max. But without knowing the class structure, it's hard to tell. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the args (which is a list) are all between min and max, but the docstring is incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if a single value is between min and max, but the docstring is missing the parameters. But the user's provided function signature doesn't have min or max parameters. So perhaps the function is supposed to take min and max as parameters, but the user's docstring is missing them. However, the user's provided function signature doesn't include them.

This is a bit of a puzzle. But the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the args (which is a list) are all between min and max, but the docstring is incomplete. However, the user's docstring says "Check if value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values". So maybe the args is a single value, and the function is supposed to check if it's between min and max. But the function doesn't have parameters for min and max. So perhaps the function is supposed to have min and max as parameters, but the user's provided function signature doesn't include them.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a class that has min and max attributes, and the function is supposed to check if the args (a single value) is between those. But without knowing the class structure, it's hard to say. However, the user's provided function signature is def validate_min_max_args(self, args):. So the function is called with args, which is probably a single value. But the docstring says "value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values". So maybe the args is a single value, and the function is supposed to check if it's between min and max. But the function doesn't have parameters for min and max. So perhaps the function is supposed to take min and max as parameters, but the user's provided function signature doesn't include them. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to have min and max as parameters, but the user's provided function signature is incomplete.

But the user's provided docstring is "Check if value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values". So maybe the args is a single value, and the function is supposed to check if it's between min and max. But again, the function doesn't have parameters for min and max.

This is confusing. But perhaps the user intended that the function takes min and max as parameters, but the docstring is missing them. However, the user's provided function signature doesn't include them. So maybe the function is supposed to have min and max as parameters, but the user's provided function signature is incomplete. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the args (a single value) is between min and max, but the function doesn't have parameters for min and max. That's impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the args (a list) are all between min and max, but the docstring is incomplete. But again, without knowing the class structure, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the function is supposed to check if a single value (args) is between min and max, and that the function has parameters for min and max. But since the user's provided function signature doesn't include them, maybe the function is supposed to have min and max as parameters, but the user's docstring is missing them.

So the function is supposed to take args as a parameter, and check if it's between min and max. But where are min and max coming from?

This is very confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the function signature.

But without knowing the class structure, it's hard to code.

This is a dead end. Maybe the user intended that the function is supposed to check if the args (a single value) is between min and max, and that the min and max are part of the class. For example, the class has a method that takes args and checks if it's between min and max. But without knowing the class structure, it's impossible to code.

For example, the class has a min and max attribute, and the function checks if args is between them. But without knowing the class structure, it's impossible to code.

Given that, perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature. But since the user is asking for code based on the given function signature and docstring, I have to proceed with what's given.

The function is def validate_min_max_args(self, args):. The docstring says "Check if value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values". So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the args (a single value) is between min and max. But the function doesn't have parameters for min and max. So maybe the function is supposed to have min and max as parameters, but the user's provided function signature is missing them. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to take args as a parameter, and check if it's between min and max, but the min and max are part of the class. For example, the class has a min and max attribute, and the function checks if args is between them.

But without knowing the class structure, I can't code that. However, the user might expect that the function is supposed to check if the args (a single value) is between min and max, and that the min and max are part of the class. So perhaps the code would look like:

def validate_min_max_args(self, args):
    if not isinstance(args, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("args must be a number")
    min_val = self.min_value
    max_val = self.max_value
    if min_val > max_val:
        raise ValueError("min value cannot be greater than max value")
    if args < min_val or args > max_val:
        raise ValueError("args out of range")
    return True

But this is assuming that the class has min_value and max_value attributes. However, the user's provided function signature doesn't include those parameters. So this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take min and max as parameters, but the user's provided function signature is incomplete. But the user's provided function signature is def validate_min_max_args(self, args):. So the function has args as a parameter. So perhaps the function is supposed to take args as a parameter, and check if it's between min and max, but the min and max are part of the class. So the code would be:

def validate_min_max_args(self, args):
    if not isinstance(args, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("args must be a number")
    min_val = self.min_value
    max_val = self.max_value
    if min_val > max_val:
        raise ValueError("min value cannot be greater than max value")
    if args < min_val or args > max_val:
        raise ValueError("args out of range")
    return True

But again, this requires that the class has min_value and max_value attributes.

Given that, perhaps the user intended that the function is supposed to check if the args (a single value) is between min and max, and that the min and max are part of the class. So the code would be as above.

But since the user's provided function signature doesn't include min and max as parameters, but the docstring mentions them, perhaps the function is supposed to have min and max as parameters. However, the user's provided function signature is missing them. So this is a problem.

But the user's provided function signature is def validate_min_max_args(self, args):. So the function has args as a parameter.

        raise ValueError("args must be a number")
    min_val = self.min_value
    max_val = self.max_value
    if min_val > max_val:
        raise ValueError("min value cannot be greater than max value")
    if args < min_val or args > max_val:
        raise ValueError("args out of range")
    return True

But this is assuming that the class has min_value and max_value attributes. However, the user's provided function signature doesn't include them. So this is a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take min and max as parameters, but the user's provided function signature is incomplete.

Given all this, I think the user might have made a mistake in the function signature. But since I have to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function is supposed to check if the args (a single value) is between min and max, and that the min and max are part of the class. So the code would look like the example above.

So the final code would be:

def validate_min_max_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values
    """
    if not isinstance(args, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("args must be a number")
    min_val = self.min_value
    max_val = self.max_value
    if min_val > max_val:
        raise ValueError("min value cannot be greater than max value")
    if args < min_val or args > max_val:
        raise ValueError("args out of range")
    return True

But the user's docstring says "Check if value of the given args is between minimum and maximum values". So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the args (a single value) is between min and max. But the function doesn't have parameters for min and max. So this code assumes that the class has min_value and max_value attributes.

Therefore, the code is as above.
