Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get, and it's an instance method because it has a self parameter. The function takes two arguments: key and default, with default having a default value of None.

The docstring explains that if the key exists in the class, the corresponding value is returned. Otherwise, it returns the default value. So, I need to think about how to check if the key exists in the class.

Wait, in Python, to check if a key exists in a class, I can use the __dict__ attribute, which is a dictionary containing the namespace of the class. So, I can access self.__dict__ and check if the key is a key in that dictionary.

So the code inside the function should be something like: return self.__dict__.get(key, default). That way, if the key exists, it returns the value, else it returns the default.

I should make sure that the function is correctly indented and that it's part of a class. Since the user didn't specify the class name, I'll just write it as a standalone method within a class.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: define the method, access self.__dict__, use get with the key and default, and return the result.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
