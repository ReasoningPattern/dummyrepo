Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called process_text_links and it's supposed to process text to linkify textual links. 

First, I'll think about what the function needs to do. The docstring says it adds attributes and linkifies textual links. So, I should probably split the text into words and look for words that are likely to be nouns or nouns with adjectives, which can function as link candidates.

I'll need to create a list of possible link words, like "click", "visit", "go", etc. Then, for each word in the text, I'll check if it's a link word. If it is, I'll look at the preceding noun to see if it's part of the same chunk. If both are present, I'll create a Link object with the start and end indices of the chunk.

I should also handle cases where the link word is followed by a period or another punctuation. Maybe I'll split the text into tokens, considering punctuation as separate tokens to avoid issues.

I'll need to import re for regular expressions to split the text into words and punctuation. Also, I'll define a Link class with __init__ and __str__ methods so it can be used and represented properly.

Putting it all together, the function will process each token, check for link words, find the noun phrases, and create Link objects accordingly. Finally, it will return a string that includes these links highlighted in the original text.

I should make sure the code is clean and efficient, handling edge cases like multiple link words or overlapping chunks. Testing with sample text might help ensure it works as expected, but since the user didn't ask for testing, I'll focus on the code structure based on the given requirements.
