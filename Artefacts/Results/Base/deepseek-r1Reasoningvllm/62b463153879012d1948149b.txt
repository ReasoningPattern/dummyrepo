Okay, I need to write a Python function called match_file_by_prefix. The function takes two arguments: prefix and file_path. The docstring explains that the function should return True if the basename of the file_path starts with either prefix plus a "-" or prefix plus a ".". 

First, I should think about how to get the basename of the file. In Python, the os module has a function called basename which returns the filename from a path. So I'll need to import os.

Next, I need to check if the basename starts with either prefix + "-" or prefix + ".". I can use the startswith() method for strings. But wait, what if the prefix ends with a character? For example, if prefix is "file" and the file is "file.txt", then prefix + "." would be "file." and the basename is "file.txt", which starts with "file.", so it should return True. Similarly, if the prefix is "file-" and the file is "file-test.jpg", then "file-test" starts with "file-", so it should return True.

So the function can be structured as follows: get the basename, then check if it starts with either prefix + "-" or prefix + ".".

I should also consider edge cases. For example, if the prefix is an empty string, then the function would check if the basename starts with "-" or ".", which might not make sense, but according to the problem statement, that's how it should work.

Putting it all together, the function will import os, get the basename, and return the result of the startswith checks.

Wait, but in the function, I should combine both conditions using an or operator. So the return statement will be:

return basename.startswith(prefix + "-") or basename.startswith(prefix + ".")

That should cover both cases.

So the code steps are:

1. Import os module.
2. Define the function with the given signature.
3. Inside the function, get the basename using os.path.basename(file_path).
4. Return True if the basename starts with either prefix + "-" or prefix + ".".

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
