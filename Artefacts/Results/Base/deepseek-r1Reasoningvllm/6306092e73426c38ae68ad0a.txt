Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The function is called validate_choices_args and it takes one parameter, args. The docstring says it should check if the value of the given args is one of the available choices.

Hmm, so the function needs to compare the received args against a set of predefined choices. If args is in the choices, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. That makes sense.

I should define the available choices as a class-level constant. Let me name it VALID_CHOICES and set it as a tuple containing all the valid options. So, VALID_CHOICES = ('choice1', 'choice2', ...).

Next, I'll write the function. Inside the function, I'll check if args is an instance of the VALID_CHOICES tuple. Using 'if args in VALID_CHOICES' should do the trick. If it is, return True; else, return False.

Wait, I should make sure that the function correctly handles different types of inputs. For example, if args is a string, it should check membership correctly. Also, the function should be case-sensitive, so that's handled automatically.

I think that's all. Now, putting it all together, I'll write the class with the VALID_CHOICES and the validate_choices_args method as described.
