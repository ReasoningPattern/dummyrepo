Okay, I need to help the user generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_option_spec, and it's supposed to get the specification for an option name from a command. 

First, I'll look at the function signature. It's a method with parameters self, command_name, and argument_name. The docstring explains that it retrieves options for the command_name using self.get_parser_option_specs(). 

So, the function needs to call self.get_parser_option_specs() to get all the option specs. Then, it should filter these specs to find the one that matches the argument_name. 

I should check if the argument_name exists in the specs. If it does, return that spec. If not, return None. 

I'll structure the code to first get the specs, then use a dictionary to look up the argument_name. That's efficient and clean. 

Putting it all together, the function will look up the specs, filter by argument_name, and return the result or None. I'll make sure the code is concise and fits the requirements.
