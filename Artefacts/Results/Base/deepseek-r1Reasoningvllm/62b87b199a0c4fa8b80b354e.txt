Alright, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_request_seq that checks if a given sequence can be converted into a FillRequestSeq. The function should return a boolean. 

First, I should think about what FillRequestSeq is. From the name, it probably represents a sequence of requests that need to be filled, maybe like a list of objects with specific attributes. So, the input 'seq' is likely a list or iterable, and I need to check if it meets certain criteria to be considered a FillRequestSeq.

I'll start by checking if 'seq' is an iterable. In Python, I can do this by seeing if it's an instance of collections.abc.Iterable. But I should remember to import collections.abc for this.

Next, I need to ensure that each element in the sequence has certain attributes. The docstring mentions that a bool is returned, so each element must have attributes like 'id', 'code', 'description', and 'value'. I'll loop through each item in the sequence and check these attributes exist. If any item is missing one of these, the function should return False.

Also, I should handle the case where 'seq' is None. If it's None, the function should immediately return False.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Check if 'seq' is an iterable. If not, return False.
2. If 'seq' is None, return False.
3. Iterate over each item in 'seq' and check for the required attributes.
4. If all items have the necessary attributes, return True; otherwise, return False.

I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to include the necessary imports and structure.
