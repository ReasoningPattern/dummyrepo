Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ttl_cache and it's a decorator used for memoization with an LRU algorithm and a time-to-live value.

First, I remember that Python has a built-in module called 'functools' which has decorator functions, including 'lru_cache'. But this function is supposed to be similar but with more parameters like ttl and timer, so I can't just use the built-in one directly.

I'll start by importing the necessary modules. I'll need 'time' for the timer function, so I'll import time. Also, from functools, I'll import 'partial' because I might need to set some default arguments when creating the decorator.

Looking at the function signature, the parameters are maxsize, ttl, timer, and typed. The default values are maxsize=128, ttl=600, timer=time.monotonic, and typed=False. So the function should be defined with these parameters.

The docstring explains that it's a decorator for memoizing functions with an LRU cache based on TTL. I need to make sure the docstring is properly formatted with the correct indentation and structure.

Now, thinking about how to implement this. The decorator will wrap the function, and for each call, it will check if the result is still valid based on the TTL. If it's older than the TTL, it will evict the oldest entry and load the new result.

I'll need to create a wrapper function inside the decorator that keeps track of the cache. The wrapper will use a dictionary to store the results. Each time the function is called, it will check if the argument is in the cache. If it is, and the time since the last use is less than the TTL, it will return the cached value. Otherwise, it will calculate the new TTL and update the cache.

The timer function is used to calculate the time since the last use. By default, it's time.monotonic, which returns the current monotonic time in seconds. So I'll use functools.partial to set the default timer when creating the decorator.

I should also handle the case where the function is called with arguments that are not hashable, but perhaps that's beyond the scope here. The 'typed' parameter is for compatibility with the built-in lru_cache, so I'll ignore it for now.

Putting it all together, the decorator will use a dictionary to cache results, and each time the function is called, it will check and update the cache based on the TTL and timer functions provided.

I need to make sure that the code is properly indented and that all the necessary imports are included. Also, the function should be named ttl_cache and have the correct parameters with default values.

Wait, I should also consider that the timer function is optional, so when creating the decorator, I'll set it to time.monotonic by default. The 'typed' parameter is a boolean, so I'll include it as typed=False.

I think that's the main structure. Now, I'll write the code step by step, making sure each part is correctly implemented.
