Okay, I need to write a Python function called identify_request that checks if the request body contains events when loaded with JSON. The function should return True if events are present and False otherwise.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. Since the request is a JSON object, I'll need the json module to parse it. Also, typing is required to satisfy the function's type hints.

Next, I'll define the function with the given signature. It takes a RequestType parameter, which is of type JSONRequest from fastapi, and returns a boolean.

Inside the function, I'll try to parse the request body using json.loads(). I'll assign the result to a variable, maybe called events.

Then, I'll check if events is an instance of dict. If it is, I'll return True. Otherwise, I'll return False.

I should make sure to handle any potential exceptions, but since the function is supposed to return a boolean based on the presence of events, I'll let it fail naturally if parsing fails, which aligns with the intended behavior.

Putting it all together, I'll write the code, making sure to include the necessary imports and docstring as provided.
