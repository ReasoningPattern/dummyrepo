Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _fromutc and it's a method, so it should have 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it takes a timezone datetime and calculates a datetime in a new timezone. 

I remember that Python has a datetime module, specifically the datetime.timezone class which allows creating timezones. So, I'll probably need to create a new timezone from the given datetime's timezone and a new timezone offset.

Wait, the function is part of a class, maybe a DateTimeTZ class. So, the self would be an instance of that class. The dt parameter is a datetime object in the original timezone. I need to convert it to a new timezone.

I think the approach is to create a naive datetime in UTC by converting dt to UTC. Then, create a new timezone based on that UTC datetime and the desired offset. 

So, first, I'll get the UTC time from dt using replace(tzinfo=None). Then, create a new timezone using datetime.timezone(new_offset). Finally, replace the tzinfo of the naive UTC datetime with the new timezone.

Putting it all together, the code inside the function would be: return naive_dt.replace(tzinfo=new_timezone). 

I should make sure to import datetime, but since it's a method, it's probably already imported elsewhere.

So the function will look like this: take self and dt, return the new datetime after conversion.
