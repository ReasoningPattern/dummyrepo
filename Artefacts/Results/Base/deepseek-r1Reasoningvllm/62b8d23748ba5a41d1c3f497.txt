Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's an instance method, so it should have 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it should remove and return the least frequently used (key, value) pair.

Hmm, in Python, the collections module has a defaultdict that has a popitem method. That method removes and returns the least frequently used item. So maybe the code should import defaultdict from collections.

Wait, but the code needs to be a function, not a class method. So I'll define a function called popitem inside a class, probably using defaultdict.

So the function will return a tuple of (key, value) of the least recently used item. I should make sure that the function doesn't raise an error if the container is empty, but since it's part of defaultdict's behavior, it might raise a KeyError. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling that, so I'll proceed.

Putting it all together, the code imports defaultdict, defines the function, and returns d.popitem(). That should do it.
