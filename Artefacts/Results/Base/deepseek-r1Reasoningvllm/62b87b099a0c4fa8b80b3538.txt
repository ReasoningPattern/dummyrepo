Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_fill_request_el, and it takes an object 'obj' as an argument. The docstring says it checks whether the obj class has the 'fill' and 'request' attributes.

Wait, does it check if the attributes exist on the object or on the class? Since the function is named is_fill_request_el, I think it's checking if the object itself has these attributes, not the class. So I should use hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request').

But wait, sometimes in Python, especially with objects, it's better to check if the attribute is an instance variable. So using hasattr is correct because it checks if the attribute exists in the object's namespace.

So the function should return True only if both attributes exist. So I'll use and to combine the two hasattr checks.

Putting it all together, the function will be:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request')

That should do it. I don't need any imports here because hasattr is a built-in function.
