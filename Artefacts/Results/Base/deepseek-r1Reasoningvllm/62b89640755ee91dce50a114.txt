Okay, I need to write a Python function called tzname_in_python2 that takes a namefunc as an argument. The docstring says it's supposed to change unicode output into bytestrings in Python 2. Hmm, I remember that in Python 2, strings are bytes by default, but unicode is also supported. So if a function returns a unicode string, I need to convert it to bytes.

Wait, how do I do that? Oh right, in Python 2, you can use the .encode() method to convert a unicode string to bytes. But what encoding should I use? Probably UTF-8 since that's the standard. So I'll need to call the function, capture its return value, encode it as UTF-8, and then return it as a byte string.

But how do I call the function? Since namefunc is presumably a function that returns a string, I can just call namefunc(), right? So inside the function, I'll do something like result = namefunc(), then return result.encode('utf-8').

Wait, but what if the function doesn't return a string? Oh, the docstring says it's about unicode output, so I guess we can assume that the function returns a unicode string. So no need for error checking.

Putting it all together, the function will call namefunc, encode the result, and return it as bytes. That should handle the conversion from unicode to bytestrings in Python 2.

So the code would be:

def tzname_in_python2(namefunc):
    result = namefunc()
    return result.encode('utf-8')

I think that's it. I don't see any edge cases here because the function is expected to return a unicode string, and we're converting it to bytes using UTF-8 encoding.
