Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_versions and it's supposed to return version information. If it can't get the version, it should return the default value.

First, I'll start by defining the function with the correct signature. The docstring explains that it obtains version info, using a default if it can't be obtained. So I'll make sure the docstring is properly formatted with Google style.

Next, I'll think about how to retrieve version information. The standard library has a modules module where each module has a __version__ attribute. So I can iterate over modules in the __import__able objects, probably using sys.modules or something similar.

I'll import sys at the beginning. Then, I'll loop through each module in sys.modules. For each module, I'll check if it has a __version__ attribute. If it does, I'll extract that version and convert it into a tuple for consistent comparison.

Once I have all the versions, I'll sort them lexicographically. That way, they'll be in a consistent order, which is probably what the user wants.

If no versions are found after checking all modules, the function should return the default value provided. So I'll initialize the versions list as an empty tuple and the result as the default. Then, if versions is empty after the loop, return the default.

Putting it all together, I'll write the code inside the function. I'll make sure to import sys at the top so it's accessible.

Wait, should I handle exceptions? The function is supposed to return the default if it can't obtain version info, but what if a module's __version__ is not a tuple or can't be converted? Maybe I should add a try-except block when converting to a tuple to avoid errors. But the user didn't specify handling that, so perhaps it's beyond the scope. I'll proceed without it for now.

So the code will import sys, loop through modules, collect versions, sort them, and return the default if none are found. That should meet the requirements.
