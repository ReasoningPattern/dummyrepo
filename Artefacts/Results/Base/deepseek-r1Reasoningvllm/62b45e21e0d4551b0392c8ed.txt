Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called find_path_type and it takes a single argument, path. The docstring says it returns a string indicating the type of thing at the given path. 

Hmm, so the function's purpose is to determine what kind of object or resource is located at a certain path. The path could be a file, a directory, a network resource, etc. The function should check the type of the object at that path and return an appropriate string.

Let me think about how to approach this. First, I'll need to evaluate the object at the given path. So, I'll use the __class__.__name__ attribute to get the type name. But wait, I should make sure that the path is a valid object. If path is None, trying to access its type might cause an error. So I should handle that case.

I'll start by checking if path is None. If it is, the function should return "None type". Otherwise, I'll get the type of path using type(path). Then, I'll use __name__ to get the string representation of the type.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this. First, handle the None case, then return the type name. That should cover all possible cases and return the correct string as per the docstring.
