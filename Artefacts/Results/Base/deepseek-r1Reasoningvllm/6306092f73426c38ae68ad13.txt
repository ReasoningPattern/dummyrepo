Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_playbook and it's supposed to wrap the 'ansible-playbook' CLI. 

First, I'll look at the parameters. The function has several parameters: ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args. The docstring explains each of these, so I'll make sure to include them correctly.

The function should return something. Since it's wrapping the CLI, I think it's supposed to execute the playbook. So I'll probably call subprocess.run, which is a common way to run CLI commands in Python.

I remember that subprocess.run takes a list of arguments, so the command would be ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]. I should make that a list.

Next, I'll set up the subprocess.run parameters. The shell parameter should be set to True if we're using a string that might have spaces, but since the command is a list, shell=False is better. However, since the command is a list, shell isn't needed here.

The check=False parameter means the subprocess won't wait for it to finish. But usually, we want the function to wait, so maybe I should set check=True. But if the user wants to handle it themselves, maybe check=False is better. Hmm, the original example uses check=False, so I'll follow that.

For arguments, I need to pass extra_vars and ansible_args. I think using **kwargs would merge them into the run command. So run_command_kwargs={'extra_vars': extra_vars, 'ansible_args': ansible_args}.

The verbose parameter controls the verbosity. I'll set the stdout and stderr to subprocess.PIPE so I can read the output. The shell check can be done with check, but maybe I should let it fail if the playbook doesn't exist. So if verbose is not None, I'll set the check to True, and then check the return code. If verbose is True, set check=True; if False, set check=False. Or maybe just let it check regardless, but log the output based on verbose. Wait, the function is supposed to return the result, so perhaps it's better to always check but let the user handle the output based on verbose.

Alternatively, maybe the function should just run the command and return the result, regardless of the verbose level. The verbose parameter is more for controlling output, not the execution flow.

So I'll proceed with setting check=True, which will raise an exception if the command fails. But the user can handle that with the verbose parameter, perhaps printing the error if verbose is True.

The capture_output parameter is deprecated, so I'll ignore that.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Use subprocess.run with the command as a list.
2. Pass the parameters as kwargs.
3. Handle the check based on the verbose level.
4. Return the result.

Wait, but the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, so maybe it's better to just run the command and return the result, letting the user handle any exceptions. So perhaps the check parameter isn't necessary, or maybe it's better to let it check regardless and let the user handle the output based on the verbose flag.

I think the key is to execute the command and return the result, so I'll proceed with that.

So the code will import subprocess, define the function, and then return subprocess.run with the appropriate arguments and kwargs.

I should also make sure to include the docstring as given, so I'll copy that into the function.

Wait, but in the initial example, the function returns the result of subprocess.run, which is a CompletedProcess instance. So the function will execute the command and return the result, which can be checked for return code, stdout, stderr, etc.

So putting it all together, the code will look like this:

Import subprocess, then define the function with the given parameters and docstring. Inside, call subprocess.run with the command, check parameter based on verbose, and the kwargs.

I think that's it. I'll write the code accordingly.
