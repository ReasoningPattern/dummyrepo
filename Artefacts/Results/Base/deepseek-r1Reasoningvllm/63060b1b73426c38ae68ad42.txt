Okay, I need to write a Python function called inject_config based on the given docstring. The function should check if the ANSIBLE_CONFIG property exists in os.environ. If it doesn't, it should set it to self.ansible_config_path.

First, I'll import the os module because I need to access environment variables. Then, I'll define the method inside the class, checking if the ANSIBLE_CONFIG is already present. If not, I'll set it using os.environ.

I remember that os.environ is a dictionary-like object that holds the values of all environment variables. So, I can check if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' is a key in os.environ. If it's not there, I'll assign self.ansible_config_path to it.

Wait, but what if self.ansible_config_path is None or an empty string? I should probably handle that case to avoid setting it unnecessarily. But the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe it's safe to proceed as is.

Putting it all together, the function will check for the key and set it if missing. I'll make sure to use self.ansible_config_path, assuming that's an attribute of the class.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
