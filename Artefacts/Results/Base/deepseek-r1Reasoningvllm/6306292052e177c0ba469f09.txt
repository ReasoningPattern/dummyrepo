Okay, I need to write a Python function called identify_request that checks if the request body contains JSON events. If it does, the function should return True. If not, it should check if the XML has the Magic_ENV_TAG. If that's found, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. I'll need json to parse JSON and xml.etree.ElementTree as ET for XML parsing.

Next, I'll check if the request body is not empty. If it's empty, there's nothing to process, so return False.

Then, I'll try to parse the request body as JSON. If it's successful, I'll check if the JSON has an 'events' key. If 'events' exists, return True.

If parsing as JSON fails or there's no 'events' key, I'll move on to checking XML. I'll parse the request body as XML using ElementTree. I'll look for the 'Magic_ENV_TAG' in the parsed XML. If found, return True.

If neither JSON events nor Magic_ENV_TAG is present, return False.

I need to handle exceptions in case the parsing fails. For JSON, I'll catch ValueError, and for XML, I'll catch ElementTree exceptions. If any parsing fails, I'll just continue to the next check.

I should also make sure to decode the request body properly, using request.content.decode('utf-8') to handle different byte encodings.

Putting it all together, the function will first check JSON, then XML, and return the appropriate boolean based on the conditions.
