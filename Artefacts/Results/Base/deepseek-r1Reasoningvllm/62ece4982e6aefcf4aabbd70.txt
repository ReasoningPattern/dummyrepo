Okay, I need to write a Python function called os_is_mac that checks if the operating system is macOS and returns a boolean. Let me think about how to do this.

First, I remember that Python has the platform module which can give information about the system. So I should import platform.

Looking at the platform module, there's a function called system() that returns a string indicating the operating system. So I can use platform.system().

I also recall that on macOS, platform.system() returns 'Darwin'. So I can check if the result is equal to 'Darwin'. If it is, return True; otherwise, return False.

Putting it all together, I'll import platform, define the function, use a conditional expression to check the system, and return the appropriate boolean value.

Wait, are there any edge cases? Well, the function is straightforward, so it should work on any platform where platform.system() returns 'Darwin' for macOS.

So the code will import platform, then return True if platform.system() is 'Darwin', else False.

I think that's it. Let me write the code accordingly.
