Okay, I need to write a Python function called make_find_paths that takes a sequence of paths and transforms each into a glob pattern if it's not already one. The function should return a tuple of these transformed paths.

First, I should figure out how to determine if a path is a glob pattern. I remember that in Python, glob patterns are strings that use special characters like * and ?. So I can check if the path contains any of these characters.

I'll start by iterating over each path in the input sequence. For each path, I'll check if it's already a glob pattern. If it is, I'll leave it as is. If not, I'll convert it into a glob pattern.

Wait, how do I convert a path into a glob pattern? Well, I can use the re module, specifically the re.escape function to escape any special characters in the path, and then add a * at the end. That should make it a valid glob pattern.

So, for each path, I'll check if any character in it is a special glob character. If it's not, I'll escape it and append a *. Otherwise, I'll keep it as a glob pattern.

Putting it all together, I'll loop through each path in find_paths, apply the transformation, and collect the results into a tuple. That's the basic plan.

I should also make sure that the function returns a tuple, even if the input is empty. So, if find_paths is empty, the function should return an empty tuple.

Let me think about some examples. If the input is ['dir', 'dir/*.txt'], the output should be ['dir', 'dir/*.txt']. If the input is ['dir/sub', 'file.txt'], it becomes ['dir/sub', 'file.txt'].

Wait, no. Actually, the function should only transform paths that are not already glob patterns. So in the first example, 'dir' isn't a glob pattern, so it becomes 'dir/'. But in the sample given, the function is supposed to pass existing patterns untouched. Hmm, maybe I misread that.

Looking back at the docstring: it says to transform all paths into glob patterns, and pass through existing patterns untouched. So if a path is already a glob pattern, it remains as is. Otherwise, it's converted.

So, how do I detect if a path is a glob pattern? It should end with a * or contain a *. Or maybe it's a pattern that could be a glob. Alternatively, perhaps the function should treat any path that doesn't contain a * or a ? as a simple path and convert it, while leaving those with * as is.

Wait, but in glob patterns, * is a wildcard. So any path that contains a * is already a glob pattern. So perhaps the condition is: if the path contains '*' or '?', it's already a glob pattern and should be left as is. Otherwise, it's converted into a glob pattern.

So, for each path, if '*' is in the path, leave it. Else, escape and add a *.

That makes sense. So the code inside the loop would be:

if '*' in path:
    transformed = path
else:
    transformed = re.escape(path) + '*'

Yes, that should work.

Now, putting it all together, the function will import re, loop through each path, apply this logic, and collect the transformed paths into a tuple.

I should also handle empty inputs gracefully, so that if find_paths is empty, the function returns an empty tuple.

Testing this logic with examples:

Example 1:
find_paths = ['dir', 'dir/*.txt']
The function should return ('dir', 'dir/*.txt').

Example 2:
find_paths = ['dir/sub', 'file.txt']
The function should return ('dir/sub*', 'file.txt') because 'dir/sub' doesn't have a *, so it's converted to 'dir/sub*'. Wait, no, because re.escape('dir/sub') would be 'dir/sub' and adding * makes it 'dir/sub*'. But in glob, that would match exactly 'dir/sub' followed by a *. Hmm, maybe that's not the intended behavior. Alternatively, perhaps the function should append a * only if the path doesn't end with a *.

Wait, maybe I should check if the path ends with a * before appending. Because if the path is 'dir/*', it's already a glob pattern. But if it's 'dir/sub', it's not, so we make it 'dir/sub*'.

But in the example, 'dir/sub' would become 'dir/sub*', which is a glob pattern that matches exactly 'dir/sub' followed by a *. That might not be the desired behavior. Perhaps the function should append a * only if the path doesn't already end with a *.

So, perhaps the condition should be: if the path contains '*' and doesn't end with '*', then leave it. Else, convert.

Wait, but the function's docstring says to transform all paths into glob patterns, passing through existing patterns untouched. So, if a path is already a glob pattern, regardless of whether it ends with *, it's left as is. So, perhaps the function should check if the path is a glob pattern, which could be determined by whether it matches the glob syntax.

But checking if a string is a glob pattern is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the function should simply check if the path contains a '*' or '?', and if so, assume it's a glob pattern and leave it. Otherwise, convert.

But that might not cover all cases. For example, a path like 'dir/*' is a glob pattern, but so is 'dir/*.txt'. So, perhaps the initial approach is acceptable, even if it's not perfect.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should treat any path that doesn't contain a '*' or '?' as a simple path and convert it, while leaving others as is.

So, the code would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    transformed_paths = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if '*' in path or '?' in path:
            transformed_paths.append(path)
        else:
            transformed_paths.append(re.escape(path) + '*')
    return tuple(transformed_paths)

Wait, but this would leave paths with '?' untouched, which is correct because '?' is a glob character. So, this should handle both '*' and '?' as indicators that the path is already a glob pattern.

Testing this with the examples:

Example 1:
find_paths = ['dir', 'dir/*.txt']
The function would check 'dir'â€”no '*' or '?', so it becomes 'dir*'. Wait, that's not right because 'dir' would become 'dir*', which is a glob pattern that matches 'dir' followed by a *. But in the example, the expected output is 'dir' as is. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, in the example given in the problem statement, the function is supposed to transform all paths into glob patterns. So, 'dir' should be transformed into 'dir*', but the sample code's docstring shows that it's passed through. Wait, no, looking back, the sample code's docstring says that the function returns a tuple of transformed path, but the example isn't given. Wait, the problem statement says that the function should transform all paths into glob patterns, and pass through existing patterns untouched.

So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Because in the example, if the input is ['dir', 'dir/*.txt'], the output should be ['dir*', 'dir/*.txt'], but according to the problem statement, existing patterns are passed through. So, perhaps the function should not modify paths that are already glob patterns.

But how to determine if a path is a glob pattern. One way is to check if the path matches the glob pattern syntax. But that's a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps the function should only add a '*' if the path doesn't already end with a '*' or contain a '*' or '?'.

Wait, perhaps the function should check if the path is a glob pattern by trying to match it against glob patterns. But that might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should assume that any path that doesn't contain a '*' or '?' is a simple path and needs to be converted to a glob pattern. But in the example, 'dir' would be converted to 'dir*', which is a glob pattern, but perhaps the intended behavior is to leave it as is.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The function is supposed to transform all paths into glob patterns, and pass through existing patterns untouched. So, if a path is already a glob pattern, it's left as is. Otherwise, it's converted.

So, the key is to determine if a given path is a glob pattern. How can I do that?

A glob pattern can contain wildcards like '*' and '?', but also has specific syntax. For example, 'dir/*.txt' is a glob pattern, but so is 'dir/*' or 'dir?sub'. Wait, no, 'dir?sub' is not a valid glob pattern because '?' is used for optional characters, but in the middle of a pattern, it's treated as a literal. Hmm, perhaps the function should consider any path that contains '*' or '?' as a glob pattern and leave it as is.

But that's not entirely accurate because a path like 'dir?sub' is not a valid glob pattern, but it's possible that the user might pass such a path. However, according to the problem statement, the function should treat it as a glob pattern if it's a valid one.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should only add a '*' if the path doesn't already end with a '*' or contain a '*' or '?'.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to check if the path is a valid glob pattern. But checking that would require using the glob module's functionality, which might be a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can use the glob module's isglob function, but that's not a direct method. Alternatively, perhaps using re.match to see if the path matches a glob pattern.

Wait, perhaps the function can use the re module to check if the path matches a glob pattern. For example, a glob pattern starts with an optional directory separator, followed by any number of characters, including wildcards.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the function can simply check if the path contains '*' or '?', and if so, leave it as is. Otherwise, convert it to a glob pattern by adding a '*' at the end.

So, the code would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    transformed_paths = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if '*' in path or '?' in path:
            transformed_paths.append(path)
        else:
            transformed_paths.append(re.escape(path) + '*')
    return tuple(transformed_paths)

Testing this with the example from the problem statement:

If find_paths is ['dir', 'dir/*.txt'], the function would transform 'dir' into 'dir*', and leave 'dir/*.txt' as is. But according to the problem statement, the function should pass through existing patterns. So in this case, 'dir' is not a glob pattern because it's just a directory, not a pattern. Wait, but in glob, 'dir' is a pattern that matches exactly 'dir'. So perhaps the function should treat 'dir' as a glob pattern and leave it as is. But according to the code above, it's not, because it doesn't contain a '*' or '?'.

Hmm, this is a problem. The function is supposed to transform all paths into glob patterns, but in this case, 'dir' is already a glob pattern, so it should be left as is.

So, the initial approach is incorrect because it doesn't recognize 'dir' as a glob pattern.

So, perhaps the function needs a better way to determine if a path is a glob pattern.

An alternative approach is to use the re module to check if the path matches a glob pattern. A glob pattern can be matched with a regex that starts with ^ and ends with $, allowing for optional directory separators and wildcards.

The regex pattern for a glob could be something like ^[\\/]?(.*?)(\\*|\\?|[^\\/*?])*$, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to use the glob module's functions to see if a pattern matches.

Wait, perhaps the function can try to see if the path can be matched by glob. For example, using glob.glob(path) and seeing if it returns a non-empty list. But that's not efficient because it would run in a loop for each path.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can use a regex to match glob patterns. The regex for a glob pattern could be ^[\\/]?(\\*|\\?|[^\\/*?])+$.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the re module to match any string that is a valid glob pattern. The regex for a glob pattern could be:

^([/\\]?[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_~%*?&'()|:;=+-]+([/\\]?[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_~%*?&'()|:;=+-]*)*)$

This regex matches any string that is a valid glob pattern according to the glob syntax. So, the function can use this regex to check if a path is a glob pattern.

So, the code inside the loop would be:

import re

pattern = r'^([/\\]?[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_~%*?&\'()|:;=+-]+([/\\]?[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_~%*?&\'()|:;=+-]*)*)$'

for path in find_paths:
    if re.fullmatch(pattern, path):
        transformed_paths.append(path)
    else:
        transformed_paths.append(re.escape(path) + '*')

This way, any path that is already a valid glob pattern is left as is, and others are converted.

But this might be overcomplicating, and perhaps the function is intended to be simple. Given the problem statement, maybe the initial approach is acceptable, even if it's not 100% accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should consider any path that doesn't contain '*' or '?' as a simple path and convert it, but that might not cover all cases.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach, but note that it might not correctly identify all glob patterns.

So, the code would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    transformed_paths = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if '*' in path or '?' in path:
            transformed_paths.append(path)
        else:
            transformed_paths.append(re.escape(path) + '*')
    return tuple(transformed_paths)

Testing this with the example:

If find_paths = ['dir', 'dir/*.txt'], the function returns ('dir*', 'dir/*.txt'), which might not be correct because 'dir' is a valid glob pattern. But according to the problem statement, the function should transform all paths into glob patterns, so perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the function should always add a '*' to paths that are not already glob patterns. But how to determine that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should check if the path ends with a '/'. If not, and it doesn't contain '*' or '?', then it's converted to a glob pattern.

But this is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial code, but perhaps the function should be adjusted to use the regex approach.

So, the final code would be:

import re

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    pattern = r'^([/\\]?[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_~%*?&\'()|:;=+-]+([/\\]?[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_~%*?&\'()|:;=+-]*)*)$'
    transformed_paths = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if re.fullmatch(pattern, path):
            transformed_paths.append(path)
        else:
            transformed_paths.append(re.escape(path) + '*')
    return tuple(transformed_paths)

But I'm not sure if this regex is accurate. It might need to be tested.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can use the glob module's isglob function, but that requires importing glob.

Wait, perhaps using the glob module's isglob function is a better approach. So, the code would be:

import glob

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    transformed_paths = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if glob.isglob(path):
            transformed_paths.append(path)
        else:
            transformed_paths.append(re.escape(path) + '*')
    return tuple(transformed_paths)

But I'm not sure if this works correctly, as isglob might not handle all edge cases, and it's better to stick with the regex approach.

In conclusion, the function should check if each path is a valid glob pattern, and if not, convert it by adding a '*' at the end after escaping any special characters.
