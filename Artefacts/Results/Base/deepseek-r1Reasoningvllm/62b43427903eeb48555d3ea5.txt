Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what's required.

The function is called 'format' and it's an instance method because it has 'self' as the first parameter. The parameters are 'sql' which is of type AnyStr, and 'params' which is a Union of a dictionary of Union[str, int] and Any. The return type is a Tuple of AnyStr and Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]].

The docstring says the function converts SQL using self._converter.convert. So, the function is supposed to take the SQL string and the parameters, apply the converter, and return the converted SQL string along with the possibly modified parameters.

I need to write a function that does this. The first thing I'll do is call self._converter.convert with sql and params. Let's assume that this method returns a tuple of (converted_sql, new_params). 

Next, I should handle the return type correctly. The function should return a tuple where the first element is the converted SQL string and the second is the new parameters. 

Wait, but what if the converter's method doesn't change the parameters? Then, I can just return (converted_sql, params). But if it does change, it should handle that.

Putting it all together, the function body would be: converted_sql, new_params = self._converter.convert(sql, params). Then return (converted_sql, new_params).

I should make sure that the return type is a tuple with the correct types. Since the converter's method returns a tuple of AnyStr and Union, this should fit.

So, the code should be straightforward. I'll write the function, perform the conversion, and return the tuple.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
