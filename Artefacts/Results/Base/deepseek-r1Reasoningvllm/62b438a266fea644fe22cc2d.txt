Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_subparser_arguments based on the given docstring. The function takes two arguments: unparsed_arguments, which is a sequence, and subparsers, which is a dictionary mapping subparser names to argparse.ArgumentParser instances. The goal is to parse the arguments and return a tuple with a dictionary of parsed namespaces and a list of remaining arguments.

First, I'll think about how argparse works. Normally, when you use subparsers, each subparser can have its own arguments. But if there are common arguments like "--repository", they should be shared. So, the function needs to allow each subparser to try to parse the arguments, and if they do, those arguments are removed from the unparsed_arguments so other subparsers can't use them.

I'll start by creating an empty dictionary to hold the parsed arguments. Then, for each subparser in the subparsers dictionary, I'll try to parse the arguments. I'll use the subparser's parse_args method, passing in the unparsed_arguments. But wait, the parse_args method usually takes a namespace, not a list. So I'll need to convert the unparsed_arguments list into a namespace using argparse.Namespace(*unparsed_arguments). That way, the subparser can process the arguments.

After parsing, if the subparser had any arguments left, I'll add those to the parsed_results dictionary with the subparser's name as the key. Then, I'll remove the parsed arguments from the unparsed_arguments so other subparsers don't pick them up.

Once all subparsers have been processed, whatever arguments are left in unparsed_arguments will be returned as the remaining arguments.

I should also handle the case where a subparser doesn't find any arguments. In that case, it won't add anything to parsed_results, and the arguments will stay in unparsed_arguments.

Putting it all together, I'll loop through each subparser, try to parse, handle any exceptions just in case, and then collect the results. Finally, return the tuple as specified.
