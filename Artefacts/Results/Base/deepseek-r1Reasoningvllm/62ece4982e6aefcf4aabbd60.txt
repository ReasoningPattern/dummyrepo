Okay, I need to write a Python function called size_to_bytes that converts a human-readable file size string into bytes. The function signature is already given, so I just need to fill in the code.

First, I should think about the possible units in the input string. Common units are like K, M, G, etc. So, I'll need to handle cases like '500K', '100M', '2.5G'.

I remember that 1K is 1024 bytes, 1M is 1024^2, 1G is 1024^3, and so on. So, I'll create a dictionary that maps these units to their respective multipliers. The keys will be uppercase letters, and the values will be the exponents for 1024.

Next, I need to process the input string. I'll split it into the numeric part and the unit. Using string slicing, I can separate the number from the end of the string. For example, in '500K', the number is '500' and the unit is 'K'.

Once I have the number and the unit, I'll convert the number string to a float or integer. Then, I'll look up the unit in the dictionary to get the multiplier. Multiply the number by 1024 raised to the power of the exponent associated with the unit.

Wait, what if the input is something like '1024K'? Should I handle exact powers? Probably, but the function should still work as intended because 1024K is 1024 * 1024 bytes, which is 1,048,576 bytes. So, no problem there.

I should also consider edge cases. What if the input is just '1024' without any unit? According to the docstring, the input is a string representing a human-readable size, so maybe it's always followed by a unit. But to be safe, perhaps I should handle cases where the unit is missing. But since the function expects a string like '500K', maybe it's safe to assume the unit is present.

Another thing is that the unit could be lowercase, like 'k' or 'm'. Should I handle that? The examples given in the docstring are uppercase, like '500K', so perhaps the function expects the input to be in uppercase. But to make it more robust, maybe I should convert the unit to uppercase. Or, perhaps the function should only handle uppercase units as per the problem statement.

I think for this problem, I'll assume the input is correctly formatted with uppercase units, so I don't need to handle lowercase. But if I were to make it more robust, I could add a step to convert the unit to uppercase. However, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll stick to uppercase.

Putting it all together, the steps are:

1. Create a dictionary mapping units to multipliers.
2. Split the input string into numeric part and unit.
3. Convert the numeric part to a float.
4. Get the multiplier from the dictionary based on the unit.
5. Calculate the total bytes by multiplying the numeric value with the multiplier.

Let me draft the code.

First, the dictionary:

size单位和对应的乘数：
{
    'K': 1024 ** 1,
    'M': 1024 ** 2,
    'G': 1024 ** 3,
    'T': 1024 ** 4,
    'P': 1024 ** 5,
    'E': 1024 ** 6
}

然后，处理输入字符串：

size_str = '500K'
number_part = size_str[:-1]  # '500'
unit = size_str[-1]  # 'K'

number = float(number_part)
bytes = number * (1024 ** multiplier)

Wait, but 1024^1 is 1024, which is correct for K. So the code would be:

multiplier = units[unit]
bytes = number * (1024 ** multiplier)

But wait, in the dictionary, 'K' is 1024^1, which is correct. So that's right.

Putting it into code:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    units = {
        'K': 1024,
        'M': 1024 ** 2,
        'G': 1024 ** 3,
        'T': 1024 ** 4,
        'P': 1024 ** 5,
        'E': 1024 ** 6
    }
    # Split the size into number and unit
    if len(size) == 0:
        return 0  # handle empty string, though per problem, it's not expected
    unit = size[-1]
    number_str = size[:-1]
    number = float(number_str)
    multiplier = units[unit]
    bytes = number * (1024 ** multiplier)
    return int(bytes)

Wait, but 1024 ** multiplier is the same as 1024 raised to the power of the unit's exponent. Alternatively, it's the same as multiplying 1024, 1024^2, etc., which is correct.

Testing with '500K' should give 500 * 1024 = 522,000 bytes.

Another test case: '100M' is 100 * 1024^2 = 100 * 1,048,576 = 104,857,600 bytes.

What about '1G'? 1 * 1024^3 = 1,073,741,824 bytes.

I think this should work. But wait, the function returns an int, so converting the float result to int is correct, assuming the input is a valid size string.

I think this should handle all the cases as per the problem statement.
