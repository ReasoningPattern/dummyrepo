Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called generate_default_observer_schema and it takes an argument app. The docstring explains that this function generates the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in spec.manifest where a custom schema hasn't been specified.

First, I should figure out what the function needs to do. It probably iterates over the resources in app['spec']['manifest'], like services, nodes, etc. For each resource, it checks if there's an observer schema already defined. If not, it creates a default one.

I remember that the observer pattern in Kubernetes involves defining a class that implements theObserver interface. The default observer schema might look like a dictionary with necessary keys such as kind, resource_name, and observers.

So, the function should loop through each resource in the manifest. For each resource, check if 'observer' is in the app's observers. If not, create a new observer schema with the appropriate details.

I'll need to structure the code to create a new observer dictionary for each resource. The keys should include 'kind', 'resource_name', and 'observers' which is another dictionary with 'class' and 'method' keys pointing to the default observer class and method.

Putting it all together, the code will loop through each resource, check for the observer, and if absent, add the default schema. The code should return the updated app with the observers populated.

I should make sure the code is clean and efficient, handling each resource correctly without duplication. Also, ensure that the new observer schemas are added in a way that doesn't conflict with existing ones.
