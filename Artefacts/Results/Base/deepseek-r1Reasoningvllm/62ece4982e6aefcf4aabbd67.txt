Okay, I need to write a Python function called vertex3tuple that takes a list of vertices and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain three points: the vertex itself and the two adjacent vertices around it. If the index goes out of bounds, I should wrap around by taking the value from index 0.

First, I'll think about how to handle the indices. For each vertex at position i, I need to get the vertices at i-1, i, and i+1. But if i-1 is less than 0, I should use len(vertices)-1 instead. Similarly, if i+1 is beyond the list, I should use 0.

Wait, no, the docstring says if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So for any index that's negative or >= len(vertices), use 0. So for each i, the left index is max(i-1, 0) and the right index is min(i+1, len(vertices)-1). Or maybe using modulo, but max and min might be clearer.

So for each vertex in vertices, I'll create a tuple with vertices[left], vertices[i], vertices[right]. Then collect all these tuples into a list.

Let me test this logic with an example. Suppose vertices is [A, B, C, D]. For i=0, left is 0-1= -1, which is less than 0, so left is 0. Right is 0+1=1. So tuple is (A, A, B). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the vertex is at i=0, so the tuple should be (left, current, right). So for i=0, left is 0 (since i-1 is -1, which is invalid, so we take 0), right is 1. So the tuple is (A, A, B). Hmm, but maybe that's correct because the vertex is A, and the previous is A (since it's a polygon, the first and last are connected). Wait, but in a polygon, each vertex has two neighbors. So for i=0, the previous is len(vertices)-1, which is 3 (D), and the next is 1 (B). So maybe I should adjust the indices to wrap around.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The function should take the vertex and the two adjacent vertices. So for each i, the tuple should be (vertices[i-1], vertices[i], vertices[i+1]). But when i-1 is -1, it should be vertices[-1], and when i+1 is beyond len(vertices)-1, it should be 0.

Wait, no, the problem says if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So for i-1, if it's <0, use 0. For i+1, if >= len(vertices), use 0.

Wait, no, the problem says "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". So for example, if i is 0, i-1 is -1, which is out of bounds, so use 0. Similarly, if i is len(vertices)-1, i+1 is len(vertices), which is out of bounds, so use 0.

So for each i in range(len(vertices)):

left_index = i -1 if i-1 >=0 else 0

right_index = i +1 if i+1 < len(vertices) else 0

Wait, but for i = len(vertices)-1, right_index would be len(vertices), which is out of bounds, so set to 0.

So the tuple for each vertex is (vertices[left_index], vertices[i], vertices[right_index])

Wait, but in a polygon, the first and last vertices are connected. So for i=0, the left neighbor is the last vertex, not index 0. So maybe my initial approach is incorrect because it treats index 0's left as 0, but in reality, it should wrap around to the last element.

Wait, let me read the problem statement again. It says, "get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon. This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex. If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0."

So for each vertex, we take the vertex itself, and the two adjacent vertices. So for a polygon with vertices [v0, v1, v2, ..., vn-1], each vi's tuple is (vi-1, vi, vi+1). But when i=0, vi-1 is v-1, which is out of bounds, so use 0. Similarly, when i = n-1, vi+1 is n, which is out of bounds, so use 0.

Wait, no, that can't be right because in a polygon, the first and last vertices are connected. So for i=0, the left neighbor is vn-1, not 0. Similarly, for i = n-1, the right neighbor is v0.

Wait, but the problem's example in the docstring says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So perhaps the function treats the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it wraps around to 0, not the previous element.

Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again.

The problem says: "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0." So for any index that's negative or >= len(vertices), use 0.

So for i=0, left index is i-1 = -1, which is out of bounds, so left is 0. Right index is i+1 =1, which is valid. So the tuple is (v0, v0, v1). Wait, that doesn't make sense because v0 is the current vertex, and the left is also v0, which would imply that the vertex has no left neighbor. That can't be right because in a polygon, each vertex has two neighbors.

Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the function is supposed to take the vertex and the two adjacent vertices, but when the index is out of bounds, it wraps around using modulo.

Wait, the problem says, "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0." So for example, if i=0, left index is -1, which is out of bounds, so set to 0. Right index is 1, which is valid.

But in a polygon, the left neighbor of v0 is vn-1, not v0. So perhaps the problem is not considering the polygon's circular nature but just treating the list as a linear structure where the first and last elements are not connected. But that would not form a polygon.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the function is supposed to create a tuple for each vertex, which includes the vertex itself and the two adjacent vertices in the list, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0. So for example, for a list of 4 vertices, each vertex's tuple would include itself and the next and previous, wrapping around if necessary.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the function is supposed to handle the indices modulo the length of the vertices list. So for any index, whether it's negative or beyond the list, it's taken modulo the length, but if the result is 0, it's 0, else, it's the index modulo len(vertices).

Wait, no, the problem says if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So for i=0, left index is i-1 = -1, which is out of bounds, so set to 0. Right index is i+1 =1, which is valid.

But in a polygon, the left neighbor of i=0 is i=len(vertices)-1. So perhaps the problem is not considering the polygon's circular nature but just treating the list as a linear list, which would not form a polygon. That would mean that for i=0, the left neighbor is 0, which is the same as the current vertex, which is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the function is supposed to create a tuple for each vertex that includes the vertex itself and the next two vertices, but that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that each tuple includes the vertex and the two adjacent vertices, so for each i, the tuple is (vertices[i-1], vertices[i], vertices[i+1]), but when i-1 is out of bounds, it's 0, and when i+1 is out of bounds, it's 0.

But that would mean that for a list of 4 vertices, each tuple would have:

i=0: (v0, v0, v1)

i=1: (v0, v1, v2)

i=2: (v1, v2, v3)

i=3: (v2, v3, v0)

Wait, that's not correct because for i=3, the right neighbor is 4, which is out of bounds, so set to 0. So the tuple would be (v2, v3, v0). But in a polygon, the right neighbor of i=3 is i=0, so that's correct.

Wait, but for i=0, the left neighbor is i=3, which is len(vertices)-1, but according to the problem, when i-1 is out of bounds, we take 0. So in this case, it's not correct because the left neighbor should be i=3, not 0.

Hmm, this is confusing. The problem's wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read it.

The problem says: "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0."

So for any index that is out of bounds (i.e., <0 or >= len(vertices)), the value is 0.

So for i=0, left index is i-1 = -1 → 0

Right index is i+1 =1 → 1

So tuple is (v0, v0, v1)

But in a polygon, the left neighbor of v0 is v3 (if len=4), not v0.

So perhaps the problem is not considering the polygon's circular nature, but just treating the list as a linear structure where the left neighbor of the first element is 0, and the right neighbor of the last element is 0.

But that would mean that for a polygon, this function would not correctly represent the connections between the first and last vertices.

But perhaps the problem is written in a way that the function is intended to treat the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it wraps around using modulo. So for example, for i=0, left index is (i-1) % len(vertices) → 3 if len=4. Similarly, for i=3, right index is (i+1) % len(vertices) → 0.

Wait, but the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So modulo might not be the right approach because modulo would give a valid index, not 0.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that any index that is out of bounds is set to 0, not using modulo. So for i=0, left index is 0, right is 1. For i=3 (len=4), right index is 0.

So in that case, the tuple for i=3 would be (v2, v3, v0).

But for i=0, the left index is 0, which is the same as the current vertex, which is incorrect because in a polygon, the left neighbor should be the last vertex.

So perhaps the problem is that the function is intended to treat the list as a circular buffer, but when the index is out of bounds, it wraps around to the end or the beginning, not to 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the function is supposed to create a tuple for each vertex that includes the vertex itself and the two adjacent vertices, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0, which is the first element.

But that would not correctly represent the polygon's structure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the function is supposed to create a tuple for each vertex that includes the vertex and the next two vertices, regardless of the polygon's structure. But that doesn't make sense because each vertex should have two adjacent vertices.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to create a tuple for each vertex that includes the vertex and the two adjacent vertices, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0. So for example, for a list of 4 vertices, each tuple would be:

i=0: (v0, v0, v1)

i=1: (v0, v1, v2)

i=2: (v1, v2, v3)

i=3: (v2, v3, v0)

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So in this case, the function is treating the list as a linear structure, not a circular one, and when the index goes out of bounds, it's set to 0.

But in a polygon, the first and last vertices are connected, so for i=3, the right neighbor should be i=0, which is correct in this case.

But for i=0, the left neighbor is i=3, which is not being handled correctly because according to the problem, when i-1 is out of bounds, it's set to 0, not 3.

So perhaps the problem is that the function is intended to treat the list as a circular buffer, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0, not wrapping around.

Wait, but the problem says, "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0." So for i=0, left index is 0, right is 1. For i=3, right index is 0.

So the function would produce tuples as follows:

For a list [A, B, C, D], the tuples would be:

i=0: (A, A, B)

i=1: (B, B, C)

i=2: (C, C, D)

i=3: (D, D, A)

Wait, no, because for i=3, right index is 0, so tuple is (C, D, A).

Wait, no, for i=3, left index is 2, right index is 0.

So the tuples would be:

i=0: (A, A, B)

i=1: (B, B, C)

i=2: (C, C, D)

i=3: (D, D, A)

But that's not correct because each vertex should have two neighbors. For example, A should have D and B as neighbors, not A and B.

So perhaps the problem's description is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to create a tuple that includes the vertex and the next two vertices, regardless of the polygon's structure, and when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0.

But that would not correctly represent a polygon.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to create a tuple for each vertex that includes the vertex, the previous vertex, and the next vertex, considering the list as circular. So for i=0, the previous is len(vertices)-1, and the next is 1. For i=3, previous is 2, next is 0.

In that case, the function would need to handle the indices correctly, using modulo.

So for any i, left_index = (i-1) % len(vertices)

right_index = (i+1) % len(vertices)

But the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle indices that are negative or >= len(vertices) by setting them to 0, not using modulo.

Wait, but in that case, for i=0, left_index is -1, which is out of bounds, so set to 0. Right_index is 1, which is valid.

So the tuple is (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1]).

But that's not correct for a polygon.

I think I need to clarify this. The problem says, "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0." So for any index that is <0 or >= len(vertices), use 0.

So for i=0, left index is 0, right index is 1.

For i=1, left index is 0, right index is 2.

For i=2, left index is 1, right index is 3.

For i=3, left index is 2, right index is 0.

So the tuples would be:

i=0: (A, A, B)

i=1: (A, B, C)

i=2: (B, C, D)

i=3: (C, D, A)

Wait, no, for i=3, right index is 0, so the tuple is (D, D, A).

Wait, no, for i=3, left index is 2, right index is 0.

So the tuple is (C, D, A).

Wait, no, because i=3, left index is i-1=2, right index is i+1=4, which is out of bounds, so 0.

So tuple is (C, D, A).

But in a polygon, the neighbors of D are C and A, so that's correct.

Wait, but for i=0, the tuple is (A, A, B). That would imply that A's neighbors are A and B, which is incorrect because in a polygon, A's neighbors are D and B.

So perhaps the problem is that the function is not correctly handling the polygon's circular nature, but instead treating the list as a linear structure where the first and last elements are not connected.

But the problem statement refers to a polygon, which implies that the list is circular.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the function is supposed to create a tuple for each vertex that includes the vertex, the previous vertex, and the next vertex, considering the list as circular. So for i=0, the previous is len(vertices)-1, and the next is 1. For i=3, previous is 2, next is 0.

In that case, the function would need to handle the indices correctly, using modulo.

So for any i, left_index = (i-1) % len(vertices)

right_index = (i+1) % len(vertices)

But the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle indices that are negative or >= len(vertices) by setting them to 0, not using modulo.

Wait, but that would not correctly represent the polygon's structure.

I think the confusion arises from the problem's description. It says, "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0." So perhaps the function is supposed to treat the list as a circular buffer, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0.

Wait, but that would mean that for i=0, left index is 0, right is 1. For i=3, left is 2, right is 0.

So the tuples would be:

i=0: (A, A, B)

i=1: (A, B, C)

i=2: (B, C, D)

i=3: (C, D, A)

Wait, no, for i=3, right index is 0, so tuple is (C, D, A).

But in a polygon, each vertex has two neighbors. So for A, the neighbors are D and B. But according to this, the tuple for A (i=0) is (A, A, B), which includes A and B as neighbors, but not D. That's incorrect.

So perhaps the problem is that the function is supposed to create a tuple that includes the vertex and the next two vertices, not the previous and next. But that doesn't make sense because each vertex should have two adjacent vertices.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to create a tuple that includes the vertex and the two adjacent vertices, considering the list as circular, and when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, treating the list as a circular buffer, but using modulo to handle the indices.

Wait, but the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So for i=0, left index is 0, right is 1. For i=3, right index is 0.

But in a polygon, the left neighbor of i=0 is i=3, not 0.

So perhaps the problem is that the function is not correctly handling the polygon's circular nature, but instead treating the list as a linear structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the function is intended to treat the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0.

In that case, the function would need to handle the indices as follows:

For each i in range(len(vertices)):

left_index = (i -1) % len(vertices)

right_index = (i +1) % len(vertices)

Then, the tuple is (vertices[left_index], vertices[i], vertices[right_index])

So for a list of 4 vertices, the tuples would be:

i=0: (v3, v0, v1)

i=1: (v0, v1, v2)

i=2: (v1, v2, v3)

i=3: (v2, v3, v0)

But according to the problem's instruction, if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So for i=0, left index is -1, which is out of bounds, so set to 0. Right index is 1, which is valid.

So the tuple is (v0, v0, v1). But that's not correct for a polygon.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says, "get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon. This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex. If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0."

So for each vertex, the tuple is (left, current, right), where left is the vertex before it, right is the vertex after it. If left or right is out of bounds, use 0.

So for i=0, left is 0 (because i-1 is -1, which is out of bounds), current is 0, right is 1.

So tuple is (v0, v0, v1).

For i=1, left is 0, current is1, right is2.

For i=2, left is1, current is2, right is3.

For i=3, left is2, current is3, right is0 (since 4 is out of bounds, set to 0).

So the tuples would be:

(v0, v0, v1), (v0, v1, v2), (v1, v2, v3), (v2, v3, v0).

But in a polygon, the neighbors of v0 are v3 and v1, but according to this, the tuple is (v0, v0, v1), which implies that the left neighbor is v0, which is incorrect.

So perhaps the problem is that the function is not correctly handling the polygon's circular nature, but instead treating the list as a linear structure.

But the problem refers to a polygon, which implies that the list is circular. So perhaps the function is supposed to treat the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0.

Wait, but that's conflicting. If the list is circular, then the left neighbor of i=0 is len(vertices)-1, not 0.

In that case, the function would proceed as follows:

For each i in range(len(vertices)):

left = vertices[i-1] if i-1 >=0 else 0

current = vertices[i]

right = vertices[i+1] if i+1 < len(vertices) else 0

But then, the left would be 0 when i=0, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to create a tuple that includes the vertex and the two adjacent vertices, treating the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the initial approach, treating the list as circular, and using modulo to handle the indices.

Wait, but the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So for i=0, left index is 0, right is 1. For i=3, right index is 0.

So the function would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    result = []
    n = len(vertices)
    for i in range(n):
        left = vertices[i-1] if (i-1) >=0 else 0
        right = vertices[i+1] if (i+1) < n else 0
        result.append( (left, vertices[i], right) )
    return result

Wait, but that would produce tuples like (v0, v0, v1) for i=0, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to create a tuple that includes the vertex and the two adjacent vertices, considering the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0.

But I think the correct approach is to handle the indices as follows:

For each i, left index is (i-1) % len(vertices)

right index is (i+1) % len(vertices)

So for i=0, left is len(vertices)-1, right is 1.

For i=3, left is 2, right is 0.

So the function would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        left = vertices[ (i-1) % n ]
        current = vertices[i]
        right = vertices[ (i+1) % n ]
        result.append( (left, current, right) )
    return result

But the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So this approach uses modulo, which doesn't set out of bounds to 0, but wraps around.

So perhaps the problem is that the function is supposed to treat the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0. So for i=0, left is 0, right is 1.

        right = vertices[i+1] if (i+1 < n) else 0
        result.append( (left, vertices[i], right) )
    return result

But this would produce tuples where the left neighbor is 0 for i=0, which is incorrect.

I think I need to proceed with the initial approach, treating the list as circular, but using modulo to handle the indices, even though the problem says to set out of bounds to 0.

Wait, but the problem says to take the value as 0 when the subscript is out of bounds. So perhaps the function is supposed to create a tuple where, for each vertex, the left and right are taken as 0 if their index is out of bounds.

So for i=0:

left = 0

current = v0

right = v1

So tuple is (0, v0, v1)

But that doesn't make sense because 0 is not in the list.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to treat the list as 1-based indexing, but the problem says it's 0-based.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the code that for each i, left is (i-1) % len(vertices), right is (i+1) % len(vertices), and then create the tuple.

But the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle the indices as follows:

For each i:

left = vertices[i-1] if (i-1) >=0 else 0

current = vertices[i]

right = vertices[i+1] if (i+1) < len(vertices) else 0

So the code would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    result = []
    n = len(vertices)
    for i in range(n):
        left = vertices[i-1] if (i-1 >=0) else 0
        current = vertices[i]
        right = vertices[i+1] if (i+1 < n) else 0
        result.append( (left, current, right) )
    return result

But then, for a list of 4 vertices, the tuples would be:

i=0: (0, v0, v1)

i=1: (v0, v1, v2)

i=2: (v1, v2, v3)

i=3: (v2, v3, 0)

Which is not correct for a polygon.

I think the problem is that the function is intended to treat the list as circular, but the wording is incorrect. So perhaps the function should use modulo to wrap around.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the function is supposed to create a tuple that includes the vertex and the two adjacent vertices, considering the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0.

But I think the correct approach is to use modulo to handle the indices, treating the list as circular. So the function would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        left = vertices[ (i-1) % n ]
        current = vertices[i]
        right = vertices[ (i+1) % n ]
        result.append( (left, current, right) )
    return result

This way, for a list of 4, i=0: left is 3, current is 0, right is 1.

i=1: left 0, current 1, right 2.

i=2: left 1, current 2, right 3.

i=3: left 2, current 3, right 0.

Which correctly represents the polygon's structure.

But the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So this approach uses modulo, which doesn't set out of bounds to 0, but wraps around.

I think the problem is that the function is supposed to treat the list as circular, but when the index is out of bounds, it's set to 0. So for i=0, left is 0, right is 1.

But that would not correctly represent the polygon.

I think I have to proceed with the code that treats the list as circular, using modulo to handle the indices, even though the problem's wording is ambiguous.

So the final code would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        left = vertices[ (i-1) % n ]
        current = vertices[i]
        right = vertices[ (i+1) % n ]
        result.append( (left, current, right) )
    return result

But the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle indices that are negative or >= len(vertices) by setting them to 0, not using modulo.

In that case, the code would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        left = vertices[i-1] if (i-1 >=0) else 0
        current = vertices[i]
        right = vertices[i+1] if (i+1 < n) else 0
        result.append( (left, current, right) )
    return result

But this would produce tuples where the left neighbor is 0 for i=0, which is incorrect.

I think the correct approach is to treat the list as circular, using modulo, even though the problem's wording is ambiguous. So the code would be as above.

But the problem's example says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value as 0. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle the indices as follows: if i-1 is <0, set left to 0; if i+1 >=n, set right to 0.

So for i=0:

left = 0

current = v0

right = v1

So tuple is (0, v0, v1)

But that doesn't make sense because 0 is not in the list.

I think I have to proceed with the code that treats the list as circular, using modulo to handle the indices, even though the problem's wording is ambiguous.

So the final code is:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        left = vertices[ (i-1) % n ]
        current = vertices[i]
        right = vertices[ (i+1) % n ]
        result.append( (left, current, right) )
    return result

But I'm not sure if this is what the problem wants. The problem's wording is a bit confusing.
