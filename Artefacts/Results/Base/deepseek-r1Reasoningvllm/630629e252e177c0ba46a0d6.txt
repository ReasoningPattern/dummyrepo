Okay, I need to help the user by generating Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The function is called retrieve_diaspora_host_meta and takes a single argument 'host'. The docstring explains that this function retrieves a remote Diaspora host-meta document and returns an XRD instance. So, the function is part of a module, probably named xrd, as that's a common module name in Python.

First, I'll need to import the necessary modules. Since the function returns an XRD instance, I assume the module has an import for XRD. So, I'll import XRD from 'xrd'.

Next, I'll define the function. The function will take 'host' as an argument. Inside the function, I'll create a new XRD instance using the provided host parameter. That's straightforward.

Then, I'll add a docstring to the function to explain its purpose, which is already provided in the user's question. The docstring should include the argument description and the return value.

I should also add module-level documentation, which is typically placed at the top of the module. This is usually a string that describes what the module does. In this case, the module would handle retrieving host metadata from Diaspora.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code with the import statement, the function definition, the function's docstring, and the module-level docstring. I'll make sure everything is properly indented and follows standard Python conventions.

I should also consider any potential issues. For example, if the XRD module isn't in the same directory, the user might need to import it correctly. But since the user didn't mention any issues, I'll assume the import is correct.

Finally, I'll review the code to ensure it's clean and matches the requirements: correct imports, function definition, docstrings, and proper structure.
