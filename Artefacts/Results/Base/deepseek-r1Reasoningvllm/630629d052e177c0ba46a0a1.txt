Okay, I need to write a Python function called verify_relayable_signature. The function takes three arguments: public_key, doc, and signature. The docstring explains that this function verifies the signed XML elements to confirm the author's authenticity.

First, I should think about how to parse the XML document. The xml.etree.ElementTree module is a good choice for this. So I'll import ElementTree as ET.

Next, I'll convert the doc string into an ElementTree object. Using ET.fromstring(doc) should work, assuming that the doc is properly encoded as bytes. But wait, the function signature doesn't specify the encoding, so maybe I should handle that. However, ElementTree can sometimes infer the encoding, but it's better to specify it to avoid errors. So I'll add the encoding parameter as 'utf-8'.

Then, I need to extract the root element from the tree. Using tree.getroot() should give me that.

Now, the main part is verifying the signature. The public_key is provided, but I'm not sure if it's a string or a more complex object. If it's a string, I can directly use it to create an RSA object. So I'll import RSA from the cryptography module. I'll create an instance with public_key.

Next, I need to get the signature value from the root element. I'll use tree.find b'content') to find the element with the b'' prefix, which might represent binary content. Wait, actually, the signature is usually stored in a specific element, maybe a 'signature' element within the doc. So perhaps I should look for an element with a specific tag, like 'signature'. So I'll replace get b'content' with find('signature').

Once I have the signature element, I'll extract the text using element.text. If there's no text, maybe return False.

Then, I'll pass the public_key, the signature text, and the root element to the RSA instance's verify method. The verify method returns a boolean indicating whether the signature is valid.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Import necessary modules.
2. Parse the doc string into an ElementTree.
3. Extract the public_key into an RSA object.
4. Find the signature element.
5. Verify the signature using the public key and the document element.

I should also handle any exceptions that might occur during parsing or verification. Maybe wrap the code in a try-except block to catch any errors and return False if something goes wrong.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a boolean. So if any error occurs during parsing or verification, it should return False. That makes sense.

So, putting it all together, the function will import ElementTree and RSA, parse the doc, extract the public key, find the signature, and verify it. If any step fails, it returns False.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
