Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _validate_labels and it takes 'labels' as an argument. The docstring says it checks that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value(). 

First, I should think about what this function needs to do. It probably expects 'labels' to be a dictionary. So, the first step is to check if labels is a dictionary. If it's not, maybe raise a TypeError.

Next, I need to iterate over both the keys and the values of the dictionary. For each key, I'll call validate_key(), and for each value, I'll call validate_value(). If either of these functions returns False, the entire function should raise a ValueError indicating that the labels are invalid.

Wait, but what if the labels dictionary is empty? Should it still pass validation? The problem statement doesn't specify, but it's safer to assume that an empty dictionary should be considered valid if all keys and values pass their respective validations. But actually, if there are no keys or values, then there's nothing to validate, so it should pass. So, the function can proceed as is without special handling for empty cases.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Check if labels is a dictionary. If not, raise a TypeError.
2. Iterate over each key in labels and check validate_key().
3. Iterate over each value in labels and check validate_value().
4. If any check fails, raise a ValueError with an appropriate message.

I should structure the code accordingly. So, the function starts by checking the type of labels. Then, loops through keys and values, applying the respective validation functions. If any validation fails, it raises an error.

I think that's the correct approach. Now, I'll write the code based on this logic.
