Okay, I need to write a Python function called fix_namespace_prefix_w that replaces "w:st=" with "w-st=". Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I'll look at the function signature. It takes a string content as input and returns a modified string. The docstring explains that it should replace "w:st=" with "w-st=".

So, the task is to find all occurrences of the substring "w:st=" and change them to "w-st=". I should make sure that this replacement happens exactly, without affecting other parts of the string.

I remember that Python's string method replace() can be used for this. The replace() method takes two arguments: the substring to find and the substring to replace it with. So, I can use content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=").

Wait, but what if there are multiple occurrences or edge cases? For example, if the string is empty or doesn't contain "w:st=", the replace method should just return the original string without any issues. So, I don't need to handle those cases separately.

Putting it all together, the function can be written in a single line. I'll assign the result of the replace() method to a variable, say fixed_content, and then return it.

So the function will look like:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    fixed_content = content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")
    return fixed_content

I think that's all. It's straightforward and should handle all cases as required.
