Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _c_optimizations_required and it's supposed to return a boolean indicating if C optimizations are needed.

Looking at the docstring, it says the function should return True if C optimizations are required. So, the function should just return True. There's no need for any complex logic or parameters here. It's a straightforward function.

I should make sure the function is correctly named and that it returns a boolean value. The code should be in Python markdown format, which typically means using triple backticks for code blocks. So, I'll write the code inside a triple backtick block, ensuring that the function definition is correct and that the docstring is properly formatted.

I don't need to include any explanations or reasoning, just the code. So, the final code will be a simple function returning True.
