Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _group_files_by_xml_filename and it takes three parameters: source, xmls, and files. The docstring says it groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format.

Hmm, so the function's purpose is to group files such that each XML file in the xmls list corresponds to a list of files in the files list. That makes sense. So for each xml in xmls, I need to find all the files in files that are associated with it.

I'll start by initializing an empty dictionary to hold the groups. Then, I'll loop through each XML file. For each xml, I'll get the base name by splitting the filename from the path. Then, I'll loop through each file in the corresponding files list. For each file, I'll split its name from the path as well. I'll then use the file's base name as the key in the dictionary and append the file path to the list associated with that key.

Wait, but what if the same filename appears multiple times? Oh, right, using append will handle that by adding each occurrence. So the dictionary will group all files by their base name, which is determined by the XML filename.

Putting it all together, I'll write a function that initializes the dictionary, loops through each XML file, gets the key from the file's base name, and appends each corresponding file path to the dictionary's value. Finally, the function returns the dictionary.

I think that's all. Let me structure the code accordingly.
