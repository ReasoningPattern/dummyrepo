Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called protocol_handlers and it takes two arguments: cls and protocol_version, which has a default value of None. The docstring explains that this function returns different Bolt protocol handlers based on the protocol_version.

First, I should think about what this function might do. Since it's returning handlers for different protocol versions, I'll probably need to create a dictionary that maps protocol versions to their corresponding handler classes. That makes sense because it's a common way to handle different cases in Python.

So, I'll start by defining the function with the given signature. Then, I'll create a dictionary called protocol Handlers where each key is a protocol version, and the value is the handler class. For example, HTTP might map to a handler class like Default REST Handler.

Next, I'll check if protocol_version is provided. If it is, I'll return the corresponding handler from the dictionary. If it's None, I'll return all the handlers, maybe as a sorted list to make it predictable for the user.

I should also consider error handling. What if someone passes a protocol version that's not in the dictionary? It might return None or raise a KeyError. But since the example doesn't include error handling, I'll assume it's beyond the current scope.

Putting it all together, the code will define the function, create the handlers dictionary, and then return the appropriate handler based on the input. I'll make sure to sort the list of handlers when returning all of them to provide a consistent order.
