Alright, I need to write a Python function called normalize_cmd. The function takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a tuple of strings. The docstring says it complements the full path to an executable and returns it in its original form. Hmm, so I'm guessing the function is meant to handle command-line arguments, ensuring that each path is properly resolved.

First, I should think about what "complement the full path" means. Maybe it's about resolving any relative paths in the command line arguments. For example, if someone runs a script that expects an image path, and the user provides a relative path like 'some/image.jpg', the function should resolve that to the correct file path.

I remember that in Python, the os module has a path utilities, but I don't think there's a built-in function to resolve paths from a tuple. So I'll probably need to loop through each element in the input tuple and resolve each path.

Wait, but how do I handle different operating systems? The function should be cross-platform, right? So I'll need to import os and maybe use os.path functions. But wait, os.path's realpath function is platform-dependent, so maybe I should use that. However, realpath can return None on Windows if the path doesn't exist. But in this case, since we're normalizing the command, perhaps it's acceptable to let it resolve or maybe return the original path if it's not found. But the problem statement doesn't specify error handling, so maybe I'll proceed without handling exceptions.

So the plan is: for each string in the input tuple, resolve the path using os.path's realpath or something similar. But wait, realpath returns the absolute path, but sometimes it might not exist, which could cause issues. Alternatively, maybe using expanduser could also be necessary if there are tilde (~) expansions.

So perhaps I should first expand any user home directory tildes, then resolve any relative paths. Using os.path.expanduser followed by os.path.realpath might be the way to go. But I should test this logic.

Let me think about an example. Suppose the input is ('myscript', './image.jpg', '../config.yaml'). After normalization, it should become ('myscript', '/path/to/image.jpg', '/path/to/config.yaml'), assuming the current working directory is /path/to.

But wait, if the script is run from a different directory, the relative paths would need to be resolved correctly. So using realpath should handle that.

So the steps for each element in the tuple would be:

1. Take the string.
2. Use os.path.expanduser to handle any ~ expansions.
3. Use os.path.realpath to resolve the relative path to an absolute path.
4. Replace the original string with the resolved path.

But what if the resolved path is None? Maybe in that case, we leave it as is, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps we can proceed without handling that for now.

Now, considering that the function returns a tuple, I'll need to process each element in the input tuple and create a new tuple with the resolved paths.

Putting it all together, the function will import os, loop through each command in the input tuple, resolve each command, and collect them into a new tuple to return.

Wait, but the function is called normalize_cmd and takes cmd as a tuple of strings. So in code:

import os

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    normalized = []
    for cmd_str in cmd:
        # Resolve the path
        resolved = os.path.realpath(os.path.expanduser(cmd_str))
        normalized.append(resolved)
    return tuple(normalized)

Wait, but what if the resolved path is None? For example, if the path doesn't exist. In that case, the function would return None in the tuple, which might cause issues when executing the commands. But again, the problem statement doesn't specify handling such cases, so perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the function should leave the path as is if it can't be resolved. So the code above should work.

I think that's a solid approach. So the function will import os, loop through each command, expand user home, resolve the path, and return the new tuple.
