Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_silent_args and it's an instance method, so it should have 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring explains that this function returns a list of silenced argument names. 

The parameter is named 'args', which is the received arguments. The return type is a list. I remember that in Python, to get the argument names, we can use the inspect module, specifically inspect.signature. So I'll need to import that.

First, I'll import inspect at the top. Then, inside the function, I'll get the signature using inspect.signature(self.func). Then, I'll retrieve the parameters using signature.parameters(). 

Next, I need to filter these parameters. The function should return only those parameters that are marked as 'silenced'. I think the 'silenced' parameter in the signature has a default value of False, so I'll check where default is None, which would indicate that the parameter is not silenced.

I'll collect the names of these parameters into a list and return it. I should make sure the list is returned in the correct order, so using a list comprehension should work.

Putting it all together, the function will import inspect, get the signature, filter the parameters, and return their names. I'll make sure the docstring is properly included and that the code is clean and concise.
