Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_run_el and it takes an object as an argument. The docstring says it checks whether the object's class has the run method. 

Hmm, so the function should return True if the class of obj has a method named run, otherwise False. I remember that in Python, we can check if a class has a method using the hasattr() function. 

So the function would look something like this: return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run'). That makes sense because obj.__class__ gives the class of the object, and then we check for the 'run' attribute.

Wait, should I consider any exceptions or edge cases? Well, if obj is not an instance of a class, but maybe a class itself, but in this case, since it's an object, it should work. The function is straightforward, so I think the code is simple enough without needing additional checks.

So putting it all together, the function is one line: return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run').
