Okay, so the user wants me to generate Python code based on a given function signature and docstring. They specified that I shouldn't include any explanations or markdown, just the code. Let me break this down.

First, looking at the function signature: it's a method called set_cut_chars, taking two arguments, before and after, both bytes, and returning None. The docstring explains that before and after are used as delimiters to split a file.

I remember that in Python, the splitfile module is used to split files into before and after parts. So, the function likely uses splitfile.split to handle this. The method would probably take a filename as an argument, which isn't shown here, but since the function signature provided doesn't include it, maybe the user expects the method to be part of a class that's already handling file operations.

Wait, the user's function is a method, so it should be part of a class. The method needs to take self, before, and after. The code should probably open the file, split it using before and after, and then close it properly to avoid resource leaks.

I should import splitfile from the splitfile module. Then, inside the method, open the file in read-binary mode. Use splitfile.split with before and after, and pass the filename. If any exceptions occur during splitting, it's good to close the file to clean up.

Putting it all together, the code would import splitfile, define the method, handle the file operations, and ensure resources are managed. I think that's all the user needs for this function.
