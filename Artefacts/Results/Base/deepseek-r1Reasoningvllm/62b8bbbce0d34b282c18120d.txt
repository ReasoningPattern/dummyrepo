Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_file_exist that checks whether a given file_name exists. The function should return True if the file exists and False otherwise. 

First, I should think about how to check for a file's existence in Python. I remember that the os module has functions for this. The os.path.exists() function can take a filename and a path, and it returns True if the file or directory exists.

Wait, but the function signature only takes file_name as an argument. So I need to make sure that the function can handle cases where file_name might include the full path or just a relative path. The os.path.exists() function should handle both cases, right? Because it uses the current working directory if the path isn't fully specified.

So, the plan is to import the os module and use os.path.exists(file_name). That should do it.

I should also consider any potential errors, like if the file doesn't exist. But since the function is supposed to check existence, it doesn't need to handle errors; it just needs to return a boolean.

Putting it all together, the function will import os, then return the result of os.path.exists(file_name).

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
