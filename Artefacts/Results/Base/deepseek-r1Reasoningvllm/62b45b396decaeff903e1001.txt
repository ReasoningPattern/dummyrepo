Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called amend_bzparams and it takes two arguments: self, params, and bug_ids. The docstring says it's for amending Bugzilla params.

First, I'll start by writing the function definition. It should be a method, so I'll include self as the first parameter. The parameters are params and bug_ids, so I'll define them inside the function.

Next, I need to process each bug_id in bug_ids. For each id, I'll check if it's in the params. If it is, I'll remove it and then add it back with a new value. The new value is the bug_id itself, so I'll set params[bug_id] = bug_id.

I should loop through each bug_id using a for loop. Inside the loop, I'll use the 'in' operator to check membership. If the condition is true, perform the removal and addition.

I'll make sure the code is clean and efficient, handling each bug_id appropriately without causing any key errors. That should cover the functionality described in the docstring.
