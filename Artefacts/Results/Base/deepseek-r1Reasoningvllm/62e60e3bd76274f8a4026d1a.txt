Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called from_raw_values, takes a cls argument which is the class, and a values list of raw bookmark strings. The docstring says it creates a Bookmarks object from these values.

First, I should think about what a Bookmarks object typically contains. Usually, it has attributes like 'url' and 'title'. So I'll need to initialize an instance of cls with these attributes.

I'll start by creating a new instance: obj = cls(url=url, title=title). But wait, I need to loop through the values list to extract these attributes. Each value in values corresponds to a bookmark, and each bookmark has url and title.

So I'll loop over each value in values. For each value, I'll split it into url and title. Maybe using the split() method, but I should check if there's a specific delimiter. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume a single space separates them.

So for url, I'll take the first part: url = value.split()[0]. For title, the rest of the string after the first space: title = ' '.join(value.split()[1:]). This handles cases where titles might have multiple words.

After processing each value, I'll assign these to the instance's attributes. So obj.url = url and obj.title = title.

Putting it all together, I'll initialize the object, then loop through each value, updating the attributes each time. Finally, return the obj.

I should make sure the code is properly indented and fits within the function. Testing edge cases, like if a value doesn't have both url and title, but the problem probably assumes all values are valid.

So the code will look like:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    obj = cls()
    for value in values:
        url = value.split()[0]
        title = ' '.join(value.split()[1:])
        obj.url = url
        obj.title = title
    return obj

I think that's it. It initializes the object, processes each value to set the attributes, and returns the filled object.
