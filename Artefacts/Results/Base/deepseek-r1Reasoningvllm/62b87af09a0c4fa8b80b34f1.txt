Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called fill, and it's part of a class since it has a self parameter. The function takes two arguments: coord and weight, with weight defaulting to 1.

First, I should think about how the function will handle the coord parameter. The docstring mentions that coordinates outside the histogram edges are ignored, so the function needs to check if coord is within the valid range. If it's not, the function should do nothing.

So, I'll need to access the histogram's edges. I'll assume that the class has attributes like lower and upper, which define the valid range. If coord is less than lower or greater than upper, it's ignored.

If the coordinate is valid, the function will add the weight to the corresponding bin. I'll need an attribute like data to store the accumulated weights. I'll check if the coordinate is an integer to index into the data list. If it's not an integer, perhaps because it's a float or out of bounds, I'll raise an error.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if coord is within lower and upper.
2. If not, return.
3. Check if coord is an integer.
4. If yes, add the weight to data[coord].
5. If not, raise a ValueError.

I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle all these cases. Also, I'll include the docstring as given.
