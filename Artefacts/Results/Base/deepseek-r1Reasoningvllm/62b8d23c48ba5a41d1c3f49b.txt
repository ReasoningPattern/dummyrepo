Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's part of a class, indicated by the self parameter. The docstring says it should remove and return the most recently used (key, value) pair.

Hmm, I remember that in Python, the built-in dict type has an popitem() method. That method by default removes and returns the last item added, which is considered the most recently added. So I can model this function after that.

The function should return a tuple containing the key and value of the removed item. If the dictionary is empty, it should probably raise a KeyError, which is the usual behavior for such methods.

So the code structure would be straightforward. I'll define the function with self, then return self.popitem(). Adding a docstring that explains what it does, similar to the provided one.

Wait, the user provided a docstring that says "Remove and return the (key, value) pair most recently used." My function's docstring is already given, so I just need to include it as a string.

Putting it all together, the function will simply call the built-in popitem method on the dictionary instance and return the result. That should satisfy the requirements.
