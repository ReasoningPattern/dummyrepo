Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called cachedmethod and it's supposed to be a decorator that checks a cache. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function signature is def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. So it takes three arguments: cache, key function, and lock. The docstring says it returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.

Wait, so cachedmethod is a higher-order function that takes cache, key, and lock, and returns another function, the decorator. This decorator will be used to decorate another function, let's say func. The purpose of this decorator is to check if the result of func is already in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached result; otherwise, it calls the original function and stores the result in the cache.

I remember that in Python, a decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function. So the decorator returned by cachedmethod will handle the caching logic.

Let me outline the steps the decorator should perform:

1. When the decorated function (func) is called, the decorator will compute the result.
2. It will check if the result is already in the cache using the provided key function.
3. If the result is found, it returns it immediately.
4. If not, it calls func to compute the result, stores it in the cache using the key, and then returns the result.

So the decorator inside cachedmethod should look something like this:

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # compute key based on args and kwargs
        key = key_function(args, kwargs)
        # check if key exists in cache
        if key in cache:
            return cache[key]
        else:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            cache[key] = result
            return result
    return wrapper

Wait, but the key parameter in cachedmethod is the key function. So in the decorator, I should use that key function. But in the current setup, the key is passed as a parameter to cachedmethod. So in the decorator, I need to capture that key function.

Wait, no. The key parameter in cachedmethod is the default, so when the decorator is created, the key function is fixed. So inside the decorator, I can just use the key parameter from the outer function.

So the decorator function inside cachedmethod would be:

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = key  # because key is a variable in the outer scope
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        cache[key] = result
        return result
    return wrapper

Wait, but what if the key is a function? Because the default is hashkey, which I assume is a function that generates a hash key from the arguments. So in the wrapper, I need to compute the key using the key function provided when the decorator was created.

Wait, no. The key parameter is the key function, which is a function that takes args and kwargs and returns a hashable type. So in the wrapper, I should compute the key by calling key(*args, **kwargs). Or wait, no. Because the key parameter is the function itself. So in the decorator, the key is the function that generates the key. So in the wrapper, I should compute the key by calling key(*args, **kwargs).

Wait, no, because the key parameter is the function. So in the wrapper, I should compute the key as key(*args, **kwargs). But wait, in the decorator, the key is a function, so when the wrapper is called, it should pass args and kwargs to the key function to generate the cache key.

Wait, no. The key parameter is the function that generates the key. So in the wrapper, I need to call key(*args, **kwargs) to get the cache key.

Wait, but in the initial code I wrote, I just used key = key, which would capture the variable name, not call it. That's a mistake. So I need to fix that.

So the correct approach is:

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = key(*args, **kwargs)  # call the key function with args and kwargs
        if key in cache:
            return cache[key]
        else:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            cache[key] = result
            return result
    return wrapper

But wait, what if the lock is provided? The original function signature includes a lock parameter. Hmm, the user didn't mention it in the initial problem, but perhaps the lock is used for thread safety. So in the wrapper, when storing the result in the cache, it should acquire the lock if it's not None.

So I need to modify the wrapper to acquire the lock before storing the result. So using a threading.Lock, but perhaps the lock parameter is a lock object. So in the code, before storing, I should lock the cache, compute the result, then store, then unlock.

Wait, but the lock parameter is optional, defaulting to None. So if lock is None, no locking is done. Otherwise, it's assumed to be a lock object.

So the code inside the else block should be:

if lock is not None:
    lock.acquire()
    cache[key] = result
    lock.release()
else:
    cache[key] = result

Putting it all together, the decorator becomes:

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = key(*args, **kwargs)
        if lock is not None:
            with lock:
                if key in cache:
                    return cache[key]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key] = result
                    return result
        else:
            if key in cache:
                return cache[key]
            else:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key] = result
                return result
    return wrapper

Wait, but perhaps it's better to structure it with the lock acquired before checking and storing. So using a with statement if lock is not None.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to structure it as:

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if lock is not None:
            with lock:
                key = key(*args, **kwargs)
                if key in cache:
                    return cache[key]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key] = result
                    return result
        else:
            key = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if key in cache:
                return cache[key]
            else:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key] = result
                return result
    return wrapper

But that's a bit repetitive. Alternatively, we can structure it to handle locking in a more concise way.

Another approach is to have a helper function to safely get the key and store the result, considering the lock.

But perhaps for simplicity, the code can be written as:

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = key(*args, **kwargs)
        if lock is not None:
            with lock:
                if key in cache:
                    return cache[key]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key] = result
                    return result
        else:
            if key in cache:
                return cache[key]
            else:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key] = result
                return result
    return wrapper

Wait, but in the case where lock is not None, the with statement will ensure that the lock is acquired before accessing the cache. So even if another thread calls the wrapper, the lock will protect the cache access.

So putting it all together, the code for the decorator is as above.

Now, putting it all into the function:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key in cache:
                        return cache[key]
                    else:
                        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                        cache[key] = result
                        return result
            else:
                if key in cache:
                    return cache[key]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key] = result
                    return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but in the initial code, the key parameter is the key function, which is used to generate the cache key. So in the wrapper, we call key(*args, **kwargs) to get the key.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the final code should be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key in cache:
                        return cache[key]
                    else:
                        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                        cache[key] = result
                        return result
            else:
                if key in cache:
                    return cache[key]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key] = result
                    return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

I think this should work. It's a decorator factory that returns a decorator which checks the cache, and if not found, calls the function, stores the result, and returns it.
