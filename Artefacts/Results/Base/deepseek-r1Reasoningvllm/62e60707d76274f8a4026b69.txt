Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called point_type and it's supposed to dynamically generate a Point class. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes three arguments: name, fields, and srid_map. The docstring explains that it's dynamically generating a Point class, so I need to create a class with specific attributes and methods based on the inputs.

The name parameter is the name of the class being generated. So, whatever code I write inside this function will define a class with that name.

Next, the fields parameter is a dictionary containing the fields of the class. Each key in this dictionary is a field name, and the value is another dictionary with 'type' and 'default' keys. For example, {'x': {'type': 'float', 'default': 0.0}, 'y': {'type': 'float', 'default': 0.0}}.

The srid_map parameter is a dictionary that maps SRID values to their display names. This is probably for mapping different coordinate systems to their human-readable names, like 'WGS84' for EPSG:4326.

So, the function needs to create a class with an __init__ method that initializes the attributes based on the fields provided. Each attribute should have a corresponding __setattr__ method to control access, making these attributes read-only unless an initial value is provided.

Wait, but in the example code I saw earlier, the __setattr__ method was used to set the attributes only if they don't already exist. That way, once an initial value is set, you can't change it. That makes sense for a Point class where once you create an instance, you shouldn't modify its attributes.

I should also include the __init__ method that takes self and an optional arguments dictionary. This allows for keyword arguments to be passed when creating an instance of the class.

Now, for each field in the fields dictionary, I need to add an attribute to the class. The type can be either 'text' or something else, but for a Point class, maybe it's always a numeric type. But I'll keep it general as per the function's design.

The srid_map is used when the class is instantiated. So, in the __init__ method, for each field that's in srid_map, I'll check if the SRID is present and then get the corresponding display name. If it's not present, I'll use the SRID as the name.

Wait, but in the example code, the __setattr__ method was used to set the attributes, and the __init__ method was dynamically created using type(). So, I need to make sure that the code correctly generates the class with the right attributes and methods.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Check if the class already exists. If it does, it raises an error to prevent overriding.

2. Dynamically create the class using type(), specifying the name, bases (probably object), and a namespace dictionary.

3. In the namespace, define the __setattr__ and __init__ methods.

4. For each field in fields, add an attribute to the class. The attribute name is the field, and the setter method will check if the value is provided; if so, set it as an instance variable, else raise an error.

5. The __init__ method will take the arguments, assign each field from the arguments, using the srid_map for SRID values.

So, the code inside the function will involve creating these methods dynamically. I'll use a loop to add each attribute to the class, and define the __init__ method using a function that takes *args and **kwargs, then assigns each field.

I think that's the general approach. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to handle each part correctly without any errors.
