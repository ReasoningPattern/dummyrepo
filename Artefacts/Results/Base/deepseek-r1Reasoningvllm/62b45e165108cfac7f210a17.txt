Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_logical_path_map and it takes two parameters: inventory and version. The docstring says it returns a dictionary of file paths of the states in the inventory. 

First, I should figure out what the function needs to do. It probably processes the inventory data, which is likely a list of state dictionaries, each containing a 'path' key. But maybe sometimes the path isn't present, so I should handle that by checking if 'path' exists in each state.

I'll start by initializing an empty dictionary, maybe called path_map. Then, I'll loop through each state in the inventory. For each state, I'll check if 'path' is a key in the state dictionary. If it is, I'll add it to the path_map with the state's version as the key. Wait, no, the version is a parameter, so perhaps each version corresponds to a specific path. Or maybe each state's version is used as the key. Hmm, maybe I should think about how the function is supposed to map versions to paths. 

Wait, the function is called get_logical_path_map, which suggests that each version corresponds to a logical path. So perhaps each state's version is a key, and the value is the path. Or maybe the inventory contains all the states across versions, and the function is grouping them by version. 

Wait, the function's docstring says it returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in a dict type. So each key in the dict is a version, and the value is the path. So I need to group the states by their version and collect their paths. But what if multiple states have the same version? Should they overwrite each other or be aggregated somehow? The problem statement isn't clear, but perhaps each version maps to a single path, so if there are multiple states with the same version, maybe the last one or the first one is taken. Alternatively, perhaps each state's version is unique, so each version maps to one path.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to create a path for each version, but I'm not sure. The function's name suggests it's getting the logical path map based on the inventory and version. So perhaps for each version in the inventory, the function collects the corresponding path.

Wait, perhaps the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with a 'version' and a 'path' key. So for each state in inventory, we extract the version and path. Then, the function returns a dictionary where each key is a version and the value is the path. But that would mean that if multiple states have the same version, the last one would overwrite the previous in the dictionary. Alternatively, maybe we should aggregate the paths, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the version is a key in each state, and the function is supposed to collect all the paths for each version across all states. So the resulting dictionary would have all versions present in the inventory, each mapping to their respective paths. But if a version appears multiple times, what happens? The last occurrence's path would be the value.

So, the code would look something like this: loop through each state in inventory, for each state, if the version key exists, add it to the path_map with the path as the value. But wait, the function's docstring says it returns the file paths of the states in the inventory, so perhaps each state's version is the key, and the path is the value. So the code would be:

path_map = {}
for state in inventory:
    if 'version' in state and 'path' in state:
        version = state['version']
        path = state['path']
        path_map[version] = path
return path_map

Wait, but the function is called with 'version' as a parameter. So perhaps the function is supposed to create a path for each version, but I'm not sure how that interacts with the inventory. Maybe the inventory contains all the states across all versions, and the function is grouping them by version. Or perhaps each state in the inventory has a specific version, and the function is mapping each version to its path.

Alternatively, perhaps the version parameter is the version of the state, and each state's path is determined based on that version. But without more context, it's hard to tell. But the function's docstring says it returns a dictionary of file paths, so perhaps each version in the inventory corresponds to a path, and the function maps versions to paths.

So, the code would loop through each state in inventory, check if 'version' and 'path' are present, and add them to the dictionary. If a version appears multiple times, the last one would overwrite.

Wait, but the function's parameter is 'version', which is a single value, not a list. So perhaps the function is supposed to process all states in the inventory that have the given version. So, for example, if version is 'v1', the function returns a dictionary where each key is a version (maybe the same as the input) and the value is the path of the state(s) with that version.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to collect all the paths from the inventory, but keyed by version. So, for each state in inventory, if the state has a 'version' key, then the version is the key in the resulting dictionary, and the value is the path. So, the code would be:

path_map = {}
for state in inventory:
    if 'version' in state and 'path' in state:
        version = state['version']
        path = state['path']
        if version in path_map:
            # What to do if multiple states for the same version?
            # Maybe overwrite or append? The problem doesn't specify.
            # For now, I'll overwrite.
            path_map[version] = path
return path_map

But wait, the function's docstring says it returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type. So perhaps each state contributes its own version and path, and the function aggregates them. But if the version is the same, it's unclear. Maybe the function should return a dictionary where each version is a key, and the value is a list of paths for that version. That would make sense if multiple states have the same version.

So perhaps the code should be:

path_map = {}
for state in inventory:
    if 'version' in state and 'path' in state:
        version = state['version']
        path = state['path']
        if version not in path_map:
            path_map[version] = []
        path_map[version].append(path)
return path_map

But the problem statement isn't clear on whether each version should have a single path or a list of paths. The function's name suggests it's a map, which usually implies a single value per key, but maybe it's a list.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each version is a key, and the value is the path of the state with that version. So if a version appears multiple times, the last one is used. That would make sense if the inventory has multiple states for the same version, and we want the last occurrence's path.

So, in that case, the code would be:

path_map = {}
for state in inventory:
    if 'version' in state and 'path' in state:
        version = state['version']
        path = state['path']
        path_map[version] = path  # Overwrite if version exists
return path_map

But I'm not sure if that's the intended behavior. However, without more context, I'll proceed with this approach.

So, putting it all together, the function initializes an empty dictionary, loops through each state in inventory, checks for 'version' and 'path' keys, and adds them to the dictionary, overwriting any existing version.

So the code would look like this:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        if 'version' in state and 'path' in state:
            path_map[state['version']] = state['path']
    return path_map

Wait, but the function's parameter is 'version', which is a single value. So perhaps the function is supposed to process all states in the inventory that have that specific version. So, for example, if version is 'v1', the function returns a dictionary where each key is a version (maybe just 'v1') and the value is the path of the state(s) with that version.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to collect all the paths, and the keys are the versions from the inventory. So, the code would be as I wrote above.

I think that's the correct approach. So the final code is as written.
