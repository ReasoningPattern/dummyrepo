Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_spec_defaults and it's supposed to resolve arguments' values from the spec and other sources, using self._get_defaults(). 

First, I'll start by defining the function with the correct signature. The docstring is already provided, so I'll include that. The function doesn't take any parameters, so the definition is straightforward.

Next, I'll write the function body. The docstring mentions resolving values from spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). So, I'll call this method on self and return its result. 

Putting it all together, the function will return whatever self._get_defaults() returns. That should fulfill the requirement as per the docstring.
