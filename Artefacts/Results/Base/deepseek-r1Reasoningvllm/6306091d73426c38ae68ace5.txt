Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _include_groups and it's supposed to resolve the include dict directive in spec files. 

First, I'll start by looking at the function signature. It's a method, so I'll add an indentation level. The parameters are self and parser_dict. The docstring explains that it resolves the include directive, so I'll include that as a comment.

I remember that in Python, when handling such directives, we often split the input string by semicolons to get individual directives. So I'll split parser_dict into parts using ';' as the delimiter. Then, I'll loop through each directive.

For each directive, I'll strip any whitespace around it. If the directive is 'include', I'll take the next part, which is the filename, strip whitespace again, and add it to a list. If it's 'exclude', I'll do the same but add it to an excludes list instead.

Wait, but in the code, I need to collect the includes and excludes. So I'll initialize two empty lists: includes and excludes. Then, for each directive, if it's 'include', append the filename to includes. If it's 'exclude', append to excludes.

Once all directives are processed, I need to modify the parser_dict. I'll use the update method on the parser_dict, passing both includes and excludes as a single argument since they are lists. This way, the parser can apply the include and exclude rules.

Putting it all together, the function will process each directive, collect the necessary paths, and update the parser_dict accordingly. I should make sure the code is clean and follows proper indentation for readability.
