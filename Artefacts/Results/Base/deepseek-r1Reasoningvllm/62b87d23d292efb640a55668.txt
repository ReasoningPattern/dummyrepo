Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_config, and it's supposed to return a new VersioneerConfig instance and set various attributes on it. 

First, I'll start by defining the function. Since the docstring mentions returning a new VersioneerConfig, I'll import the VersioneerConfig class. I'll make sure to import it from the correct module, probably 'sphinxext(versioneer)'.

Next, inside the function, I'll create an instance of VersioneerConfig using a new() method. Then, I need to set various attributes. The docstring doesn't specify exactly which attributes to set, but I'll include common ones that VersioneerConfig might have. 

I'll set the root URL to something like 'https://github.com/' as a placeholder. The compiler options can be a dictionary with common settings, like truncation and pretty printer. 

I'll add some settings like use twelve, use abbreviated month names, and force use of pluralization. Including a minimum release version makes sense, so I'll set that to '2020-01-01'. 

The extensions can be a list, maybe including 'sphinxcontrib', 'sphinxext', and 'myst' as examples. 

For the language settings, I'll include common languages like 'en', 'es', and 'fr'. The default language can be 'en'.

The copy options should include things like url, srcdir, and outdir, with appropriate defaults. 

The root namespace is usually 'https://github.com/' as well.

I'll set the html options to include 'code-blocks', 'download links', and 'toctree' for better documentation. 

The theme can be set to 'sphinx', which is a common default.

I'll add some additional configuration like html_theme_options for dark theme, html_sidekicks for extra links, and html_distalink for better link display.

Finally, I'll include a custom meta description for the documentation. 

I'll make sure all the attributes are properly set on the config instance. 

I'll test the code to ensure it runs without errors, but since it's just setting attributes, it should be straightforward. 

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
