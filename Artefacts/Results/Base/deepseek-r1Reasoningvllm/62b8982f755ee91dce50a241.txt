Okay, I need to write a Python method called normalized in a class. The docstring says it should normalize all units of time to integers. Hmm, so I'm thinking this method probably converts time units like seconds, milliseconds, etc., into a single integer representation.

First, I should figure out which time units are involved. Common ones include seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, and maybe even larger units like days, hours, etc. But the problem says "all units," so I might need to handle as many as possible.

Wait, but how do I convert all these into integers? Maybe by converting everything into the smallest unit, like nanoseconds, and then summing them all up as an integer. That makes sense because it's a common approach to normalize time into a single unit.

So, I'll need to get each time unit from the instance. Let's assume the class has attributes like self.seconds, self.milliseconds, etc. For each attribute, I'll convert it to nanoseconds. For example, 1 second is 1e9 nanoseconds, so I multiply by 1e9. Similarly, milliseconds would be multiplied by 1e6, and so on.

I should loop through each unit. Maybe I can have a list of tuples where each tuple contains the unit name and the conversion factor to nanoseconds. That way, I can iterate over this list and accumulate the total.

Let me think about the conversion factors:
- 1 second = 1e9 nanoseconds
- 1 millisecond = 1e6 nanoseconds
- 1 microsecond = 1e3 nanoseconds
- 1 nanosecond = 1 nanosecond
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds, so 3600e9 nanoseconds
- 1 day = 24 hours, so 24*3600e9
- 1 week = 7 days, so 7*24*3600e9
- 1 month is a bit tricky, but maybe approximate it as 30 days, so 30*24*3600e9
- 1 year as 365 days, so 365*24*3600e9

I'll include all these in the list. Then, for each unit, I'll multiply the attribute value by the conversion factor and add it to the total.

Wait, but what if the instance doesn't have some of these attributes? I should check if each attribute exists before trying to access it to avoid errors.

So, the code structure would be:
- Initialize total to 0
- Loop through each unit and factor in the list
- For each unit, if the attribute exists, convert it and add to total
- Return the total as an integer

Putting it all together, I'll write a loop that goes through each unit, checks if the attribute is present, converts it, and accumulates the total. Finally, return the total.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
