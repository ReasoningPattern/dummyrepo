Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _parse_image_ref, and it takes an image_href as a string parameter. It's supposed to return a tuple with three elements: image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. Also, it should raise a ValueError if something goes wrong.

First, I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the function is parsing an HTTP URL, I'll need to use urllib.parse to handle the parsing. So I'll import urlparse from urllib.parse.

Next, I'll define the function. The parameter is image_href, which is a string. The function will try to parse this string into a URL object.

I'll assign the parsed result to a variable, maybe called parsed_url. Then, I'll check if parsed_url is None. If it is, that means the URL couldn't be parsed, so I'll raise a ValueError with a message indicating that.

If parsed_url is not None, I'll extract the netloc using parsed_url.netloc. That should give me the network location part, like 'example.com'.

For the image_id, I think I need to extract the path from the URL. The path is everything after the hostname. I can use parsed_url.path for that. But wait, the path might be an empty string if the image_href is just 'http://' or doesn't have a path. So I should check if the path is empty. If it is, raise another ValueError, maybe saying the image reference doesn't contain an image path.

Assuming the path isn't empty, I'll take parsed_url.path as the image_id. 

Now, for the use_ssl flag. I remember that urlparse doesn't directly give me whether SSL was used. So I'll need to check if the scheme is 'https'. If the scheme is 'https', then use_ssl should be True; otherwise, it's False.

Putting it all together, the function will try to parse the URL, extract the necessary parts, and handle cases where the parsing fails or the path is missing.

I should also consider edge cases, like if the image_href has query parameters or fragments. But since the function is designed to extract the image_id from the path, those parts might be ignored, which is probably acceptable as per the problem statement.

So, the code will look something like this: parse the URL, check for None, extract netloc, check for empty path, then get the scheme to determine use_ssl, and return the tuple.

I should make sure to raise ValueError with appropriate messages for each case where parsing fails or the path is missing.

Finally, I'll write the code, making sure it's clean and follows the function signature provided.
