Okay, I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that takes a list of nodes and merges any duplicate keys. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, I should think about how to handle this.

First, I'll consider that each node in the list could be a MappingNode, which I assume is a dictionary. If two nodes have the same key, I need to merge their values. But if the values are not dictionaries, I just take the last one.

I'll start by initializing a dictionary to hold the merged results. I'll iterate through each node in the input list. For each key in the node, I'll check if it's already in the merged dictionary.

If the key isn't in the dictionary, I'll add it with its value. But if it is, I need to check the type of the existing value. If it's a MappingNode (dictionary), I'll update it by deep merging the new value. If it's not a MappingNode, I'll just overwrite it with the new value.

Wait, how do I deep merge the dictionaries? I think I need a helper function for that. Let's call it deep_merge. This function will take two dictionaries and merge them, recursively. For each key in the new dictionary, if the key exists in the existing one, it will merge the values. If not, it adds the key.

So, in the helper function, I'll loop through each key in the second dictionary. For each key, if it's in the first dict, I'll call deep_merge again. Otherwise, I'll add it to the first dict.

Putting it all together, I'll loop through each node, then each key in the node. For each key, I'll either add it to the merged dict or deep_merge if it's a MappingNode.

I should test this logic with an example. Suppose nodes = [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'b': 3, 'c':4}, {'b':5, 'd':6}]. The merged dict should have 'a':1, 'b':5, 'c':4, 'd':6.

Wait, but in the helper function, when merging, it should handle nested structures. For example, if a value is a dict containing another dict, it should merge those as well.

I think this approach should handle all cases. Now, I'll write the code, making sure to include the helper function inside the main function or as a nested function.

I should also handle the case where the value is not a MappingNode. In that case, just assign it without deep merging.

So, the code structure will be:

- Define deep_merge_nodes function.
- Initialize merged as empty dict.
- For each node in nodes:
  - For each key, value in node.items():
    - If key in merged:
      - If isinstance(merged[key], MappingNode):
        - Call deep_merge on merged[key] and value
      - Else:
        - Update merged[key] with value
    - Else:
      - Add key to merged with value
- Return merged

Wait, but in Python, how do I check if something is a MappingNode? I think the user has a specific class called MappingNode, so I'll assume it's imported or defined elsewhere. So, I'll use isinstance(node, MappingNode).

I'll also need to define the deep_merge function. It should take two dicts and merge them deeply. So, in the helper function, for each key in the second dict, if it exists in the first, deep_merge the values. Otherwise, add the key.

Putting it all together, the code should look like the one provided earlier. I think that's correct.
