Okay, I need to generate Python code for a function called _resolve_string based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is supposed to get a value from the environment using a matcher that contains a name and an optional default value. If the variable isn't found and there's no default, it should raise an Error.

First, I'll look at the function signature. The function takes a parameter called matcher, which is a dictionary with 'name' and possibly 'default'. So, the function needs to extract 'name' from this dictionary.

Next, I need to get the environment variables. I'll use os.environ.get() for this because it allows checking if a variable exists without causing an error. If the variable isn't found, it returns None.

Then, I'll check if the 'default' key exists in the matcher. If it does, I'll return the default value. If not, I'll check if the environment variable exists. If it does, return its value; if not, raise an Error.

Wait, the docstring says if the variable isn't defined and no default is provided, raise an Error. So, I should only raise an error if both 'default' is not present and the environment variable doesn't exist.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Get the 'name' from the matcher.
2. Check if the environment has the 'name' variable.
3. If it does, return its value.
4. If not, check if 'default' is in the matcher. If yes, return the default.
5. If neither is available, raise an Error.

I should also import the os module at the top to use os.environ.

So, the code will start with importing os, then define the function. Inside, get the env var, check for default, else check existence, else raise.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
