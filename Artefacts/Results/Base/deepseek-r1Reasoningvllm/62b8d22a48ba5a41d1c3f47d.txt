Okay, I need to write a Python method called pop based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function is supposed to behave like a dictionary's pop method but with some custom behavior. The signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, so it's an instance method, meaning it's part of a class, probably something like a custom dict subclass.

The docstring says that D.pop(k[,d]) returns the value associated with key if present, else returns default if given, else raises KeyError. So it's similar to the built-in dict.pop, but with a default provided as the second argument.

Wait, in the built-in dict, the pop method takes key and optional default. So the default is the second argument, but in the code, the default is set to __marker. I think __marker is a special variable, maybe a class-level variable in the class where this method is defined.

So the method needs to check if the key exists in self. If it does, return self[key] and remove it. If not, return the default value, which is __marker. But wait, in the built-in dict, if the key isn't found and no default is given, it raises a KeyError. So in this case, if default isn't provided, we should still raise KeyError if the key isn't found.

Wait, looking at the docstring again: If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised. So the default is only used if the key isn't found. So the method should behave like that.

So the steps are:

1. Check if the key exists in self.
2. If it does, remove it and return the value.
3. If it doesn't, return the default value (which is __marker).
4. But if default isn't provided, raise KeyError.

Wait, no. The function signature has default=__marker, which is the second argument. So when the user calls pop without providing a default, it's using __marker as default. But in the case where the key isn't found, if default is provided, return it; else, raise KeyError.

Wait, the function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, so the default is optional. So when the user calls pop without a default, default is __marker. But in the case where the key isn't found, if default is given (i.e., __marker), return it. If not given, raise KeyError.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The function's default parameter is __marker, so when the user doesn't provide a default, it's set to __marker. So when the key isn't found, and default is __marker, return __marker. If the user provides a default, say 0, and the key isn't found, return 0.

So the logic is:

if key in self:
    value = self.pop(key)
else:
    if default is not provided (i.e., not passed?), wait no, default is a parameter, so if the user doesn't pass it, it's __marker. So if the key isn't found, return default (which is __marker) if provided, else raise KeyError.

Wait, no. The function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, which means default is a required argument, but it's given a default value of __marker. So when the user calls pop without providing a default, it's set to __marker. So in the method, if the key isn't found, it should check if default is provided (i.e., not the default value). Wait, no, because the default is set to __marker, so if the user doesn't provide it, it's __marker. So in the method, if the key isn't found, and default is __marker, we return it. But if the key isn't found and default is not provided, we raise KeyError.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me structure it:

When the method is called, it can be called with or without the default argument. So in Python, if the default is set, it's only used when the argument isn't provided. So when the user calls pop(key), default is __marker. When they call pop(key, 5), default is 5.

So in the method:

- If key exists: remove it and return the value.
- Else: if default is provided (i.e., not the default value), return default.
- Else: raise KeyError.

Wait, no. Because the default parameter is __marker, which is a class variable. So in the method, if the default is __marker, that means the user didn't provide one. So in that case, if the key isn't found, we should raise KeyError.

Wait, that's the opposite. Let me think again.

In the function signature, default is __marker, which is a class-level variable. So when the user calls pop(key), default is __marker. When they call pop(key, 5), default is 5.

So in the method:

if key in self:
    value = self.pop(key)
else:
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError

Wait, no. Because the default is set to __marker, so if the user doesn't provide it, default is __marker. So in the else clause, if the key isn't found, and default is not __marker (meaning the user provided it), return it. Else, if default is __marker, meaning the user didn't provide it, raise KeyError.

So in code:

if key in self:
    value = self.pop(key)
else:
    if default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError

Wait, but in Python, the default parameter is evaluated once when the function is defined, so __marker is determined at that time. So if __marker is a specific value, say None, then when the user doesn't provide a default, it's None, and if the key isn't found, we raise KeyError.

So putting it all together:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self.pop(key)
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError

Wait, but wait. The built-in dict's pop method removes the key and returns the value. So in this case, the method should remove the key from self if it exists, and return the value. If not, return the default if provided, else raise KeyError.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the code should be:

Check if key is in self. If yes, pop it and return the value. Else, return default if it's not __marker, else raise KeyError.

So the code is as written above.

I think that's correct. Let me test it with an example.

Suppose self is a dictionary like {'a': 1, 'b': 2}.

Case 1: pop('a') returns 1 and removes 'a' from self.

Case 2: pop('c') returns default (which is __marker, say None) if default is not provided. Wait, no: when default is not provided, it's __marker, so in the else clause, if default is not __marker, return it. So if default is not provided (i.e., __marker), then we raise KeyError.

Wait, no. Because in the method, if the key isn't found, it checks if default is not __marker. If it's not, return it. Else, raise KeyError.

So if default is __marker (user didn't provide it), then it raises KeyError.

Yes, that's correct.

Another example: pop('c', 0) would return 0.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code should work as intended.
