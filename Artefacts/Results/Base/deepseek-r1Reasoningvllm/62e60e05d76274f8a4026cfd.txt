Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called index, and it's part of a class since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it returns the key as an int.

Hmm, so the function takes 'self' and 'key'. The key could be any type, but it needs to be converted to an integer. The simplest way is to use int() function. But wait, what if the key isn't a string that can be converted to an int? That could cause a ValueError. The problem statement doesn't mention handling exceptions, so maybe it's okay to assume the key is a valid integer or string representation.

So the function body should be return int(key). That's straightforward. I don't need to do anything else because the function just needs to return the key as an integer. I should make sure the code is properly indented, but since it's a method, it's inside a class. However, the user didn't ask for the class, just the function, so I'll just write the function.

Wait, the code should be in Python markdown format. So I'll write it as a docstring and the function body. But looking at the example, the user included the function in a class-like structure with colons and indentation. But since the function is a method, it should have 'self' as the first parameter. So the code should be:

def index(self, key):
    """
    Returns the key in the form of int.
    """
    return int(key)

Yes, that's it. I think that's all that's needed. No need for error handling unless specified, which it isn't. So the code is simple and does exactly what the docstring says.
