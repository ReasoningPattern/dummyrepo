Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called pretty, and it takes three parameters: self, indent (default 0), and debug (default False). The docstring explains that the function should return a pretty-formatted string representation of self. 

If self.obj is a string, it should be enclosed in single quotes. Otherwise, it should use the repr() function on self.obj. Then, the function constructs a string that starts with spaces based on the indent, followed by the class name, and some debug details. 

Wait, looking closer, the return statement is a bit more detailed. It seems that debug_details is a formatted string that includes whether debug is True or False. So, if debug is True, it appends "_debug" to the string; otherwise, it appends "_nondebug". 

I also notice that obj is assigned based on the type of self.obj. If it's a string, obj is f"'{self.obj}'". For other types, it's f"{repr(self.obj)}". 

Putting this together, the function first checks the type of self.obj. If it's a string, it creates the obj string with quotes. Then, it constructs the debug_details part by checking if debug is True or False. Finally, it combines all these parts with the appropriate indentation and returns the result.

I should make sure to handle cases where self.obj might not be a string or have any other type. Also, using the __class__.__name__ ensures that the class name is correctly referenced.

So, the code will first assign obj based on the type check. Then, create the debug_details string. Finally, concatenate everything with the proper indentation and return it.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
