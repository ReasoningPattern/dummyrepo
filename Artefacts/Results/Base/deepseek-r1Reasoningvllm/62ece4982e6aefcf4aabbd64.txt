Okay, I need to write a Python function called strip_root that takes two arguments, path and root. The goal is to remove the root directory from the given path. If it fails, it should throw an exception and return the path without the root.

First, I should think about how to identify if the path starts with the root. For example, if the root is 'home', then the path might be '/home/...' or 'home/'. So I can check if the path starts with the root.

If the path starts with the root, I'll need to slice it. But I have to be careful about cases where the path is exactly the root, or the root is just a part of a longer path. Also, I should consider both cases where the path starts with a '/' or not.

Wait, maybe using the os.path module would help here. There's a function called dirname which can extract the directory name. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient because it might not handle cases where the path is just the root.

Alternatively, I can use string manipulation. If the path starts with the root, I can slice it from the length of the root. But I need to handle cases where the path is exactly the root or starts with it.

Let me think about some examples:

Case 1: path = '/home/user', root = '/home' → should return 'user'
Case 2: path = 'home/user', root = 'home' → should return 'user'
Case 3: path = '/home', root = '/' → should return 'home'
Case 4: path = '/', root = '/' → should raise an error because removing the root from '/' leaves nothing, which isn't a valid path.

Hmm, so in case 3, if the path is exactly the root, removing it would leave an empty string. But an empty string isn't a valid path, so maybe I should raise an exception in that case.

Wait, but the function's docstring says if it fails, throw an exception. So I need to handle cases where stripping the root isn't possible without causing an error.

So, the steps I should take are:

1. Check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception.
2. If it does, slice the path from the length of the root.
3. However, if the root is just a single character like '/', then the path could be '/', which after slicing becomes an empty string. In that case, I should raise an exception because an empty string isn't a valid path.

How do I check if the path starts with the root? I can use the string startswith() method. But I need to make sure that the root and path are in the same format, both absolute or both relative.

Wait, but the root could be a single character like '/', which is the root of the entire filesystem. So if the path is '/', and root is '/', then after stripping, it's an empty string, which is invalid.

So, the plan is:

- If the path starts with the root:
   - Slice the path to remove the root.
   - If the resulting path is empty, raise an exception.
   - Otherwise, return the sliced path.
- Else:
   - Raise an exception because the root isn't present.

But wait, what if the root is empty? Well, according to the function signature, root is a parameter, but the user could pass an empty string. So I should probably handle that as well. If root is empty, maybe it's an error because you can't strip an empty root.

So, in code:

First, check if root is an empty string. If so, raise an exception.

Then, check if path starts with root. But need to handle cases where root is '/', because '/' is a special case.

Wait, perhaps using os.path functions would be better. Let me think about using os.path.dirname and os.path.basename.

Alternatively, maybe using the split function on the path.

Wait, perhaps using the os.path module's functions to get the directory.

Wait, let me think of another approach. If I split the path into parts, the root is the first part. So for example, if path is '/home/user', splitting by '/' gives ['', 'home', 'user']. The root is ['', 'home'], so the remaining parts are ['user'], which when joined gives 'user'.

But if the path is just '/', splitting gives [''], and the root is [''], so the remaining parts are empty, which is invalid.

Similarly, if the path is 'home/user', splitting gives ['home', 'user'], so after removing 'home', we have 'user'.

So, perhaps using the os.path module's dirname function. dirname('/home/user') returns '/home', and dirname('home/user') returns 'home'. Then, I can take the path after dirname.

Wait, but dirname('home/') would return 'home', and then the path would be empty, which is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps using os.path.split.

Wait, os.path.split('path') returns (head, tail). So for 'path', head is '', tail is 'path'. For '/path', head is '/', tail is 'path'. For '/path/', head is '/path', tail is ''.

Wait, so if I split the path, and the tail is not empty, then I can take the tail as the stripped path. If the tail is empty, then the stripped path is the head.

But wait, if the path is just the root, like '/', then splitting gives ('', '')? Or is it ('/', '')? Let me check.

No, actually, os.path.split('/') returns ('/', '') because '/' is considered a directory, and the tail is empty.

Wait, no. Let me think: in Python, os.path.split('/') returns ('', '')? Or does it return ('/', '')? Wait, no, I think it returns ('', '') because '/' is the root, and the current working directory is empty.

Wait, no, perhaps I should test this. Let me think: in Python, os.path.split('/') would return ('', '') because the directory is the root, and the tail is empty.

Wait, no, actually, when I run os.path.split('/'), it returns ('', '') because '/' is the root, and there's no file or directory name.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing with os.path.dirname. Let me think again.

Wait, os.path.dirname('/') returns '' because the parent of the root is the empty string. Hmm, no, that's not right. Actually, os.path.dirname('/') returns '' because '/' is the root, and its directory name is empty.

Wait, no, perhaps I should look it up. Oh right, in Python, os.path.dirname('/') returns '' because the directory name of the root is considered empty.

So, if I use os.path.split, for a path like '/home/user', it returns ('/home', 'user'). So the head is '/home' and the tail is 'user'. So the stripped path would be 'user'.

For a path like 'home/user', os.path.split gives ('', 'home/user'), so the head is empty and the tail is 'home/user'. So the stripped path is 'home/user'.

But wait, what about a path like '/home'? Splitting it gives ('/home', ''). So the tail is empty, which means after stripping, the path is just the head, which is '/home'. But that's not correct because we want to remove the root, which is '/home', so the stripped path should be empty, which is invalid.

Wait, so perhaps using os.path.split isn't sufficient because in the case where the path is just the root, the tail is empty, and the head is the root. So after stripping, we should return an empty string, but that's invalid.

So, perhaps the approach is:

- Split the path into head and tail using os.path.split.
- If tail is not empty, then the stripped path is tail.
- If tail is empty, then the stripped path is head.
- But then, we need to check if the stripped path is empty. If it is, raise an exception.

Wait, but in the case where the path is just the root, like '/', then head is '/' and tail is empty. So the stripped path would be head, which is '/', which is the root. But that's not correct because we want to remove the root, so the stripped path should be empty, which is invalid.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't handling the edge cases correctly.

Another approach: Check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then slice it. But handle cases where the root is '/'.

So, code steps:

1. If root is empty string, raise exception.
2. If path starts with root:
   a. If root is '/', and path is '/', then stripping gives empty string → raise exception.
   b. Else, slice the path from len(root).
3. Else, raise exception.

But how to implement this in Python.

Wait, but in Python, strings have the startswith() method. So:

if path.startswith(root):
   if root == '/' and path == '/':
       raise ValueError("Cannot strip root from '/' as it would result in an empty path.")
   else:
       return path[len(root):]
else:
   raise ValueError("Path does not start with root.")

But wait, what if the root is '/' and the path is '/a'? Then, path.startswith('/') is True, so we slice from 1, which gives 'a' → correct.

What if the root is 'a' and the path is 'a/b'? Then, it's correct to slice to 'b'.

What if the root is 'a' and the path is 'ab'? Then, path.startswith('a') is True, so slice to 'b' → correct.

What if the root is 'a' and the path is 'a'? Then, slice to '' → which is invalid, so we should raise an exception.

So, in code:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not root:
        raise ValueError("Root cannot be empty.")
    if path.startswith(root):
        if root == '/' and path == '/':
            raise ValueError("Cannot strip root from '/' as it results in an empty path.")
        stripped = path[len(root):]
        if not stripped:
            raise ValueError("Stripping root results in empty path.")
        return stripped
    else:
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root.")

Wait, but in the case where root is '/' and path is '/a', then len(root) is 1, so stripped is 'a' → correct.

If root is '/' and path is 'a/', then path.startswith('/') is False, so it raises an error. But that's correct because 'a/' does not start with '/'.

Wait, but 'a/' does not start with '/', so the function would raise an error, which is correct because you can't strip the root from a path that doesn't start with it.

Another test case: path is '/a/b', root is '/a' → should return 'b'.

Yes, because path starts with '/a', len is 2, so path[2:] is 'b'.

Another test case: path is 'a/b', root is 'a' → returns 'b'.

Another case: path is 'a', root is 'a' → returns '' → which is invalid, so raises exception.

Another case: path is 'a', root is 'b' → doesn't start with root, raises exception.

What about if root is longer than the path? For example, path is 'a', root is 'ab' → path.startswith('ab') is False → raises exception.

So, this code should handle all these cases.

But wait, what if the root is something like '//'? Because in Windows, '//' is a root, but in Unix, it's not. But since the function is Python-specific, I think it's safe to assume that root is a valid directory.

But in the function, if root is '//' and path is '//home', then path.startswith('//') is True, so it would slice to 'home' → correct.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Another thing to consider: if the root is empty, the function raises an error. That's correct because you can't strip an empty root.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

Check if root is empty, raise ValueError.

Check if path starts with root.

If yes, and if root is '/' and path is '/', raise ValueError.

Else, slice the path from len(root). If the result is empty, raise ValueError.

Else, return the sliced path.

If no, raise ValueError.

So, the code is as written above.
