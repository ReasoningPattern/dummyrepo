Okay, I need to write a Python function called _get_seq_with_type that takes a sequence and returns a tuple containing the sequence and its type. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should check if the input is already a sequence. In Python, sequences are like lists, tuples, strings, etc. So I need a way to determine if 'seq' is a sequence. I remember that collections.abc has a Sequence abstract base class that includes all sequence types. So I'll import ABC and Sequence from collections.abc.

Wait, but what if someone passes a string? Because strings are sequences, but maybe the function should treat them differently? The docstring says that the sequence is derived from *seq*, so I think it's okay to include strings as sequences.

Next, I'll check if 'seq' is an instance of a Sequence. If it is, then I just return (seq, type(seq)). But if it's not, I need to wrap it in a list. So I'll create a new list containing 'seq' and return that list along with its type.

But wait, what about cases where 'seq' is not a sequence but is iterable? For example, a generator or a set. The problem is that if I wrap it in a list, it might change its behavior. But the function's requirement is to return the sequence as derived from *seq*, so wrapping non-sequences into a list seems appropriate.

So the steps are:

1. Import the necessary modules.
2. Check if 'seq' is an instance of collections.abc.Sequence.
3. If yes, return (seq, type(seq)).
4. If no, return (list(seq), type(list(seq))).

Wait, but what if 'seq' is a bytes object? Bytes are also a sequence, but their type is bytes. So the function will correctly return (bytes_obj, type(bytes_obj)).

Testing some examples:

Case 1: seq is a list like [1,2,3]. The function returns ([1,2,3], list).

Case 2: seq is a string "hello". It returns ("hello", str).

Case 3: seq is a tuple (1,2,3). Returns (tuple, tuple).

Case 4: seq is 5 (not a sequence). Returns [5, int].

That seems to cover the cases. Now, I'll write the code.

I'll need to import ABC and Sequence. Then, inside the function, check if isinstance(seq, ABC.Sequence). If yes, return (seq, type(seq)). Else, return (list(seq), type(list(seq))).

Wait, but what about the case where seq is None? Well, None is not a sequence, so it will be wrapped in a list, returning [None, type(None)], which is correct.

Another consideration: what if 'seq' is a generator? It's an iterable but not a Sequence. So it will be wrapped in a list, which is correct as per the function's requirements.

I think this should handle all cases. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
