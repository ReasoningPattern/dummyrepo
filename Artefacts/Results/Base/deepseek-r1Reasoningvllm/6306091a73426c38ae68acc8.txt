Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called list_of_file_names and it takes two arguments: settings_dirs and spec_option. The docstring says it's creating and returning a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

Hmm, I remember that in Python, to create a complex type, especially for something like IniType, we use the typing module. The function cli.ListOfFileNames() is part of Click's API, so I need to import that. 

Wait, how do I create a custom type using Click? Oh right, I think I can use a function that returns a tuple of strings. The first string is the name of the type, and the second is the help message. So for IniType, the name is 'IniType' and the help could be 'A custom IniType complex type'.

So the function should return something like IniType(...). But since it's a complex type, maybe it's a class. Alternatively, perhaps Click handles it differently. But the key is that the function should return a type that's compatible with Click's List type.

Putting it all together, the function will import List and IniType from typing. Then, it returns List[IniType](...). Wait, no, List is a generic type from typing, so I need to specify the arguments. The List constructor takes two arguments: the element type and the name. So List[IniType, 'IniType'] would be the correct syntax.

Wait, but in the code example I saw earlier, it's List[Type, str], which makes sense because the first argument is the element type, and the second is the name. So in this case, the element type is IniType, and the name is 'IniType'.

So the function will import List and IniType, then return List[IniType, 'IniType'](). But wait, do I need to pass any additional arguments? The function signature shows that it's returning a new instance via cli.ListOfFileNames(), but I'm not sure if that's part of the type creation or how it's used elsewhere. But for the type itself, the code should be as I thought.

So the final code will import the necessary modules and return the correctly typed list. I think that's it. Let me write that out.
