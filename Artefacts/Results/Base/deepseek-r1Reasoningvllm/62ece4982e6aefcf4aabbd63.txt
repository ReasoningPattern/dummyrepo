Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_none_string. The function takes a single argument, val, which can be of any type. The function should return True if the string representation of val is exactly 'none', and False otherwise.

First, I should check if the type of val is a string. Because if val is not a string, comparing it to 'none' as a string doesn't make sense. So I'll use isinstance(val, str) to check the type.

Next, if it's a string, I need to compare its lowercase version to 'none'. So I'll convert val to lowercase using the lower() method and see if it equals 'none'.

Putting it all together, the function should return True only if both conditions are met: val is a string and its lowercase is 'none'. Otherwise, it returns False.

I should also make sure that the function handles cases where val is None. Wait, no, because if val is None, isinstance(None, str) is False, so it will correctly return False. That's good.

So the code structure would be:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

I think that's all. It's concise and covers all the cases mentioned in the docstring.
