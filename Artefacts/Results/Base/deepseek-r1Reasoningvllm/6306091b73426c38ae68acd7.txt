Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_config_manager and it's a class method, so it should take 'cls' as the first parameter. The docstring explains that it gets the Ansible config manager via the service name 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER' in cls._get_service(). 

First, I'll start by defining the function with 'cls' as the parameter. Then, I'll call cls._get_service() and pass 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER' as the argument. Since _get_service() likely returns an object, I'll assign this result to a variable, maybe 'config_manager'. Finally, I'll return this variable. 

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: it calls the internal method with the specified service name and returns the result. I'll make sure to follow proper Python syntax and structure.
