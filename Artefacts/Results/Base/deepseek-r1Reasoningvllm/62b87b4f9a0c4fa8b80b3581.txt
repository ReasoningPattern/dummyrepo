Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called scale and it's part of a class, so it's a method. Let me read the docstring carefully to understand what it needs to do.

The function signature is def scale(self, other=None, recompute=False):. So it takes two arguments: other, which can be None or a float, and recompute, which is a boolean.

The docstring explains that if other is None, the method should return the scale of the histogram. If the scale wasn't computed before, it computes and stores it for future use unless recompute is True. Also, if the histogram is changed, one must recompute the scale if it was already computed.

If other is a float, the method rescales self to other. But if the scale is zero, raising a LenaValueError makes sense because you can't divide by zero.

First, I need to check if other is None. If so, compute the scale. But wait, how is the scale computed? The scale is the integral of the histogram, which I assume is the sum of all the bin values. So I need to calculate the sum of the histogram's values.

But wait, in some histogram classes, the sum is already stored as an attribute, maybe called self.scale or something similar. Alternatively, if it's not stored, I might need to compute it each time. However, the docstring mentions that if the scale wasn't computed before, it's computed and stored. So I should check if self.scale exists. If not, compute it.

So, first, I'll check if recompute is True or if other is None. If recompute is True, I should compute the scale regardless. Otherwise, if the scale is already computed (exists as an attribute), use it unless it's zero.

Wait, but the docstring says that if other is None, return the scale. So I need to compute it if it's not already computed, unless recompute is True.

So, the steps are:

1. If other is None:
   a. If recompute is True, compute the scale and store it.
   b. Else, if self.scale exists and is not zero, return it.
   c. Else, raise LenaValueError because scale is zero.

2. If other is a float:
   a. Check if self.scale is zero. If yes, raise LenaValueError.
   b. Otherwise, scale each bin by dividing by the current scale and multiplying by other.

But wait, how is the scale computed? If it's not stored, I need to sum all the bin values. So I'll write something like self.scale = sum of all bin values.

Wait, but in some cases, the histogram might have a range or weights. Hmm, but the problem statement doesn't specify that, so I'll assume it's a simple sum.

So, the code outline is:

def scale(self, other=None, recompute=False):
    if other is None:
        if recompute or not hasattr(self, 'scale'):
            # compute scale
            self.scale = sum of all bin values
            if self.scale == 0:
                raise LenaValueError
            return self.scale
        else:
            return self.scale
    else:
        if not isinstance(other, float):
            raise TypeError
        if self.scale == 0:
            raise LenaValueError
        # rescale each bin
        for i in range(len(self.bins)):
            self.bins[i] = self.bins[i] * other / self.scale
        return

Wait, but in the code, I need to make sure that the bins are being updated correctly. Also, the method is part of a class, so self.bins is an attribute of the class.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Maybe the histogram has a method to get the sum, or perhaps it's stored in self._sum or something. Alternatively, I can compute it each time.

But according to the docstring, if the scale was not computed before, it's computed and stored. So I need to check if self.scale exists. If it does and is not zero, return it. Else, compute it.

Wait, but in the case where other is None, I have to compute the scale if recompute is True or if it's not already computed. So the code inside the if other is None block should handle that.

So, putting it all together:

First, handle the case where other is None.

If other is None:
   if recompute is True or self.scale doesn't exist:
       compute self.scale as sum of bins
       if self.scale is zero, raise error
       return self.scale
   else:
       return self.scale

Else:
   if other is not a float, raise error
   if self.scale is zero, raise error
   else, for each bin, set bin = bin * other / self.scale
   return

But wait, in Python, we can check if an attribute exists using hasattr. So, if hasattr(self, 'scale') is False, then compute it.

So, code:

def scale(self, other=None, recompute=False):
    if other is None:
        if recompute or not hasattr(self, 'scale'):
            # Compute the scale
            self.scale = sum(self.bins)
            if self.scale == 0:
                raise LenaValueError("Scale cannot be zero")
        # Return the scale if it exists and is not zero
        if not hasattr(self, 'scale') or self.scale == 0:
            raise LenaValueError("Scale cannot be zero")
        return self.scale
    else:
        if not isinstance(other, float):
            raise TypeError("Other must be a float")
        if self.scale == 0:
            raise LenaValueError("Cannot scale by zero")
        # Rescale each bin
        for i in range(len(self.bins)):
            self.bins[i] = self.bins[i] * other / self.scale
        return

Wait, but in the case where other is None, after computing self.scale, if it's zero, we raise an error. So the code should handle that.

But wait, in the initial check, if recompute is True, we compute it regardless. Otherwise, if it's not computed, compute it. Then, after computing, if it's zero, raise error. So the code should be okay.

But what about if other is a float and self.scale is zero? We raise an error before trying to scale.

So, the code seems to handle all cases.

Now, I need to make sure that the code is properly indented and that all conditions are checked.

Wait, in the case where other is None, after computing self.scale, if it's zero, we raise an error. So the return statement is after that.

Wait, no. Let me see:

In the other is None block:

if recompute or not hasattr(self, 'scale'):
    compute self.scale
    if self.scale == 0:
        raise error
then, return self.scale

But wait, if recompute is True, compute it, then check if it's zero and raise if so. Then return.

If recompute is False and hasattr is True, then return self.scale, which is already computed.

But what if the scale was computed before but was zero? Then, the function would have already raised an error when it was computed, so the scale attribute wouldn't exist, right?

Wait, no. If the scale was computed before, and it was zero, then during the first call, when other is None, it would have raised an error and the scale attribute would not exist. So in subsequent calls, when other is None and recompute is False, it would check hasattr and find it doesn't exist, so compute it again, which would raise an error again.

Wait, that's a problem. So if the scale was previously computed and was zero, then the next time the function is called with other=None, it would not have the scale attribute, so it would compute it again, leading to an error.

But according to the docstring, after changing the histogram, one must explicitly recompute the scale if it was computed before. So perhaps the function should not recompute if recompute is False, but if the scale was already computed but is zero, that's an error.

Wait, the docstring says: "Note that after changing (filling) the histogram one must explicitly recompute the scale if it was computed before."

So, if the scale was computed before (i.e., self.scale exists), and the histogram is changed, then the scale is invalid and needs to be recomputed. So in the code, if recompute is False, but the scale exists, but is zero, then it's an error.

But in the current code, if other is None, and recompute is False, but self.scale exists and is zero, it would return self.scale, which is zero, but according to the docstring, that's invalid.

Wait, no. Because in the code, when other is None, after checking if recompute is True or self.scale doesn't exist, it computes it. Otherwise, returns it.

But if self.scale exists but is zero, then in the code, it's not recomputed, so it returns zero, which is invalid.

So, perhaps the code needs to check if self.scale exists and is non-zero before returning it.

Wait, but in the code above, after computing self.scale, it raises an error if it's zero. But if self.scale exists, it just returns it without checking if it's zero. So that's a problem.

So, the code should, in all cases, ensure that self.scale is not zero before using it.

So, perhaps the code should be adjusted to check if self.scale exists and is non-zero before returning it, regardless of whether it was recomputed or not.

So, in the other is None block:

if other is None:
    if recompute or not hasattr(self, 'scale'):
        compute self.scale
        if self.scale == 0:
            raise error
    if not hasattr(self, 'scale') or self.scale == 0:
        raise error
    return self.scale

Wait, but that's redundant. Because after computing, we already checked for zero. So the code can just return self.scale after that.

Alternatively, perhaps after computing, we should always check if it's zero and raise an error if so.

So, in the code:

if other is None:
    if recompute or not hasattr(self, 'scale'):
        self.scale = sum(self.bins)
        if self.scale == 0:
            raise LenaValueError("Scale cannot be zero")
    # Now, check if scale is zero
    if self.scale == 0:
        raise LenaValueError("Scale cannot be zero")
    return self.scale

But wait, if self.scale was already computed and is zero, then the first part (recompute or not hasattr) would be false, so it wouldn't compute it again. Then, the code would check if self.scale is zero and raise an error.

So that's better.

Similarly, when other is a float, after rescaling, we need to ensure that the scale is not zero. But in that case, we already check before rescaling that self.scale is not zero.

So, putting it all together:

def scale(self, other=None, recompute=False):
    if other is None:
        if recompute or not hasattr(self, 'scale'):
            self.scale = sum(self.bins)
            if self.scale == 0:
                raise LenaValueError("Scale cannot be zero")
        # Now, check if scale is zero
        if self.scale == 0:
            raise LenaValueError("Scale cannot be zero")
        return self.scale
    else:
        if not isinstance(other, float):
            raise TypeError("Other must be a float")
        if self.scale == 0:
            raise LenaValueError("Cannot scale by zero")
        for i in range(len(self.bins)):
            self.bins[i] = self.bins[i] * other / self.scale
        return

Wait, but what if the histogram has zero bins? Like, all bins are zero. Then sum would be zero, and the error is raised. That's correct.

But wait, in the code, after recompute, it's recomputing the scale, but if the histogram is empty, sum would be zero. So the code handles that.

Another thing: in the code, when recompute is True, it recomputes the scale, which could be expensive if the histogram is large. But that's the user's responsibility.

Also, in the code, the bins are being modified in place. So the method is mutating the bins, which is correct.

So, I think this code should handle all the cases as per the docstring.
