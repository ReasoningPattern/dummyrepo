Okay, so I need to write a Python method called pop_u16 for a class. The docstring says it should remove the last two elements from self.data and return something. Hmm, the problem is a bit vague on what exactly to return, but looking at the function signature, it's returning something, probably the two elements.

Wait, the function is part of a class, maybe a list-like structure. So self.data is likely a list. The method needs to pop the last two elements. In Python, popping from the end can be done with pop(), but by default it removes the last element. So to remove two, I might need to call pop twice.

But wait, if I pop twice, the second pop will remove the new last element after the first pop. That should work. So self.data.pop() twice. But then, I should return these two elements. Maybe as a tuple, since that's a common return type for such operations.

So the steps are: pop twice, store each popped value, and return them as a tuple. Let me think about the code structure. The method is inside a class, so it's an instance method. The code would be something like:

def pop_u16(self):
    a = self.data.pop()
    b = self.data.pop()
    return (a, b)

Wait, but what if the list has fewer than two elements? That could cause an error. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling exceptions, so maybe we don't need to worry about that here.

Alternatively, maybe the method should return a list containing the two elements. But the example in the docstring shows returning, so perhaps a tuple is fine.

So putting it all together, the code should pop twice and return the two elements. That should fulfill the docstring's requirement.
