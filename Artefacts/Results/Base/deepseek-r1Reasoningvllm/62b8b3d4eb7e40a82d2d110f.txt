Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _should_attempt_c_optimizations and it's supposed to return a boolean indicating whether to use C optimizations. 

Hmm, the docstring says it should return True if we use C optimizations. But wait, how does that function decide what to return? Usually, such functions might check certain conditions or have a default behavior. Since the problem doesn't specify any conditions, maybe it's just a simple function that always returns True or False by default.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a larger context where it's used conditionally. Maybe in the codebase, there's a setting or a flag that determines whether to attempt C optimizations. But since the function isn't provided with any parameters, it can't check those conditions. So, maybe the function is supposed to always return True, indicating that C optimizations are always attempted.

Alternatively, maybe the function is meant to return a boolean based on some internal state or configuration. But without more information, the simplest approach is to assume that the function should return True by default. 

So, the code would be a function that returns True. That makes sense because the docstring says it returns True if we use C optimizations. Therefore, the function will just return True without any arguments.

I think that's the right approach. So the code is straightforward.
