Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's an instance method, so it should have 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it removes and returns the least recently used (LRU) (key, value) pair. 

I remember that in Python, the OrderedDict class has an popitem method. This method allows removing and returning the LRU item. Since the function is part of a class, I'll probably be adding this method to an OrderedDict or a subclass of it.

So, the code should define a method popitem inside a class, probably something like OrderedDict. The method doesn't take any arguments besides self. It should return a tuple of (key, value). 

Looking at the OrderedDict's popitem method, it uses a remove operation which affects the order. But since it's LRU, the least recently accessed item is removed first. 

I should write the function with the correct return type and ensure it's compatible with how OrderedDict's methods are structured. 

Putting it all together, the code will define the popitem method that returns the least recently used item as a tuple.
