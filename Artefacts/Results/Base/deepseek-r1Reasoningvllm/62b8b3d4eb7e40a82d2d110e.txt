Alright, I need to write a Python function based on the given docstring. The function is called _c_optimizations_ignored and it's supposed to return True if the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable exists and is not zero. Otherwise, it returns False.

First, I should check if the "PURE_PYTHON" variable is present in the environment. In Python, I can get environment variables using os.environ. So I'll need to import the os module.

Next, I'll retrieve the value using os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON"). The get method returns None if the variable isn't found, which is perfect because I can check for None.

Then, I need to check if this value is not None and also not equal to zero. So I'll use a logical AND (&&) to combine these two conditions. If both are true, return True; else, False.

Putting it all together, I'll import os at the top, then define the function. Inside the function, I'll get the variable, check the conditions, and return the appropriate boolean.

I should make sure the function is correctly named and that the docstring accurately reflects what it does. Also, I need to ensure that the code doesn't include any unnecessary parts and only outputs the function as specified.
