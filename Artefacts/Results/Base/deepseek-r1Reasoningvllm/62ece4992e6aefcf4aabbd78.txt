Alright, I need to write a Python function called is_local that checks if a given host is localhost. The docstring explains that localhost can be in several forms: 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or combinations like 'user@domain' or 'ip@hostname'. 

First, I should think about how to determine if the host is localhost. One approach is to resolve the IP address and see if it maps to 127.0.0.1. But using an external library like ipaddress might be necessary for this. 

Wait, but what if the host is a string like '127.0.0.1'? The function should return True. Also, if the host is a domain name like 'google.com', that's not localhost. 

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Check if the host is exactly 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. If yes, return True.
2. If the host is a string that includes '@', it might be a username:domain format. For example, 'user@host'. In this case, after splitting on '@', the first part is the username, and the second part should be checked if it's 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
3. If the host is an IP address string, like '192.168.1.1', I need to resolve it to see if it maps to 127.0.0.1. However, this might not be necessary because the function's argument can be either a string (hostname/ip) or an integer (IP address). Wait, in Python, the function is defined to take 'host' as an argument, but in the examples, it's shown as strings. So perhaps the function should handle both string and integer inputs. 

Wait, looking back at the docstring, the function signature is given, but the user didn't include it. Oh, wait, the user provided a function signature and docstring, but in the initial prompt, the function is defined as def is_local(host):. So the function expects 'host' to be either a string (like 'localhost') or an integer (like 127.0.0.1 as an int). 

Hmm, but in Python, 127.0.0.1 is a string, but if the function is called with an integer, it's probably an IP address in integer form. So I need to handle both cases. 

So, the plan is:

- If the host is an integer, check if it's equal to 127.0.0.1 when converted to an IP. Wait, but how? Using ipaddress to convert it to an IPv4 address. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function should handle both string and integer inputs. So, the first step is to check if the host is an integer. If it is, attempt to resolve it as an IPv4 address and see if it's 127.0.0.1. 

But wait, in Python, if the function is called with an integer, like is_local(127), that's not the IP address. So perhaps the function expects 'host' to be a string representation of the IP or hostname. But the docstring says the host can be the string 'localhost' or the IP address '127.0.0.1'. So maybe the function is intended to handle string inputs only. 

Wait, the docstring says the function checks if the host is localhost, which can be 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or 'user@domain', etc. So perhaps the function should accept both string and integer inputs, but for IP addresses, it's passed as a string like '192.168.1.1' or as an integer 127. So I'm a bit confused. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to handle string inputs only, and if an integer is passed, it's treated as an IP address. So, to handle both cases, I can check if the host is an integer. If it is, convert it to a string and then check if it's 127.0.0.1. But that might not be the best approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function should always treat the host as a string, and if an integer is passed, it's considered as an IP address string. So, for example, if host is 127, it's converted to '127' and then checked against '127.0.0.1', which would not match. So that approach might not work. 

Hmm, perhaps the function should accept both string and integer types. So, the first step is to check if the host is an integer. If it is, attempt to resolve it as an IPv4 address and see if it maps to 127.0.0.1. 

Wait, but how to resolve an integer IP address? Using ipaddress's IPv4Address. So, for example, if host is 127, we can try to create an IPv4Address from it. If it's valid and equals 127.0.0.1, then return True. 

But what about if the host is an integer like 192.168.1.1, which is a valid IP, but not localhost. So, in that case, it would return False. 

So, the steps are:

1. If the host is an integer:
   a. Try to create an IPv4Address from it.
   b. If it's valid, check if its host is '127.0.0.1'.
   c. If yes, return True; else, False.
2. If the host is a string:
   a. Check if it's exactly 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. If yes, return True.
   b. If it contains '@', split into username and hostname. Check if the hostname part is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
   c. If it's a numeric string, try to convert to integer and then check as above.
   d. If it's a domain name, check if it's equal to 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
   e. If none of the above, return False.

Wait, but handling all these cases might complicate the function. Maybe a better approach is to use the socket library to resolve the hostname and see if it maps to 127.0.0.1. 

So, the plan is:

- If the host is a string:
   a. Try to resolve it as a hostname using socket.gethostbyname.
   b. If it resolves to 127.0.0.1, return True.
   c. Else, check if the string is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' and return accordingly.
- If the host is an integer:
   a. Convert it to a string and check if it's '127.0.0.1' or attempt to resolve it as an IPv4 address.
   b. If it's 127.0.0.1, return True.

Wait, but converting an integer to a string and checking if it's '127.0.0.1' might not be the best approach because, for example, the integer 127 would become '127', which is not equal to '127.0.0.1'. So perhaps the function should handle both string and integer inputs, treating integers as IP addresses and strings as hostnames or IP addresses.

So, perhaps the function should first check if the host is an integer. If it is, attempt to resolve it as an IPv4 address and see if it maps to 127.0.0.1. If it's a string, then check if it's a hostname that resolves to 127.0.0.1 or is exactly 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.

Wait, but the docstring says that the host can be 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or 'user@domain', etc. So perhaps the function should handle both string and integer inputs, but for strings, it's either a hostname or an IP address in string form.

So, the function can be structured as follows:

- If the host is an integer:
   a. Check if it's equal to 127 when converted to a string, but that's not sufficient because 127.0.0.1 is a string. Alternatively, use ipaddress to see if it's 127.0.0.1.
- If the host is a string:
   a. Check if it's exactly 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. If yes, return True.
   b. If it contains '@', split into username and hostname. Check if the hostname is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
   c. If it's an IPv4 string (like '192.168.1.1'), check if it's 127.0.0.1.
   d. If it's a domain name, check if it's 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
   e. If none of the above, return False.

Wait, but checking if a string is an IPv4 address can be done by splitting on '.' and checking if there are four parts, each being a number between 0 and 255. But that's error-prone. Alternatively, using ipaddress to see if it's a valid IPv4 address and equals 127.0.0.1.

So, putting it all together, the function can:

1. Import ipaddress.
2. Check if the host is an integer. If yes, try to create an IPv4Address from it. If it's valid and equals 127.0.0.1, return True.
3. If the host is a string:
   a. Try to see if it's 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. If yes, return True.
   b. If it contains '@', split into parts and check if the second part is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
   c. If it's a numeric string (like '192.168.1.1'), try to create an IPv4Address and see if it's 127.0.0.1.
   d. If it's a domain name, check if it's 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
   e. If none of the above, return False.

Wait, but how to handle numeric strings? For example, '127' is a valid integer but not the IP address. So, perhaps in step 3c, if the string is numeric, attempt to create an IPv4Address and see if it's 127.0.0.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can first check if the host is an integer, then handle it as an IP address. If it's a string, handle it as a hostname or IP address.

So, the code structure would be:

import ipaddress

def is_local(host):
    if isinstance(host, int):
        try:
            ip = ipaddress.IPv4Address(host)
            return ip == ipaddress.IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
        except ValueError:
            return False
    elif isinstance(host, str):
        if host == 'localhost' or host == '127.0.0.1':
            return True
        if '@' in host:
            parts = host.split('@')
            if len(parts) != 2:
                return False
            _, hostname = parts
            return (hostname == 'localhost' or hostname == '127.0.0.1')
        if '.' in host:
            try:
                ip = ipaddress.IPv4Address(host)
                return ip == ipaddress.IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
            except ValueError:
                return False
        if host == '127.0.0.1':
            return True
        return False
    else:
        return False

Wait, but this might have some issues. For example, if the host is a numeric string like '127', it's not an IP address, so it should return False. The code above checks if it's a string with '.', tries to create an IPv4Address, and if it fails, returns False. So that's correct.

Another test case: host is 'user@host', the code splits into ['user', 'host'], and checks if 'host' is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. But wait, the code says 'hostname' which is 'host' in this case. So if 'host' is 'localhost', it returns True. That's correct.

Another case: host is '192.168.1.1', which is a valid IP, but not 127.0.0.1, so returns False.

What about host is 'localhost@user'? That's a hostname with a username, which is not valid. So the code would split into ['localhost@user'], which has len(parts) > 2, so returns False. That's correct.

Wait, no. If host is 'user@localhost', then parts would be ['user', 'localhost'], and the code would check if 'localhost' is the hostname, which it is, so returns True. That's correct.

Another case: host is '127.0.0.1', returns True.

Host is '127', which is an integer, converted to '127', but the code treats it as an integer, tries to create IPv4Address(127), which is invalid because IPv4Address expects a string or integer that can be parsed as an IPv4. Wait, no, ipaddress.IPv4Address(127) would raise a ValueError because 127 is not a valid IPv4 address. So the function would return False for host=127, which is correct because 127 is not the IP address 127.0.0.1. Wait, no, 127 is an integer, but the function treats it as an IP address. So, for example, if host is 127, it's an integer, and the code tries to create IPv4Address(127), which would fail because 127 is not a valid IPv4 address (it's a number, not a string). So the function would return False, which is correct because 127 is not equal to 127.0.0.1.

Wait, but 127.0.0.1 is a string. So if host is 127, it's an integer, and the function treats it as an IP address, but since it's not a valid IPv4 string, it returns False. That's correct.

Another test case: host is '192.168.1.1', which is a string with '.', so the code tries to create IPv4Address('192.168.1.1'), which is valid but not equal to 127.0.0.1, so returns False.

What about host is '127.0.0.1', which is a string, returns True.

Host is 'user@127.0.0.1', which is a string with '@', so the code splits into ['user', '127.0.0.1'], and since the hostname is '127.0.0.1', returns True.

Host is 'user@localhost', which splits into ['user', 'localhost'], so returns True.

Host is 'localhost@user', which splits into ['localhost@user'], which has len(parts) = 1, so returns False.

Wait, no. If host is 'localhost@user', then host.split('@') would give ['localhost', 'user'], so len(parts) is 2. Then, hostname is 'localhost', so returns True. But that's incorrect because 'localhost@user' is not a valid hostname. Wait, no, in reality, 'localhost@user' is not a valid hostname. Hostnames can't have '@' in them. So the function should return False in this case.

Hmm, this is a problem. The function currently splits on '@' and treats the second part as the hostname, but in reality, the hostname shouldn't contain '@'. So, perhaps the function should check if the hostname part is a valid hostname, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should not split on '@' unless it's a valid username:hostname format. But checking if the hostname is valid is complex. Maybe the function should return True only if the host is exactly 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' or a string that, when split on '@', the hostname part is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.

But in reality, 'user@hostname' is a valid way to represent a hostname with username, but the hostname itself is just 'hostname'. So, perhaps the function should only consider the hostname part, ignoring the username.

So, in the case of 'user@localhost', the hostname is 'localhost', so it's valid. But in the case of 'localhost@user', the hostname is 'user', which is not a valid hostname, but the function would treat it as valid because it's split into two parts. So the function would return True, but that's incorrect because 'localhost@user' is not a valid hostname.

This is a problem because the function would incorrectly return True for invalid strings.

To fix this, perhaps the function should check if the hostname part is a valid hostname. But checking that is non-trivial. Alternatively, perhaps the function should not split on '@' unless it's a valid IPv6 address, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should only treat the string as a hostname:ip if it's in the form 'user@ip', but then the ip must be 127.0.0.1. But that's not correct because the host could be a domain name with username.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the socket library to resolve the host.

So, the function can:

- If the host is an integer, treat it as an IPv4 address and see if it resolves to 127.0.0.1.
- If the host is a string:
   a. Try to resolve it using socket.gethostbyname. If it returns '127.0.0.1', return True.
   b. Else, check if the string is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' and return accordingly.

But wait, socket.gethostbyname can return None if the host is not resolvable. So, for example, if the host is '192.168.1.1', it returns that IP address, which is not 127.0.0.1, so function returns False.

If the host is 'localhost', gethostbyname returns '127.0.0.1', so function returns True.

If the host is 'user@host', gethostbyname would fail because it's not a resolvable host, so function returns False, which is incorrect because 'user@host' is a valid hostname with username.

Wait, no. 'user@host' is a hostname with username, but in reality, the hostname is 'host', and the username is 'user'. So, the function should check if the hostname part is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.

So, perhaps the function should split the host into username and hostname if it contains '@', but only if the hostname is valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should attempt to split the host into parts and check each part.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the socket library to resolve the hostname and see if it maps to 127.0.0.1, but that would not handle IPv6 addresses or other cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can use a combination of methods:

1. If the host is an integer, attempt to resolve it as an IPv4 address and see if it's 127.0.0.1.
2. If the host is a string:
   a. Try to resolve it as a hostname using socket.gethostbyname. If it returns 127.0.0.1, return True.
   b. Else, check if the string is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' and return accordingly.
   c. Else, check if the string contains '@', split into username and hostname, and check if the hostname is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.

But wait, socket.gethostbyname('user@host') would fail because 'user@host' is not a resolvable host. So, in that case, the function would proceed to step 2b, which would check if the string is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', which it's not, then step 2c, which would split into ['user', 'host'], and check if 'host' is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', which it's not, so returns False.

But in reality, 'user@host' is a valid hostname with username, but the hostname itself is 'host', which is not 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', so the function correctly returns False.

Another test case: host is 'user@localhost'. The function would split into ['user', 'localhost'], and since 'localhost' is one of the valid hostnames, it returns True.

But wait, socket.gethostbyname('user@localhost') would fail because it's not a resolvable host. So the function would proceed to step 2c, split into ['user', 'localhost'], and check if 'localhost' is a valid hostname, which it is, so returns True. That's correct.

Another test case: host is 'localhost@user'. The function would split into ['localhost', 'user'], and check if 'user' is a valid hostname, which it's not, so returns False. But in reality, 'localhost@user' is not a valid hostname because the hostname part is 'user', which is not a domain name. So the function correctly returns False.

Another test case: host is '127.0.0.1@user'. The function would split into ['127.0.0.1', 'user'], and check if 'user' is a valid hostname, which it's not, so returns False. But in reality, '127.0.0.1' is the IP, but the hostname part is 'user', which is invalid, so the function correctly returns False.

So, this approach seems to handle most cases correctly.

Putting it all together, the function can be written as:

Import ipaddress and socket.

Check if host is an integer:
   a. Try to create IPv4Address from it. If valid and equals 127.0.0.1, return True.
   b. Else, return False.

Else, if host is a string:
   a. Try to gethostbyname. If it's 127.0.0.1, return True.
   b. Else, check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' and return accordingly.
   c. Else, if host contains '@', split into username and hostname. Check if hostname is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. If yes, return True.
   d. Else, return False.

Wait, but step 2c: if the host is 'user@localhost', gethostbyname would fail, so step 2a would fail, then step 2b would check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', which it's not, then step 2c would split into ['user', 'localhost'], and check if 'localhost' is a valid hostname, which it is, so returns True. That's correct.

Another case: host is 'localhost@user'. Step 2c would split into ['localhost', 'user'], and check if 'user' is a valid hostname, which it's not, so returns False. Correct.

Another case: host is '192.168.1.1@user'. Step 2c would split into ['192.168.1.1', 'user'], and check if 'user' is a valid hostname, which it's not, so returns False. Correct.

Another case: host is '127.0.0.1@user'. Step 2c would split into ['127.0.0.1', 'user'], and check if 'user' is a valid hostname, which it's not, so returns False. Correct.

Another case: host is 'user@127.0.0.1'. Step 2c would split into ['user', '127.0.0.1'], and check if '127.0.0.1' is a valid hostname. But '127.0.0.1' is an IP address, not a hostname. So, the function would return False, which is correct because 'user@127.0.0.1' is not a valid hostname.

Wait, but '127.0.0.1' is a valid IP address, but not a hostname. So, the function correctly returns False.

Another case: host is 'localhost@127.0.0.1'. Step 2c would split into ['localhost', '127.0.0.1'], and check if '127.0.0.1' is a valid hostname. But '127.0.0.1' is an IP address, not a hostname, so returns False. Correct.

Another case: host is '127.0.0.1@localhost'. Step 2c would split into ['127.0.0.1', 'localhost'], and check if 'localhost' is a valid hostname, which it is, so returns True. Correct.

So, this approach seems to handle most cases correctly.

Now, implementing this in code.

First, import ipaddress and socket.

Then, in the function:

if isinstance(host, int):
    try:
        ip = ipaddress.IPv4Address(str(host))
        return ip == ipaddress.IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
    except ValueError:
        return False
elif isinstance(host, str):
    # Check via socket.gethostbyname
    try:
        resolved = socket.gethostbyname(host)
        if resolved == '127.0.0.1':
            return True
    except socket.error:
        pass
    # Check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'
    if host == 'localhost' or host == '127.0.0.1':
        return True
    # Check if host contains '@'
    if '@' in host:
        parts = host.split('@')
        if len(parts) != 2:
            return False
        _, hostname = parts
        return hostname == 'localhost' or hostname == '127.0.0.1'
    # Check if host is a numeric string (like '192.168.1.1')
    if '.' in host:
        try:
            ip = ipaddress.IPv4Address(host)
            return ip == ipaddress.IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    # If none of the above, return False
    return False

Wait, but in the case where host is '127.0.0.1', it's a string, so the socket.gethostbyname would return '127.0.0.1', so the function returns True. Correct.

Another test case: host is '127.0.0.1' as a string, function returns True.

Host is 'localhost' as a string, returns True.

Host is 'user@localhost', function returns True.

Host is 'localhost@user', function returns False.

Host is '192.168.1.1', function returns False.

Host is '127.0.0.1@user', function returns False.

Host is '127.0.0.1@localhost', function returns True.

Host is 'localhost@127.0.0.1', function returns False.

Host is '127.0.0.1@127.0.0.1', function returns False.

Host is '127.0.0.1@localhost', function returns True.

Host is 'localhost@127.0.0.1', function returns False.

This seems to handle all cases correctly.

Another edge case: host is '127.0.0.1.' (with a trailing dot). The socket.gethostbyname would fail because it's not a valid hostname, so function proceeds to check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', which it's not, then checks for '@', which it doesn't have, then checks if it's a numeric string, which it is, but trying to create IPv4Address('127.0.0.1.') would fail because of the trailing dot, so returns False. Which is correct because '127.0.0.1.' is not a valid IPv4 address.

Another edge case: host is '127.0.0.1a' (invalid IP). socket.gethostbyname fails, function returns False.

Another case: host is 'localhost.', which socket.gethostbyname would fail, function returns False.

Another case: host is '127.0.0.1@localhost.', which is a string with '@' and a trailing dot. The split would give ['127.0.0.1@localhost', ''], but len(parts) would be 2, and hostname would be '', which is invalid, so returns False.

Another case: host is 'user@127.0.0.1.', which would split into ['user@127.0.0.1', ''], so hostname is invalid, returns False.

Another case: host is 'user@localhost.', which would split into ['user@localhost', ''], so hostname is invalid, returns False.

Another case: host is 'localhost@127.0.0.1.', which would split into ['localhost@127.0.0.1', ''], so hostname is invalid, returns False.

So, the function correctly handles these cases.

Thus, the final code is as written above.
