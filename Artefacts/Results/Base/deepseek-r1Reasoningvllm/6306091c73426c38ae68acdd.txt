Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_from_file, and it takes a parameter cls, which seems to be a class, and an optional yaml_file. The docstring says it loads and validates that a YAML file has all required fields. It raises an exception if mandatory data is missing and returns a dictionary with the data.

First, I should import necessary modules. Since it's handling YAML files, I'll need the yaml module. Also, because the function raises exceptions, I'll need to import Exception from somewhere, maybe from the built-ins or another module.

Looking at the docstring, the function is supposed to validate the YAML file. So I'll probably use a YAML loader. The yaml.safe_load function is good because it's safe and doesn't replace the interpreter. So I'll import yaml and maybe yaml.Loader.

Next, I need to read the YAML file. If yaml_file is None, I should probably raise an error because the function requires a file path. So I'll add a check at the beginning.

Then, I'll load the YAML data. After loading, I need to validate that all required fields are present. The problem is that the required fields are determined by the class cls. So I need a way to get the required fields from the class.

Hmm, how can I get the required fields from the class? Maybe by inspecting the class's attributes or using reflection. I'll need to import inspect module. Then, I can get the __annotations__ or maybe the __dict__ of the class to find the required keys.

Wait, the class might not have annotations, so maybe I should get all the attributes of the class and check if they are required. Or perhaps the required fields are the ones that the class expects, so I can get the __dict__ of the class and find the keys that are present.

But if the class uses type hints, the __annotations__ might have the required fields. So I'll try to get the __annotations__ attribute of the class. If it exists, I'll get the keys from there. If not, maybe the required fields are the attributes of the class itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the required fields are the parameters expected by the class when it's instantiated. So I can get the __init__ method's signature and extract the parameters.

Wait, the function is called validate_from_file, and it's supposed to validate that the YAML file has all required fields. So the required fields are the ones that the class expects. So perhaps the required_fields can be obtained by getting the __init__ method's parameters, excluding self.

So I'll need to get the __init__ method of the class, then inspect its parameters. Using inspect.signature, I can get the parameters. But I have to be careful because the class might not have an __init__ method, or it might be inherited from a parent class.

So, I'll try to get the __init__ method of the class, if it exists. If not, maybe the required fields are the class's attributes.

Wait, perhaps the required fields are the keys that the class expects, so I can get the class's __dict__ and find the required keys. But that might not be accurate because the class might have attributes that are not required fields.

Alternatively, maybe the required_fields can be obtained by the class's __annotations__, which are the expected types for the fields. So I'll try to get the __annotations__ attribute of the class.

So, putting this together, I'll import inspect, and then in the function, I'll do:

required_fields = inspect.getmembers(cls, lambda name, obj: isinstance(obj, type) and name != 'self')

Wait, no, that might not work. Maybe I should get the __init__ method's parameters.

Let me think again. The function is supposed to validate that the YAML file has all required fields. So the required fields are the ones that the class expects, which are the parameters of the __init__ method.

So, I'll get the __init__ method of the class, if it exists. Then, I'll get its parameters, excluding 'self'. Then, for each parameter, I'll get its type annotation, if any.

So, using inspect.signature, I can get the parameters. Then, for each parameter, if it has a type annotation, that's a required field.

Alternatively, perhaps the required_fields are the keys in the class's __dict__ that are not methods or attributes. Hmm, but that might not be reliable.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file contains all the fields that the class expects. So perhaps the required_fields are the class's __annotations__ keys.

So, I'll proceed by getting the __annotations__ attribute of the class. If it's not None, then the required_fields are the keys of __annotations__. Otherwise, perhaps there are no required fields, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file contains all the fields that the class has in its __dict__.

But I'm not sure. The problem statement says that the function raises an exception when mandatory data is missing. So the function needs to know which fields are mandatory.

Perhaps the required_fields are the class's __annotations__ keys. So I'll proceed with that.

So, in code, I'll import inspect, then in the function:

if not yaml_file:
    raise ValueError("yaml_file must be provided")

with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
    data = yaml.safe_load(f)

Then, get the required_fields:

required_fields = inspect.get_annotations(cls).keys() if hasattr(cls, 'annotations') else {}

Wait, in Python 3.0 and above, the __annotations__ attribute is available, so perhaps I should use that. So:

required_fields = inspect.get_annotations(cls).keys()

But if the class doesn't have __annotations__, this will raise an AttributeError. So perhaps I should handle that.

Alternatively, I can try to get the annotations and default to an empty set if it's not present.

required_fields = set(inspect.get_annotations(cls).keys()) if hasattr(cls, 'annotations') else set()

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe the function is designed in such a way that the class defines the required fields via type hints, so using __annotations__ is appropriate.

Once I have the required_fields, I need to check that each key in data is present in required_fields.

So, for field in required_fields:
    if field not in data:
        raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")

Wait, but the exception is called IRValidatorException. So I need to import that from the appropriate module, probably from the same package.

So, I'll import IRValidatorException from somewhere. Assuming it's in the same module or package.

Putting it all together, the code will:

- Import yaml, Exception, and maybe other modules.
- Check if yaml_file is None, raise error.
- Load the YAML data.
- Get the required fields from the class.
- Check each required field is present in data.
- Return data if all required fields are present.

Wait, but the function's docstring says it returns a dictionary, but if any required field is missing, it raises an exception. So, if all required fields are present, it returns the data.

So, the code will look like:

import yaml
from some_module import IRValidatorException
import inspect

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file must be provided")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    required_fields = inspect.get_annotations(cls).keys() if hasattr(cls, 'annotations') else set()
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

Wait, but what if the class has no annotations? Then required_fields will be an empty set, and no fields are checked. That might be a problem because the function is supposed to validate that all required fields are present. So perhaps the function expects that the class defines required fields in some way, maybe through __init__ parameters or __annotations__.

Alternatively, maybe the function should get the required fields from the class's __init__ method's parameters.

So, perhaps a better approach is to get the __init__ method's parameters, excluding 'self', and then get their annotations.

So, modifying the code:

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file must be provided")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    # Get required fields from class's __init__ parameters
    sig = inspect.signature(cls.__init__)
    parameters = sig.parameters.values()
    required_fields = set()
    for param in parameters:
        if param.kind in (param.POSITIONAL_ONLY, param.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD, param.KEYWORD_ONLY):
            if param.name != 'self' and param.default == param.empty:
                required_fields.add(param.name)
    # Now check each required field is present in data
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

But this approach assumes that the class has an __init__ method, which might not always be the case. So, perhaps I should handle cases where __init__ is not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to work with classes that have certain attributes, like _required_fields, but that's not specified in the problem statement.

Given the problem statement, the function is supposed to validate that a YAML file has all required fields, and the required fields are determined by the class. So, perhaps the class has a way to specify required fields, such as via __annotations__ or via other means.

Given that, perhaps the initial approach using __annotations__ is acceptable, even if it's not perfect.

So, the code would be:

import yaml
from some_module import IRValidatorException
import inspect

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file must be provided")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    required_fields = inspect.get_annotations(cls).keys() if hasattr(cls, 'annotations') else set()
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

But I'm not sure if this covers all cases. For example, if the class doesn't have __annotations__, then required_fields is empty, and no validation is done. That might be a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should get the required fields from the class's __init__ method's parameters, as I thought earlier.

So, perhaps the code should be adjusted to get the parameters from __init__.

Let me think about that.

Another approach is to use the dataclass decorator if the class is a dataclass, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to validate that the YAML file contains all the fields that the class expects, which could be determined by the class's attributes.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Given that, perhaps the initial code is acceptable, but I should note that if the class doesn't have __annotations__, no validation is done.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should check if the class has any required fields by looking at its __dict__.

But that's not a good approach because not all attributes are required fields.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file contains all the fields that are present in the class's __init__ method's parameters.

So, in that case, the code would get the parameters of __init__, excluding 'self', and check that each is present in the data.

So, the code would be:

import yaml
from some_module import IRValidatorException
import inspect

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file must be provided")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    # Get required fields from class's __init__ parameters
    sig = inspect.signature(cls.__init__)
    parameters = sig.parameters.values()
    required_fields = set()
    for param in parameters:
        if param.kind in (param.POSITIONAL_ONLY, param.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD, param.KEYWORD_ONLY):
            if param.name != 'self' and param.default == param.empty:
                required_fields.add(param.name)
    # Check each required field is present
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

But this approach assumes that the class has an __init__ method, which may not always be the case. So, perhaps we should handle that.

So, in code, we can check if __init__ exists before trying to get its parameters.

So, the code would be:

import yaml
from some_module import IRValidatorException
import inspect

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file must be provided")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    # Get required fields from class's __init__ parameters
    if hasattr(cls, '__init__'):
        sig = inspect.signature(cls.__init__)
        parameters = sig.parameters.values()
        required_fields = set()
        for param in parameters:
            if param.kind in (param.POSITIONAL_ONLY, param.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD, param.KEYWORD_ONLY):
                if param.name != 'self' and param.default == param.empty:
                    required_fields.add(param.name)
    else:
        required_fields = set()
    # Check each required field is present
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

This way, if the class doesn't have an __init__ method, required_fields is empty, and no validation is done, which might be acceptable.

But the problem statement says that the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file has all required fields, which implies that the class defines what those fields are. So perhaps using __init__ parameters is the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file contains all the fields that are present in the class's __dict__.

But that's not a good approach because not all attributes are required fields.

Given that, perhaps the initial approach using __annotations__ is the best, but with a note that if the class doesn't have __annotations__, no validation is done.

But the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the initial code is acceptable.

So, to sum up, the code will:

- Import necessary modules: yaml, IRValidatorException, inspect.

- Check if yaml_file is None, raise error.

- Load YAML data.

- Get required_fields from class's __annotations__.

- For each required field, check if it's present in data. If not, raise exception.

- Return data.

So, the code would look like:

import yaml
from some_module import IRValidatorException
import inspect

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file must be provided")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    required_fields = inspect.get_annotations(cls).keys() if hasattr(cls, 'annotations') else set()
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

But I'm not sure if this is the best approach. Maybe the class has required fields that are not in __annotations__ but in other places, like __init__ parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should get the required fields from the class's __dict__ by checking for required attributes.

But that's not a good approach because not all attributes are required.

Given that, perhaps the initial code is acceptable, but it's better to use the __init__ parameters approach.

So, the final code would be:

import yaml
from some_module import IRValidatorException
import inspect

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file must be provided")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    # Get required fields from class's __init__ parameters
    if hasattr(cls, '__init__'):
        sig = inspect.signature(cls.__init__)
        parameters = sig.parameters.values()
        required_fields = set()
        for param in parameters:
            if param.kind in (param.POSITIONAL_ONLY, param.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD, param.KEYWORD_ONLY):
                if param.name != 'self' and param.default == param.empty:
                    required_fields.add(param.name)
    else:
        required_fields = set()
    # Check each required field is present
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

This way, the function validates that the YAML file contains all the parameters expected by the class's __init__ method, excluding 'self'.
