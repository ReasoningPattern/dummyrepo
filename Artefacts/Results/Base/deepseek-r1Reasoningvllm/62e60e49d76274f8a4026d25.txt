Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called unit_of_work and takes two optional parameters: metadata and timeout. It returns a decorator with those attributes.

First, I remember that decorators in Python are created using functions that take another function as an argument and return a new function. So, the unit_of_work function must be a decorator factory that returns the actual decorator.

I should use the @functools.wraps decorator to preserve the original function's metadata, like __name__ and __doc__. So, I'll import functools and use wraps on the returned decorator.

The unit_of_work function should accept metadata and timeout as keyword arguments. Since they're optional, I'll set default values as None. Inside the function, I'll return a decorator that takes a function as an argument and applies the metadata and timeout to it.

For the metadata, I'll use functools.update_wrapper to update the wrapper dictionary of the decorated function with the metadata key. Similarly, I'll update the wrapper with a timeout method that sets a timeout attribute on the wrapper.

Wait, but the timeout decorator might need to be a separate function. Alternatively, I can define a timeout decorator inside the unit_of_work function that takes a timeout value and returns a decorator that sets the timeout attribute on the wrapped function.

Putting it all together, the unit_of_work function will return a decorator that, when applied to a function, adds the metadata and timeout attributes. I'll make sure to handle the case where metadata and timeout are None by default.

I should test the code to ensure it works as expected. For example, when a function is decorated with @unit_of_work(metadata='module', timeout=10), the wrapper should have these attributes set.

So, the code will import functools, define unit_of_work with the parameters, use wraps, and return a decorator that applies the metadata and timeout updates.
