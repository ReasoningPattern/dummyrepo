Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_compute_el that checks whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods. The function should return True if both methods exist, and False otherwise.

First, I'll start by looking at the parameters. The function takes one parameter, obj, which is the object to check.

Next, I need to determine if obj has the fill method. In Python, I can check for the existence of a method using the hasattr() function. So, I'll do hasattr(obj, 'fill').

Similarly, I'll check for the compute method with hasattr(obj, 'compute').

Now, I need to make sure that both conditions are true. So, I'll use the and operator between the two hasattr checks.

Putting it all together, the function will return True only if both methods exist. Otherwise, it returns False.

I should also make sure that the function is correctly defined with the proper indentation and syntax.

So, the final code should look like this: define the function, use hasattr for both methods, and return the logical AND of the two checks.
