Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_deprecated_args and it's part of a class, indicated by the self parameter. The docstring says it returns a dictionary with options that deprecate others, taken from self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs(). 

So, the task is to write a method that calls iterate_option_specs() on self.spec_helper and returns the result as a dictionary. The method doesn't take any arguments besides self, and it doesn't need any imports since it's just calling an existing method.

I should make sure the function is properly indented, probably with four spaces as per Python conventions. The return statement should convert the result into a dictionary, but since iterate_option_specs() likely returns a dictionary, maybe it's already a dict. So, wrapping it in {} might not be necessary unless the method returns something else.

Putting it all together, the function will be straightforward: call self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs() and return it as a dictionary. So the code will be a single return statement.
