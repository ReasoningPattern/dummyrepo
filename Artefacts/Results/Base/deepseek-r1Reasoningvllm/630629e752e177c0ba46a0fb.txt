Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called send_document, and it's supposed to send a POST request with some data. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, looking at the function signature: it takes url, data, timeout=10, method="post", and then *args and **kwargs. The docstring says it sends a response containing data through the POST method. Hmm, wait, does it mean it sends a POST request or returns the response object?

Wait, the function name is send_document, and the docstring says it sends a response. So maybe this function is part of a client library, and it returns the response from the server. That makes sense because send_document would typically return the HTTP response object so the caller can check status codes and access data.

So, I need to use a library to make HTTP requests. The standard one in Python is requests. So I'll need to import requests.

The function parameters are url, data, timeout, method, *args, **kwargs. The method is fixed as "post" unless overridden by the user. So in the function, I'll set method to "post" by default, but allow the user to change it if they pass a different value.

Wait, no, the method is given as "post" in the signature, so if the user passes a method, it will override. But in the function, I should probably set method as a parameter that defaults to "post", so any calls without specifying method will use POST.

But looking at the function signature, method is already set to "post" and it's a required parameter, but since it's a keyword argument, it can be overridden. So in the function, I can set it as method="post" but then allow it to be changed by the user.

Wait, no, in the function definition, method is a keyword argument with default "post", so if the user doesn't pass it, it's "post". But if they do, it uses that value.

So in the function, I'll construct the request using requests.request(). The method is method, url is url, and the data is data. But wait, in requests, for POST, you can pass data as the data parameter, but sometimes you need to pass files or other things. But in this case, data is passed as a parameter, so I'll use it as data.

I should also set the timeout to the given value, so timeout=timeout.

Then, the response is returned, so I'll return requests.request(method, url, data=data, timeout=timeout).

Wait, but the function is supposed to send a POST and return the response. So the code inside the function would be something like:

response = requests.request(method, url, data=data, timeout=timeout)
return response

But wait, the function is called send_document, so perhaps it's better to name it appropriately. Also, sometimes it's good to include headers or other parameters, but the function signature doesn't mention them, so I'll stick to the given parameters.

So putting it all together, the function will import requests, then make the request with the given method, url, data, timeout, and return the response.

Wait, but in the initial code, the function is written as def send_document(url, data, timeout=10, method="post", *args, **kwargs):. So in the function, I can use method from kwargs if provided, but wait, no, because method is a keyword argument, so if the user passes method=some_value, it will use that. But in the function, the method is already set as "post" in the signature, so if the user doesn't pass method, it's "post". But if they do, it should use that.

Wait, no, the function signature has method as a keyword argument with default "post", so in the function, method is a parameter that can be overridden by the user. So in the function, I can just use method as is.

So the code would be:

import requests

def send_document(url, data, timeout=10, method="post", *args, **kwargs):
    response = requests.request(method, url, data=data, timeout=timeout)
    return response

Wait, but what about other parameters like headers or cookies? The function signature doesn't include them, so I'll ignore them for now.

So that's the code. It imports requests, makes the POST (or other method) request, and returns the response object.

I think that's all. Let me double-check: the function takes url, data, timeout, method, and any other args and kwargs. It constructs the request with those parameters and returns the response. That should work.
