Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called add_asset and it's an instance method, so it should take 'self' as the first parameter. The parameters are 'basename' and 'file_path'. 

The docstring explains that this function assigns the filepath from filepath() in the class to a 'basename' in '_assets'. So, I need to update the '_assets' dictionary in the class. 

In the function, I'll access the '_assets' attribute of 'self' and set it equal to a dictionary where the key is 'basename' and the value is 'file_path'. 

I should make sure that the code is properly indented and fits within a class. So, the code will be:

def add_asset(self, basename, file_path):
    self._assets[basename] = file_path

That should do it. I don't need any imports here since it's just assigning a value.
