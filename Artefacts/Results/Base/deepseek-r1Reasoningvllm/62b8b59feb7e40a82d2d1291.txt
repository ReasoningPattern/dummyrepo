Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me see what the user provided. The function is called _getTargetClass, and it's supposed to return the implementation without the 'Py' or 'Fallback' suffix. 

Hmm, the function is part of a class, probably in a template or templating system. The docstring says it should return the implementation, stripping off 'Py' and 'Fallback'. So, the implementation is likely a string that includes these prefixes, and I need to remove them.

Wait, in Jinja2 templating, for example, you have {{ something|py }} which returns 'something' without the 'py' suffix. So maybe this function is meant to extract that part. The function is returning self.__class__.__name__, but that includes 'Py' or 'Fallback'. 

So, to get rid of 'Py', I can slice the string up to -2 characters because 'Py' is two letters. Alternatively, I can split the string on '_' and take the last part. Both methods should work.

Let me test the first approach: if self.__class__.__name__ is 'MyClassPy', then [:-2] would give 'MyClass'. Similarly, if it's 'Fallback', [:-2] would leave an empty string, but that's unlikely. The second approach, splitting on '_', would take the last element, which should be the desired class name.

I think the second method is safer because it handles cases where the class name might have underscores. So, using split('_') and taking [-1] would give the correct class name without the suffix.

Putting it all together, the function should return self.__class__.__name__.split('_')[-1]. That should effectively strip off any 'Py' or 'Fallback' suffixes.

I should write the code accordingly, making sure it's a one-liner. No need for any imports since it's just string manipulation.
