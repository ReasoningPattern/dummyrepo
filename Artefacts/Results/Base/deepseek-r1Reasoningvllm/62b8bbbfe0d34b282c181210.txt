Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called append_text_to_file and it's supposed to write the text buffer to a file. Let me think about what each parameter does.

The function takes four parameters: file_name, text_buffer, encoding, and overwrite, which defaults to False. The docstring explains that it writes the data in the text buffer to a file. 

First, I should open the file. I know that in Python, the open function is used, and I need to handle both binary and text modes. Since the function deals with text, I'll probably use text mode. But wait, the encoding parameter is provided, so maybe the file should be opened in text mode with that encoding.

Wait, but if the file is opened in text mode, and the encoding isn't specified, it might use the default encoding. So I should specify the encoding parameter when opening the file. So the opening line would be something like with open(file_name, 'r+', encoding=encoding) as f. The 'r+' mode allows reading and writing, truncating the file if it exists.

Next, I need to check if overwrite is True. If it is, I should truncate the file before writing. How do I do that? Using f.seek(0) would move the cursor to the beginning of the file. Then I can write the text_buffer using f.write(text_buffer).

If overwrite is False, I should append the text instead. So I'll just do f.write(text_buffer) without truncating.

I should also make sure that the file is properly closed after writing. The with statement in Python automatically handles closing the file, so I don't need to worry about that.

Putting it all together, the function will open the file, check the overwrite flag, either truncate and write or just write, and then close the file.

Wait, but what if the file doesn't exist? Using 'r+' mode will create it if it doesn't exist, which is fine. So the code should handle that case as well.

Let me structure the code step by step. Open the file, check if overwrite is True. If yes, seek to 0 and write. Else, just write. Then return the file object, which in this case is the variable f.

So the code inside the function would be:

with open(file_name, 'r+', encoding=encoding) as f:
    if overwrite:
        f.seek(0)
    f.write(text_buffer)

And then return f.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the file object? Or is it just writing and returning nothing? The original code example I was given returns None, but in the function signature, it's not specified. The user's example code returns None, so I'll follow that.

So the function will open the file, perform the necessary writes, and return the file object.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
