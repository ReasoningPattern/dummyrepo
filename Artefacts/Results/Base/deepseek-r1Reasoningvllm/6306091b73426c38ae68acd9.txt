Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called workspace_manager and takes a single argument cls. The docstring says it gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

So, the function should call cls._get_service() with the string 'WORKSPACE_MANAGER'. It should return whatever _get_service returns. 

I remember that in Python, to call a method, you use the method name followed by parentheses. So, inside the function, I'll write return cls._get_service('WORKSPACE_MANAGER').

I should make sure the code is properly indented and follows the correct syntax. Since it's a function, I'll define it with def workspace_manager(cls): and then the return statement.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: it takes cls as an argument, calls _get_service with the service name, and returns the result. No imports are needed here because _get_service is assumed to be available in the class.
