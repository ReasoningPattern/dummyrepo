Okay, I need to write a Python function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is called _shuffled, takes a sequence of strings, and returns a list of strings. The docstring says it shuffles the seq with a fixed random seed. 

Hmm, so the key here is that the shuffling is deterministic because of the fixed seed. That means every time the function is called with the same input, it should produce the same shuffled output.

I remember that in Python, the random.shuffle function shuffles the list in place. But if I use a fixed seed, the order will always be the same. So I should set the random seed before shuffling.

Wait, how do I set the seed? Oh right, I can use random.seed with a specific value. Let's choose a number, maybe 42 since it's common.

So the steps are: import random, set the seed, convert the input sequence to a list because random.shuffle requires a mutable sequence, shuffle it, then convert it back to a list and return.

Wait, the input is a Sequence[str], which could be a list or a tuple. So I need to make a copy of it as a list. Then shuffle, then return as a list. But since the input is a sequence, maybe it's better to create a new list to avoid modifying the original. Or, perhaps, just convert it to a list, shuffle, and return the shuffled list.

Let me structure the code. Import random, then in the function, set the seed. Then make a copy of the sequence as a list, shuffle it, then return it.

Wait, but the input is a Sequence[str], which is from the typing module. So I need to import Sequence from typing as well.

Putting it all together: import random and Sequence. Then define the function, set the seed, convert seq to a list, shuffle, return the new list.

I think that's it. So the code will look like:

import random
from typing import Sequence

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    random.seed(42)
    shuffled = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled)
    return shuffled

Yes, that should do it. It uses a fixed seed, so the shuffle is reproducible. Each call with the same seq will return the same shuffled list.
