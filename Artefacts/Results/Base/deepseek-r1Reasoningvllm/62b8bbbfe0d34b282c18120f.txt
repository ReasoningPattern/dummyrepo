Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called file_to_textbuffer, and it takes two parameters: file_name and encoding. The docstring says it's supposed to load a file into a text buffer.

Hmm, so the function should open the specified file and read its contents into a text buffer. I remember that in Python, you can open a file using the open function, and then read it with read() or readlines(). Since the function needs to return the text buffer, I'll probably read the entire content.

Wait, the encoding parameter is there, so I should specify that when opening the file. Otherwise, it might default to the wrong encoding, especially if the file is saved in a different encoding like UTF-8.

I should check if the file can be opened with the given encoding. Maybe raise an error if it fails, but the problem doesn't specify error handling, so perhaps it's beyond the scope here.

So the steps are: open the file with the given encoding, read all the data, and return it as a string.

Let me write the code. The function will return the file's content. Using a with statement is good for handling files properly, ensuring they're closed after reading.

Putting it all together, the code inside the function will be: open the file, read it, and return the data.
