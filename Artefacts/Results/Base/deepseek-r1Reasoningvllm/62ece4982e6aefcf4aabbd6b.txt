Okay, I need to write a Python function called subclasses that takes a class as an argument and returns all of its subclasses, including those of subclasses, in a recursive manner. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, the inspect module has a method called getsubclasses(). This method returns a list of all subclasses of a given class, including those that are not directly defined but are subclasses of other subclasses. So using inspect.getsubclasses() should handle the recursion automatically.

Wait, but what if the class itself has a __bases__ attribute that includes other classes? I think getsubclasses() should handle that by recursively including all of them.

So the function will import inspect, then take the class as an argument. Then, it will call inspect.getsubclasses(cls) and return that list.

I should make sure to handle cases where the class might not have any subclasses. In that case, getsubclasses() will return an empty list, which is correct.

Putting it all together, the function will import inspect, then use getsubclasses() to get all the subclasses. So the code should be straightforward.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
