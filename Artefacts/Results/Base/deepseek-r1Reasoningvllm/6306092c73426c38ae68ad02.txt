Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_arg_deprecation and it takes two parameters: self, cli_args, and answer_file_args. The docstring explains that this function validates and prints deprecated arguments.

First, I'll start by writing the function definition. Since it's a method in a class, I'll include the self parameter. The parameters are cli_args and answer_file_args, both dictionaries.

Next, I need to process these arguments. The docstring mentions validating them, so I'll probably have to check each key in cli_args against answer_file_args. For each key in cli_args, if it's not in answer_file_args, I should print a warning. Also, if a key exists in cli_args but not in answer_file_args, I should warn the user about deprecation.

I'll loop through each key in cli_args. For each key, I'll check if it's in answer_file_args. If it's not, I'll print a message saying it's deprecated and what the correct argument is. If it is present, I'll check if the value is the same as in answer_file_args. If not, I'll warn about the change.

I'll use an if-elif-else structure to handle these cases. If the key is not in answer_file_args, print a deprecated warning. Else if the values differ, print a deprecation warning. If it's the same, do nothing.

I'll make sure to format the messages clearly, using placeholders for the keys and values. Also, I'll ensure the code is clean and readable, using appropriate indentation.

Finally, I'll test the code mentally to see if it covers all cases: checking presence and value differences. I think this should handle the validation as required.
