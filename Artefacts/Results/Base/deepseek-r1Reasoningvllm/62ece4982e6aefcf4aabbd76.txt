Okay, I need to write a Python function called match that checks if a given filename is a 'doxyfile'. Let me think about what a doxyfile is. From what I remember, doxyfiles are typically used by Doxygen, an automated documentation generator. They usually have a specific extension and structure.

First, looking at the function signature provided, it's a single-line docstring. The docstring says that the function checks if the type of the filename is 'doxyfile'. So, the function should return True if the filename's extension is .doxyfile, right?

Wait, but sometimes filenames can be case-insensitive. The function should check the lowercase version of the filename. So, I should convert the filename to lowercase first.

What's the best way to get the filename's extension? Using the os.path module's suffix function makes sense because it handles different operating systems automatically. So, I'll import os and then use os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower() to get the lowercase extension.

Putting it all together, the function will return True if the extension is 'doxyfile'. So the code inside the function is a simple return statement checking if the extension matches.

I should make sure to handle the case where the filename doesn't have an extension properly. For example, if the filename is just 'file', then os.path.splitext returns ('file', ''). In that case, the extension would be an empty string, so the condition would be False.

Testing some examples: 'MyDoxyFile' should return True because it becomes 'doxyfile'. 'AnotherFile' would return False. 'file.txt' would also return False. So the code should handle these cases correctly.

I think that's all. The function is straightforward once I consider the extension and case insensitivity.
