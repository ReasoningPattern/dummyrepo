Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function fix_namespace_prefix_w. The task is to replace all occurrences of "w:st=" with "w-st=" in the given content. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a string parameter 'content'. The goal is to modify this string by replacing the substring "w:st=" with "w-st=". So the straightforward way is to use the string's replace method. But wait, maybe there's more to it? Like, should it replace only the exact occurrence or consider some patterns? The docstring says to replace "w:st=", so I assume it's a direct replacement.

So the code would be something like returning content.replace("w:st=", "w-st="). But maybe I should check if there are any edge cases. For example, if the content is None, but the function is supposed to handle it? Well, the problem statement doesn't mention handling None, so perhaps we can assume that content is a string. If not, maybe the function should raise an error, but the user didn't specify that. So I'll proceed with the simple approach.

Wait, the user said to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=". So the code is simple. Just a single replace call. Let me make sure there's no other parts. Like, maybe replacing multiple instances? But the replace method in Python replaces all occurrences by default. So that's covered.

So the function would be:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    """
    Replace "w:st=" in content with "w-st=".
    """
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

That's it. No other processing needed. Let me check if there's any possible mistake. For example, if the content is a byte string, but the function is supposed to handle strings. Since the parameter is named 'content', it's likely expecting a string. So the code should work as intended.
