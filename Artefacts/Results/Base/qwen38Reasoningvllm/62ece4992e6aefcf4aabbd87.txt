Okay, I need to generate Python code for the build_app_logger function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function's purpose is to create a general-purpose application logger, mainly for debugging. The arguments are name, logfile, and debug. The return is an instantiated logger object.

First, I remember that in Python, logging is handled by the logging module. So I should use that. The function needs to configure a logger with a specific name, write logs to a file, and set the debug level based on the debug parameter.

Let me outline the steps. The function should create a logger with the given name. Then, set up a file handler to write to the specified logfile. The logging level should be set to DEBUG if debug is True, else INFO or WARNING? Wait, the docstring says "is need to debug", so probably if debug is True, set the level to DEBUG, otherwise maybe INFO. But the default for debug is True, so maybe the user can toggle it.

Wait, the default for debug is True. So when debug is True, the logger should output debug messages. But the function's name is build_app_logger, so maybe it's intended to create a logger that can be used for debugging. So the logging level should be set to DEBUG when debug is True, and perhaps something else otherwise. But the docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the default is DEBUG. Or maybe the user can set it to a different level. Hmm.

Wait, the function's args have debug as a boolean. So maybe when debug is True, the logger is set to DEBUG level, else to INFO. But the default is True, so the logger would be in debug mode by default.

Next, the logger should have a file handler. So I need to create a FileHandler instance, pointing to the logfile. Then, set the formatter for the handler. The formatter should include the timestamp, logger name, log level, and message. So using the basic format like "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s".

Also, the logger should be configured to propagate messages to the root logger? Or maybe not. The default is to propagate, but perhaps the user wants to handle it themselves. The docstring says it's a general-purpose logger, so maybe it's better to not propagate unless specified. Wait, the default for propagate is True, but maybe the function should set it to False to prevent duplication. Or maybe leave it as is. The docstring doesn't mention, so perhaps the function just creates the logger with the basic configuration.

So, putting it all together: import logging, create a logger with the given name, add a file handler, set the formatter, set the level based on debug, and return the logger.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return an instantiated logger object. So the steps would be:

1. Import logging.
2. Create a logger with logging.getLogger(name).
3. Set the logging level: if debug is True, set to logging.DEBUG, else logging.INFO.
4. Create a FileHandler for the logfile.
5. Set the formatter for the handler.
6. Add the handler to the logger.
7. Return the logger.

But wait, the default for debug is True. So the function's default behavior is to enable debug logging. Also, the logfile is 'app.log' by default. So the code should handle those defaults.

Let me check the code structure. The function is called build_app_logger, and it takes name, logfile, debug. So inside the function:

Import logging.

logger = logging.getLogger(name)

if debug is True, set logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG), else set to logging.INFO.

Then, create a file handler: fh = logging.FileHandler(logfile)

Set the formatter: formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

Add the formatter to the handler: fh.setFormatter(formatter)

Add the handler to the logger: logger.addHandler(fh)

Then return logger.

Wait, but what about the root logger? If the user wants to have other handlers, maybe they should not add the handler to the root. But the function is creating a logger with a specific name, so adding the handler to that logger is correct.

But also, sometimes people configure the root logger. However, the function is supposed to create a logger for the app, so it's better to configure that specific logger.

So the code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    """
    General purpose application logger. Useful mainly for debugging
    Args:
        name: The name of logger
        logfile: The log file need to save
        debug: is need to debug

    Returns:
        Returns an instantiated logger object
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    if debug:
        logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    else:
        logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    fh = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(fh)
    return logger

Wait, but what if the logger already exists? Like, if someone calls this function multiple times with the same name. But the function is supposed to create a new logger, so maybe that's not a concern. Or perhaps the function should check if the logger already has handlers and not add duplicates. But the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe it's okay to proceed as is.

Another thing: the default for debug is True, so the logger will be set to DEBUG level by default. The logfile is 'app.log' by default. So that's covered.

I think that's the correct approach. Let me make sure there are no errors. For example, if the logfile is not writable, the FileHandler might not work, but that's an error the user would have to handle. The function just sets up the logger.

Yes, this should work. So the code is as above.
