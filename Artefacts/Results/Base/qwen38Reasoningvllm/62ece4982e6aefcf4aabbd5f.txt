Okay, I need to generate Python code for the paging function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns every response with the length of max_results. So the function takes a list (response) and an integer (max_results), and splits the list into chunks of max_results size, returning a generator.

Wait, the function is called paging, and it's supposed to split the response into pages. So each page is a sublist of the original response, with each sublist having up to max_results elements. The generator will yield each of these sublists one by one.

How to split a list into chunks? Let me recall. One common way is to loop through the list in steps of max_results. For each step, take a slice from i to i+max_results. But I need to handle the case where the total length isn't a multiple of max_results. So for example, if the list has 10 elements and max_results is 3, the first page is 0-2, second 3-5, third 6-8, fourth 9-10 (which is 2 elements). So the loop should iterate over the list in steps of max_results, and for each step, create a sublist.

So the function will iterate from 0 to len(response) in increments of max_results. For each index i, yield response[i:i+max_results]. But wait, the docstring says "split page by page", so the generator should produce each page as a list. That makes sense.

Let me check the parameters. The response is a list, and max_results is an integer. The function should return a generator. So the code would be something like:

def paging(response, max_results):
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i+max_results]

But wait, what if max_results is zero? Oh, but the function's arguments probably assume that max_results is a positive integer. The docstring doesn't mention handling that, so maybe we don't need to handle it. The user might expect that max_results is at least 1. So the code can proceed as is.

Testing this: if response is [1,2,3,4,5], and max_results is 2, then the generator would yield [1,2], [3,4], [5]. That seems right.

So the code is straightforward. The function is a generator that yields slices of the response list. The docstring is already provided, so just need to implement that.

Wait, the docstring says "Return every response with the length of max_results". Wait, does that mean each page should have exactly max_results elements, or up to that? Because if the last page has fewer, that's okay. So the code as written would handle that. So the function is correct.

So the code is simply the loop with yield. Let me write that.
