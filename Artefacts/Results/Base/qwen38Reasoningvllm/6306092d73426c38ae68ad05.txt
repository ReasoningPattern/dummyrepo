Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring they provided. The function is called get_option_spec, and it takes command_name and argument_name as parameters. The docstring mentions that it gets the specification for the specified option name by using self.get_parser_option_specs().

Hmm, so the function is part of a class, probably related to parsing command-line arguments. The docstring says that get_parser_option_specs() is called to get the options for the given command. But wait, the function name is get_option_spec, which might be a typo? Or maybe it's intentional. Let me check again.

The docstring says: "Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()". Oh, maybe the function is supposed to retrieve the option specs for a command, but the name is a bit off. Maybe the user intended to have get_option_spec call get_parser_option_specs, but perhaps there's a confusion between command_name and argument_name.

Wait, the parameters are command_name and argument_name. But the docstring says to get options of the given command_name using get_parser_option_specs. So maybe the function is supposed to find the option specs for a specific argument within a command. Or perhaps the argument_name is actually the option name. Maybe there's a mix-up here between arguments and options. But I have to follow the given function signature and docstring.

So the task is to implement get_option_spec. The docstring suggests that it uses self.get_parser_option_specs() to get the options for the command. But how does argument_name factor into this? Maybe the function is supposed to retrieve the specification for a particular option within the command's arguments. Or perhaps the argument_name is the option's name, and the function is supposed to get that specific option's spec from the command's options.

Assuming that the function is part of a class that handles command-line parsing, maybe the get_parser_option_specs() method returns all options for a command, and get_option_spec is supposed to retrieve a specific one based on argument_name. But the parameters are named command_name and argument_name, which might be conflicting. Wait, in command-line tools, commands and options are different. For example, a command like 'run' might have options like --verbose.

So perhaps the function is meant to get the option specification for a particular option (argument_name) within a command (command_name). But how is that structured? Maybe the class has a way to store options for each command, and this function retrieves the spec for a specific option.

But without more context, I need to make some assumptions. Let's think about possible implementations. Maybe the function is part of a class that has a parser, and get_parser_option_specs() returns a list of options for the command. Then, get_option_spec would look through that list to find the one matching argument_name.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to get the option's specification from the parser's options, filtered by the command name. But again, the exact structure isn't clear. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll have to proceed with the given information.

The docstring says to use self.get_parser_option_specs() to get the options for the command. So perhaps the function is supposed to call that method and then find the option with the given argument_name. But how? Maybe the get_parser_option_specs() returns a dictionary or a list of option specs, and the function needs to retrieve the one that matches argument_name.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the option specification for the given argument name in the specified command. So the steps would be: get all options for the command using get_parser_option_specs, then find the one that matches argument_name. But how is the argument_name related to the options? Maybe the argument_name is the name of the option, like --option-name.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check if the argument_name is an option for the command_name. But again, without knowing the exact structure of the data, it's a bit tricky.

Let me think of a possible implementation. Suppose that get_parser_option_specs() returns a list of option specifications, each with a name attribute. Then, the function could iterate through that list and return the one where the name matches argument_name. But maybe the argument_name is the long name of the option, like '--help', or the short name like '-h'.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the option's spec based on the command and the argument. But perhaps the argument_name is actually the option's name. So the code might look like:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    for option in options:
        if option.name == argument_name:
            return option
    return None

But wait, the original docstring says "Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()". So maybe the function is supposed to call get_parser_option_specs() with command_name, and then find the option with the name argument_name. However, the function's name is get_option_spec, which might imply that it's getting the spec for a single option, not all options.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the option's specification for the given command and argument. But perhaps the argument_name is the option's name. So the code would need to retrieve the options for the command and then find the one that matches the argument_name.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of get_parser_option_specs, I have to make assumptions. Let me proceed with the idea that get_parser_option_specs() returns a list of options for the command, and the function is supposed to find the one with the name argument_name.

So the code would be something like:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    for option in options:
        if option.name == argument_name:
            return option
    return None

But maybe the get_parser_option_specs() method is supposed to take the command name and return the options, and then the function filters them by argument_name. However, the function's parameters are command_name and argument_name, which might be redundant if the get_parser_option_specs() already takes command_name. Wait, the original docstring says "Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()", which suggests that get_parser_option_specs is a method that takes command_name as an argument. So perhaps the function get_option_spec is supposed to call get_parser_option_specs with command_name, and then find the option with the name argument_name.

But the function's name is get_option_spec, which might be a mistake. Maybe it should be get_option_specs, but the user provided the signature as get_option_spec. So I need to follow that.

Another possibility is that the function is part of a parser class, and the get_parser_option_specs() is a helper method that returns the options for the command. Then, get_option_spec would retrieve the specific option's spec based on the argument name.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the option's specification for the given command and argument, but the argument is actually the option's name. So the code would be as above.

But since the user hasn't given more details, I'll have to proceed with this logic. Also, the user said not to include any explanation, just the code. So I need to make sure the code is written correctly, even if the function's name and parameters might be a bit confusing.

Another thought: perhaps the function is supposed to get the option's spec for a specific command and argument, but the argument_name is the name of the argument, not the option. But that would be conflicting with the docstring's mention of option name.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to get the option's spec for a command's argument. But again, not sure.

In any case, the code should call self.get_parser_option_specs() with command_name, then process the result to find the option with the name argument_name. So the code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    for option in options:
        if option.name == argument_name:
            return option
    return None

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. However, without knowing the actual structure of the options, like whether they are stored in a dictionary or list, this is speculative. But given the information, this seems like a reasonable approach. Also, the user might be using a library where the options are stored in a certain way, like each option has a 'name' attribute.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the option's spec directly, and the docstring is a bit off. But given the docstring, the code should call get_parser_option_specs() and then find the option with the argument_name.

Another possibility is that the function is supposed to return the option's specification for the given command and argument, but the argument is actually the option's name. So the code would be as above.

I think that's the best approach given the information. So the code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    for option in options:
        if option.name == argument_name:
            return option
    return None

But maybe the get_parser_option_specs() returns a dictionary where the keys are the option names. Then, it could be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    return self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name).get(argument_name)

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the original docstring says that get_parser_option_specs() is used to get the options for the command, so perhaps the function is supposed to call that method and then find the option with the given argument_name.

So the code would be as follows. Let's proceed with that.
