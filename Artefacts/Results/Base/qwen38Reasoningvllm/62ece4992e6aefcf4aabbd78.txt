Okay, I need to create a Python function called is_local that checks if a given host is the localhost. The docstring says that localhost includes local IP, username, local domain name, 'localhost', and '127.0.0.1'. So, the function should return True if the host matches any of these.

First, I should figure out how to get the local hostname and IP. For the hostname, using socket.gethostname() makes sense. But wait, sometimes that might return something like 'pc-name' which isn't necessarily the same as the local domain. Hmm, maybe I need to check the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) as well. Oh, right, the docstring mentions local domain name, so perhaps I should get the FQDN and check if it's in the host.

Also, the function needs to check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. But how about the local IP address? Like, if the host is the machine's own IP, such as 192.168.1.5, then it should return True. So I need to get the local IP and compare it.

Wait, but getting the local IP might be tricky. Because there could be multiple network interfaces. Maybe I should check all possible local IPs? Or just the primary one? The docstring says 'local IP', so perhaps it's enough to check if the host is in the list of local IPs. But how to get them?

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to check if the host is either 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's own hostname. But the docstring mentions local domain name as well. So perhaps I need to check the hostname's FQDN against the local domain.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the local machine's hostname and domain. For example, if the machine's hostname is 'myhost' and domain is 'example.com', then 'myhost.example.com' would be considered local. But how to get that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the host is any of the local machine's hostnames, including the FQDN. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the standard approach.

In many cases, checking if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' is sufficient. However, the docstring says it should also include the local IP, username, and local domain name. Wait, username? That seems odd. Maybe it's a typo and meant to say 'local hostname'? Because checking the username as part of the host doesn't make much sense. Maybe the user meant the local machine's hostname.

So, perhaps the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's own hostname. Also, maybe the local domain name. But how to get the local domain name?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the host is the same as the local machine's hostname, regardless of domain. For example, if the machine's hostname is 'myhost', then 'myhost' or 'myhost.example.com' (if the domain is included) would be considered local.

But the docstring says 'local domain name', so maybe the function should check if the host matches the local hostname (without domain) or the FQDN. Or perhaps it's checking if the host is in the local network, but that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the local machine's hostname, like if the host is 'localhost' or the machine's own hostname. Also, '127.0.0.1' is the loopback address. So maybe the function should check if the host is any of those.

But how to get the machine's own hostname? Using socket.gethostname() gives the short hostname. To get the FQDN, use socket.getfqdn(). So maybe the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or matches the machine's hostname or FQDN.

But the docstring says 'local IP' which could be any of the machine's IP addresses. So perhaps the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or any of the machine's local IPs. However, getting all local IPs is more involved.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the local machine's hostname, and the local domain. For example, if the machine's hostname is 'myhost' and domain is 'example.com', then 'myhost' or 'myhost.example.com' would be considered local. But how to determine the local domain?

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to check if the host is the same as the local machine's hostname, regardless of domain. So, for example, if the host is 'myhost', then it's local. But if the host is 'myhost.example.com', then it's also local. But how to handle that?

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's hostname. But then, what about the domain? Maybe the user wants to check if the host is in the local network, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the host is the same as the local machine's hostname, considering both the short name and FQDN. Also, check for 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1'.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' (case-insensitive? Probably not, but maybe the function should handle case? The docstring doesn't specify, but maybe it's better to check case-insensitively? Or just as is.)

2. Get the local machine's hostname and check if it matches the host. Also get the FQDN and check if it matches.

But wait, the hostname might not include the domain. For example, if the machine's hostname is 'myhost' and the domain is 'example.com', then the FQDN is 'myhost.example.com'. So, perhaps the function should check if the host is equal to the machine's hostname (without domain) or the FQDN.

But how to handle that? For example, if the host is 'myhost', and the machine's hostname is 'myhost', then return True. If the host is 'myhost.example.com', and the FQDN is that, then return True.

But what about the local IP? The docstring says 'local IP' is included. So perhaps the function should also check if the host is any of the machine's local IP addresses. But how to get those?

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the local machine's hostname, and the local domain. So, for example, if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', or the machine's hostname (like 'myhost') or the machine's FQDN (like 'myhost.example.com'), then return True.

But how to get the machine's hostname and FQDN? Using socket.gethostname() and socket.getfqdn().

So, the function could check if the host is in the set {'localhost', '127.0.0.1', socket.gethostname(), socket.getfqdn()}.

But wait, what if the host is an IP address that's not 127.0.0.1 but is a local IP? For example, if the machine has an IP like 192.168.1.5, then that should also be considered local. But how to check that?

That's more complicated. To check if the host is a local IP, perhaps we can get all the local IPs and check if the host is in that list. However, that's not straightforward. For example, how to get all the local IPs?

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the machine's own hostname and domain, and not the actual IP addresses. So maybe the function is intended to check if the host is the same as the machine's hostname, or the FQDN, or 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.

But the docstring says 'local IP', so perhaps the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or any of the machine's local IP addresses.

But how to get the local IP addresses? Well, perhaps we can use socket to get the local IP. For example, using socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) gives the IP address of the machine. But that might not be reliable. Also, there could be multiple IPs.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to check if the host is the same as the machine's hostname, or 'localhost', or '127.0.0.1'. The mention of 'local domain name' is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake, and they meant the FQDN.

So, putting this together, the function could check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or matches the machine's hostname (without domain) or FQDN.

But how to handle the case where the host is an IP address that's not 127.0.0.1 but is a local IP? For example, if the machine is on a local network, then other IPs in the same subnet might be considered local. But that's more complex and depends on the network configuration.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user just wants to check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's own hostname. Let's proceed with that.

So, the code would:

- Check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' (case-insensitive? Probably not, but maybe the function should be case-insensitive? The docstring doesn't specify, but maybe it's better to check case-insensitively for 'localhost'? Or just as given.)

Wait, the function's arguments are 'host', which is the hostname or IP. So, the host could be in any case. For example, 'localhost' vs 'Localhost'. But the standard is usually lowercase. However, the function may need to handle that. But the docstring doesn't mention case, so perhaps we can assume that the host is provided in the correct format.

So, the code would first check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. Then, check if the host is equal to the machine's hostname or FQDN.

But how to get the machine's hostname and FQDN?

In Python, socket.gethostname() returns the short hostname, and socket.getfqdn() returns the FQDN. So, for example, if the machine's hostname is 'myhost', then gethostname() returns 'myhost', and getfqdn() returns 'myhost.example.com' if that's the domain.

So, the function could compare the host against these values.

But what about the local domain name? Maybe the user wants to check if the host is in the local domain. For example, if the machine is part of a domain, then hosts in that domain are considered local. But that's more complex and would require knowing the local domain, which might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the 'local domain name' refers to the machine's own domain. So, if the host is the machine's FQDN, then it's considered local.

So, the code could be:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    """
    Checks if the host is the localhost,
    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Args:
        host: The hostname or ip

    Returns:
        True if the host is the localhost else False
    """
    local_hostnames = {socket.gethostname(), socket.getfqdn()}
    return host in local_hostnames or host == 'localhost' or host == '127.0.0.1'

Wait, but the docstring says 'local IP' as well. So, perhaps the function should also check if the host is a local IP address. But how to determine that? For example, checking if the host is an IPv4 address and belongs to the local machine's IP addresses.

But that's more involved. Let me think: To check if the host is a local IP, perhaps we can try to resolve it to an IP and see if it's in the list of the machine's IPs. But that's not reliable, as the machine might have multiple IPs.

Alternatively, maybe the user considers 'local IP' as any IP that's not public. But that's not something we can easily determine without checking the IP's range.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended to check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's hostname. So the code would check those three possibilities.

Wait, but the docstring says 'local IP, user name, local domain name'. Wait, 'user name'? That's probably a typo. Maybe it's 'hostname'? Because 'user name' doesn't make sense in this context. So, assuming that, the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', the machine's hostname, or the machine's FQDN.

But then, what about the local IP? For example, if the host is an IP like 192.168.1.5, which is the machine's local IP, then it should return True. So, how to check that?

To get the machine's local IP addresses, perhaps we can use socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()), but that gives the primary IP. However, there might be multiple IPs. So, perhaps we can get all the IPs of the machine.

But how to get all the IPs? For example, using socket.getaddrinfo() to get all the addresses.

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants to check if the host is the same as the machine's own hostname or IP. So, for example, if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' or the machine's hostname or FQDN, then return True.

But the docstring says 'local IP' which might mean any IP that's part of the local network. However, that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the machine's own IP address. So, if the host is the same as the machine's IP, then return True. But how to get that?

So, maybe the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's own IP address. But again, how to get that.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the machine's hostname, and the local domain. For example, if the host is 'myhost' or 'myhost.example.com', then return True.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's hostname (without domain) or FQDN. Also, maybe check if the host is an IP address that's in the same subnet as the machine's IP. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants to check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' or the machine's hostname. Let's proceed with that.

So, code steps:

- Check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' → return True.

- Else, check if host is equal to the machine's hostname or FQDN → return True.

But wait, what about if the host is an IP address that's not 127.0.0.1 but is the machine's own IP? For example, if the machine's IP is 192.168.1.5, then host '192.168.1.5' should return True. So, perhaps we need to check if the host is an IP address that's the machine's own IP.

But how to get the machine's own IP addresses? Let's think.

We can use socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) to get the IP address. However, this might not return all IPs, just the primary one. Also, if the machine is connected to multiple networks, this could vary.

Alternatively, we can use socket.getaddrinfo() to get all the addresses.

But perhaps the user wants to check if the host is the same as the machine's own IP. So, for example, if the host is an IP address that's assigned to the machine.

But how to handle that? Let's think of code that can get the machine's own IP addresses.

For example:

import socket

def get_local_ips():
    ips = set()
    try:
        # Get all the IP addresses of the local machine
        for family, _, _, _, addr in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None):
            if family == socket.AF_INET:
                ips.add(addr[0])
    except socket.error:
        pass
    return ips

Then, in the is_local function, check if the host is in this set, or is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.

But then, what about the hostname? For example, if the host is the machine's hostname, like 'myhost', then it should return True.

So, combining all these possibilities:

The function should return True if the host is:

- 'localhost'

- '127.0.0.1'

- the machine's hostname (without domain)

- the machine's FQDN (with domain)

- any of the machine's local IP addresses.

But how to handle that?

So, the code could be:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    """
    Checks if the host is the localhost,
    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Args:
        host: The hostname or ip

    Returns:
        True if the host is the localhost else False
    """
    # Check for 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1'
    if host in ('localhost', '127.0.0.1'):
        return True
    # Get the machine's hostname and FQDN
    local_hostname = socket.gethostname()
    local_fqdn = socket.getfqdn()
    # Check if host matches the local hostname or FQDN
    if host == local_hostname or host == local_fqdn:
        return True
    # Check if host is a local IP address
    try:
        # Resolve the host to an IP address
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(host)
        # Get the machine's local IPs
        local_ips = set()
        for family, _, _, _, addr in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None):
            if family == socket.AF_INET:
                local_ips.add(addr[0])
        # Check if the resolved IP is in the local IPs
        return ip in local_ips
    except socket.error:
        # If host is not a valid IP, return False
        return False

Wait, but this code would resolve the host to an IP, and then check if that IP is in the local IPs. However, if the host is a hostname that resolves to a local IP, then this would return True. But if the host is a local IP, then it would resolve to itself, and check if it's in the local IPs.

But this approach has some issues. For example, if the host is a local IP but not in the machine's local IPs, it would return False. Also, if the host is a hostname that resolves to a local IP, but the machine's hostname is different, it would return True.

But according to the docstring, the function should return True if the host is the localhost, which includes the local IP. So, perhaps the function should check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's own hostname or FQDN, or any of the machine's own IP addresses.

But then, how to handle the case where the host is an IP address that's not 127.0.0.1 but is one of the machine's IPs.

So, the code would need to check if the host is an IP address that's in the local IPs.

But the code above would do that. However, there's a problem: if the host is a hostname that resolves to a local IP, like 'myhost' which resolves to 192.168.1.5, then the code would check if that IP is in the local IPs. But if the machine's hostname is 'myhost', then the code would have already checked that. So maybe the code is redundant.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to check if the host is the same as the machine's own hostname, or if it's an IP address that's the machine's own IP.

But then, what about the FQDN? For example, if the host is the FQDN, like 'myhost.example.com', then it should return True.

But how to handle that? Well, the code checks if host is equal to the machine's hostname or FQDN. So that's covered.

But what about the case where the host is an IP address that's not 127.0.0.1 but is the machine's own IP? The code would resolve that host to an IP, then check if it's in the local IPs. But if the host is an IP, then gethostbyname(host) would return that IP. Then, check if it's in the local IPs.

But in that case, the code would return True if the host is a local IP.

But this approach could have issues. For example, if the host is 'localhost', which is a hostname, but the code would check it in the first condition. Similarly for '127.0.0.1'.

So, the code would first check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', then check if it's the machine's hostname or FQDN. Then, if it's an IP, check if it's in the machine's local IPs.

But what about the case where the host is a local IP but not in the machine's local IPs? For example, if the machine has multiple IPs, but the host is one of them. Well, the code would check that.

But how to get the machine's local IPs? The code uses socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None) to get all the addresses. For each address, if it's AF_INET (IPv4), then add the IP address to the set. Then, check if the host (if it's an IP) is in that set.

But there's a problem: socket.gethostname() might not resolve to the same IP as the machine's actual IP. For example, if the machine's hostname is 'myhost', but it's connected to a network where the IP is 192.168.1.5. Then, socket.gethostname() might return 'myhost', and socket.getaddrinfo would return the IP addresses. So, the code would collect all the IPs of the machine.

But this approach could work.

So, putting it all together:

The function first checks if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' → return True.

Then, check if host is equal to the machine's hostname or FQDN → return True.

If the host is an IP address, resolve it and check if it's in the machine's local IPs → return True.

Else, return False.

But there's a problem with the code. For example, if the host is a hostname that resolves to a local IP, but the machine's hostname is different. For example, if the host is 'myhost' which resolves to 192.168.1.5, and the machine's hostname is 'myhost', then it would return True. But if the machine's hostname is 'myhost', and the host is 'myhost', then the code would return True in the second condition.

But what if the host is an IP address that's not 127.0.0.1 but is the machine's own IP? Then, the third condition would check that.

But how to handle the case where the host is a hostname that resolves to a local IP, but the machine's hostname is different. For example, if the host is 'myhost' which resolves to 192.168.1.5, and the machine's hostname is 'myhost', then it's covered. But if the machine's hostname is 'myhost', and the host is 'myhost', then it's covered. If the host is 'myhost.example.com', which is the FQDN, then it's covered.

But what about if the host is a local IP that's not in the machine's IPs? Like, if the machine is on a network and the host is another machine's IP. Then, it would return False.

But according to the docstring, the 'local IP' refers to the machine's own IP. So, the code should check if the host is the machine's own IP.

But then, the code would need to handle both hostnames and IPs.

So, the code would first check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.

Then, check if the host is the machine's hostname or FQDN.

Then, if the host is an IP, check if it's in the machine's local IPs.

But how to determine if the host is an IP? Well, we can try to parse it. For example, using a try-except block to attempt to resolve it as an IP.

Alternatively, we can check if the host is a valid IP address. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, we can check if the host is in the local IPs, regardless of whether it's a hostname or IP. But that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the code can first check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. Then, check if the host is the machine's hostname or FQDN. Then, if the host is an IP address, check if it's in the machine's local IPs.

But how to check if the host is an IP address? Maybe using a regex or trying to parse it.

Alternatively, we can try to resolve the host to an IP address, and then check if that IP is in the machine's local IPs. But this could lead to errors if the host is not a valid IP.

So, the code would have a try-except block for socket.gethostbyname(host), which would raise socket.error if the host is not a valid IP.

So, the code would be:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    """
    Checks if the host is the localhost,
    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Args:
        host: The hostname or ip

    Returns:
        True if the host is the localhost else False
    """
    # Check for 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1'
    if host in ('localhost', '127.0.0.1'):
        return True
    # Get the machine's hostname and FQDN
    local_hostname = socket.gethostname()
    local_fqdn = socket.getfqdn()
    # Check if host matches the local hostname or FQDN
    if host == local_hostname or host == local_fqdn:
        return True
    # Check if host is a local IP address
    try:
        # Resolve the host to an IP address
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(host)
        # Get the machine's local IPs

        return ip in local_ips
    except socket.error:
        # If host is not a valid IP, return False
        return False

But this code may have some issues. For example, if the host is a hostname that resolves to a public IP, then it would return False. Also, if the host is a local IP but not in the machine's local IPs, it would return False.

But according to the docstring, the function should return True if the host is the localhost, which includes the local IP. So, this code would handle that.

But what about the 'user name' part? The docstring says 'user name' but that's probably a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be 'hostname'? So, perhaps the code is okay.

Another thing: the function should return True if the host is the localhost, which could be a hostname or an IP. So, the code checks for 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', the machine's hostname, the machine's FQDN, and any of the machine's local IPs.

But what about the case where the host is a local IP but not in the machine's local IPs? For example, if the machine has multiple IPs, but the host is one of them. Well, the code would check that.

But perhaps there's a better way. For example, checking if the host is the same as the machine's hostname, or if it's an IP that's in the machine's local IPs.

But this code may work.

Testing this code:

Case 1: host is 'localhost' → return True.

Case 2: host is '127.0.0.1' → return True.

Case 3: host is the machine's hostname → return True.

Case 4: host is the machine's FQDN → return True.

Case 5: host is a local IP (like 192.168.1.5) → if that's one of the machine's IPs, return True.

Case 6: host is a public IP → return False.

But how to handle the case where the host is a local IP but not the machine's own IP? Like, if the machine is on a network and the host is another machine's IP. Then, it would return False.

So, this code seems to cover the cases mentioned in the docstring.

But there's a problem: when checking if the host is a local IP, the code resolves the host to an IP. But if the host is a hostname that resolves to a local IP, then it would return True. However, if the host is a local IP (like 192.168.1.5), then it would resolve to that IP, and check if it's in the machine's local IPs.

But what if the host is a local IP that's not the machine's own IP? Like, if the machine is connected to a network and the host is another machine's IP. Then, the code would return False.

So, this code should work.

But what about the case where the host is a local IP that's not in the machine's local IPs? For example, if the machine has multiple network interfaces, but the host is an IP on another interface. Well, the code would collect all the IPs from the machine's hostname, so that should be covered.

Another thing: the code uses socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None) to get all the addresses. But that might include other address families like AF_INET6. So, perhaps we should check for both IPv4 and IPv6.

But the docstring mentions 'local IP', which could be IPv4 or IPv6. So, maybe the code should check for both.

But the code currently checks for AF_INET (IPv4). To include IPv6, we can check for AF_INET6 as well.

So, modifying the code:

local_ips = set()
for family, _, _, _, addr in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None):
    if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
        local_ips.add(addr[0])

But then, the code would collect both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

But the function is supposed to check if the host is the localhost, which includes local IPs. So, the code should handle both.

But then, when the host is an IPv6 address like '::1', it would be considered local.

So, the code should be adjusted to include both address families.

But the original docstring says 'local IP', which might refer to IPv4. However, it's safer to include both.

So, updating the code:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    """
    Checks if the host is the localhost,
    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Args:
        host: The hostname or ip

    Returns:
        True if the host is the localhost else False
    """
    # Check for 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1'
    if host in ('localhost', '127.0.0.1'):
        return True
    # Get the machine's hostname and FQDN
    local_hostname = socket.gethostname()
    local_fqdn = socket.getfqdn()
    # Check if host matches the local hostname or FQDN
    if host == local_hostname or host == local_fqdn:
        return True
    # Check if host is a local IP address
    try:
        # Resolve the host to an IP address
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(host)
        # Get the machine's local IPs
        local_ips = set()
        for family, _, _, _, addr in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None):
            if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
                local_ips.add(addr[0])
        # Check if the resolved IP is in the local IPs
        return ip in local_ips
    except socket.error:
        # If host is not a valid IP, return False
        return False

Wait, but socket.gethostbyname(host) would only handle IPv4. For IPv6, we need to use getaddrinfo with AF_INET6.

But the code above uses gethostbyname, which is for IPv4. So, if the host is an IPv6 address, like 'fe80::1', then gethostbyname would raise an error. So, the code would not handle IPv6 addresses properly.

Therefore, perhaps we should use getaddrinfo to resolve the host to an IP address, regardless of family.

But how to handle that? Let me think. The code currently tries to resolve the host to an IP using gethostbyname, which is for IPv4. But if the host is an IPv6 address, that would fail. So, perhaps we should use getaddrinfo to resolve the host to an IP address, and then check if that IP is in the machine's local IPs.

But how to do that?

Alternative approach: check if the host is an IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6), and then check if that IP is in the machine's local IPs.

But how to check if the host is an IP address? Well, we can try to parse it. For example, using a try-except block.

Alternatively, we can use socket.getaddrinfo to get the address info for the host, and then check if any of the addresses are local.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the original code is sufficient for the intended purpose, assuming that the host is either a hostname or an IPv4 address.

But the user might have intended to include IPv6 as well. So, perhaps the code should be adjusted to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to check if the host is the same as the machine's own hostname or IP, regardless of the address family.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the initial code is acceptable, but with some adjustments.

Another approach: check if the host is 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or the machine's hostname, or the machine's FQDN. Also, check if the host is an IP address that is the machine's own IP.

But how to check if the host is an IP address? Let's think: we can try to parse it as an IP address. For example, using ipaddress module.

So, perhaps using the ipaddress module to check if the host is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, and then compare it to the machine's IPs.

But this would require more code.

Alternatively, the code can try to resolve the host to an IP and then check if that IP is in the machine's local IPs. But for that, we need to handle both IPv4 and IPv6.

So, modifying the code:

import socket
import ipaddress

def is_local(host):
    """

    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Returns:

            local_ips = set()
            for family, _, _, _, addr in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None):
                if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
                    local_ips.add(addr[0])
            # Check if the IP is in the local IPs
            return str(ip) in local_ips
        except ValueError:
            # Not a valid IP address, so check if it's a hostname
            # Resolve the hostname to an IP and check
            # But this is already handled by the previous checks?
            # Wait, no. If the host is a hostname that resolves to a local IP, then the code would have already checked that in the earlier conditions.
            # Wait, no. Because the code first checks if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', then checks if it's the machine's hostname or FQDN. If it's a hostname that resolves to a local IP, then the code would resolve it to an IP and check if it's in the machine's local IPs.

            # So, in the try block, we first try to parse the host as an IP. If that fails, then we try to resolve it as a hostname.

            # Wait, no. The code is in a try-except block. So, if the host is a valid IP, then it would parse it and check if it's in the local IPs. If it's not a valid IP, then it would proceed to resolve it as a hostname. But that's not correct. Because if the host is a hostname, then resolving it would give an IP, which we then check against the machine's local IPs.

            # So, perhaps the code should first check if the host is a valid IP. If it is, then check if it's in the machine's local IPs. If not, then resolve it as a hostname and check if it's the machine's hostname or FQDN.

            # Wait, but that's already covered in the earlier conditions. So, perhaps the code should be adjusted.

            # Let me restructure the code:

            # Check if host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' → return True.

            # Check if host is the machine's hostname or FQDN → return True.

            # Else, try to resolve the host to an IP address, and check if it's in the machine's local IPs.

            # But how to resolve the host to an IP address? Using socket.gethostbyname(host) would only handle IPv4. So, perhaps using socket.getaddrinfo(host, None) to get all address info.

            # So, modifying the code:

            # Check if host is the machine's hostname or FQDN → return True.

            # Else, try to resolve the host to an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) and check if it's in the machine's local IPs.

            # So, the code could be:

            # Get the machine's local IPs
            local_ips = set()
            for family, _, _, _, addr in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None):
                if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
                    local_ips.add(addr[0])
            # Try to resolve the host to an IP address
            try:
                # Get address info for the host
                addr_info = socket.getaddrinfo(host, None)
                # Check if any of the addresses are in the local IPs
                for family, _, _, _, addr in addr_info:
                    if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
                        if addr[0] in local_ips:
                            return True
                return False
            except socket.error:
                return False

But this approach would check if the host resolves to any of the machine's local IPs. However, this could have issues. For example, if the host is a public hostname, it would resolve to a public IP and return False.

But the code would return True if the host is a local IP (either IPv4 or IPv6) that is in the machine's local IPs.

But this approach may be more accurate.

So, putting it all together:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    """
    Checks if the host is the localhost,
    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Args:
        host: The hostname or ip

    Returns:
        True if the host is the localhost else False
    """
    # Check for 'localhost' and '127.0.0.1'
    if host in ('localhost', '127.0.0.1'):
        return True
    # Get the machine's hostname and FQDN
    local_hostname = socket.gethostname()
    local_fqdn = socket.getfqdn()
    # Check if host matches the local hostname or FQDN
    if host == local_hostname or host == local_fqdn:
        return True
    # Check if the host resolves to a local IP address
    try:
        # Get address info for the host
        addr_info = socket.getaddrinfo(host, None)
        # Check if any of the addresses are in the machine's local IPs
        # Get machine's local IPs
        machine_local_ips = set()
        for family, _, _, _, addr in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None):
            if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
                machine_local_ips.add(addr[0])
        # Check if any of the host's resolved IPs are in machine_local_ips
        for family, _, _, _, addr in addr_info:
            if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
                if addr[0] in machine_local_ips:
                    return True
        return False
    except socket.error:
        return False

But this code would check if the host resolves to any of the machine's local IPs. However, this could be problematic because if the host is a public hostname, it would resolve to a public IP and return False. If the host is a local IP, it would check if it's in the machine's local IPs.

But this approach may work. However, it's possible that the host is a local IP but not in the machine's local IPs. For example, if the machine has multiple network interfaces and the host is an IP on another interface.

But the code would collect all the machine's local IPs, so that should be covered.

But there's a problem with the code: when we call socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None), it returns all the address info for the machine's hostname, including all IPs. So, that's correct.

But what about the case where the host is a local IP but not the machine's own IP? Like, if the machine is on a network and the host is another machine's IP. Then, the code would return False.

So, this code should handle the cases mentioned in the docstring.

But the docstring mentions 'user name' which is unclear. Maybe it's a typo and should be 'hostname'.

Another thing: the code may have performance issues if the host is a public hostname, as it would attempt to resolve it. But that's part of the function's logic.

So, this code seems to cover the cases.

But let's test some scenarios:

Scenario 1: host is 'localhost' → return True.

Scenario 2: host is '127.0.0.1' → return True.

Scenario 3: host is the machine's hostname (e.g., 'myhost') → return True.

Scenario 4: host is the machine's FQDN (e.g., 'myhost.example.com') → return True.

Scenario 5: host is a local IP (e.g., '192.168.1.5') → if that's one of the machine's IPs, return True.

Scenario 6: host is a public IP → return False.

Scenario 7: host is a public hostname → return False.

So, this code should handle those.

But what about if the host is a local IP but not the machine's own IP? For example, if the machine has an IP 192.168.1.5, and the host is 192.168.1.5 → return True.

But if the host is another IP in the same subnet, like 192.168.1.6, but the machine's IP is 192.168.1.5, then it would return False. Which is correct.

So, this code should work.

But there's a problem: when the host is a local IP, the code would resolve it to an IP and check if it's in the machine's local IPs. However, if the host is a local IP that's not in the machine's local IPs, it would return False.

But according to the docstring, the function should return True if the host is the local IP. So, the code should check if the host is any of the machine's local IPs.

But the code currently does that.

Another thing: the code uses socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None), which may return multiple addresses. For example, if the machine has multiple IPs, like 192.168.1.5 and 10.0.0.1, then machine_local_ips would contain both.

So, the code seems to handle that.

But what about the case where the host is a local IP but the machine has multiple IPs? For example, if the host is 192.168.1.5 and the machine has that IP, then it would return True.

So, this code should work.

Therefore, the final code would be as above.

But the user's original docstring mentions 'local IP, user name, local domain name'. So, perhaps the 'user name' is a mistake, and should be 'hostname'.

In any case, the code checks for the hostname and FQDN, which covers the domain part.

So, the code should be:

import socket

def is_local(host):
    """
    Checks if the host is the localhost,
    the localhost include local IP, user name, local domain name, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`

    Args:
        host: The hostname or ip

    Returns:
        True if the host is the localhost else False
    """
    if host in ('localhost', '127.0.0.1'):
        return True
    local_hostname = socket.gethostname()
    local_fqdn = socket.getfqdn()
    if host == local_hostname or host == local_fqdn:
        return True
    try:
        addr_info = socket.getaddrinfo(host, None)
        machine_local_ips = set()
        for family, _, _, _, addr in socket.getaddrinfo(socket.gethostname(), None):
            if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
                machine_local_ips.add(addr[0])
        for family, _, _, _, addr in addr_info:
            if family in (socket.AF_INET, socket.AF_INET6):
                if addr[0] in machine_local_ips:
                    return True
        return False
    except socket.error:
        return False

But this code may have some issues. For example, when resolving the host, it might return multiple addresses. Also, the code is checking if any of the host's resolved IPs are in the machine's local IPs.

But this approach could work.

Alternatively, maybe the code should check if the host is the same as the machine's own IP. But how to get the machine's own IP? Well, the code collects all of them.

But this code is more comprehensive.

However, there's a possible error in the code: when resolving the host, the code may return multiple addresses, but we only need to check if any of them are in the machine's local IPs.

But the code would return True if any of the host's resolved IPs are in the machine's local IPs.

But what if the host is a hostname that resolves to multiple IPs, some of which are local and some not? For example, if the host is a local machine's hostname that also has a public IP. Then, the code would return True because it's the machine's hostname.

But if the host is a public hostname, it would resolve to a public IP and return False.

So, the code seems correct.

But perhaps the code can be simplified. For example, the code can check if the host is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', or if it's the machine's hostname or FQDN, or if it's a local IP.

But how to check if the host is a local IP? Well, the code can check if the host is an IP address (using try-except) and then compare it to the machine's local IPs.

But the code above does that.

Another thing: the code uses socket.getaddrinfo for both the machine's hostname and the host. But for the machine's hostname, it's already known, so perhaps we can just check if the host is the machine's hostname or FQDN.

So, the code is as follows.
