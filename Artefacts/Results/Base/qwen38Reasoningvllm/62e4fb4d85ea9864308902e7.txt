Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function normalize_cmd based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function takes a tuple of strings called cmd and returns a tuple of strings. The docstring says it's to complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form. Hmm, maybe the idea is to ensure that each command in the tuple has the full path to the executable. But how?

Wait, the docstring mentions "complement the full path to exe". So perhaps the function is supposed to take a command that might not have the full path and add it. But the return is "in its original form"—maybe that means if the command already has a full path, it should return it as is, but if not, add the full path? Or maybe it's about normalizing the command path in some way?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a command like ("python", "script.py") and convert it to the full path of the executable. But how would it know where the executable is located? Oh, perhaps it's using the system's PATH environment variable to find the full path of the executable. But the docstring says "return it in its original form"—maybe that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the original form refers to the canonicalized path? Like, resolving any relative paths to absolute ones?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's just the name of the executable and replace it with the full path. For example, if the cmd is ("myprogram",), it should find the full path to myprogram and return that as a tuple. But how to do that in Python?

So, the function's purpose is to take a command (like a list of arguments) and ensure that the first element is the full path to the executable. But how to find that path? Using shutil.which? Because that function searches for the executable in the PATH.

Wait, the docstring says "complement the full path to exe"—maybe "complement" here means to complete or supplement. So, if the command is given as just the executable name, the function should find its full path. But if it's already provided with the full path, leave it as is. But the return is "in its original form"—maybe that's a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Perhaps it's supposed to return the normalized form, like the absolute path?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that might have relative paths and convert them to absolute paths. For example, if the cmd is ("./script.py",), it should convert it to the absolute path.

Wait, the function's name is normalize_cmd. So perhaps it's about normalizing the command arguments. Let me think: the function takes a tuple of strings, which is the command. For each argument in the command, maybe it's supposed to resolve relative paths to absolute ones. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the first element (the executable) and replace it with the full path if it's not already present. For example, if the cmd is ("python", "script.py"), it would find the full path to python and return that as the first element, while keeping the rest of the arguments the same.

So, the approach would be: check if the first element is an absolute path. If not, find the full path using something like shutil.which. Then, return the tuple with the first element replaced by the full path.

But wait, what if the executable is not found? The function might need to handle that. However, the problem statement doesn't mention error handling, so maybe we can assume that the executable exists.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Check if the first element of the cmd tuple is an absolute path. If it is, leave it as is.
2. If it's not, use shutil.which to find the full path of the executable.
3. Replace the first element with the full path found.
4. Return the modified tuple.

But how to check if a path is absolute? In Python, a path is absolute if it starts with a slash or a drive letter (like 'C:\\' on Windows). So for each argument in the cmd, maybe we need to check if it's a valid path and resolve it. Wait, but the function is supposed to complement the full path to exe. So perhaps only the first element is the executable, and the rest are arguments. So the function should process the first element to make it an absolute path, and leave the rest as they are.

So, the code would be:

Import shutil.

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    # Check if the first element is an absolute path
    if not os.path.isabs(cmd[0]):
        # Find the full path using shutil.which
        exe_path = shutil.which(cmd[0])
        if exe_path is None:
            # What to do here? Maybe raise an error? But the problem doesn't specify.
            # Since the problem says to return the original form, maybe assume it's found.
            # But for the sake of code, perhaps we can raise a ValueError or something.
            # However, the user hasn't mentioned error handling, so maybe just proceed.
            # But since the function is supposed to complement the full path, maybe it's expected that exe_path is found.
            # So, assuming it's found, replace the first element.
            cmd = (exe_path,) + cmd[1:]
    return cmd

Wait, but the function is supposed to return a tuple. So, if the original cmd is a tuple, we need to create a new tuple. Also, we need to import os and shutil.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form." Maybe the original form refers to the canonicalized path? Like, resolving any symbolic links or making it absolute.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take a command that's a list of arguments, and for each argument, if it's a relative path, convert it to absolute. But that's not clear. The docstring is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command like ("script.py",) and return the full path to the script. But that's not clear either.

Wait, the docstring says "complement the full path to exe"—so the exe is the first element. So, for example, if the cmd is ("python", "script.py"), the function would replace "python" with the full path to the Python executable, like "/usr/bin/python" or "C:\\Python39\\python.exe".

So, the code would need to find the full path of the executable given by cmd[0], and replace it in the tuple.

But how to handle cases where the executable is not found? Well, maybe the function assumes that the executable exists. So, proceed with that.

So, the code would be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """
    Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form
    """
    if not os.path.isabs(cmd[0]):
        exe_path = shutil.which(cmd[0])
        if exe_path is None:
            # Maybe raise an exception? But the problem doesn't specify.
            # Since the user hasn't mentioned, perhaps just return the original?
            # Or maybe assume that it's found.
            # For the purpose of this code, let's assume it's found.
            # But in practice, we should handle it. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given info.
            # So perhaps proceed without error handling.
            pass  # Or raise an error?
        else:
            cmd = (exe_path,) + cmd[1:]
    return cmd

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the original form. Maybe the original form refers to the canonicalized path? Like, if the executable is found, return its absolute path, but maybe in a normalized way?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the command and return it as a tuple of strings, but with the first element being the full path. So, for example, if the cmd is ("myprogram",), it returns the full path to myprogram. If it's already absolute, returns it as is.

But the docstring says "return it in its original form"—maybe that's a mistake, and they meant to return the normalized form. Or perhaps the original form refers to the same command but with the full path.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a relative path and convert it to absolute. But again, the docstring is unclear.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to take a command that may have a relative path and return the absolute path. For example, if the cmd is ("./script.py",), it returns the absolute path to script.py.

But then, how to handle the first element? Maybe the function is supposed to normalize all the paths in the cmd tuple. But the docstring says "full path to exe", implying that the first element is the executable.

Hmm. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended functionality is to take the first element (the executable) and replace it with its full path if it's not already absolute. So, the code would do that.

So, the code would need to import os and shutil. Then, check if the first element is absolute. If not, use shutil.which to find it. Then, return the new tuple with the full path as the first element.

But the function returns a tuple of strings. So, in Python, tuples are immutable, so we need to create a new tuple.

So, the code would be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """
    Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form
    """
    if not os.path.isabs(cmd[0]):
        exe_path = shutil.which(cmd[0])
        if exe_path is None:
            # Handle error? But the problem doesn't mention it.
            # Maybe raise an exception?
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Executable {cmd[0]} not found")
        cmd = (exe_path,) + cmd[1:]
    return cmd

But the docstring says "return it in its original form"—maybe that's a mistake, and they meant to return the normalized form. Or perhaps the original form refers to the same command but with the full path. Maybe the original form is the command as given, but with the exe path completed.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a list of arguments, and for each argument, if it's a relative path, convert it to absolute. But that's not clear.

Another approach: perhaps the function is supposed to take a command like ("script.py",) and return the full path to the script. But how would it know where the script is? Unless it's relative to the current working directory. But that's not reliable.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the command and return the full path of the executable, but the rest of the arguments are kept as they are. So, for example, if the command is ("python", "script.py"), it returns the full path to python.exe or python, and the rest remains.

So, the code would be as I outlined before.

But then, what if the cmd is empty? Well, the function signature says it's a tuple of strings, so maybe it's assumed that cmd has at least one element.

So, the code would check if the first element is absolute. If not, find it using shutil.which, then replace it.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form." Maybe the original form is the same as the input, but with the exe path completed. So, the function is supposed to return the command with the full path to the exe, but the rest of the arguments are left as is.

So, the code would be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """
    Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form
    """
    if not os.path.isabs(cmd[0]):
        exe_path = shutil.which(cmd[0])
        if exe_path is None:
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Executable {cmd[0]} not found")
        cmd = (exe_path,) + cmd[1:]
    return cmd

But the function returns a tuple. However, in Python, tuples are immutable, so modifying the first element would require creating a new tuple.

Yes, that's what the code does: (exe_path,) + cmd[1:].

But what about cases where the executable is found but the path is relative? For example, if the cmd is ("python",), shutil.which would return the full path. So that's correct.

But the docstring says "return it in its original form"—maybe that's a mistranslation. Perhaps it's supposed to return the command with the full path, but the rest of the arguments are kept as they are. So, the original form refers to the command as given, but with the exe path completed.

So, the code should be as above.

But the user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the code would be:

Importing os and shutil, then checking if the first element is absolute. If not, find it with shutil.which and replace.

But the user didn't mention importing modules. However, the code must include those imports.

So, the final code would be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """
    Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form
    """
    if not os.path.isabs(cmd[0]):
        exe_path = shutil.which(cmd[0])
        if exe_path is None:
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Executable {cmd[0]} not found")
        cmd = (exe_path,) + cmd[1:]
    return cmd

But the user says to output only the code, no explanation. So, I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the function returns a tuple, which is correct.

Wait, but what if the cmd is empty? Well, the function signature says it's a tuple of strings, so maybe it's assumed that cmd is non-empty. But in practice, the code would crash if cmd is empty. However, the problem doesn't mention handling that case, so perhaps it's acceptable.

Another thing: shutil.which returns the full path of the executable, which is what we need. So, the code should work.

So, the code is as above. Now, I need to write it in Python markdown format, which is just the code with triple backticks.

But the user said to output only the code, no explanation. So, the code should be:

```python
import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """
    Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form
    """
    if not os.path.isabs(cmd[0]):
        exe_path = shutil.which(cmd[0])
        if exe_path is None:
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Executable {cmd[0]} not found")
        cmd = (exe_path,) + cmd[1:]
    return cmd
```

But wait, the function returns cmd, which is a tuple. However, if the original cmd is a tuple, and we do (exe_path,) + cmd[1:], that creates a new tuple. So, the code is correct.

Yes, that's the code.
