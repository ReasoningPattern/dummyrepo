Okay, I need to generate Python code for the to_csv function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is part of a class, probably a Graph class, since it's mentioned in the docstring. The purpose is to convert the graph's points into a CSV format. The parameters are separator (default comma) and header (optional). The docstring says that if header is not None, it's the first line of the output with a newline added. Also, for each point, first its coordinate is converted to a string separated by the separator, then each part of its value.

Wait, the graph is multidimensional. So each point has coordinates and values. Let me think: for example, if a point has coordinates (x, y) and value (a, b), then the CSV line would be "x,y,a,b" if the separator is comma. But the docstring says first convert the coordinate to string separated by separator, then each part of its value. So maybe the coordinates are split by the separator, and the values are split as well. But how are the coordinates and values structured?

Assuming that each point in the graph has a coordinate (maybe a list or tuple) and a value (also a list or tuple). For example, if the coordinate is [1, 2] and value is [3, 4], then using separator ',', the line would be "1,2,3,4".

But the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinate is split into individual elements, then the value is split into individual elements, and all are joined with the separator.

So the steps would be:

1. For each point in the graph, process its coordinate and value.
2. Convert the coordinate elements to strings, join with separator.
3. Convert the value elements to strings, join with separator.
4. Combine coordinate and value strings, separated by the separator.

Wait, but how are the coordinate and value structured? Let me think. If the graph is multidimensional, perhaps each point has multiple coordinates and multiple values. For example, in a 2D graph, each point has x and y coordinates, and maybe some values. But the exact structure isn't clear. However, the function is part of a class, so I need to assume that the class has a way to access the points, coordinates, and values.

The docstring mentions that the header is the first line if provided. So if header is given, it's added as the first line. Then each subsequent line is the data.

But how to handle the header? Let's say the header is a string, and it's written as the first line. Then each data line is constructed by concatenating the coordinate parts and value parts, separated by the separator.

Wait, maybe the header is a list of strings? Or maybe it's a single string that represents the header. The docstring says "header, if not None, is the first string of the output (new line is added automatically)." So it's a single string. For example, if the header is "x,y,value", then that line is written first.

But the function is supposed to convert the graph's points to CSV. So perhaps the header is optional, and if provided, it's added as the first line. Then each point's data is written as a line.

So the code would need to iterate over each point in the graph. For each point, get its coordinates and values, convert them to strings, split them by the separator, and then join all parts with the separator.

Wait, but the separator is used to split the coordinate and value parts. For example, if the coordinate is [1, 2], then converting to string with separator would be "1,2". Similarly for the value parts. Then combining those two strings with the separator. Wait, no. Wait, the docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinate is split into parts, then the value is split into parts, and all parts are joined with the separator.

So for a point with coordinate (x, y) and value (a, b), the line would be x_str + separator + y_str + separator + a_str + separator + b_str.

But how to get the coordinate and value from each point? The function is part of a class, so perhaps the class has an attribute like 'points' which is a list of points. Each point has 'coordinate' and 'value' attributes.

So the code would:

- Check if header is provided. If so, add it as the first line.
- For each point in self.points, process coordinate and value.
- Convert coordinate to a list of strings, joined by separator.
- Convert value to a list of strings, joined by separator.
- Combine these two parts with the separator.

Wait, but the separator is used to separate the coordinate parts and the value parts. So if the coordinate is a tuple (x, y), then converting each part to string and joining with separator gives "x,y". Similarly for the value. Then combining those two parts with the separator would result in "x,y,value_part1,value_part2".

But maybe the header is a list of strings? Or perhaps the header is a single string that represents the headers for the CSV. For example, if the header is "x,y,value", then that's the first line. Then each data line is the coordinate parts and value parts joined by the separator.

But the function's parameters say that header is a string. So the code would need to write that header line first, then the data lines.

So the code would generate a CSV string. Let's think about how to implement this.

First, the function is part of a class, so 'self' is the instance. The function is supposed to return the CSV string.

So, the steps:

1. If header is not None, add it as the first line.
2. For each point in self.points:
   a. Get the coordinate parts as strings, joined by separator.
   b. Get the value parts as strings, joined by separator.
   c. Combine them with the separator. Wait, no. Wait, the coordinate is converted to string (split by separator), then each part of its value. So perhaps the coordinate is split into parts, and the value is split into parts, and all parts are concatenated with the separator.

Wait, maybe the coordinate is a list of values, and the value is a list of values. For example, each point has a coordinate (like x, y, z) and a value (like a, b, c). So for each point, we take the coordinate elements, convert them to strings, join with separator, then take the value elements, convert to strings, join with separator, and then combine those two strings with the separator. Wait, but that would be coordinate_str + separator + value_str. But that would merge all coordinate parts and value parts into one line.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinate and value are separate, and each part is separated by the separator. For example, if the coordinate is [x, y] and value is [a, b], then the line is x_str + separator + y_str + separator + a_str + separator + b_str.

So the code would need to process each point's coordinate and value as lists, convert each element to string, then join with the separator. Then combine the coordinate and value parts into one line.

So for a point, the line would be separator.join(str(coord) for coord in coordinate) + separator + separator.join(str(val) for val in value).

Wait, but the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinate is converted to a string with the separator, then the value parts are converted to a string with the separator, and then the two are concatenated with the separator. Wait, that would be coordinate_str + separator + value_str. But that's not clear. Let me re-read the docstring.

"Since a graph can be multidimensional, for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value."

So for each point, first convert the coordinate to a string, with parts separated by the separator. Then convert each part of its value (so the value is a list of parts, each converted to string, separated by the separator). Then combine these two strings with the separator.

Wait, that would mean that the coordinate is a list of elements, and the value is a list of elements. For example, if coordinate is [1, 2] and value is [3, 4], then the line would be "1,2,3,4".

But how to handle the header? If the header is provided, it's the first line. So maybe the header is a string that represents the headers for the CSV. For example, if the header is "x,y,value", then that's the first line. Then each data line is the coordinate parts and value parts joined by the separator.

But the function's parameters say that header is a string. So perhaps the header is a single line, and the data lines are constructed by combining coordinate and value parts.

So the code would:

- Start with an empty list of lines.
- If header is not None, add it as the first line.
- For each point, create a line by combining the coordinate parts and value parts, each converted to strings and joined by the separator.

But how to get the coordinate and value from each point? Assuming that each point has a 'coordinate' and 'value' attribute. For example, in the Graph class, each point might have a coordinate (like a list or tuple) and a value (also a list or tuple).

So the code would be something like:

lines = []
if header is not None:
    lines.append(header)
for point in self.points:
    coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coordinate)
    value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
    lines.append(coord_str + separator + value_str)
return '\n'.join(lines)

But wait, the docstring says that the header is the first string, and a new line is added automatically. So if the header is provided, it's added as the first line, then each data line is added. So the code would need to handle that.

But what if the header is not provided? Then the first line is the coordinate parts and value parts. Wait, no. The docstring says that the header is optional. If it's not provided, then the CSV starts with the data lines.

But the function's name is to_csv, which suggests that it's generating a CSV string. So the code would generate a string where each line is a point's data.

But how to handle the header? Let's say the header is a string, like "x,y,value". Then the first line is that string. Then each data line is the coordinate parts and value parts joined by the separator.

But maybe the header is not a single string but a list of strings? The docstring says "header, if not None, is the first string of the output". So it's a single string.

So the code would start with the header line if provided, then for each point, create a line by joining coordinate parts and value parts with the separator.

But the function is part of a class, so the code would need to access the points. Let's assume that the class has a 'points' attribute which is a list of points. Each point has 'coordinate' and 'value' attributes.

So the code would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.
    """
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coord_parts = [str(c) for c in point.coordinate]
        value_parts = [str(v) for v in point.value]
        line = separator.join(coord_parts) + separator + separator.join(value_parts)
        lines.append(line)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

Wait, but the separator is used to separate the coordinate parts and the value parts. So for example, if the coordinate is [1, 2], value is [3, 4], then the line would be "1,2,3,4".

But maybe the header is supposed to be the column names. For example, if the header is "x,y,value", then that's the first line, and the data lines are the coordinate and value parts.

But the function's docstring says that the header is the first string, and a new line is added automatically. So the code would add the header as a line, then the data lines.

But the function is deprecated, so perhaps it's not used anymore. However, the user wants the code generated based on the given docstring.

Another thing: the function is part of a class, so the code should be inside the class. The user hasn't provided the class definition, but the function is called to_csv, so assuming that the class has a 'points' attribute.

But perhaps the 'points' are stored in a different way. For example, maybe the graph is stored as a list of coordinates and values. But without more context, I'll proceed with the assumption that each point has a coordinate and a value, which are iterable.

So the code would loop through each point, convert coordinate and value to strings separated by the separator, then combine them with the separator. Wait, but that would be joining coordinate parts with separator, then joining value parts with separator, and then combining those two strings with separator. So for coordinate [1,2], value [3,4], the line would be "1,2,3,4".

But maybe the header is supposed to be the column names. For example, if the header is "x,y,value", then the first line is that, and each data line is the coordinate parts and value parts joined by the separator.

So the code would generate the CSV as per that.

But the user's docstring says that the header is the first string, and a new line is added automatically. So the code would add the header line, then the data lines.

But how to handle the case where the header is not provided? Then the first line is the data.

But the function's parameters allow header to be None. So the code would check if header is not None, append it, then process the points.

But what if the points have varying numbers of coordinates or values? The code would generate lines with varying numbers of elements, but CSV can handle that.

So the code seems to be as above. However, the function is deprecated, so maybe it's not used anymore, but the user wants the code generated.

Another thing: the function is supposed to return the CSV string. So the code would collect all lines into a list and join them with newlines.

But perhaps the separator is used to separate the coordinate parts and the value parts. For example, if the separator is ';', then the line would be "1;2;3;4".

So the code would be as follows:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coordinate)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(coord_str + separator + value_str)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

Wait, but if the coordinate is a list of numbers, and the value is a list of numbers, then each part is converted to a string. So for a point with coordinate (1, 2) and value (3, 4), the line would be "1,2,3,4".

But maybe the header is supposed to be the column names. For example, if the header is "x,y,value", then the first line is that, and the data lines are the coordinate and value parts.

But the code as written would handle that. So the code seems correct.

But what about if the points have different numbers of coordinates or values? The code would still generate lines with the same number of elements, but that's up to the data. The function doesn't handle that, but the docstring doesn't mention it either.

So the code is as above. Now, the user says to output only the code in Python markdown format, no explanations. So I need to write the code inside triple backticks.

But the function is part of a class. The user's code starts with 'def to_csv(self, ...):', so the code should be part of a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code will assume that the class has a 'points' attribute, which is a list of points, each with 'coordinate' and 'value' attributes.

So the generated code would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.
    """
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coordinate)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(coord_str + separator + value_str)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

But wait, the docstring says that the header is the first string, and a new line is added automatically. So when the header is provided, it's added as the first line, and then the data lines follow. The code does that.

But maybe the header should be split into parts? For example, if the header is a list of strings, but the docstring says it's a single string. So the code is correct as written.

Another thing: the function is deprecated, but the code is still generated. The user says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, regardless of deprecation.

So the code should be as above. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, which is triple backticks. So the final code is:

```python
def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.
    """
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coordinate)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(coord_str + separator + value_str)
    return '\n'.join(lines)
```

But wait, the docstring says that the header is the first string, and a new line is added automatically. So if the header is provided, it's added as the first line. The code does that.

But perhaps the header should be split into parts? For example, if the header is a list of strings, but the docstring says it's a single string. So the code is correct.

I think this is the correct approach. So the code is as written above.
