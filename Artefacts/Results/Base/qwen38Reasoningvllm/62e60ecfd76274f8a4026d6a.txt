Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called protocol_handlers within a class. The function's docstring mentions that different Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the protocol_version. Hmm, first I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so it's a class method. The parameter is protocol_version, which is optional. The docstring says it returns different handlers depending on that version. So maybe the function checks the protocol_version and returns the appropriate handler.

Bolt protocol versions... I remember that Bolt is a protocol used by Neo4j. The common versions are 1, 2, and 3. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle those versions. Let me think about how to structure this.

The function might have a dictionary that maps protocol versions to their respective handler classes. Then, based on the provided version, it returns the correct one. If the version isn't specified, maybe it defaults to the latest or a specific one.

Wait, the user didn't specify the exact behavior, just the docstring. So I need to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the function returns a handler class based on the version. For example, if protocol_version is 1, return Bolt1Handler, for 2, Bolt2Handler, etc. Also, if no version is given, maybe it uses a default, like the latest version.

But how to implement this? The function is a class method, so maybe it's using a class-level dictionary to map versions to handlers. Let me outline the steps:

1. Check if protocol_version is provided. If not, use a default value, perhaps 3.
2. Use a dictionary to map each version to its handler class.
3. Return the corresponding handler class based on the version.

Wait, but the function is called protocol_handlers, which might be a static method or a class method. The user's code shows it's a class method (cls is the first parameter). So maybe the function is part of a class that has different handler classes as attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return instances of these handlers. But the docstring says "different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned," so perhaps it's returning the class itself, not an instance. Or maybe it's returning an instance based on the version.

But without more context, I'll have to make assumptions. Let's say the function returns the appropriate handler class. So, the code could look like this:

Inside the function, check the protocol_version. If it's None, default to a certain version, say 3. Then, use a dictionary to map versions to classes. For example:

handlers = {
    1: Bolt1Handler,
    2: Bolt2Handler,
    3: Bolt3Handler
}

Then return handlers.get(protocol_version, default_handler). But what if the version is not in the dictionary? Maybe raise an error or handle it somehow.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of handlers or some structure. But the docstring says "different forms... are returned based on the value," which suggests selecting one.

So the code would be something like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        protocol_version = 3  # default to latest version
    handlers = {
        1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
        2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
        3: cls.Bolt3Handler
    }
    return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.DefaultHandler)

Wait, but the user might have specific handler classes in mind. Since the function is part of a class, perhaps the handlers are defined as inner classes or attributes. So the code would need to reference them via the class.

But the user hasn't provided the actual handler classes. So I need to make placeholders. Maybe the function is part of a class that has these handlers as nested classes. So, for example, the class might have Bolt1Handler, Bolt2Handler, etc., as inner classes.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return instances. But the docstring doesn't specify that. Let me think again. The function's name is protocol_handlers, which might imply that it returns a list or a collection of handlers. But the docstring says "different forms... are returned based on the value of protocol_version," which suggests that it's returning a specific handler.

Wait, maybe the function is meant to return a handler instance. So, the code would create an instance of the appropriate handler class. But again, without knowing the exact structure, I have to make assumptions.

Another approach: perhaps the function is part of a class that has different handler implementations, and it selects which one to return based on the protocol version. For example, if the version is 1, return a handler that uses the older protocol, etc.

So, the code could be structured with a dictionary mapping versions to handler classes, then returning the corresponding class. Let me draft that.

Also, the function is a class method, so it's using cls. So, the code would need to access the handler classes via cls.

Putting it all together, here's a possible implementation:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        protocol_version = 3  # default to latest version
    handlers = {
        1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
        2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
        3: cls.Bolt3Handler
    }
    return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.DefaultHandler)

But I need to make sure that the handler classes exist in the class. Since the user hasn't provided them, I'll have to assume they are present as inner classes.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of handlers, but the docstring says "different forms... are returned based on the value," which implies a single handler. So, returning a single class or instance makes sense.

Another thing: the function's parameters. The protocol_version is optional, so if it's not provided, the default is used. The function is a class method, so it's called as cls.protocol_handlers(...).

Wait, but in Python, if you define a function with 'cls' as the first parameter, it's a class method. So, the code would need to be decorated with @classmethod. However, the user's function signature doesn't include that. So maybe the function is intended to be a class method, but the user hasn't included the decorator. Or perhaps it's a static method.

But the user provided the function signature as def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), so it's likely a class method. However, in the code, the user might have intended it to be a static method or a regular function. But given the parameters, it's probably a class method.

But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the code should just proceed with the function as given, assuming that it's a class method. So the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        protocol_version = 3
    handlers = {
        1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
        2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
        3: cls.Bolt3Handler
    }
    return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.DefaultHandler)

But I need to make sure that the handler classes are present. Since the user hasn't provided them, I'll have to leave them as placeholders. Also, maybe the function is supposed to return an instance, so perhaps it should instantiate the class.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return an instance of the handler. So, for example:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        protocol_version = 3
    handlers = {
        1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
        2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
        3: cls.Bolt3Handler
    }
    return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.DefaultHandler)()

But then, the user might need to have the handler classes defined. However, since the user hasn't provided them, the code would need to assume that they exist.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a method to create the handler. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to return a list of all available handlers, but the docstring says it returns different forms based on the version. So that's less likely.

So, the most straightforward approach is to have a dictionary mapping versions to handler classes, default to a certain version, and return the corresponding class. Or return an instance of it.

But the user's docstring says "returned based on the value of protocol_version," which could mean returning the class or an instance. Let me check the function's return type. The user hasn't specified, but given the context, it's probably returning a handler class or instance.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a method to get the handler. But again, without more info, I'll proceed with the initial approach.

So, the code would look like this. Also, the user might want to handle invalid versions by raising an exception. But the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe just defaulting is sufficient.

Another thing: the function is called protocol_handlers, which might suggest that it returns a list or a collection. But the docstring says "different forms... are returned," which could mean a single handler. Maybe the function is supposed to return a specific handler based on the version.

In any case, the code should be written with the assumption that the class has the necessary handler classes as attributes. So, the code would use cls to access them.

So, the final code would be as follows. Let me write that.
