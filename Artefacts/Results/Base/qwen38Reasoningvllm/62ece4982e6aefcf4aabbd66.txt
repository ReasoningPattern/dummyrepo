Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function was_processed based on the given signature and docstring. Let me read the docstring carefully.

The function checks if a file or directory has already been processed. To prevent recursion, it expands the path name to an absolute path. Then, it checks if the entry is in the processed set. If it is, it reports the issue and returns True. Otherwise, adds the entry to the set and returns False.

Args are processed (a set), path_name (the path to check), and verbose (whether to output verbose messages). The return is a boolean.

So first, the function should convert the path_name to an absolute path. How to do that in Python? Using os.path.abspath, maybe. Then, check if this absolute path is in the processed set.

If it's already present, then if verbose is True, print something like "Warning: {path_name} already processed." Then return True.

If not, add it to the processed set and return False.

Wait, but the path_name might be relative. So expanding to absolute is necessary. Also, need to make sure that the path is normalized? Like, maybe handling cases where the path has multiple dots or similar. But the docstring says to expand the path name to an absolute path, so perhaps just using abspath is sufficient.

So code steps:

1. Convert path_name to absolute path using os.path.abspath.
2. Check if the absolute path is in the processed set.
3. If yes: if verbose, print a message, return True.
4. If no: add it to the set, return False.

But wait, the docstring says "expand the path name to an absolution path" â€” maybe a typo for 'absolute'? So assuming that's correct.

So the code would be:

import os

def was_processed(processed, path_name, verbose):
    absolute_path = os.path.abspath(path_name)
    if absolute_path in processed:
        if verbose:
            print(f"Warning: {path_name} already processed.")
        return True
    processed.add(absolute_path)
    return False

Wait, but the function is supposed to prevent recursion. So by adding the absolute path to the set, it ensures that even if the same path is encountered again (maybe through different relative paths), it's detected. That makes sense.

But what about if the path is a symlink? os.path.abspath resolves symlinks, so that's handled. Also, the function is called with a set that's being built as paths are processed. So each time a path is processed, it's added to the set, and subsequent calls check against that set.

So the code seems straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

The function's parameters: processed is a set, path_name is the path, verbose is a boolean.

Yes. So the code should be as above. But the user said to output only the code in python markdown format. So I need to make sure that the code is correctly formatted and includes the necessary import.

Wait, the original code may not have the import. But the function uses os.path.abspath, so the code must import os.

So the code would start with import os, then the function definition.

But the user's code may not include the import. However, since the function uses os.path, it's necessary to import os.

So the final code is:

import os

def was_processed(processed, path_name, verbose):
    """
    Check if a file or directory has already been processed.

    To prevent recursion, expand the path name to an absolute path
    call this function with a set that will store all the entries and
    the entry to test. If the entry is already in the set, report the issue
    and return ``True``. Otherwise, add the entry to the set and return
    ``False`` to allow the path to be processed.

    Args:
        processed: Set to store processed pathnames
        path_name: Path to a directory or file
        verbose: True if verbose output is requested

    Returns:
        True if it's already in the set. False if not.
    """
    absolute_path = os.path.abspath(path_name)
    if absolute_path in processed:
        if verbose:
            print(f"Warning: {path_name} already processed.")
        return True
    processed.add(absolute_path)
    return False

Wait, but the docstring says "call this function with a set that will store all the entries". So the processed set is modified in place. The function adds the absolute path to it if not present.

Yes, that's correct. So the code is as above. Let me check for possible errors.

What if path_name is a relative path? The function converts it to absolute, so that's handled. For example, if path_name is 'subdir/file.txt' and the current working directory is different, it will resolve correctly.

Also, the message printed is using path_name, not absolute_path. So if the user passes a relative path, the warning will show the relative path, but the actual stored path is absolute. That's okay, as the warning is for the user's reference.

So the code should be correct. Now, the user wants the code in python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks.

But the user said to output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. So the answer is just the code, no explanations.

So the code is:

```python
import os

def was_processed(processed, path_name, verbose):
    """
    Check if a file or directory has already been processed.

    To prevent recursion, expand the path name to an absolute path
    call this function with a set that will store all the entries and
    the entry to test. If the entry is already in the set, report the issue
    and return ``True``. Otherwise, add the entry to the set and return
    ``False`` to allow the path to be processed.

    Args:
        processed: Set to store processed pathnames
        path_name: Path to a directory or file
        verbose: True if verbose output is requested

    Returns:
        True if it's already in the set. False if not.
    """
    absolute_path = os.path.abspath(path_name)
    if absolute_path in processed:
        if verbose:
            print(f"Warning: {path_name} already processed.")
        return True
    processed.add(absolute_path)
    return False
```
