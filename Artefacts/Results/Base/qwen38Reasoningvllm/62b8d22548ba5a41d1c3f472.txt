Okay, I need to generate Python code for the cachedmethod function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it returns a decorator that can call a result in the cache. So, the purpose is to cache the results of a method call. The parameters are cache, key, and lock. The key is a function that generates a cache key, defaulting to hashkey. The lock is optional, probably for thread safety.

First, I remember that decorators in Python are functions that take another function and return a new function. So, cachedmethod should be a decorator factory. The decorator will check if the result is already in the cache. If it is, return it; otherwise, compute it and store it.

Let me outline the steps. The cachedmethod function takes cache, key, and lock. The cache is likely a dictionary or some storage. The key function is used to generate a unique key for each method call. The lock is probably a threading lock to prevent race conditions when updating the cache.

So, the decorator function (let's call it the returned function) will take a method as an argument. Then, when the method is called, it will generate a key using the provided key function. It will check if the key exists in the cache. If it does, return the cached value. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and then return it.

Wait, but how does the cache work? Maybe the cache is a dictionary that's passed into the decorator. So, the decorator will use that cache to store results. Also, if there's a lock, it should acquire the lock before accessing the cache to ensure thread safety.

Let me think about the structure. The outer function cachedmethod takes cache, key, and lock. Then, it returns a decorator that takes a method. The decorator will then define a new function that wraps the original method.

Inside the wrapper function, when the method is called, generate the key using key(func, *args, **kwargs). Wait, the key function's parametersâ€”maybe it's supposed to take the function and the arguments? Or maybe it's just the arguments. The default key is hashkey, which I assume is a function that generates a hash based on the arguments. But the user hasn't defined hashkey, so maybe it's a helper function that takes the arguments and returns a hashable key.

Wait, the key parameter is a function. So, the key function should take the method's arguments and return a key. But how do I pass the method and its arguments to the key function? Maybe the key function is supposed to be a function that generates a key based on the method's parameters. For example, the default key could be something like using the arguments as a tuple and hashing them.

But the user's docstring says the key is a function that can be used to generate the cache key. So, the key function might take the function and the arguments. Wait, but in the parameters, the key is passed as a default argument, so maybe it's a function that takes the arguments and returns a key. Or perhaps it's a function that takes the function and the arguments. Let me think.

In typical caching decorators, the key is generated based on the arguments of the function. So, the key function would take the function and the arguments, but in this case, the key is a parameter to cachedmethod. So, when the decorator is applied, the key function is used to generate the key for the method's arguments.

Wait, the key function is supposed to be called with the method's arguments. But how? Let me think of an example. Suppose the method is called with some arguments. The key function would generate a unique key for those arguments. So, the key function should take the arguments and return a hashable value. But in Python, when you call a function, the arguments are passed as *args and **kwargs. So, the key function would need to accept those.

But the way the decorator is structured, the key function would be called with the function and the arguments? Or maybe the key function is called with the arguments. Let me think about the standard approach.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. For example, the default key function could be something like hashkey that takes the function and the arguments, and returns a tuple or a string that can be used as a key.

But the user's docstring says the key is a function that can call a result in the cache. Maybe the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the method's parameters. So, the key function would take the method's arguments and return a key. But how do I pass those arguments to the key function?

Wait, the key function is a parameter to cachedmethod. So, when the decorator is applied, the key function is used. For example, when using the decorator, the key function would be called with the method's arguments. But in Python, when you have a decorator that wraps a function, the wrapper function receives the arguments when the decorated function is called.

So, the key function should be called with the arguments of the method. But how to pass them? Let me think. The key function might need to take the function and the arguments. But perhaps the key function is designed to take the function and the arguments, and return a key. Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the arguments and return a key, but then how does it know which function it's for?

Hmm, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. So, the default key function, hashkey, would be something like:

def hashkey(func, *args, **kwargs):
    return (func.__name__, *args, **kwargs)

But that's not hashable. So perhaps the key function is supposed to generate a hashable key based on the arguments. Maybe the default key function is using the arguments to create a tuple, which can be hashed.

Alternatively, maybe the key is generated by hashing the arguments. But the user's code may have a hashkey function that's already defined. So, the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments, and return a key. But I need to make sure that the key is hashable.

Wait, the key function is passed as an argument to cachedmethod. So, when the decorator is applied, the key function is used. The key function should generate a unique key for each set of arguments. So, the key function would be called with the method's arguments. But how to pass the function to the key function? Because the key function might need to know the function's name or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. So, the default key function could be something like:

def hashkey(func, *args, **kwargs):
    return (func.__name__, args, kwargs)

But then, when you hash that, it's not very efficient. Maybe the key is generated by combining the function's name with the arguments. However, for the purpose of the decorator, the key function needs to be called with the arguments. But how?

Wait, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments, but in the code, when the method is called, the key is generated by passing the function and the arguments to the key function. So, in the wrapper function, when the method is called, we generate the key by calling key(func, *args, **kwargs). But then, the key function would need to accept those parameters.

But the user's docstring says the key is a function that can call a result in the cache. Maybe the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the arguments. So, the key function is called with the arguments, not the function. But then, how does it know which function it's for? Maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. Or perhaps the key is generated based on the function's name and the arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments, and return a hashable key. For example, the default key function could be:

def hashkey(func, *args, **kwargs):
    return (func.__name__, args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But I'm not sure. The user hasn't provided the hashkey function, so I need to assume that it's a helper function that takes the function and the arguments and returns a key. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, not to implement hashkey.

So, the cachedmethod function is a decorator factory. The decorator will wrap the method, and when the method is called, it will check the cache. If the key exists, return it. Otherwise, compute the result, store it in the cache, and return it.

Also, the lock parameter is optional. If provided, it should be used to acquire a lock before accessing the cache to prevent race conditions. So, when the method is called, the decorator should acquire the lock, check the cache, and if not present, compute and store.

So, putting this together:

The cachedmethod function returns a decorator. The decorator takes a method, and returns a new function that wraps it. The wrapper function will check the cache for the key generated by the key function. If found, return the cached value. Else, compute it, store in cache, and return.

But how to handle the key? The key function is supposed to generate a key based on the method's arguments. So, in the wrapper, when the method is called, we need to generate the key using the key function, passing the method and the arguments. Wait, but the key function may not need the method. Maybe the key is generated based on the arguments only. But the docstring says the key is a function that can call a result in the cache. Maybe the key function is called with the function and the arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. So, the default key function is hashkey, which is a function that takes the function and the arguments and returns a key. But since the user hasn't provided hashkey, perhaps it's a helper function that's part of the code. However, the code should not include any explanation, so I need to assume that hashkey is defined elsewhere.

Wait, the user's code may have a hashkey function. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the code should use a default key function that generates a key based on the arguments. But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the key is a function that's passed in, and the code should use that function to generate the key.

So, the code for the decorator would be something like:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # generate key
            key_value = key(func, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key_value in cache:
                        return cache[key_value]
                    else:
                        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                        cache[key_value] = result
                        return result
            else:
                if key_value in cache:
                    return cache[key_value]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_value] = result
                    return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the key function may not need the func. Maybe the key is generated based on the arguments only. For example, the default key could be something like:

def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, kwargs)

But then, the key function would need to be called with the arguments. However, in the code above, the key is called with func, *args, **kwargs. So, perhaps the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. But maybe the key function is supposed to take only the arguments. Let me think again.

The function signature is def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. The key is a function. So, when the decorator is applied, the key function is used. The key function is supposed to generate a unique key for the method's arguments. So, perhaps the key function is called with the function and the arguments. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the arguments and return a key. But then, how to pass the function? Maybe the key function is designed to take the function and the arguments. For example, the default key function could be something like:

def hashkey(func, *args, **kwargs):
    return (func.__name__, *args, **kwargs)

But again, the user hasn't provided hashkey. So, the code should assume that hashkey is a function that takes the function and the arguments. However, in practice, the key function might not need the function. Maybe it's better to pass the arguments to the key function. But the problem is that the key function may need to know which function it's for. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the arguments. For example, the default key could be a function that takes the arguments and returns a tuple of them, which can be hashed. But then, how to handle the function's parameters? Maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. But without knowing hashkey's implementation, it's hard to say.

But given that the user's docstring says that the key is a function that can call a result in the cache, perhaps the key function is called with the function and the arguments. So, the code for the wrapper would be:

key_value = key(func, *args, **kwargs)

But then, the key function must accept those parameters. So, the code would need to handle that.

But the user's code may have hashkey defined as a function that takes the function and the arguments. So, the code would use that.

So, the code would be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_value = key(func, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key_value in cache:
                        return cache[key_value]
                    else:
                        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                        cache[key_value] = result
                        return result
            else:
                if key_value in cache:
                    return cache[key_value]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_value] = result
                    return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the key function may not be intended to take the function as an argument. Maybe the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the arguments. For example, the default key could be a function that takes the arguments and returns a hashable key. But in that case, the key function would need to be called with the arguments, not the function.

So, perhaps the key function is called with the arguments. But then, how does it know which function it's for? Maybe the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the function's name and the arguments. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. But the default hashkey is not defined here, so perhaps the user expects that hashkey is a function that takes the function and the arguments. However, the user may have a different implementation.

But given the function signature, the key is passed as a default argument, which suggests that it's a function that can be used to generate the key. So, the code should use the key function as provided, which may take the function and the arguments.

But in the code, when the method is called, the wrapper function has access to the function (func), and the arguments (*args, **kwargs). So, the key function is called with func and the arguments. That makes sense.

So, the code above seems correct. However, the key function may not be intended to take the function. Maybe the key function is supposed to take only the arguments. But that would require the key function to be called with the arguments, not the function. So, perhaps the key function is called with the arguments. But then, how to pass the function? Maybe the key function is supposed to take the function as part of its parameters. Or maybe the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the function's name and the arguments.

Alternatively, perhaps the key function is supposed to take the function and the arguments. So, the default hashkey could be something like:

def hashkey(func, *args, **kwargs):
    return (func.__name__, args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But again, the user hasn't provided it. So, the code should use the key function as given.

So, the code for cachedmethod would be as follows. The decorator function takes func, then the wrapper function is defined. When the wrapper is called, it generates the key using key(func, *args, **kwargs), then checks the cache. If lock is present, it uses a context manager to acquire the lock, then checks the cache. If not present, computes the result, stores it, and returns.

But wait, in the code, the key function is called with func, *args, **kwargs. So, the key function must accept those parameters. So, the user is expected to provide a key function that can take the function and the arguments. However, in practice, the key function may not need the function. For example, it could just generate a key based on the arguments. But that's not possible unless the key function is designed to do so.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the arguments and return a key. But then, how to pass the function? Maybe the key function is supposed to be a function that takes the function and the arguments. So, the code is correct.

Another thing to consider is that the cache is a mutable object, so when the decorator is applied, it's using the same cache instance. So, the code should work with that.

Also, the lock is optional. If provided, it's used to ensure that only one thread can compute the result at a time. So, the code uses the lock in a with statement to acquire it.

Now, I need to write this code. The user says to output only the code in Python markdown format, without any explanation.

So, the code would look like:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_value = key(func, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key_value in cache:
                        return cache[key_value]
                    else:
                        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                        cache[key_value] = result
                        return result
            else:
                if key_value in cache:
                    return cache[key_value]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_value] = result
                    return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the key function may not be intended to take the function as an argument. For example, maybe the key is generated based on the arguments only. In that case, the code would be:

key_value = key(*args, **kwargs)

But then, the key function would need to be designed to take the arguments. However, the default key is hashkey, which may not be defined here. So, perhaps the user expects that the key function takes the function and the arguments. But without knowing hashkey's implementation, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function's name and the arguments. But again, the code should be written based on the given function signature and docstring.

The docstring says that the key is a function that can call a result in the cache. So, the key function is used to generate the key for the cache. Therefore, the key function should be called with the function and the arguments. So, the code above is correct.

But what about the lock? If the lock is provided, it's used to ensure that when multiple threads are accessing the cache, they don't interfere. So, the code acquires the lock before checking the cache and storing the result.

Another thing: the key function should return a hashable type, like a tuple or a string. So, the code assumes that the key function returns such a value.

So, the final code would be as written above. But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me test this logic.

For example, if a method is decorated with @cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey), then when the method is called, the wrapper generates the key by calling hashkey with the function and the arguments. Then checks the cache. If not present, computes the result and stores it.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the code is correct. Now, I need to write it in Python, using the parameters as given.

But the user may have intended the key function to take only the arguments. For example, maybe the key is generated based on the arguments, not the function. In that case, the code would call key(*args, **kwargs). However, the default key is hashkey, which may be a function that takes the function and the arguments. But since the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the code should assume that the key function takes the function and the arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the function's name and the arguments. But again, the code as written is correct based on the given function signature.

So, I think the code I have is correct. Let me write it.
