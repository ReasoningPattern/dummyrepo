Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function merge_extra_vars based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it extends vars_dict with extra-vars. So, the goal is to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict.

First, the parameters: vars_dict is a dictionary, and extra_vars is a list. Wait, the docstring mentions "List of extra-vars", but the parameter name is extra_vars. Maybe the extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs? Or perhaps each element in the list is a dictionary? Or maybe it's a list of strings that are variable names, and we need to add them as keys with some default values?

Wait, the function is called merge_extra_vars, and the parameter is extra_vars. The docstring says "Extend vars_dict with extra-vars". The term "extra-vars" might be a typo for "extra variables". But the parameter is a list. Hmm. Maybe the extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, each representing variables to merge into vars_dict. Or perhaps it's a list of key-value pairs. But in Python, dictionaries are merged using update() method or the ** operator. So maybe the extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and we need to merge them all into vars_dict.

Wait, the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring says "List of extra-vars". So perhaps extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, but how to represent that? Maybe each element in the list is a dictionary, or perhaps it's a list of tuples. But the parameter is named extra_vars, which is a list. Let me think about the standard way to merge variables. For example, in Ansible, extra_vars are usually provided as a dictionary, but maybe here it's a list of dictionaries.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a list of variables in the form of strings, and we need to add them as keys with some default values. But the docstring doesn't specify that. The original function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", so perhaps the extra_vars is a dictionary, but the parameter is named extra_vars and the type is list. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the function signature says extra_vars is a list. So maybe the function is intended to take a list of variables, perhaps in a specific format.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to merge a list of extra variables into the vars_dict. For example, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then we need to merge each of them into vars_dict. Or maybe extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, like a list of tuples. But the parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list. Let me check the function signature again.

The function is defined as def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):. The docstring says "Extend vars_dict with extra-vars". So perhaps the extra_vars is a dictionary, but the parameter is named extra_vars and the type is list. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring? Or maybe the function is supposed to take a list of variables, each of which is a key-value pair. For example, if extra_vars is a list of tuples, then we can loop through them and add to vars_dict.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars dictionary into vars_dict. But the parameter is a list. Hmm. Let me think again. The function name is merge_extra_vars, and the parameter is extra_vars. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". Maybe the extra_vars is a dictionary, but the parameter is named extra_vars and the type is list. That seems like a possible mistake. But since the user provided the function signature, I have to work with that.

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to take a list of variables, where each variable is a dictionary. So, for example, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then we need to merge all of them into vars_dict. So the function would iterate over each dictionary in the list and update vars_dict with them.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, like a list of tuples, and we need to add each pair to vars_dict. But the parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list. Let me check the docstring again. The docstring says "List of extra-vars", so maybe each element in the list is a variable in the form of a string, and we need to add them as keys with some default value. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars dictionary into vars_dict. But the parameter is a list. Maybe the user intended extra_vars to be a dictionary but mistakenly wrote list. But since I have to follow the given function signature, I need to assume that extra_vars is a list. Let me think of possible ways to merge a list into a dictionary.

If extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then merging them into vars_dict would involve updating vars_dict with each dictionary in the list. So, for each d in extra_vars, vars_dict.update(d). But if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, perhaps tuples, then we can loop through them and assign each key-value pair to vars_dict.

But the docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which might imply that extra_vars is a dictionary. However, the parameter is a list. Maybe the function is supposed to take a list of variables, each being a dictionary, and merge them into vars_dict. So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(var)
    return vars_dict

But wait, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then this code would work. However, if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs (like a list of tuples), then this code would not work. So perhaps the function is intended to take a list of dictionaries. But the docstring says "List of extra-vars", which is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge a dictionary into vars_dict, but the parameter is named extra_vars and is a list. That's confusing. Maybe the user intended extra_vars to be a dictionary, but the parameter is a list. Or maybe the function is supposed to take a list of variables, each as a string, and add them as keys with some default value. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Another possibility: the function is meant to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict, where extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs. For example, if extra_vars is a list like [{'key1': 'value1'}, {'key2': 'value2'}], then merging them into vars_dict. So the code would be as above.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of variables in the form of a list of strings, each string being a key, and then add them with some default value. But the docstring doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars dictionary into vars_dict, but the parameter is a list. Maybe the user made a mistake in the function signature. But since I have to generate code based on the given function signature, I have to assume that extra_vars is a list.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars list into vars_dict, where each element in the list is a key-value pair. For example, if extra_vars is a list of tuples, then we can loop through them and assign each key and value to vars_dict. But the docstring says "List of extra-vars", which is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars dictionary into vars_dict, but the parameter is named extra_vars and is a list. Maybe the function is intended to take a list of variables, but the actual parameters are a dictionary and a list. That's confusing.

But given the function signature, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that extra_vars is a list of dictionaries. So the code would iterate through each dictionary in the list and update vars_dict with them. That makes sense. So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(var)
    return vars_dict

But wait, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then this code would merge them. However, if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs (like a list of tuples), then this code would not work. But the function's parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list. The docstring says "List of extra-vars", so maybe each element in the list is a key-value pair. But how to represent that? Maybe the list is a list of tuples, like [('key1', 'value1'), ('key2', 'value2')], and we need to add each to vars_dict.

In that case, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for key, value in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

But then, the parameter extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs. However, the function's docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which might imply that extra_vars is a dictionary. But the user says the parameter is a list. So perhaps the function is intended to take a list of variables, each as a dictionary, and merge them into vars_dict. Or maybe the function is supposed to take a list of variables in the form of a list of key-value pairs.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict, where extra_vars is a dictionary. But the parameter is a list. That would be a mistake. But since the user provided the function signature, I have to work with that.

Another possibility is that the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars list into vars_dict as a single dictionary. For example, if extra_vars is a list of variables, perhaps in the form of a list of key-value pairs, and we need to convert that list into a dictionary and then merge. But that's not clear.

Wait, the original function's name is merge_extra_vars, which suggests that it's merging extra variables into vars_dict. In Ansible, extra_vars are typically provided as a dictionary. So maybe the user intended extra_vars to be a dictionary, but the parameter is a list. That's conflicting. However, given the function signature, I have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of variables, where each variable is a dictionary, and merge them all into vars_dict. So the code would be as I wrote before, looping through each item in extra_vars and updating vars_dict.

But perhaps the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict, where extra_vars is a dictionary. So maybe the function signature is wrong, but the user wants the code to merge a dictionary into vars_dict. However, the user says to generate code based on the given function signature, so I can't assume that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars list into vars_dict as a single dictionary. For example, if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, then convert it into a dictionary and merge. But that's not clear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to assume that extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and merge each into vars_dict. So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(var)
    return vars_dict

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me think about possible test cases. Suppose vars_dict is {'a': 1}, and extra_vars is [{'b': 2}, {'c': 3}]. Then merging would result in {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if extra_vars is a list of tuples, like [('b', 2), ('c', 3)], then the code would need to loop through each tuple and assign key and value. So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for key, value in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

But the problem is that the parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list. The docstring says "List of extra-vars", but it's not clear if each element is a dictionary or a tuple. However, in the absence of more information, perhaps the first approach is better, assuming that extra_vars is a list of dictionaries. But maybe the function is intended to merge a single dictionary, but the parameter is a list. That's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars list into vars_dict as a single dictionary. For example, if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, then convert it into a dictionary and merge. But how to handle that? For example, if extra_vars is a list like ['key1=value1', 'key2=value2'], then split each string into key and value. But again, the docstring doesn't mention this.

Given the ambiguity, but looking at the function's name and the docstring, perhaps the intended behavior is to merge the extra_vars dictionary into vars_dict. But since the parameter is a list, maybe it's a mistake. However, the user says to generate code based on the given function signature. So perhaps the correct approach is to assume that extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and merge them into vars_dict.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars list into vars_dict, where each element in the list is a key-value pair. For example, if extra_vars is a list of tuples, then the code would loop through each tuple and assign the key and value. But the parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list. So perhaps that's the case.

But the docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which could mean that extra-vars is a dictionary. However, the parameter is a list. Maybe the user intended to have extra_vars as a dictionary, but the function signature is wrong. But since I have to follow the given function signature, I'll proceed.

In conclusion, the most likely scenario is that the function is supposed to merge a list of dictionaries (extra_vars) into vars_dict. So the code would be as follows.
