Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function try_retrieve_webfinger_document. The function's purpose is to retrieve a webfinger document as per RFC7033 and shouldn't raise exceptions if it fails. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a handle as a string and returns an optional string. So, I should handle cases where the retrieval might fail without raising an error. The user mentioned not to include any explanations, just the code. But I need to make sure I understand the requirements.

Webfinger is a protocol for retrieving information about a user or resource. The typical process involves making a GET request to a specific URL, usually something like https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=handle. So, the function needs to construct that URL.

I'll need to use the requests library to send HTTP requests. But wait, maybe the user wants it to not raise exceptions, so I should handle possible errors like network issues, invalid URLs, or HTTP errors. So, I'll use try-except blocks around the request.

Let me outline the steps: construct the URL, send a GET request, check the response status code. If it's 200 OK, return the content. Otherwise, return None. Also, handle exceptions such as ConnectionError, Timeout, etc., silently.

Wait, but what about the actual format of the webfinger document? The response should be in a specific format, maybe JSON. But the function's docstring says it returns the document as a string, so perhaps just returning the raw response text if successful.

So, the code would start by importing requests and Optional from typing. Then, the function would try to make the request. Let me check the parameters. The handle is given, so the resource parameter in the URL should be handle=... but need to URL-encode it. Oh right, the resource is typically a URI, so maybe the handle is part of that. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', the resource URL would be 'acct:user@example.com'.

Wait, the webfinger resource is usually 'acct:' prefixed. So maybe the function should construct the resource URL properly. So, the URL would be f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}" but wait, the domain isn't provided. Oh, the handle might not include the domain. So perhaps the function should assume that the handle is the full resource, or maybe it's supposed to be the user's handle, and the domain is inferred? Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the username part, and the domain is part of the handle. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'.

So the URL would be constructed as "https://{handle_domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle_username}". Wait, but how to split the handle into username and domain? Maybe the handle is expected to be in the format 'username@domain', so I can split it on '@' to get the parts. But maybe the function is supposed to take the full handle, which might already include the domain. Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to take the handle as the resource, but that's not standard. Let me check the RFC7033. According to RFC7033, the resource is a URI, typically in the form of 'acct:handle@domain'. So the handle parameter here might be the 'handle@domain' part. So the resource URL would be 'acct:' + handle.

Wait, the function's parameter is called 'handle', which might be the full handle. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'. So the URL would be constructed as "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}". But how do I get the domain from the handle? Maybe the handle is supposed to be the full resource, so the function can directly use it. Wait, no. The handle is the identifier, like 'user@example.com', and the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'. So perhaps the function should construct the resource URL by adding 'acct:' prefix to the handle. But maybe the handle is already in the correct format. Hmm, the function's docstring says "RFC7033 webfinger document", so the resource is the handle. Wait, no. The webfinger resource is a URI, and the handle is the identifier. For example, the handle is 'user@example.com', and the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'.

So the function should construct the resource URL by adding 'acct:' to the handle. But maybe the handle is already in the correct format. Alternatively, perhaps the handle is the username part, and the domain is determined elsewhere. But since the function only takes a handle, maybe it's expected that the handle includes the domain. So, the resource URL would be 'acct:' + handle. Wait, no. The handle is the identifier, and the resource is the URI. So for example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'. Therefore, the function should construct the URL as "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}" but how to get the domain? Oh, maybe the handle is the full resource, so the domain is part of the handle. Wait, perhaps the handle is the username part, and the domain is a separate parameter. But the function only has a handle parameter. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the username, and the domain is fixed or determined by some other means. But that's not clear. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the function should assume that the handle is the full resource, so the URL would be "https://{handle.split('@')[1]}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"? Wait, but that would split the handle into username and domain. For example, if handle is 'user@example.com', then split on '@' gives ['user', 'example.com'], so domain is 'example.com'. Then the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'.

Wait, but the resource parameter in the webfinger request is the URI of the resource. So the handle is the identifier, and the resource is 'acct:' + handle. So the URL would be "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}". But how to get the domain? If the handle is 'user@example.com', then the domain is 'example.com'. So perhaps the function should split the handle into parts. But what if the handle doesn't have an '@'? Then it's invalid. But the function is supposed to handle that gracefully, returning None.

So, the code would first check if the handle contains '@' to split into username and domain. If not, maybe return None. Or perhaps the function is designed to take the full handle, which includes the domain. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the username, and the domain is a separate parameter. But since the function only has a handle parameter, perhaps the handle is expected to be in the format 'username@domain'.

So, the steps would be:

1. Check if the handle is valid (contains '@').

But maybe the function doesn't validate the handle, just tries to retrieve it. So perhaps proceed regardless.

So, construct the URL as "https://{handle.split('@')[1]}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"? Wait, no. Because the handle is the identifier, and the resource is 'acct:' + handle. So the URL should be "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}". But how to get the domain? If the handle is 'user@example.com', then the domain is 'example.com'. So split the handle on '@' to get the domain part. But if there's no '@', then it's invalid. However, the function is supposed to not raise errors, so perhaps in that case, return None.

So, code steps:

- Split handle into parts. If there's no '@', return None.

Wait, but maybe the handle is just the username, and the domain is a separate parameter. But the function's parameter is only handle. So perhaps the function assumes that the handle includes the domain. So, split on '@' to get the domain. Then construct the URL as "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}".

Wait, but that would be incorrect. Because the resource is 'acct:' + handle. So if the handle is 'user@example.com', the resource is 'acct:user@example.com', and the domain is 'example.com'. So the URL would be "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com".

So, the code would need to split the handle into username and domain. But maybe the handle is just the username, and the domain is not provided. But that's not possible. So perhaps the function is designed to take the full handle, which includes the domain. Therefore, the code can split the handle into parts.

But perhaps the function is supposed to take the handle as the username, and the domain is fixed. But that's not clear. Maybe the function is intended to be used with a specific domain, but since it's not provided, perhaps the code should assume that the handle is in the format 'username@domain', and use the domain part to construct the URL.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the handle as the resource, but that's not standard. Let me think again. The webfinger protocol requires that the resource is a URI. So, for example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'. Therefore, the URL would be "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com", where domain is the domain part of the handle.

So, the code would split the handle into username and domain. If there's no '@', then return None. Otherwise, construct the URL with the domain part.

Wait, but the handle might not have a domain. For example, maybe the handle is just 'user', but that's not standard. However, the function is supposed to handle any handle, so perhaps it's better to split on '@' and take the domain part. If there's no '@', then the domain is not present, so return None.

So, code steps:

- Split handle into parts. If there's no '@', return None.

- Extract the domain from the handle.

- Construct the URL as f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"

Wait, but the handle might already include the domain. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the domain is 'example.com', and the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'.

So, the code would split the handle into username and domain. Then, the URL is constructed with the domain part. But what if the handle is 'user', then no domain, so return None.

But maybe the handle is supposed to be the full resource. For example, if the handle is 'acct:user@example.com', then the resource is that. But that's not standard. Typically, the handle is the username part, and the domain is determined by the service. However, without knowing the domain, the function can't construct the correct URL. So perhaps the function is intended to take the handle as the username, and the domain is a separate parameter. But since the function only has a handle parameter, maybe the code is supposed to assume that the domain is part of the handle. So, split the handle into parts.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the full identifier, and the domain is determined by the handle. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the domain is 'example.com'. So, the code would split the handle into parts, and use the domain part to construct the URL.

So, in code:

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    try:
        # Split handle into parts
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        username, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.text
        else:
            return None
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch all exceptions and return None
        return None

But wait, the function is supposed to not raise any exceptions. So, any error during the request (like network issues, invalid URL, etc.) should be caught and return None.

But what about the case where the handle is invalid? Like, if there's no '@', then return None.

But maybe the handle could be in the format 'acct:user@example.com', but that's not standard. The handle is typically the username part. So, perhaps the code should check if the handle starts with 'acct:', but that's not necessary. The function is supposed to retrieve the webfinger document for the given handle, which is the identifier. So the resource is 'acct:' + handle.

Wait, no. The handle is the identifier, and the resource is the URI. So, for example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'. Therefore, the code should construct the URL as "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}" where domain is extracted from the handle.

But how to extract the domain? If the handle is 'user@example.com', then domain is 'example.com'. So splitting on '@' gives the domain part.

So, the code would split the handle into parts. If there's no '@', return None. Then, construct the URL with the domain part. Then send a GET request. If the response is 200, return the text. Otherwise, return None. Also, handle any exceptions during the request.

But what about cases where the handle has multiple '@' symbols? For example, 'user@subdomain@example.com'. In that case, splitting on '@' would give more than two parts. But according to RFC7033, the handle is the identifier, which is typically a username@domain. So perhaps the code should split on the first '@' to get the username and domain. So using split('@', 1) would split into two parts.

So, the code would be:

import requests
from typing import Optional

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    try:
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        username, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.text
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        return None

But wait, what if the handle is something like 'user' without a domain? Then it returns None. Also, if the domain is invalid, like 'example.com' but the URL can't be resolved, the request would fail, and the except block would catch it.

But maybe the handle is supposed to be the full resource, so the code should not split it. For example, if the handle is 'acct:user@example.com', then the resource is that. But that's not standard. Typically, the handle is the username, and the domain is part of the resource. So perhaps the code should take the handle as the username, and the domain is a separate parameter. But since the function only has a handle parameter, perhaps the code is intended to use the domain from the handle.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the full resource, so the code can directly use it. For example, if the handle is 'acct:user@example.com', then the URL is "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=handle". But that's not correct. The resource is the handle, which is the identifier. So the URL would be "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={handle}".

But then, how to get the domain from the handle? If the handle is 'user@example.com', then the domain is 'example.com'. So the code needs to split the handle into parts.

But perhaps the function is supposed to take the handle as the full identifier, and the domain is part of it. So the code splits the handle into username and domain, then constructs the URL with that domain.

Another thing: the webfinger URL is typically 'https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger', so the code uses that.

But what if the domain is not valid? Well, the function is supposed to not raise errors, so it's handled in the except block.

So, the code should:

- Check if handle contains '@', else return None.

- Split into username and domain.

- Construct the URL with the domain.

- Send GET request.

- If status code is 200, return the text, else return None.

- Catch any exceptions and return None.

But also, maybe the handle is supposed to be the full resource, so the code should not split it. For example, if the handle is 'acct:user@example.com', then the resource is that. But in that case, the code would need to extract the domain from the handle. However, that's not straightforward. So perhaps the function is intended to take the handle as the username, and the domain is a separate parameter. But since the function only has a handle parameter, maybe the code is supposed to assume that the handle includes the domain.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the full resource, and the domain is part of the handle. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', then the domain is 'example.com', and the resource is 'acct:user@example.com'.

So the code as I wrote earlier should work.

But perhaps the handle is not in the format with '@', so the code returns None. Also, the function should not raise any exceptions, so all possible errors are caught.

Another thing: the function returns the document as a string. So, if the response is successful, return the text. Otherwise, return None.

So, the code would look like that. Also, need to import requests and Optional.

Wait, the user might not have the requests library installed. But the code is supposed to generate, so it's okay to assume it's available.

So, the code would be:

import requests
from typing import Optional

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    try:
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        username, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        return response.text if response.status_code == 200 else None
    except:
        return None

But wait, the except block catches all exceptions. That's okay, as per the docstring.

But maybe the handle is not properly formatted, like having multiple '@' symbols. For example, 'user@subdomain@example.com'. In that case, split on the first '@' gives username as 'user' and domain as 'subdomain@example.com', which is not correct. So the code would split into two parts, but the domain would be incorrect. However, the function is supposed to handle any handle, so perhaps it's better to split on the first '@' and take the rest as the domain. But that's a possible issue. However, the function is supposed to not raise errors, so even if the handle is invalid, it returns None.

So, the code as written would handle that.

Another thing: the webfinger document is usually in JSON format. But the function returns the raw text, so that's okay.

So, putting it all together, the code would be as above. Also, need to make sure that the handle is split into two parts. If there's no '@', return None. Otherwise, proceed.

I think that's the correct approach. So the code should be:

import requests
from typing import Optional

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    try:
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        username, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.text
        return None
    except:
        return None

But maybe the handle is supposed to be the full resource, so the code should not split it. For example, if the handle is 'acct:user@example.com', then the resource is that. But then the domain would be 'example.com', but the handle is already the resource. So perhaps the code should construct the URL as "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={handle}" where domain is extracted from the handle. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the handle as the username, and the domain is a separate parameter. But since the function only has a handle parameter, maybe the code is intended to use the domain from the handle. So, the code as written is correct.

So, the final code would be as above. Also, need to make sure that the URL is properly formed. Also, maybe add a timeout? But the docstring doesn't mention it, so perhaps not. The function is supposed to not raise errors, so any network issues would be caught in the except block.

Yes, that's the plan. So the code is as written.
