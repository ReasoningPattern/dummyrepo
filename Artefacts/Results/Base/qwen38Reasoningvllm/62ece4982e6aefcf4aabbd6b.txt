Okay, I need to write a Python function called subclasses that returns all subclasses of a given class, recursively. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should take a class cls as input. Then, I have to find all classes that inherit from cls, including those that are subclasses of subclasses. How do I get all subclasses?

I remember that in Python, you can use the __subclasses__() method of a class to get its immediate subclasses. But that's only direct subclasses. To get all subclasses recursively, I need to check each subclass's subclasses as well.

So maybe I can use a recursive approach. Start with the direct subclasses, then for each of those, get their subclasses, and so on. But how do I collect all of them without duplicates?

I should use a set to store the subclasses to avoid duplicates. Let's outline the steps:

1. Initialize a set to hold all subclasses.
2. Use a helper function to recursively collect subclasses.
3. For the given class, add its direct subclasses to the set.
4. For each subclass, recursively call the helper function to get their subclasses and add them to the set.
5. Return the list of subclasses from the set.

Wait, but how do I handle the recursion? Maybe the helper function can take the current class and add its subclasses to the set. Let me think.

The function can start by getting all direct subclasses via cls.__subclasses__(). Then, for each subclass in that list, call the same function recursively and extend the set with the results.

But wait, the helper function would need to be inside the subclasses function. Or maybe I can use a loop. Let me think of an example.

Suppose I have a class A with subclasses B and C. B has a subclass D. So subclasses(A) should return B, C, D.

So the steps would be:

- Start with A's direct subclasses: B, C.
- Then for B, get its subclasses: D.
- For C, check if it has any subclasses. If not, nothing added.
- So the final set is {B, C, D}.

So the function can be written recursively. Let me try to code that.

But how to handle the recursion? Maybe the function can call itself for each subclass. Let me think.

Wait, the function is called subclasses, so maybe:

def subclasses(cls):
    # Get direct subclasses
    direct_subclasses = set(cls.__subclasses__())
    # For each direct subclass, get their subclasses recursively
    for subclass in direct_subclasses:
        direct_subclasses.update(subclasses(subclass))
    return list(direct_subclasses)

Wait, but that would include the direct subclasses and all their subclasses. But wait, the initial direct_subclasses is a set, and then for each subclass, we add their subclasses. But when we call subclasses(subclass), that would return all subclasses of subclass, including those further down. So combining them all into the set should give all subclasses recursively.

But wait, what about the base class? For example, if we have a class hierarchy like A -> B -> C, then subclasses(A) should include B and C. The code above would first get B from A's subclasses, then call subclasses(B), which would get C, and add it to the set. So yes, that seems right.

But what about the original class? The function is supposed to return subclasses, not including the class itself. So the code is okay because __subclasses__() returns immediate subclasses.

Wait, but what if the class is a subclass of another class? For example, if I have class B subclassing A, and then subclasses(A) is called. The code would collect B and then any subclasses of B. So that's correct.

But I need to make sure that the function doesn't loop infinitely. For example, if there's a cycle in inheritance, but Python's __subclasses__ method should not include a class in its own subclasses, so recursion should terminate.

But how to handle the initial call? Let me test this logic.

Another thing: the function should return all subclasses, including those that are not directly under cls but are deeper in the hierarchy. So the code above should work.

But wait, the initial code uses cls.__subclasses__(), which returns a list of immediate subclasses. Then, for each of those, we call subclasses recursively, which adds their subclasses. So the set is built by adding all direct and indirect subclasses.

But what about multiple inheritance? Suppose a class has multiple parents. The __subclasses__ method returns subclasses for each parent, but in the case of multiple inheritance, a subclass might be listed under multiple parents. However, since we're using a set, duplicates are automatically handled.

Wait, no. The __subclasses__ method returns all subclasses for the given class, regardless of other parents. So if a class is a subclass of multiple classes, it would be included in each of their subclass lists. But in our case, the function is supposed to return all subclasses of the given cls. So if a class is a subclass of cls, even through multiple inheritance, it should be included once.

But the code as written would collect all subclasses of cls, including those that are subclasses of other classes that are themselves subclasses of cls. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The function is called with cls. The direct subclasses are those that directly inherit from cls. Then, for each of those, we get their subclasses. So if a class is a subclass of a subclass of cls, it would be included. But if a class is a subclass of cls through multiple paths, like if there's a class D that inherits from B and B inherits from A, then D is a subclass of A via B. But when we call subclasses(A), we get B and then subclasses(B) gives D. So D is added. So that's correct.

But what if a class is a subclass of multiple classes that are subclasses of cls? For example, suppose class B inherits from A, class C inherits from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. Then D is a subclass of B and C, which are both subclasses of A. So when we call subclasses(A), we get B and C. Then for B, we get D, and for C, we get D. But since we're using a set, D is added once. So that's correct.

So the code should work. But I need to make sure that the function is properly handling the recursion and the set.

Wait, but the initial code uses a set, and then for each subclass, it updates the set with the result of subclasses(subclass). So the code would collect all direct and indirect subclasses.

But the code as written would have the direct_subclasses as a set, and then for each subclass in direct_subclasses, we call subclasses(subclass) which returns a list of their subclasses. Then we update the direct_subclasses set with those. So the final set includes all direct and indirect subclasses.

Wait, but the code is:

def subclasses(cls):
    direct_subclasses = set(cls.__subclasses__())
    for subclass in direct_subclasses:
        direct_subclasses.update(subclasses(subclass))
    return list(direct_subclasses)

But wait, when you call subclasses(subclass), that returns a list of all subclasses of subclass. Then, direct_subclasses.update() adds those to the set. So yes, this should collect all subclasses recursively.

But wait, what about the initial direct_subclasses? Let me think. For example, if cls is A, and A has B and C as direct subclasses. Then, subclasses(A) would collect B and C, then for each, collect their subclasses. So B's subclasses are D, and C's subclasses are E. Then the set would have B, C, D, E. So that's correct.

But what if a subclass is not directly under cls but is a subclass of a subclass? Like D is a subclass of B, which is a subclass of A. Then, when we call subclasses(A), we get B, then call subclasses(B) which gets D, and add it to the set. So yes.

But wait, the code as written would have the direct_subclasses as a set, and then for each subclass in that set, it adds their subclasses. So the code is correct.

But what about the base class? For example, if someone calls subclasses(object), which is the base class. Then, object's __subclasses__() returns all built-in types. But the function would collect all of them recursively. However, in Python, object is the base class, so its subclasses are all classes, but in practice, the __subclasses__ method returns immediate subclasses. So for example, if you have a class that inherits from object, then object's subclasses would include that class. But if you call subclasses(object), it would return all classes that are directly or indirectly subclasses of object. But since object is the base, all classes are subclasses of it. However, the function would return all classes, but that's not feasible. Wait, but in practice, the function would collect all classes in the inheritance tree. However, in Python, the __subclasses__ method for object returns all classes that are directly subclasses of object. Then, when you call subclasses on those, you get their subclasses, and so on. So the function would return all classes in the entire hierarchy, which is correct.

But perhaps the function should not include the original class. Wait, the docstring says "Return all subclasses of a class, recursively". So the original class is not included. The code as written starts with direct_subclasses, which are the immediate subclasses. Then adds their subclasses. So the original class is not part of the result. That's correct.

But what about if a class is a subclass of another class that's not in the direct_subclasses? For example, if there's a class D that is a subclass of B, which is a subclass of A. Then, when you call subclasses(A), you get B, then call subclasses(B) which gets D. So D is added. So that's correct.

So the code seems to work. But I need to make sure that the function is properly handling the recursion. Also, what about if a class is not a new-style class? Well, in Python 3, all classes are new-style, so that's not a concern.

Another thing: the function should return a list of classes. So the code returns list(direct_subclasses), which is correct.

But wait, the initial code uses a set, and then updates it with the subclasses of each subclass. So the code is correct.

But let me think about the base case. For a class that has no subclasses, the function returns an empty list. That's correct.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    direct_subclasses = set(cls.__subclasses__())
    for subclass in direct_subclasses:
        direct_subclasses.update(subclasses(subclass))
    return list(direct_subclasses)

Wait, but what if a subclass is not a new-style class? Well, in Python 3, that's not possible. So the code should work.

But maybe there's a better way. For example, using a loop to avoid recursion depth issues. But the question says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the user didn't mention any constraints on recursion depth. So the recursive approach is acceptable.

Another thing: the function is supposed to return all subclasses, including those that are not directly under cls but are in the hierarchy. The code does that.

But perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, using a set to track visited classes to avoid infinite loops. Wait, but in Python, the inheritance hierarchy is acyclic. So no cycles. So the code is safe.

But what if a class is a subclass of itself? Well, that's not possible in Python. So the code is safe.

So the code should work. Let me test with some examples.

Example 1:

class A: pass
class B(A): pass
class C(B): pass

subclasses(A) should return [B, C].

Testing the code:

subclasses(A) would get direct_subclasses as {B}. Then for B, call subclasses(B), which gets {C}. So direct_subclasses becomes {B, C}. Return list, which is [B, C]. Correct.

Another example:

class A: pass
class B(A): pass
class C(A): pass
class D(B): pass
class E(C): pass

subclasses(A) would collect B and C. Then for B, collect D. For C, collect E. So the result is [B, C, D, E]. Correct.

Another case: multiple inheritance. Suppose class B inherits from A, class C inherits from A, and class D inherits from B and C. Then, subclasses(A) would get B and C. Then subclasses(B) would get D, and subclasses(C) would also get D. So the set would have B, C, D. So the result is [B, C, D]. Which is correct.

So the code seems to handle that.

But what about if a subclass is not directly under cls but is a subclass of a subclass? Like D is a subclass of B, which is a subclass of A. Then, subclasses(A) would include B and then D. Correct.

So the code should work.

But perhaps the initial code can be written with a helper function to avoid modifying the set while iterating. Wait, in the code above, the direct_subclasses is a set. Then, for each subclass in direct_subclasses, we call subclasses(subclass) and add their subclasses to direct_subclasses. Since we're using a set, adding elements during iteration is okay because the for loop is over the original direct_subclasses, and the update is adding more elements. But in Python, when you iterate over a set, adding elements to it during iteration doesn't affect the loop. Wait, no. Because the for loop is over the initial elements of the set. So, for example, if during the loop, you add new elements to the set, the loop will not process them. So in the code above, the for loop is over the initial direct_subclasses, and then each time, we add more subclasses. So that's okay. Because the initial direct_subclasses are the immediate subclasses, and then their subclasses are added. So the code is correct.

But maybe the code can be written with a loop that continues until no more subclasses are found. But the recursive approach is simpler.

So the code as written should work. Now, I need to make sure that the function is properly handling the recursion. Also, the function should return a list of classes. So the code is correct.

Another thing: the function is supposed to return all subclasses, but what about classes that are not directly or indirectly subclasses but are in the same hierarchy? No, the code should handle that.

So the code seems correct. Now, I need to write it in Python, making sure that the function is properly defined. Also, the docstring is given, so I need to include that.

So the final code would be:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    direct_subclasses = set(cls.__subclasses__())
    for subclass in direct_subclasses:
        direct_subclasses.update(subclasses(subclass))
    return list(direct_subclasses)

Wait, but what if the class is not a new-style class? Well, in Python 3, all classes are new-style, so that's not an issue. So this code should work.

But maybe the function should also include the subclasses of the subclasses, but the code already does that. So I think this is correct.
