Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called status_str. The function is part of a class, as indicated by the self parameter. The docstring says it should return a string that visits the sorted self.messages list, adding a prefix to each element. 

First, I need to figure out what the messages list contains. Since it's not specified, I'll assume it's a list of strings or objects that can be converted to strings. The function needs to sort this list. But wait, the docstring says "sorted self.messages list"—so maybe the list is already sorted, or perhaps the function is supposed to sort it? The wording is a bit ambiguous. However, the phrase "visiting the sorted" suggests that the list is sorted once and then processed. So maybe the function is supposed to sort the messages first.

Wait, the function is called status_str, which probably constructs a string representation of the messages with a prefix. The docstring says each visit adds the prefix and the element. So perhaps for each message in the sorted list, we prepend the given prefix and then concatenate them all into a single string.

So steps to take: 

1. Sort the self.messages list. But how? If the messages are strings, sorting them lexicographically makes sense. If they're objects, maybe there's a specific attribute to sort by. Since the docstring doesn't specify, I'll assume that the messages are strings and sort them in alphabetical order. Alternatively, maybe the list is already sorted, and the function just processes it. But the wording says "visiting the sorted", which might imply that the function is responsible for sorting.

Wait, the function is called status_str, and the parameter is prefix. So maybe the messages are already sorted, and the function is just adding the prefix to each element. But the docstring says "visiting the sorted self.messages list"—maybe that's a typo and meant "visiting each element in the sorted self.messages list". 

So the function should take the self.messages list, sort it, then for each element in that sorted list, add the prefix and the element to a string, then return the combined string. 

But how to sort? If the messages are strings, sorted() would work. If they are other objects, perhaps we need to sort by a specific attribute. Since the docstring doesn't mention, maybe the messages are strings. 

So code outline:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    result = []
    for msg in sorted_messages:
        result.append(prefix + str(msg))
    return '\n'.join(result)

Wait, but the docstring says "each visit add prefix and the element". So maybe each element is prefixed with the given prefix. So for each message in the sorted list, we add prefix followed by the message. Then, all these are joined into a single string, perhaps with newlines.

But the exact format isn't specified. The user might want each message to be on a new line with the prefix. So the code would sort the messages, then loop through each, add prefix and the message, then join with newlines.

Alternatively, maybe the prefix is added before each message, and the messages are sorted. So the code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    return '\n'.join([prefix + str(msg) for msg in sorted_messages])

But what if the messages are not strings? The code would need to convert them to strings. So using str(msg) is safe.

Wait, the function is part of a class. The messages are an attribute of the class. So self.messages is a list that's part of the instance.

So the code would be as above. Let me check the parameters. The prefix is optional, defaulting to empty string. So the function adds the prefix to each message.

But maybe the prefix is a string that's added before each message. So for example, if prefix is 'MSG:', then each message is 'MSG:msg1\nMSG:msg2' etc.

Yes, that makes sense. So the code would sort the messages, then create a list of each message with the prefix, then join them with newlines.

So the final code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return a string with visiting the sorted self.messages list, each visit add prefix and the element in the sorted self.messages list.
    """
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    return '\n'.join([prefix + str(msg) for msg in sorted_messages])

Wait, but the docstring says "visiting the sorted self.messages list"—maybe "visiting" here means iterating through each element. So the code is correct.

But maybe the messages are not strings. For example, if they are objects, then converting them to strings with str() is necessary. That's probably the right approach.

So the code should sort the messages, then for each message in the sorted list, prepend the prefix and convert to string, then join with newlines. That's the plan.
