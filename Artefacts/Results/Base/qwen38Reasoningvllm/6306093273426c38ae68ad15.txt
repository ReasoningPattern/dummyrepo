Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to generate Python code for the _run_playbook function based on the given signature and docstring. They specified not to include any explanations or markdown, just the code in Python markdown format.

First, I need to understand the function's purpose. The docstring says it runs an Ansible CLI with a vars_dict passed as extra-vars. The parameters are cli_args (a list of command line arguments), vars_dict (a dictionary for extra variables), ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. The return is ansible results.

So, the function is supposed to execute an Ansible playbook using the provided command line arguments and variables. I should use the Ansible API to do this. Let me recall how to run Ansible playbooks in Python. The ansible_runner library is commonly used for this. It allows running playbooks and capturing results.

Wait, but the user might not have mentioned specific libraries. However, since the function is part of an Infrared plugin, maybe it's using their internal tools. But since I don't have that context, I'll assume standard Ansible execution.

The function needs to take cli_args, which are the command line arguments. But when using ansible-runner, you typically pass the playbook path, inventory, etc. However, the cli_args here might be the arguments that the user would normally pass to the ansible CLI. So perhaps the function is meant to construct the command and run it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is using the Ansible API directly. But that's more complex. Let me think. The standard way to run Ansible from Python is using subprocess, but that's not ideal. Using ansible_runner is better for managing runs, especially in a plugin context.

So, I'll proceed with using ansible_runner. The function would need to create a runner instance, set the extra_vars, and then run the playbook.

Wait, but the parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin. What are those? The ir_workspace is an Infrared Workspace object, which might have methods to get the playbook path or other configurations. Similarly, ir_plugin could have specific settings. But since I don't have the actual definitions of these objects, I'll have to make assumptions.

Assuming that ir_workspace has a method to get the playbook path, like get_playbook_path(), and that ir_plugin might have some plugin-specific arguments. But the user hasn't provided that info, so maybe I should just use the cli_args as part of the command.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to run the playbook using the Ansible CLI with the given arguments and variables. So, the code would construct the command line, including the playbook, inventory, etc., from cli_args, and then pass the vars_dict as extra-vars.

But how to integrate the ir_workspace and ir_plugin? Maybe the ir_workspace provides the playbook path, and the ir_plugin provides some plugin-specific parameters. However, without knowing the exact structure, I'll need to make some educated guesses.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Use the cli_args to build the command. But cli_args is a list, so maybe it's already the arguments. Wait, the function's parameters are cli_args, which is a list of command line arguments. So perhaps the function is meant to execute the ansible CLI with those arguments, plus the extra-vars from vars_dict.

But how to handle the playbook? The cli_args might not include the playbook path. Wait, the function name is _run_playbook, so maybe the playbook is determined by the ir_workspace or ir_plugin. For example, the ir_workspace might have a default playbook.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args includes the playbook path. But the user hasn't specified. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous.

Given that the function is part of an Infrared plugin, perhaps the ir_workspace is used to get the playbook path. So, the code would need to construct the command with the playbook path from the workspace, along with any other cli_args provided.

But since the user hasn't given specifics, I'll have to make assumptions. Let's proceed with using the ansible_runner library. The code would need to import it, then create a Runner instance with the playbook path, inventory, etc., and pass the extra_vars.

Wait, but the cli_args might include other parameters like --inventory, --playbook, etc. So perhaps the function is supposed to parse cli_args to determine the playbook and inventory, then run it with the extra-vars.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is the list of arguments that the user wants to pass, and the function is supposed to combine them with the extra-vars. But how?

Another approach: The function might be using the Ansible CLI directly via subprocess. So, the code would construct the command as a list, including 'ansible-playbook', the playbook path (maybe from ir_workspace), and then the cli_args plus the extra-vars.

But again, without knowing how ir_workspace and ir_plugin are structured, it's tricky. Let me think of a standard way. Maybe the ir_workspace has a method to get the playbook path, and the cli_args includes other options. So the code would take the playbook path from the workspace, then combine it with cli_args, and pass the extra-vars.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args already include the playbook path. But the function name is _run_playbook, which suggests that the playbook is determined by the function, not the cli_args.

This is a bit confusing. Let me check the parameters again. The function has cli_args as a list of command line arguments. So perhaps the user is passing arguments like ['--inventory', 'my_inventory', ...], and the function is supposed to run ansible-playbook with those arguments, along with the extra-vars from vars_dict.

But then, where is the playbook specified? Maybe the ir_workspace provides the playbook path. So the code would need to get the playbook path from the workspace, then combine it with cli_args, and then run the command.

So, the steps would be:

- Get the playbook path from ir_workspace (maybe via a method like get_playbook())
- Combine the playbook path with cli_args to form the full command
- Pass the vars_dict as extra-vars
- Run the command using ansible_runner or subprocess
- Return the results

But since the user hasn't provided the exact methods of ir_workspace and ir_plugin, I'll have to make assumptions. Let's proceed with using ansible_runner.

So, the code would look something like:

import ansible_runner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    # Combine cli_args with the playbook path
    # Wait, cli_args is a list of arguments. So the full command would be ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args + [playbook_path]
    # But maybe the cli_args already includes the playbook path? Not sure. The function's name is _run_playbook, so perhaps the playbook is determined by the workspace.

    # Assuming that cli_args does not include the playbook path, and we need to add it.
    # So the command would be ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path] + cli_args
    # But that's not certain. Alternatively, maybe the cli_args includes the playbook path as one of the arguments.

    # To be safe, perhaps the cli_args is the list of arguments that the user wants to pass, and the function is responsible for adding the playbook path.

    # So, the code would construct the command as follows:
    # command = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args + [playbook_path]
    # But again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is the list of arguments that the user wants to pass, and the playbook is determined by the ir_workspace.

    # Let me think of an example. Suppose the user calls this function with cli_args like ['--inventory', 'my_inventory'], and the ir_workspace has a default playbook. Then the full command would be 'ansible-playbook' followed by the playbook path, then the cli_args, then the extra-vars.

    # So, the code would need to:

    # 1. Get the playbook path from ir_workspace
    # 2. Create the command list: ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path] + cli_args
    # 3. Pass the extra-vars as a dictionary
    # 4. Run the command and return results

    # But how to run it? Using ansible_runner, which can take a playbook and extra_vars.

    # So, using ansible_runner.run, passing the playbook, extra_vars, and other parameters.

    # Also, the ir_plugin might have some settings, like inventory, but again, without knowing, I'll assume that the ir_workspace provides the necessary info.

    # Let's proceed with that.

    # So, the code would be:

    import ansible_runner

    # Get the playbook path from the ir_workspace
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()

    # Run the playbook with the given cli_args and vars_dict
    # But how to handle cli_args? Maybe they are additional arguments that the user wants to pass, like --inventory, --limit, etc.

    # So, the command would be 'ansible-playbook' followed by the cli_args, then the playbook path.

    # Wait, but in Ansible, the playbook is specified as a command-line argument. So if cli_args includes other options, the playbook path would be part of the cli_args? Or is it separate?

    # For example, if the user wants to run a playbook with --inventory and --limit, then cli_args would be ['--inventory', 'my_inventory', '--limit', 'my_host'], and the playbook path is determined by the workspace.

    # So, the full command would be ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path] + cli_args

    # But then, the vars_dict is passed as extra-vars. So in the ansible_runner, we can set extra_vars.

    # So the code would be:

    r = ansible_runner.run(
        playbook=playbook_path,
        extra_vars=vars_dict,
        inventory=ir_workspace.get_inventory(),  # Assuming ir_workspace has a method for inventory
        plugin=ir_plugin,  # Not sure about this parameter, maybe it's for the plugin type?
        # Other parameters as needed
    )

    return r.results

But I'm not sure about the parameters for ansible_runner. The ansible_runner.run function typically takes a playbook path, inventory, etc. However, the ir_plugin might be used for something else, like specifying a plugin type. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to run the playbook using the Ansible CLI directly. So using subprocess to call ansible-playbook with the given arguments and extra-vars.

In that case, the code would be:

import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Get the playbook path from the workspace
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    # Construct the command
    command = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args + [playbook_path]
    # Add extra-vars
    for key, value in vars_dict.items():
        command.append(f'--extra-vars={key}={value}')
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Return the results
    return result.stdout, result.stderr, result.returncode

But this approach might not be ideal because it's not handling the extra-vars properly. The --extra-vars can be passed as a single argument with a JSON string, or as multiple --extra-vars flags. However, the vars_dict could be complex, so perhaps it's better to pass it as a JSON string.

Alternatively, using the ansible_runner library would be more robust. Let me check the ansible_runner documentation.

The ansible_runner.run function can take a playbook, extra_vars, inventory, etc. So perhaps the code should be:

import ansible_runner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Get the playbook path from the workspace
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    # Get inventory from the workspace
    inventory = ir_workspace.get_inventory()
    # Run the playbook with the given cli_args and vars_dict
    # Wait, but cli_args might include other options. How to integrate them?

    # Maybe the cli_args are the arguments that the user wants to pass to ansible-playbook, so we need to combine them with the playbook path and inventory.

    # So, the command would be 'ansible-playbook' followed by cli_args, inventory, and playbook_path.

    # But how to handle that? Maybe the cli_args includes the inventory, or not. This is unclear.

    # Alternatively, the cli_args is the list of arguments that the user wants to pass, and the function is responsible for adding the playbook path and inventory.

    # So, the code would be:

    r = ansible_runner.run(
        playbook=playbook_path,
        inventory=inventory,
        extra_vars=vars_dict,
        args=cli_args,
    )
    return r.results

But I'm not sure if 'args' is a valid parameter for ansible_runner. Looking at the ansible_runner documentation, the run function's parameters include playbook, inventory, extra_vars, etc. The 'args' parameter might not exist. Instead, the cli_args might be part of the command line arguments.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is the list of arguments that should be passed to the ansible-playbook command, so the code would construct the command as ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args, and then pass the extra-vars.

But then, how to get the playbook path? The ir_workspace might have a method to get it. So:

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path] + cli_args
    # Pass extra-vars
    # Using ansible_runner, which can take extra_vars
    r = ansible_runner.run(
        playbook=playbook_path,
        extra_vars=vars_dict,
        inventory=ir_workspace.get_inventory(),
    )
    return r.results

But again, the cli_args might include other parameters like --inventory, which would override the inventory from the workspace. So perhaps the function should combine the cli_args with the default inventory from the workspace.

This is getting complicated. Since the user hasn't provided specifics about ir_workspace and ir_plugin, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let me proceed with the following approach:

- The function uses the ansible_runner to run the playbook.
- The playbook path is obtained from the ir_workspace.
- The cli_args are the additional command-line arguments that the user wants to pass.
- The vars_dict is passed as extra-vars.
- The inventory is obtained from the ir_workspace.

So, the code would be:

import ansible_runner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    inventory = ir_workspace.get_inventory()
    # Run the playbook with the given cli_args and vars_dict
    r = ansible_runner.run(
        playbook=playbook_path,
        inventory=inventory,
        extra_vars=vars_dict,
        args=cli_args,
    )
    return r.results

But I'm not sure if 'args' is a valid parameter. Looking at the ansible_runner API, the run function's parameters include 'playbook', 'inventory', 'extra_vars', etc. The 'args' parameter might not be there. So perhaps the cli_args should be part of the command line arguments.

Alternatively, the cli_args might be the arguments that the user wants to pass to the ansible-playbook command, so they should be combined with the playbook path and inventory.

Wait, maybe the cli_args is the list of arguments that the user wants to pass, and the function is supposed to run ansible-playbook with those arguments, plus the extra-vars. So, the code would need to construct the command as ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args, and then pass the extra-vars.

But then, how to handle the playbook path? The ir_workspace might have a method to get it, so the code would need to include that in the command.

So, the command would be ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path] + cli_args.

But then, the extra-vars can be passed via the --extra-vars flag. So, the code could use the ansible_runner to run the playbook with those arguments.

Alternatively, using subprocess:

import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    inventory = ir_workspace.get_inventory()
    # Construct the command
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    # Add cli_args
    command.extend(cli_args)
    # Add extra-vars
    for key, value in vars_dict.items():
        command.append(f'--extra-vars={key}={value}')
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

But this approach may not handle complex variables properly. For example, if the vars_dict has nested structures, using --extra-vars with key=value might not work. However, the docstring says that vars_dict is passed as extra-vars, so maybe it's expected to be a flat dictionary.

Alternatively, the extra-vars can be passed as a JSON string. So, the code could do:

command.append(f'--extra-vars={json.dumps(vars_dict)}')

But that's not standard. The standard way is to pass each key-value pair as a separate --extra-vars argument.

But again, without knowing the exact requirements, it's hard to say. The user might expect the code to use the ansible_runner library, which can handle extra_vars more gracefully.

Another consideration: The ir_plugin might be used to specify the plugin type, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's not needed here.

Putting it all together, the code would:

- Get the playbook path from the ir_workspace.
- Use ansible_runner to run the playbook with the given extra-vars and any other parameters from cli_args.

But since the cli_args is a list of arguments, perhaps they are already part of the command. So, the code might need to combine them with the playbook path and inventory.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is the list of arguments that should be passed to the ansible-playbook command, and the function is supposed to run it with those arguments and the extra-vars.

In that case, the code would need to construct the command as ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args, and then pass the extra-vars via the --extra-vars option.

But how to integrate that into the ansible_runner? Maybe the cli_args include the --extra-vars, but that's not likely. The vars_dict is supposed to be passed as extra-vars, so the code should handle that.

Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Given the lack of specific information, I'll proceed with using the ansible_runner, assuming that the cli_args are additional arguments that the user wants to pass, and the playbook path is obtained from the ir_workspace.

So the code would be:

import ansible_runner

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments

    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    inventory = ir_workspace.get_inventory()
    r = ansible_runner.run(
        playbook=playbook_path,
        inventory=inventory,
        extra_vars=vars_dict,
        args=cli_args,
    )
    return r.results

But again, I'm not sure if 'args' is a valid parameter. Let me check the ansible_runner API again. The run function's parameters include 'playbook', 'inventory', 'extra_vars', 'verbosity', etc. There's no 'args' parameter. So perhaps the cli_args should be part of the command line arguments.

So, the code would need to construct the command as ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args, and then pass the extra-vars. But how to do that with ansible_runner?

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is the list of arguments that the user wants to pass, and the function is supposed to run the playbook using those arguments. So, the code would use the cli_args as the arguments to the ansible-playbook command, and then pass the extra-vars via the --extra-vars option.

But in that case, the code would have to combine the cli_args with the --extra-vars flags. So, for example:

command = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args
for key, value in vars_dict.items():
    command.append(f'--extra-vars={key}={value}')

Then run the command with subprocess.

But the user might want to use ansible_runner for better handling. Let me think. If the function is part of an Infrared plugin, perhaps it's using their internal runner. But since I don't have that info, I'll proceed with the standard approach.

So, the code would use subprocess to run the ansible-playbook command, combining cli_args and the extra-vars.

But how to handle the playbook path? Maybe the ir_workspace provides the playbook path, and the cli_args includes other options. So:

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    # Construct the command
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    # Add cli_args
    command.extend(cli_args)
    # Add extra-vars
    for key, value in vars_dict.items():
        command.append(f'--extra-vars={key}={value}')
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

But I'm not sure if that's the correct way. Also, the function is supposed to return 'ansible results', which could be a dictionary or some other structure. The subprocess approach returns stdout, stderr, and returncode.

Alternatively, using ansible_runner, which returns a more structured result. But without knowing the exact parameters, it's hard to say.

Another possibility: The cli_args is the list of arguments that the user wants to pass to the ansible-playbook command, and the function is supposed to run it with those arguments and the extra-vars. So, the code would need to combine the cli_args with the playbook path and inventory, and pass the extra-vars.

But again, without knowing how the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used, it's challenging. However, given the parameters, the code should probably use the ir_workspace to get the playbook path and inventory, then run the ansible-playbook command with those, plus the cli_args and extra-vars.

So, the final code would be something like:

import subprocess
import json

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars

    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook()
    inventory = ir_workspace.get_inventory()

    command.extend(cli_args)
    # Add extra-vars
    if vars_dict:
        # Convert the vars_dict to a JSON string for extra-vars
        # Or pass each key-value as separate --extra-vars
        # Assuming that the user wants to pass each key-value pair as separate arguments
        for key, value in vars_dict.items():

    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

But this is just a guess. The user might have specific requirements, but since they didn't provide, I'll proceed with this approach. Also, note that the ir_plugin is not used here, which might be an issue. Maybe the ir_plugin is used to get some settings, but without more info, I can't include that.

Alternatively, maybe the ir_plugin is used to determine the playbook or other parameters. But again, without knowing, I'll leave it out.

So, the final code would use subprocess to run the ansible-playbook command with the playbook path from the ir_workspace, cli_args, and extra-vars from vars_dict. The return is a dictionary with stdout, stderr, and returncode.

But the user's docstring says the return is 'ansible results', which could be more than just stdout and stderr. However, without more context, this is the best I can do.

Another consideration: The vars_dict might have complex data types, so passing them as key=value might not work. In that case, using --extra-vars with a JSON file would be better. But the function is supposed to pass vars_dict as extra-vars, so perhaps it's expected to be a flat dictionary.

In conclusion, the code would use subprocess to run the ansible-playbook command with the playbook path from the workspace, cli_args, and extra-vars from vars_dict. The ir_plugin is not used here, but maybe it's supposed to be part of the command. However, without knowing, I'll omit it.

So, the generated code would be as follows.
