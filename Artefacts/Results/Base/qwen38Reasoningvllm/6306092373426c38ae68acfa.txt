Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called get_spec_defaults based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says it's supposed to resolve arguments' values from the spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). 

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions resolving arguments' values, so maybe this function is part of a class that processes some kind of specifications, like a configuration or API spec. The _get_defaults() method is probably a helper that retrieves default values.

Wait, the function is part of a class, as it uses self. So the method get_spec_defaults is likely meant to gather default values from the specification and possibly other sources. The docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()", which suggests that the function uses that helper method to get the defaults.

But what's the exact purpose? Maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary of default values for the arguments defined in the spec. So the code would call self._get_defaults() and return whatever that method provides. However, I need to make sure that the code is correct and follows best practices.

Let me think about the structure. The function is defined with def get_spec_defaults(self):, and the docstring is provided. The user didn't specify any parameters, so the function doesn't take any arguments. The docstring indicates that it uses self._get_defaults(), so the code should probably call that method and return its result.

But wait, maybe the _get_defaults() method is part of the class and is already handling the resolution. So the get_spec_defaults function might just be a wrapper that calls that method. So the code would be as simple as returning self._get_defaults().

Alternatively, perhaps there's more to it. Maybe the function needs to process the spec first, then combine with other defaults. But since the docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()", it sounds like the _get_defaults method is responsible for that resolution. Therefore, the get_spec_defaults function is just a facade that calls _get_defaults and returns the result.

So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But wait, maybe the _get_defaults method is not yet implemented, or maybe the function needs to handle some specific logic. However, the user hasn't provided any additional details. The instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, without any explanation. So the safest bet is to assume that the function simply calls self._get_defaults() and returns it.

I should also check if there are any other possible steps. For example, maybe the function is supposed to merge defaults from the spec with other sources. But the docstring says that self._get_defaults() is used to resolve them, so perhaps that method already handles merging. Therefore, the get_spec_defaults function just needs to invoke that method.

Another thing to consider: the function's name suggests it's getting defaults from the spec, but the docstring says "spec and other sources". So maybe the function is intended to first check the spec for defaults and then other sources. However, without knowing the exact implementation of _get_defaults, it's hard to say. But since the user says to generate code based on the given info, I should stick to the docstring's instruction.

So the code is straightforward. Just return the result of self._get_defaults(). Also, the docstring is already provided, so I just need to include it as is. The user said not to include any explanations, so the code should be minimal.

Wait, but what if _get_defaults is a method that returns a dictionary? Then get_spec_defaults would return that dictionary. That makes sense. So the code would be as simple as that. I think that's the correct approach here. No parameters, just a single return statement.
