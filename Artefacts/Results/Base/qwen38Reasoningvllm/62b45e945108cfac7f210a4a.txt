Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_hierarchy function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it validates the storage root hierarchy and returns two values: num_objects and good_objects. The parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings, all with default values of True, True, and False respectively.

First, I should figure out what the function needs to do. Since it's about validating a hierarchy, maybe it's checking if certain objects exist in the storage structure. The parameters suggest that it can validate objects, check their digests, and whether to show warnings. 

The function is part of a class (since it's using self). So, I need to think about how the class might be structured. Perhaps there's a storage root that the function checks. The return values are counts, so the function needs to track how many objects it checks and how many are valid.

Let me outline the steps. The function might traverse the storage hierarchy, check each object's validity based on the parameters. If validate_objects is True, it checks if the objects exist. If check_digests is True, it verifies their digests. Warnings might be logged if show_warnings is True.

I need to make sure the function returns num_objects and good_objects. Let's think about variables. Maybe start with initializing num_objects and good_objects to 0. Then iterate through the storage hierarchy, perhaps using a method like get_objects() or something similar. For each object, increment num_objects. Then check validity based on the parameters. If valid, increment good_objects.

Wait, but how does the storage hierarchy work? Maybe the class has a method to get all objects in the hierarchy. Let's assume that self.storage_root has a method to list all objects. Or maybe the function is supposed to check the objects in the hierarchy starting from self.storage_root.

Also, the parameters validate_objects and check_digests might control which checks are performed. For example, if validate_objects is False, maybe the function skips checking the existence of objects. But the docstring says "validate storage root hierarchy" which might imply that the function is checking the structure, not just the objects. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where each object has a digest, and the hierarchy is validated by ensuring that all objects are present and their digests are correct. So, when validate_objects is True, check if each object exists. When check_digests is True, verify their digests against some expected values.

But without more context, I have to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the following approach:

- The function will traverse the storage hierarchy, perhaps recursively.
- For each object, it will check if it exists (if validate_objects is True).
- If check_digests is True, it will also verify the digest.
- If any issues are found, warnings might be shown based on show_warnings.
- The function returns the total number of objects checked and the count of valid ones.

Now, implementing this. Let's start by initializing the counters. Then, perhaps call a helper method to traverse the hierarchy. For example, self._traverse_hierarchy() might yield all objects in the hierarchy.

In the helper method, for each object, we check if it's valid. The validity depends on the parameters. So, if validate_objects is True, check existence. If check_digests is True, check the digest. But how to check the digest? Maybe each object has a method is_valid() that does these checks.

Wait, but the function parameters are validate_objects and check_digests. So, maybe the function is designed to allow toggling these checks. For example, if validate_objects is True, then check if the object exists in the storage. If check_digests is True, check if the object's digest matches expected values.

But how to get the list of objects? Let's assume that the storage root has a method to get all objects, like self.storage_root.get_objects(). Or maybe the function is supposed to check the hierarchy structure, like ensuring that all parent directories exist, etc. However, the docstring mentions "storage root hierarchy," which could be a tree structure of objects.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that manages a storage system, and the hierarchy refers to the structure of stored items. The exact implementation details are unclear, but I need to write code that fits the function signature and docstring.

Let me think of a possible implementation. The function could start by initializing num_objects and good_objects to 0. Then, it might iterate through all objects in the storage hierarchy. For each object, if validate_objects is True, check if it's present. If check_digests is True, check the digest. Depending on these checks, increment the counters. Also, handle warnings if show_warnings is True.

But how to represent the storage hierarchy? Maybe the class has a root directory, and the function traverses it. For example, using os.walk or a similar method. However, since it's a storage system, perhaps it's using some custom structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a method to get all objects, and each object has attributes like exists and digest. So, for each object in the hierarchy:

if validate_objects:
    if not object.exists():
        if show_warnings:
            print warning
        num_objects +=1
        good_objects +=0
else:
    pass

Similarly for check_digests. But the exact logic is not specified. The user might expect that the function checks the validity of each object in the hierarchy, considering the parameters.

Another consideration: the function returns num_objects and good_objects. So, the code needs to calculate these two numbers.

Let me draft the code:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    """
    Validate storage root hierarchy.

    Returns:
        num_objects - number of objects checked
        good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
    """
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Assume self.storage_root is the root of the hierarchy
    # Traverse the hierarchy, perhaps using a generator
    for obj in self._traverse_hierarchy():
        num_objects +=1
        if validate_objects:
            if not obj.exists():
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} does not exist.")
                continue  # or mark as invalid
        if check_digests:
            if not obj.check_digest():
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for {obj}.")
                continue  # or mark as invalid
        good_objects +=1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is just a rough sketch. The actual implementation would depend on the class's structure. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll have to make assumptions. For example, the _traverse_hierarchy method could be a helper that yields all objects in the hierarchy. Each object has methods exists() and check_digest().

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check the hierarchy structure, like ensuring that all parent directories are present. But the docstring mentions "storage root hierarchy" and the returns are about objects checked, so it's more likely about objects within the hierarchy.

Another thing: the parameters are optional, with defaults. So, the function should handle cases where they are not provided.

But the user wants the code generated based on the given signature and docstring. They didn't mention any specific implementation details, so I need to write a plausible code that fits the function's purpose.

Let me think of a possible structure. The function might check each object in the hierarchy. For each object, if validate_objects is True, check if it's valid (exists, maybe). If check_digests is True, check if the digest is correct. Then, based on these checks, increment the counters.

But how to determine if an object is valid? Maybe the function has a method to validate an object, which could be called based on the parameters.

Alternatively, the function could be part of a system where objects are stored in a tree structure, and the hierarchy is validated by ensuring that all objects are properly structured. However, without more context, it's hard to say.

Perhaps the function is supposed to check the number of objects and how many are valid. Let me proceed with the code that traverses the hierarchy, checks each object's existence and digest, and counts.

So, the code would look something like this:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    """
    Validate storage root hierarchy.

    Returns:
        num_objects - number of objects checked
        good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
    """
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Assume self.storage_root is the root of the hierarchy
    # Traverse the hierarchy, perhaps recursively
    for obj in self._traverse_hierarchy():
        num_objects += 1
        valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            if not obj.exists():
                valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} does not exist.")
        if check_digests and valid:
            if not obj.check_digest():
                valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for {obj}.")
        if valid:
            good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the helper method _traverse_hierarchy is assumed to exist. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe I should implement it as part of the function or use a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check the hierarchy by verifying that all objects are present and their digests are correct. So, the code would need to iterate through all objects in the storage root.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, I'll have to write a generic code that fits the function signature. Let's proceed with the code above, but replace _traverse_hierarchy with a method that's part of the class. However, since the user hasn't mentioned that, maybe I should just assume that the class has a way to get all objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a storage structure, and the validate_hierarchy method is supposed to check all objects in that structure. For example, if the storage is a directory, then using os.listdir or similar.

But again, without knowing the exact storage structure, it's hard to code. However, the user just wants the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, I can write a placeholder for the traversal.

Another thing: the function returns a tuple (num_objects, good_objects). The code should return that.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    """
    Validate storage root hierarchy.

    Returns:
        num_objects - number of objects checked
        good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
    """
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Traverse the storage hierarchy
    for obj in self._get_all_objects():
        num_objects += 1
        is_valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            if not obj.is_valid():
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} is invalid.")
        if check_digests and is_valid:
            if not obj.check_digest():
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for {obj}.")
        if is_valid:
            good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But again, the _get_all_objects method is assumed. Since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should use a different approach. Maybe the storage root is a directory, and the function checks all files in it. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check the hierarchy by ensuring that all objects are present and their digests are correct, and the code is part of a class that has a list of objects. For example, self.objects is a list of objects in the hierarchy.

In that case, the code could be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    """
    Validate storage root hierarchy.

    Returns:
        num_objects - number of objects checked
        good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
    """
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self.objects:
        num_objects += 1
        is_valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            if not obj.exists():
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} does not exist.")
        if check_digests:
            if not obj.check_digest():
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for {obj}.")
        if is_valid:
            good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is all speculative. The user might expect that the function is part of a class with a storage structure, and the actual implementation details are not provided. Therefore, the code should be a placeholder that follows the function signature and docstring.

Another point: the parameters are validate_objects and check_digests. So, the function might have different checks based on these. For example, if validate_objects is False, it skips existence checks, but still checks digests. Or maybe if validate_objects is True, it checks existence, and if check_digests is True, it checks digests. The code should handle these conditions.

In the code, for each object, we first check existence if validate_objects is True. Then, if check_digests is True, we check the digest. If either check fails, the object is considered invalid.

But how to determine if an object is valid? Maybe the object has a method is_valid() that returns True or False. Or perhaps the function combines the existence and digest checks.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the objects are present and their digests match expected values. So, the code would need to check both conditions if both parameters are True.

Putting all together, the code would be as follows. I'll assume that the class has a method to get all objects in the hierarchy, and each object has methods exists() and check_digest(). The code would loop through these objects, perform the checks, and count.

So, the final code would look like:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    """
    Validate storage root hierarchy.

    Returns:
        num_objects - number of objects checked
        good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
    """
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self._traverse_hierarchy():
        num_objects += 1
        is_valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            if not obj.exists():
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} does not exist.")
        if check_digests:
            if not obj.check_digest():
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for {obj}.")
        if is_valid:
            good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But the user might not have a _traverse_hierarchy method. Maybe the function is supposed to check the root's children. Alternatively, perhaps the storage hierarchy is represented as a tree, and the function traverses it recursively.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a root directory, and the code uses os.walk to traverse it. But again, without knowing the actual storage structure, it's hard to code.

In any case, the code should follow the function signature and docstring. So, the code will have the parameters, and return the two counts. The actual implementation details are left to the class's structure.

Therefore, the code I generate should have the parameters, and the logic to count objects based on the checks. The helper methods like _traverse_hierarchy or _get_all_objects are assumed to exist in the class.

So, the final code would be as written above. But since the user hasn't provided any specific implementation, I'll proceed with that.
