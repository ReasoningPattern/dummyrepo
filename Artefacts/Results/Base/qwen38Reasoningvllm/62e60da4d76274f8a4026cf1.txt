Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called 'values' based on the given signature and docstring. The function takes *keys as arguments and returns a list of values filtered by self.index. 

First, I need to understand what 'self.index' refers to. Since it's part of a class method, maybe 'self' has an attribute called 'index' which is a dictionary or some kind of data structure that maps keys to values. The function is supposed to return the values corresponding to the keys provided, but only those that are present in self.index.

Wait, the docstring says "key filtered by self.index". So perhaps the function is meant to filter the keys based on whether they exist in self.index and then return their values. But the function is named 'values', which usually returns values for given keys. Maybe the intention is to retrieve the values for the keys passed in, but only if they are in self.index. Or maybe it's to filter the keys using self.index as a criterion?

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The function is called 'values' and takes *keys. The docstring says it returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list. Wait, maybe it's a typo and should be "value filtered"? Or perhaps it's supposed to return the values that match the keys in self.index. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the values from self.index for the given keys. So if self.index is a dictionary, then for each key in the *keys argument, if it exists in self.index, include its value in the list. So the function would iterate over the keys, check their presence in self.index, and collect the values.

So the code would probably look like this: take the keys, check each one in self.index, and collect the values. Let me draft that.

def values(self, *keys):
    """
    Returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list.
    """
    return [self.index[k] for k in keys if k in self.index]

Wait, but the docstring says "key filtered" which might be a mistake. Because the function returns values, not keys. So maybe the docstring is incorrect, but I should follow it as given. Or perhaps the user meant that the keys are filtered through self.index, meaning that only keys present in self.index are included. So the function is supposed to return the values of the keys that are present in self.index. So the code above would do that. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the values from self.index that match the keys. But since the keys are passed as arguments, the code would check each key in the *keys and collect the value if the key is in self.index. That makes sense. So the code would be a list comprehension that iterates over each key in the *keys, checks if it's in self.index, and if so, appends the value. 

I think that's the right approach. So the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the function is part of a class. Since the first parameter is 'self', it's a method of a class. But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so I'll assume that self.index is an attribute of the class, perhaps a dictionary.

So the generated code would be:

def values(self, *keys):
    """
    Returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list.
    """
    return [self.index[k] for k in keys if k in self.index]

But wait, what if the keys are not in self.index? The list comprehension would just skip them. So the function returns a list of values for the keys that exist in self.index. That seems correct. 

Another possibility: maybe the function is supposed to return the values from self.index, but the keys are filtered in some other way. But given the information, this is the most straightforward interpretation. 

I'll proceed with this code. Also, the user said not to include any explanations, just the code. So I need to make sure the output is only the code, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as a code block with triple backticks. But the user might just want the function code without the markdown. Wait, the instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So they want the code inside a markdown code block, probably with the language specified as Python.

So the final answer would be:

```python
def values(self, *keys):
    """
    Returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list.
    """
    return [self.index[k] for k in keys if k in self.index]
```

Yes, that's it. I'll make sure there's no extra text and that the code is correctly formatted.
