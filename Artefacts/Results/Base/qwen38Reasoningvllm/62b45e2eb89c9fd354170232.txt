Okay, I need to generate Python code for the next_version function based on the provided docstring. Let me think about how version numbers typically work. The docstring says it's about the next version identifier following an existing pattern. So, the function should take a version string and return the next version in a standard format.

First, I should consider the version format. Common versioning schemes are semantic versioning (like 1.2.3), where versions are in the form of major.minor.patch. Sometimes there's a prerelease or build metadata, but maybe the function is intended for the basic case.

The function needs to parse the current version into its components. Let's assume it's in the format of major.minor.patch. So splitting the version string by dots would give me the parts. For example, "1.2.3" becomes [1, 2, 3].

Then, the next version would increment the patch number by 1. Unless the patch is 0, in which case it might be a minor increment. Wait, no. Typically, the next version after 1.2.3 is 1.2.4. But if the patch is 9, then it increments the minor, and so on. So the logic is similar to semantic versioning's increment rules.

Wait, but the problem says "next version identifier following existing pattern". Maybe the existing pattern is just the standard major.minor.patch, and the next version is simply the next in sequence. So, for example, if the current version is "1.2.3", the next is "1.2.4". If it's "1.2.9", then next is "1.3.0". And if it's "1.9.9", next is "2.0.0".

So the steps would be:

1. Split the version string into parts. Let's assume there are exactly three parts for now.
2. Increment the patch version. If it's 9, carry over to the minor.
3. If the minor is 9, carry over to the major.
4. If the major is 9, then maybe it's a special case, but perhaps we just increment the major and reset the others? Or maybe the function is designed for versions where major can be incremented indefinitely.

Wait, but how to handle cases where the version has more parts, like a prerelease? For example, "1.2.3-alpha" would have parts [1, 2, 3, 'alpha']. But the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe the function is intended for the basic case without prerelease tags.

So the plan is to split the version into parts, increment the last part (patch), and if it's 9, carry over to the minor. Similarly for minor. Let me think of how to implement this.

First, split the version string into components. Let's split by '.' and check if there are exactly three parts. If not, maybe raise an error or handle it somehow. But the problem says "existing pattern", so perhaps it's safe to assume that the input is a valid semantic version with three parts.

So, for example:

version = "1.2.3" → next is "1.2.4"
version = "1.2.9" → next is "1.3.0"
version = "1.9.9" → next is "2.0.0"
version = "9.9.9" → next is "10.0.0"

But what if the version is "1.0.0"? Then next is "1.0.1".

So the code would need to split the version into major, minor, patch. Then increment the patch. If patch is 9, set to 0 and increment minor. If minor is 9, set to 0 and increment major. If major is 9, set to 0 and increment the next part? Wait, but major can be any number. So maybe the function is intended to handle versions with three parts, and when major is 9, it just increments to 10, etc.

So the code steps would be:

- Split the version string into parts using split('.')
- Convert each part to integers, except possibly the last one if there's a prerelease. But again, the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe just handle the three parts.
- Increment the patch. If it's 9, set to 0 and increment minor.
- If minor is 9 after incrementing, set to 0 and increment major.
- If major is 9, set to 0 and increment the next part? Or maybe just increment major regardless. Wait, for example, "9.0.0" would become "10.0.0".

So let's code this.

But first, let's check if the version is in the correct format. Let's assume that the input is a valid version string with three parts. So, split into parts, then process each part.

Let me think of the code structure.

def next_version(version):
    parts = version.split('.')
    # Check if parts have exactly 3 elements
    if len(parts) != 3:
        # Maybe raise an error? But the docstring doesn't mention error handling.
        # Or perhaps assume that it's a valid 3-part version.
        # Since the problem says "existing pattern", maybe it's safe to assume that.
        # So proceed under that assumption.
    major, minor, patch = map(int, parts)
    # Increment patch
    patch += 1
    if patch == 10:
        patch = 0
        minor += 1
        if minor == 10:
            minor = 0
            major += 1
            if major == 10:
                major = 0
                # But what if there's a fourth part? Maybe not. So for now, assume three parts.
    return f"{major}.{minor}.{patch}"

Wait, but that's not handling all cases. For example, if the patch is 9, then incrementing to 10 would set patch to 0, minor to 1. But if minor was 9, then incrementing would set minor to 0 and major to 1.

Wait, maybe the code should handle each part in order. Let me think:

Start with the patch. If patch is 9, increment minor, set patch to 0. Then check if minor is 9, increment major, set minor to 0. Then check if major is 9, increment to 10, etc.

Wait, but the code above would only handle up to major 9. For example, if major is 9, then incrementing would set it to 10. But if major is 9 and minor is 9 and patch is 9, then it would become 10.0.0.

Wait, let's test with "9.9.9":

major = 9, minor =9, patch=9.

patch +=1 → 10. Then patch is 10, so set to 0, minor +=1 → 10. Then minor is 10, set to 0, major +=1 → 10. So return "10.0.0".

Yes, that's correct.

But what about "1.2.9"? Patch is 9, increment to 10 → set to 0, minor becomes 3. So the next version is "1.3.0".

Yes.

But what about "1.9.9"? Patch is 9 → 0, minor becomes 10 → set to 0, major becomes 2. So "2.0.0".

Yes.

But what about "1.0.0"? It becomes "1.0.1".

But what if the version is "1.0.10"? Wait, that's not possible because patch is 10. But according to the problem, the input is following the existing pattern. So perhaps the input is always in the format where each part is a single digit? No, that's not the case. For example, versions can be "1.10.0", which is valid.

Wait, but the code as written would split "1.10.0" into parts [1, 10, 0]. Then patch is 0, increment to 1. So next version is "1.10.1". Which is correct.

But if the version is "1.9.9", then patch is 9 → increment to 10, set to 0, minor becomes 10. Then minor is 10, which is >=10? Wait, no. The code as written would check if patch ==10, but in the case of minor being 9, after incrementing patch, minor is incremented. So in the case of "1.9.9", the code would do:

patch =9 → +1 → 10. So set patch to 0, minor +=1 → 10. Then check if minor ==10? The code as written doesn't check that. So in the code above, after incrementing minor, it would check if minor is 10? Or perhaps the code should check each part in order.

Wait, the code I wrote earlier only checks if patch is 10. So if minor is 9, then after incrementing patch, minor becomes 10. But the code doesn't handle that. So the code would have a bug here.

So the correct approach is to process each part in order, starting from the last (patch), then minor, then major.

So, the code should:

- Split into parts, convert to integers.
- Increment the patch. If it's 9, set to 0 and increment minor.
- Then check if minor is 9, set to 0 and increment major.
- Then check if major is 9, set to 0 and increment the next part (if any)? But the problem says the existing pattern, so maybe it's only three parts.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the next version identifier following the existing pattern. So if the input is "1.2.3", the output is "1.2.4". If the input is "1.2.9", output is "1.3.0". If input is "1.9.9", output is "2.0.0". If input is "9.9.9", output is "10.0.0".

So the code needs to handle incrementing each part, carrying over when necessary.

So the correct logic is:

Increment the patch. If it's 9, set to 0 and increment minor. Then check if minor is 9, set to 0 and increment major. Then check if major is 9, set to 0 and increment the next part (but if there is no next part, maybe it's not handled? Or perhaps the function is intended for versions with three parts, and if major is 9, it just becomes 10, etc.

So the code should be:

def next_version(version):
    parts = version.split('.')
    major, minor, patch = map(int, parts)
    patch += 1
    if patch == 10:
        patch = 0
        minor += 1
        if minor == 10:
            minor = 0
            major += 1
            if major == 10:
                major = 0
    return f"{major}.{minor}.{patch}"

Wait, but what if the version has more than three parts? Like "1.2.3-alpha.1"? The problem says "existing pattern", but maybe the function is supposed to handle only the three parts. So perhaps the function is designed for versions with exactly three parts. So the code can assume that.

But what if the version is "1.2.3"? Then the code works. But if the version is "1.2.3.4" (four parts), then the code would split into [1,2,3,4], but then major, minor, patch would be 1,2,3, and the fourth part would be ignored. That's a problem. But the docstring says "following existing pattern", so perhaps the input is always in the three-part format. So the code can assume that.

So the code is as above. But wait, in the case where major is 9, the code would increment it to 10. But if major is 9 and minor is 9 and patch is 9, then after incrementing patch, minor becomes 10, then major becomes 10. So the code would return "10.0.0".

But what if the version is "9.9.9"? The code would process:

patch is 9 → +1 → 10 → set to 0, minor becomes 10. Then check minor ==10 → set to 0, major becomes 10. So return "10.0.0".

Yes, that's correct.

But what if the version is "1.0.0"? Then patch is 1, so next is "1.0.1".

But what about "1.0.9"? Then patch becomes 10 → set to 0, minor becomes 1. So next version is "1.1.0".

Yes.

But what if the version is "1.9.0"? Then patch is 0 → increment to 1. So next is "1.9.1".

But if the version is "1.9.9", then patch becomes 10 → set to 0, minor becomes 10 → set to 0, major becomes 2. So "2.0.0".

Yes.

So the code seems to handle that.

But what if the version is "0.0.0"? Then next is "0.0.1".

But what if the version is "9.9.9"? Then next is "10.0.0".

But what if the version is "10.9.9"? Then patch becomes 10 → set to 0, minor becomes 10 → set to 0, major becomes 11. So "11.0.0".

Yes.

So the code is correct for that.

But what about if the version is "1.2.3"? The code returns "1.2.4".

But what if the version is "1.2.3.0"? Then the code would split into [1,2,3,0], but then when trying to map to major, minor, patch, it would throw an error. So the code needs to handle only three parts. So perhaps the function is intended for three-part versions.

But the problem says "existing pattern", so perhaps the input is always a valid three-part version. So the code can assume that.

But to make it more robust, perhaps the code should check that there are exactly three parts. However, the problem doesn't mention error handling, so maybe it's not necessary.

So the code would be:

def next_version(version):
    """
    Given next version identifier following existing pattern
    """
    parts = version.split('.')
    major, minor, patch = map(int, parts)
    patch += 1
    if patch == 10:
        patch = 0
        minor += 1
        if minor == 10:
            minor = 0
            major += 1
            if major == 10:
                major = 0
    return f"{major}.{minor}.{patch}"

Wait, but what if the version is "1.2.3" and after incrementing, major becomes 10? Then the code returns "10.0.0".

But what if the version is "9.9.9"? Then major becomes 10, minor 0, patch 0. Which is correct.

But what about if the version is "1.0.0"? Then it's "1.0.1".

But what if the version is "1.0.9"? Then patch becomes 10 → 0, minor becomes 1 → "1.1.0".

Yes.

But what if the version is "1.9.9"? Then patch becomes 10 → 0, minor becomes 10 → 0, major becomes 2 → "2.0.0".

Yes.

But what if the version is "1.9.9" and after incrementing, major becomes 10? Then it's "10.0.0".

So the code handles that.

But what about if the version is "1.2.3" and the patch is 9? Then it's handled correctly.

But what if the version is "1.2.9"? Then patch becomes 10 → 0, minor becomes 3 → "1.3.0".

Yes.

But wait, in the code, after incrementing patch, we check if it's 10. Then set to 0 and increment minor. Then check if minor is 10, set to 0 and increment major. Then check if major is 10, set to 0. But that's not correct. Because if major is 9, incrementing it would make it 10, but the code would set it to 0. Wait, no. Let me see:

If major is 9, minor is 9, patch is 9.

patch +=1 → 10 → set to 0, minor +=1 → 10 → set to 0, major +=1 → 10. Then check if major ==10 → set to 0. So the result would be "0.0.0".

But that's not correct. The next version after "9.9.9" should be "10.0.0", not "0.0.0".

Ah, here's a mistake. The code checks if major ==10 and sets to 0. But that's not correct. Because major can be any number, not just up to 9. So, for example, if major is 9, incrementing it to 10 is correct. But the code as written would set major to 0 if it's 10. Which is wrong.

So the code is incorrect here. The problem is that the code is checking if major ==10 and setting to 0, but that's not necessary. Because major can be any number, and the next version would just increment it. For example, "9.0.0" → next is "10.0.0", not "0.0.0".

So the code's current logic is wrong. Let me re-examine.

The code has:

if patch == 10:
    patch = 0
    minor += 1
    if minor == 10:
        minor = 0
        major += 1
        if major == 10:
            major = 0

But this is incorrect. Because when major is incremented, it should not be reset to 0 unless it's 9. Wait, no. For example, if the version is "9.9.9", then after incrementing patch, minor becomes 10, which is then set to 0, and major becomes 10. But in that case, major is 10, which is allowed. So the code should not reset major to 0 unless it's 9. Wait, but the code is checking if major ==10, which would only happen if major was 9 and then incremented. So in that case, the code would set major to 0, which is wrong.

So the code's logic is flawed. The problem is that the code is checking for major ==10, but that's not the case. The code should only check if minor or patch reach 10, but not major. Wait, no. The code is supposed to increment the major when minor overflows. So for example, if minor is 9, then incrementing it would make it 10, so we set it to 0 and increment major. But major can be any number, so if major is 9, it becomes 10. So the code should not check for major ==10. So the code should be:

def next_version(version):
    """
    Given next version identifier following existing pattern
    """
    parts = version.split('.')
    major, minor, patch = map(int, parts)
    patch += 1
    if patch == 10:
        patch = 0
        minor += 1
        if minor == 10:
            minor = 0
            major += 1
    return f"{major}.{minor}.{patch}"

Wait, but what if major is 9 and minor is 9 and patch is 9? Then:

patch becomes 10 → set to 0, minor becomes 10 → set to 0, major becomes 10. So the result is "10.0.0".

Which is correct. So the code is correct here.

But the previous code had an extra check for major ==10, which was incorrect. So the code should not have that. So the correct code is:

def next_version(version):
    """
    Given next version identifier following existing pattern
    """
    parts = version.split('.')
    major, minor, patch = map(int, parts)
    patch += 1
    if patch == 10:
        patch = 0
        minor += 1
        if minor == 10:
            minor = 0
            major += 1
    return f"{major}.{minor}.{patch}"

Yes, that's better. So the code increments the patch, then checks if it's 10. If so, reset to 0 and increment minor. Then check if minor is 10, reset to 0 and increment major. No need to check major again.

So for "9.9.9", the code would:

patch is 9 → +1 → 10 → set to 0, minor becomes 10 → set to 0, major becomes 10. So return "10.0.0".

Yes.

Another example: "1.9.9" → patch becomes 10 → 0, minor becomes 10 → 0, major becomes 2 → "2.0.0".

Another example: "1.2.9" → patch becomes 10 → 0, minor becomes 3 → "1.3.0".

Another example: "1.0.0" → "1.0.1".

Another example: "1.0.9" → "1.1.0".

Another example: "1.9.0" → patch is 0 → increment to 1 → "1.9.1".

But if the version is "1.9.9", then patch becomes 10 → 0, minor becomes 10 → 0, major becomes 2 → "2.0.0".

Yes.

But what if the version is "1.9.9" and the major is 9? Then it becomes 10.0.0.

So the code is correct.

But what if the version has more than three parts? Like "1.2.3.4"? Then the code would split into parts [1,2,3,4], and trying to map to major, minor, patch would cause an error. So the code should handle that? Or assume that the input is always three parts?

The problem says "existing pattern", so perhaps the input is always three parts. So the code can assume that. But perhaps the function should handle versions with more parts, like prerelease. For example, "1.2.3-alpha" would split into ["1", "2", "3-alpha"], but that's not helpful. So maybe the function is intended to handle only the three numeric parts.

So the code is as written.

But perhaps the function should handle versions with more parts, but only increment the first three. For example, if the version is "1.2.3-alpha", then the code would split into ["1", "2", "3-alpha"], and trying to map to integers would fail. So the code would raise a ValueError. But the problem doesn't mention handling such cases, so maybe it's acceptable.

So the code is correct as per the given docstring.

Another test case: version is "1.2.3" → returns "1.2.4".

version is "1.2.9" → returns "1.3.0".

version is "1.9.9" → returns "2.0.0".

version is "9.9.9" → returns "10.0.0".

version is "10.0.0" → returns "10.0.1".

version is "10.0.9" → returns "10.1.0".

version is "10.9.9" → returns "11.0.0".

Yes, that seems correct.

So the code is:

def next_version(version):
    """
    Given next version identifier following existing pattern
    """
    parts = version.split('.')
    major, minor, patch = map(int, parts)
    patch += 1
    if patch == 10:
        patch = 0
        minor += 1
        if minor == 10:
            minor = 0
            major += 1
    return f"{major}.{minor}.{patch}"

But wait, what if the version has leading zeros? Like "1.02.03"? The code would split into ["1", "02", "03"], then map to integers, which would be 1, 2, 3. So that's handled correctly.

So this code should work for the given problem.

Now, the user says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is a bit vague, but the code seems to handle the standard semantic versioning increment.

So the final code is as above.
