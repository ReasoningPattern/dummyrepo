Okay, I need to create a Python function called is_none_string that checks if a given value is a string and represents None. Let me think about the requirements.

The function should take any type of value and return a boolean. The docstring says that if the value is a string and its lowercase form is 'none', return True. Otherwise, False. So first, I need to check if the input is a string. Then, check if converting it to lowercase equals 'none'.

Wait, but what about cases where the input is not a string? Like if someone passes an integer or another data type. The function should return False in those cases. So the first condition is to verify the type is a string. Then, check the lowercase value.

So the steps are: check if val is an instance of str. If not, return False. If it is, convert it to lowercase and compare to 'none'. But wait, the docstring says "the lowercase of val is equal to 'none'". So maybe it's case-insensitive. For example, 'NONE', 'None', 'nOne' should all return True when converted to lowercase.

So the code would be something like:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    if not isinstance(val, str):
        return False
    return val.lower() == 'none'

Wait, but what if the input is a string that's empty? Like ''. Then, val.lower() would be empty, which isn't equal to 'none', so that's handled. What about if the string has leading or trailing whitespace? Like ' none '—lowercase would be ' none ', which isn't equal to 'none'. So the function would return False. But according to the docstring, maybe that's intended. The docstring says "the lowercase of val is equal to 'none'", so it's exact match after lowercasing. So 'NONE' becomes 'none', which matches. But 'None' becomes 'none' as well. So the function is case-insensitive but requires the string to exactly be 'none' when lowercased.

So the code seems straightforward. Let me test some cases.

Test case 1: val is 'none' → returns True.
Test case 2: val is 'NONE' → lower to 'none' → True.
Test case 3: val is 'None' → lower to 'none' → True.
Test case 4: val is 123 → not a string → False.
Test case 5: val is 'nOne' → lower to 'none' → True.
Test case 6: val is 'non' → lower to 'non' → False.

Yes, that seems correct. So the code would first check if the input is a string. If it's not, return False. If it is, then check if the lowercase version is exactly 'none'.

But wait, the function is called is_none_string. So maybe the intention is to check if the string is 'none' in any case, but perhaps there's a confusion with the Python None value. However, the docstring says to check if the string represents None. So the function is not checking if the value is None, but if the string is 'none' (case-insensitive).

So the code should be as above. Let me make sure there are no edge cases. For example, if the input is a string that's None? Wait, no. Because in Python, if you pass None to the function, the first check would be isinstance(None, str), which is False. So it would return False. But if the input is a string that's 'none', then it returns True.

So the code is correct. Let me write it.
