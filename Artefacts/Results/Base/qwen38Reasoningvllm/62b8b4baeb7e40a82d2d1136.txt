Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _verify function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. 

The function's purpose is to verify if a candidate might correctly provide an interface. The steps mentioned are checking if the candidate claims to provide the interface using iface.providedBy, unless tentative is True. Then, ensuring all necessary methods are defined, their correct signatures, and all required attributes are present. If any checks fail, it should raise zope.interface.Invalid, collecting all errors if multiple, otherwise raising the first one.

First, I should handle the tentative flag. If tentative is False, check if the candidate provides the interface. How do I check that? The iface.providedBy method probably returns a list of interfaces provided by the candidate. So, I need to verify that the iface is in that list. Wait, but in Zope interfaces, the providedBy method is used to check if an object provides an interface. So maybe the candidate is a class, and we need to check if it's an implementer of the interface. Or perhaps the candidate is an instance, but the docstring says "candidate's class declares that it implements..." so maybe the candidate is a class.

So, for the first step, if not tentative, check if the candidate's class is an implementer of iface. That would involve checking if iface is in the providedBy list of the candidate's class. But how to get that? In Zope, you can use zope.interface.providedBy on an object, but if the candidate is a class, maybe we need to check if it's an implementer. Wait, maybe the candidate is an instance, and the function is checking if it provides the interface. But the docstring says "candidate's class declares that it implements..." so perhaps the candidate is a class. Hmm, maybe the function is part of a framework where candidate can be a class or an instance, but the check is on the class.

Wait, the first step says: "Making sure the candidate claims that it provides the interface using iface.providedBy (unless tentative is True, in which case this step is skipped)." So, maybe the candidate is an object, and iface.providedBy(candidate) is called. But the docstring says "the candidate's class declares that it implements..." which suggests that the candidate's class is an implementer. So perhaps the candidate is a class, and we need to check if it implements the interface. Or maybe the candidate is an instance, and the check is whether it provides the interface.

But in Zope's interface system, providedBy is a method that returns the interfaces provided by an object. So for an instance, you'd call providedBy on it. But the docstring says "the candidate's class declares that it implements..." which implies that the candidate is a class. So maybe the first check is whether the class is an implementer of the interface. But how to check that? Maybe using zope.interface.implements or something similar. Wait, perhaps the candidate is an object, and the function checks if it provides the interface. So, the first step is to check if iface is provided by the candidate. But if tentative is True, skip this check.

So, for the first part, if not tentative, then check if iface is in the interfaces provided by the candidate. But how to get that? Using zope.interface.providedBy(candidate) would give the interfaces provided by the candidate. So, if iface is not in that list, raise an error. But the docstring says "the candidate's class declares that it implements the interface" which might mean that the class is registered as an implementer. So maybe the candidate's class is an implementer of the interface. So perhaps the check is whether the class is an implementer. But how to check that? Maybe using zope.interface.implementsChecker or something else. Alternatively, maybe the candidate is an instance, and we need to check if it provides the interface. 

This part is a bit unclear. Let me think again. The docstring says that the candidate's class declares that it implements the interface using implementer, or the candidate itself declares that it provides the interface using provider. So, for a class, if it's decorated with @implementer(iface), then it provides the interface. For an instance, if it's provided by the interface via provider, then it provides it. So, perhaps the first check is whether the candidate provides the interface. But how to check that? For an instance, providedBy would return the interfaces it provides. For a class, maybe it's checked via the class's __provides__ attribute? Or perhaps the candidate is an instance, and we need to check if it provides the interface. 

Alternatively, maybe the candidate is a class, and the function checks if it implements the interface. So, for the first step, if not tentative, check if the class is an implementer of the iface. But how to do that? Maybe using zope.interface.providedBy on the class. Wait, but providedBy is for objects, not classes. Hmm. Maybe the candidate is an instance, and the check is whether it provides the interface. So, the code would be something like:

if not tentative:
    if iface not in zope.interface.providedBy(candidate):
        raise Invalid(...)

But then, the docstring says "the candidate's class declares that it implements..." which might imply that the class is an implementer. So perhaps the candidate is a class, and we need to check if it's registered as an implementer. But I'm not sure. Maybe the candidate is an object, and the function checks if it provides the interface. 

Assuming that the candidate is an object, then the first check is whether it provides the interface. So, the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy, Invalid

if not tentative:
    if iface not in providedBy(candidate):
        raise Invalid("Candidate does not provide the interface")

But the docstring says "the candidate's class declares that it implements..." which might mean that the class is an implementer. So perhaps the candidate is a class, and we need to check if it's an implementer. But how? Maybe using the class's __implemented__ attribute? Or maybe the class is registered with implementer. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where the candidate is an object, and the first check is whether it provides the interface. So, the code would check if iface is in the providedBy list of the candidate. 

Moving on, the next step is to make sure the candidate defines all necessary methods. So, for each method in the iface, check if the candidate has that method. But how to get the methods of the interface? Using iface.names() would give the names of the attributes and methods. So, for each name in iface.names(), check if the candidate has that method or attribute. 

Wait, but the docstring says "necessary methods" and "necessary attributes". So, for each method in the interface, check if the candidate has a method with that name. Similarly for attributes. 

But how to differentiate between methods and attributes? Maybe the interface has both, and we need to check all. So, for each name in the interface, check if the candidate has that attribute. But for methods, we also need to check the signature. 

So, the code would first collect all the attributes and methods from the interface. Then, for each name, check if the candidate has that attribute. If not, raise an error. Then, for methods, check their signatures. 

But how to get the methods and attributes from the interface? Maybe using iface.declarations, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, iterate over all the attributes and methods of the interface. 

Wait, in Zope interfaces, the interface's __dict__ contains the attributes and methods. So, perhaps for each name in iface.__dict__, check if the candidate has that attribute. But that might not be the correct approach. Because the interface might have attributes that are not part of the actual implementation. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the candidate's class implements all the methods and attributes defined in the interface. So, for each method in the interface, check if the candidate's class has a method with that name. Similarly for attributes. 

But how to get the methods and attributes of the interface? Maybe using the interface's __dict__ keys. However, interfaces can have attributes and methods, but the actual implementation might have them as well. 

So, the code would need to check for each method in the interface whether the candidate has a method with that name. But how to get the methods? Maybe using the interface's __dict__ to get all the attributes and methods. 

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a system where the candidate is a class, and the interface is checked against the class's methods and attributes. So, for each name in the interface's attributes and methods, check if the candidate's class has that name as a method or attribute. 

So, first, collect all the names from the interface. Then, for each name, check if the candidate has that attribute. If not, raise an error. Then, for methods, check their signatures. 

But how to check the signature? For each method in the interface, get the method's signature and compare it with the candidate's method's signature. 

But in Python, getting the signature of a method can be done using inspect module. However, the docstring says "to the extent possible", so maybe it's not possible to check all aspects, but just the parameters. 

So, for each method in the interface, check if the candidate has a method with the same name. Then, check the parameters. 

But how to handle this? Let's think about the steps:

1. Check if the candidate provides the interface (unless tentative).
2. Check all required attributes and methods are present.
3. Check the methods have the correct signature.

Now, for the first step, if tentative is False, then check that the candidate provides the interface. 

For the second step, for each name in the interface's attributes and methods, check if the candidate has that name as an attribute or method. 

For the third step, for each method in the interface, check that the candidate's method has the same signature. 

But how to get the methods and attributes from the interface? Let's assume that the interface's __dict__ contains all the attributes and methods. 

So, first, collect all the names from the interface. Then, for each name, check if the candidate has that attribute. 

Wait, but the interface might have attributes that are not methods. So, perhaps we need to separate methods and attributes. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that all the attributes and methods defined in the interface are present in the candidate. 

But how to determine which are methods and which are attributes? Maybe using inspect.ismethod or something similar. 

But the docstring says "necessary methods" and "necessary attributes", so perhaps both are required. 

So, for each name in the interface's __dict__, check if the candidate has that attribute. If the name is a method, then check its signature. 

But how to get the list of required attributes and methods? Maybe the interface's __dict__ includes all the attributes and methods. 

So, the code would first check if the candidate provides the interface. Then, for each name in the interface's __dict__, check if the candidate has that attribute. 

But perhaps the interface's __dict__ is not the right way. Maybe the interface's attributes and methods are defined via the interface's declarations. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the candidate's class implements all the methods and attributes of the interface. 

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the Zope interface system. In Zope, an interface can have attributes and methods. When a class implements an interface, it must provide all the attributes and methods. 

So, perhaps the code should check that for each name in the interface, the candidate has that name as an attribute or method. 

But how to get the names of the interface? Using iface.names() would give all the names, including both attributes and methods. 

So, the code could be:

from zope.interface import providedBy, Invalid
import inspect

def _verify(iface, candidate, tentative=False, vtype=None):
    """

    This involves:

      in which case this step is skipped). This means that the candidate's class

            # But how to get the interface's method's signature? Because interfaces don't have methods, they have attributes. So perhaps the interface's attributes are the ones that need to be checked. 

            # Wait, maybe the interface's attributes are the ones that are required. For example, if the interface has a method 'foo', then the candidate must have a method 'foo' with the correct signature. But how to get the signature from the interface? Since interfaces don't have methods, perhaps the function is supposed to check that the candidate's methods match the interface's methods in terms of parameters. 

            # Alternatively, perhaps the interface's methods are the ones that are declared, and the candidate must have those methods. But how to get the method's signature from the interface? Maybe the interface's __dict__ contains the method's signature as a function. 

            # This seems complicated. Maybe the code is supposed to check that the candidate's class has the same methods as the interface, and their signatures match. 

            # For example, if the interface has a method 'foo', then the candidate's class must have a method 'foo' with the same parameters. 

            # So, for each name in the interface, check if the candidate has a method with that name, and then compare the signature.

            # Let me think: in Zope interfaces, methods are declared as functions. So, for example, if an interface has a method 'foo', then the interface's __dict__ would have 'foo' as a function.

            # So, first, get the method from the interface. Then, get the method from the candidate's class. Then, check if the signatures match. 

            # But how to do that? Using inspect.signature.

        else:

    return True

Wait, but this code may not be correct. For example, the first check for providedBy may not be accurate. Also, the way to get the method from the interface may not be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the interface's methods are those that are declared as methods, and the candidate's class must have those methods. 

But perhaps the code should first check that the candidate provides the interface, then for each method in the interface, check if the candidate has a method with the same name and signature. 

But how to get the methods from the interface? Maybe using the interface's __dict__ and checking for callable entries. 

Another thing: the function may need to check that the candidate's class implements the interface, which could be done via zope.interface.implements. But I'm not sure. 

Also, the docstring says that the candidate may be a class that declares it implements the interface, or the candidate itself declares that it provides the interface. So, perhaps the first check is whether the candidate's class is an implementer of the interface. 

Wait, the first step says: "Making sure the candidate claims that it provides the interface using iface.providedBy (unless tentative is True, in which case this step is skipped)." 

Wait, maybe the iface.providedBy is a method that checks if the candidate provides the interface. So, for example, iface.providedBy(candidate) would return True if the candidate provides the interface. 

But in Zope, providedBy is a function that takes an object and returns the interfaces it provides. So, iface.providedBy(candidate) would check if the candidate provides the interface. 

So, the first check would be: if not tentative, then check if iface is in providedBy(candidate). 

But in the code, the function is called _verify, and it's supposed to verify that the candidate might correctly provide the interface. 

So, the code would start by importing the necessary modules. 

But the user didn't mention any imports, so I need to include them. 

So, the code would need to import zope.interface, inspect, and maybe other modules. 

But the user's code example may not include those, but the function is supposed to raise zope.interface.Invalid, so we need to import that. 

So, the code would start with:

from zope.interface import providedBy, Invalid
import inspect

Then, the function:

def _verify(iface, candidate, tentative=False, vtype=None):
    errors = []
    if not tentative:
        if iface not in providedBy(candidate):
            errors.append(f"Candidate does not provide the interface {iface}")
    else:
        pass  # Skip the check

    # Check all required attributes and methods
    for name in iface.names():
        if not hasattr(candidate, name):
            errors.append(f"Missing attribute/method {name} in candidate")

    # Check method signatures
    for name in iface.names():
        if not hasattr(candidate, name):
            continue  # Already checked above
        if not inspect.ismethod(getattr(candidate, name)):
            continue  # Not a method, skip signature check
        # Get the method from the interface? Wait, how?
        # Maybe the interface has the method as a function, so we can get it from the interface's __dict__
        interface_method = getattr(iface, name, None)
        if not callable(interface_method):
            continue  # Not a method in the interface, so no need to check
        candidate_method = getattr(candidate, name)
        try:
            sig_iface = inspect.signature(interface_method)
            sig_candidate = inspect.signature(candidate_method)
            if sig_iface != sig_candidate:
                errors.append(f"Method {name} has incorrect signature")
        except Exception as e:
            errors.append(f"Error checking signature for {name}: {e}")

    if errors:
        if len(errors) == 1:
            raise Invalid(errors[0])
        else:
            raise Invalid('\n'.join(errors))
    return True

Wait, but the code for checking the method signatures may not be correct. Because the interface's method may not be a method in the candidate's class. Also, the candidate may have a method with the same name but different parameters. 

But the code above checks if the candidate has the method, then gets the method from the interface. However, the interface's method may not be a method in the candidate's class. Wait, no. Because the candidate is supposed to provide the interface, so the methods should be present. 

But the first check (providedBy) ensures that the candidate provides the interface, which implies that it has all the required methods and attributes. But maybe that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the providedBy check is just a preliminary step, and the actual verification is done by checking the presence of methods and attributes. 

But the docstring says that the first step is to check that the candidate claims to provide the interface. So, the code should first check that. 

Another thing: the function may need to check that the candidate's class is an implementer of the interface. For example, if the candidate is a class decorated with @implementer(iface), then it provides the interface. 

But how to check that? The providedBy function would return the interfaces provided by the candidate. So, if the candidate is a class, then providedBy(candidate) would return the interfaces that the class provides. 

But perhaps the candidate is an instance, and providedBy(candidate) would return the interfaces that the instance provides. 

So, the first check is whether the candidate provides the interface. 

Then, for each name in the interface, check if the candidate has that attribute or method. 

But how to get the names of the interface? iface.names() returns all the names in the interface. 

So, the code would iterate over all names in the interface. 

But then, for each name, check if the candidate has that attribute. 

But in the case of methods, we also need to check their signatures. 

But the code above checks for methods by seeing if the candidate's attribute is a method. 

But the problem is that the interface may have methods and attributes, and the candidate must have both. 

Wait, the docstring says "necessary methods" and "necessary attributes", so both are required. 

So, for each name in the interface, check if the candidate has that attribute. 

But for methods, we also need to check their signature. 

But how to get the method from the interface? Because interfaces don't have methods, they have attributes that are functions. 

So, perhaps the code should check if the attribute in the interface is a method, and then compare the signatures. 

So, for each name in the interface:

- Check if the candidate has the attribute. If not, add error.
- If the attribute is a method, check the signature. 

But how to determine if the attribute in the interface is a method? Using inspect.isfunction on the interface's attribute. 

So, modifying the code:

for name in iface.names():
    if not hasattr(candidate, name):
        errors.append(f"Missing attribute/method {name} in candidate")
    else:
        # Check if it's a method
        attr = getattr(candidate, name)
        if inspect.ismethod(attr) or inspect.isfunction(attr):
            # Get the method from the interface
            interface_attr = getattr(iface, name, None)
            if not callable(interface_attr):
                continue  # Not a method in the interface, so no need to check
            # Compare signatures
            try:
                sig_iface = inspect.signature(interface_attr)
                sig_candidate = inspect.signature(attr)
                if sig_iface != sig_candidate:
                    errors.append(f"Method {name} has incorrect signature")
            except Exception as e:
                errors.append(f"Error checking signature for {name}: {e}")

But this may not be correct. Because the interface's attribute may not be a method. For example, if the interface has a property, then it's not a method. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check for all attributes and methods in the interface, and ensure that the candidate has them. 

But the problem is that the interface may have attributes that are not methods, and the candidate may have them as attributes. 

But the docstring says "necessary methods" and "necessary attributes", so both are required. 

So, the code would check for all attributes and methods in the interface. 

But how to differentiate between attributes and methods in the interface? 

Maybe the code should check for all attributes in the interface, and for each, ensure that the candidate has that attribute. Then, for each method in the interface, check that the candidate has a method with the same name and signature. 

But how to get the methods from the interface? 

Perhaps the code can check for each name in the interface if it's a method (i.e., callable). 

So, the code would:

for name in iface.names():
    if not hasattr(candidate, name):
        errors.append(...)
    else:
        attr = getattr(candidate, name)
        if inspect.ismethod(attr) or inspect.isfunction(attr):
            # Check signature
            interface_attr = getattr(iface, name, None)
            if not callable(interface_attr):
                continue
            # Compare signatures
            try:
                sig_iface = inspect.signature(interface_attr)
                sig_candidate = inspect.signature(attr)
                if sig_iface != sig_candidate:
                    errors.append(...)
            except:
                errors.append(...)

But this approach may not work because the interface's attribute may not be a method. For example, if the interface has a property, then it's not a method. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should check for all attributes and methods in the interface, and for each, check if the candidate has them. 

But perhaps the code should check that all the attributes and methods required by the interface are present in the candidate. 

But how to get the list of required attributes and methods? The iface.names() gives all the names, including both. 

So, the code would first check that all names are present as attributes in the candidate. Then, for those that are methods, check their signatures. 

But in the code, the candidate may have the attribute as a method, but the interface may have it as a property. 

So, perhaps the code should check that the candidate has the attribute, regardless of whether it's a method or not. Then, for methods, check the signature. 

But how to determine if the attribute is a method? 

Alternatively, maybe the code should check that for each name in the interface, the candidate has that name as an attribute, and if it's a method, then check the signature. 

So, the code would proceed as follows:

- Check if the candidate provides the interface (unless tentative).
- For each name in the interface:
   - Check if the candidate has the attribute. If not, add error.
   - If the attribute is a method, check its signature against the interface's method's signature. 

But how to get the interface's method's signature? Because the interface may have a method declared as a function. 

Wait, in Zope interfaces, methods are declared as functions. For example, if an interface has a method 'foo', then iface.foo is a function. 

So, for each name in the interface, if the interface has a function (method), then the candidate must have a function with the same name and signature. 

But the candidate could have a method (like a function in a class) or a standalone function. 

But the candidate is probably a class, so the code would check the class's methods. 

So, the code would check for each name in iface.names():

- If the interface has a method (i.e., the attribute is a function), then check if the candidate's class has a method with the same name and signature. 

But how to get the method from the interface? 

So, for the code:

interface_method = getattr(iface, name, None)
if callable(interface_method):
    # Check if candidate has a method with the same name
    candidate_method = getattr(candidate.__class__, name, None)
    if not callable(candidate_method):
        errors.append(...)
    else:
        # Compare signatures
        try:
            sig_iface = inspect.signature(interface_method)
            sig_candidate = inspect.signature(candidate_method)
            if sig_iface != sig_candidate:
                errors.append(...)
        except:
            errors.append(...)

But this would only check the methods in the interface, not the attributes. 

Wait, the docstring says to check for both methods and attributes. So, perhaps the code should check for all attributes in the interface, and for each, ensure that the candidate has that attribute. 

But how to differentiate between attributes and methods? 

Maybe the code should check all attributes and methods in the interface. For example, for each name in iface.names():

- Check if the candidate has the attribute. If not, error.
- If the attribute is a method, check its signature. 

But how to check if the attribute is a method? Using inspect.ismethod or inspect.isfunction. 

So, the code would:

for name in iface.names():
    if not hasattr(candidate, name):
        errors.append(...)
    else:
        attr = getattr(candidate, name)
        if inspect.ismethod(attr) or inspect.isfunction(attr):
            # Check if the interface has a method with the same name
            interface_attr = getattr(iface, name, None)
            if not callable(interface_attr):
                continue  # Not a method in the interface, so no need to check
            # Compare signatures
            try:
                sig_iface = inspect.signature(interface_attr)
                sig_candidate = inspect.signature(attr)
                if sig_iface != sig_candidate:
                    errors.append(...)
            except:
                errors.append(...)

But this may not be correct. For example, if the interface has a method, but the candidate has a method with the same name but different parameters, then the signature check would fail. 

But how to handle the case where the interface has a method and the candidate has a method with the same name but different parameters? 

This approach would work. 

Now, considering the versionchanged note: if multiple errors, collect all and raise them. 

So, the code should collect all errors, then raise Invalid with all of them. 

But the code as written would collect all errors, and then raise Invalid with them. 

Now, the function also has a vtype parameter, which is not used in the current code. The docstring says "vtype=None" but doesn't explain what it is. Maybe it's a type check? Like, ensuring that the candidate's type matches vtype. 

But the user hasn't provided any details about vtype. The original docstring says "iface.providedBy" which is part of the first check. So, perhaps vtype is not used here, or maybe it's a parameter for future use. 

Since the user hasn't specified what vtype is, maybe the code doesn't need to use it. But the function signature includes it. 

So, the code may have to handle vtype. But since it's not mentioned in the steps, perhaps it's an optional parameter that's not used here. 

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't mention vtype, so maybe it's not used. 

So, the code can ignore vtype for now. 

Putting it all together, the code would:

- Import necessary modules.
- Check providedBy if not tentative.
- Check all names in the interface are present in the candidate.
- For each method in the interface, check the signature.
- Collect errors and raise Invalid accordingly.

But I'm not sure if the code is correct. For example, in the first step, if the candidate is a class, then providedBy(candidate) would return the interfaces that the class provides. 

But perhaps the code should check if the candidate's class is an implementer of the interface. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to check that the candidate is an instance of a class that provides the interface. 

But regardless, the code as per the docstring would check if the candidate provides the interface. 

So, the code would proceed as follows. 

Now, the code may need to handle the case where the candidate is a class or an instance. 

But the function is called _verify, so perhaps it's part of a system where candidate is an object. 

Another thing: the code should check that the candidate defines all necessary methods and attributes. 

But how to get the necessary methods and attributes? The interface's names() method returns all the names, including methods and attributes. 

So, the code would loop through all names in the interface, check if they are present in the candidate. 

But then, for methods, check their signatures. 

So, the code would be:

import inspect
from zope.interface import providedBy, Invalid

def _verify(iface, candidate, tentative=False, vtype=None):
    errors = []
    if not tentative:
        if iface not in providedBy(candidate):
            errors.append(f"Candidate does not provide the interface {iface}")
    else:
        pass  # Skip the check

    for name in iface.names():
        if not hasattr(candidate, name):
            errors.append(f"Missing attribute/method {name} in candidate")

    # Check method signatures
    for name in iface.names():
        if not hasattr(candidate, name):
            continue
        attr = getattr(candidate, name)
        if inspect.ismethod(attr) or inspect.isfunction(attr):
            interface_attr = getattr(iface, name, None)
            if not callable(interface_attr):
                continue
            try:
                sig_iface = inspect.signature(interface_attr)
                sig_candidate = inspect.signature(attr)
                if sig_iface != sig_candidate:
                    errors.append(f"Method {name} has incorrect signature")
            except Exception as e:
                errors.append(f"Error checking signature for {name}: {e}")

    if errors:
        if len(errors) == 1:
            raise Invalid(errors[0])
        else:
            raise Invalid('\n'.join(errors))
    return True

But this code may have some issues. For example, if the candidate is a class, then providedBy(candidate) would return the interfaces provided by the class. 

But also, the code may need to check that the candidate's class is an implementer of the interface. 

Wait, the first step says that the candidate claims to provide the interface using iface.providedBy. But iface.providedBy is a function that checks if an object provides the interface. So, the code is checking if the candidate provides the interface. 

But if the candidate is a class, then providedBy(candidate) would return the interfaces that the class provides. 

But perhaps the code should check that the candidate's class is an implementer of the interface. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should check that the candidate's class is registered as providing the interface. 

But I think the code as written is correct based on the docstring. 

Another thing: the code may need to check that the candidate's class is an implementer of the interface. For example, if the candidate is a class, then it should be decorated with @implementer(iface). 

But how to check that? Maybe by checking if the class is in the providedBy list of the candidate. 

Wait, the code already checks that the candidate provides the interface. So, if the candidate is a class, then providedBy(candidate) would return the interfaces that the class provides. 

So, the code is correct. 

But what about the vtype parameter? The docstring doesn't mention it, so perhaps it's not used. 

So, the code can ignore it. 

Now, the code may need to collect all errors, including those from the first check. 

But the first check is only done if tentative is False. 

So, the code seems to cover the steps mentioned. 

But the problem is that the code may raise Invalid with all the collected errors. 

But the docstring says that if multiple errors, collect them and report. So, the code does that. 

But in the case where only one error is present, it's raised alone. 

So, the code is correct. 

Another possible issue: the providedBy check may not be sufficient. For example, if the candidate is an instance of a class that provides the interface, then providedBy(candidate) would include the interface. 

But the code is correct. 

So, the final code would be as follows.
