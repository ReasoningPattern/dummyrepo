Okay, I need to generate Python code for the make_parsers function based on the given docstring. The docstring says it builds a top-level parser and its subparsers and returns them as a tuple. Let me think about how to structure this.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. Since it's about command-line parsing, argparse is the right choice. So I'll start with import argparse.

Next, the function make_parsers should create the main parser. Let's initialize it with argparse.ArgumentParser. Maybe add a description to make it clear.

Then, the docstring mentions subparsers. So I need to add subparsers to the main parser. Using add_subparsers() method. Let me create a subparsers object and set its help message.

Wait, the function needs to return the main parser and the subparsers as a tuple. So after creating them, I'll return (parser, subparsers).

But wait, the standard way is to have the main parser and then subparsers. Let me make sure I structure that correctly. The main parser is created first, then subparsers are added via main_parser.add_subparsers(). So the code would be:

def make_parsers():
    import argparse
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Main parser')
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command', help='Available commands')
    return parser, subparsers

Wait, but maybe the user expects more specific subparsers? The docstring doesn't mention any specific commands, so perhaps this is a generic setup. The code above creates the main parser and adds subparsers with a destination 'command' and help message. That seems right. Let me check if there's anything else needed. The function is supposed to return the tuple of parser and subparsers. Yes, that's covered. I think this should work. Let me make sure there are no syntax errors. The import is inside the function, which is allowed. The return statement returns the two objects. Looks good.
