Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function _normalizeargs based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring mentions that the function normalizes declaration arguments, which might include Declarations, tuples, or single interfaces. The key point is that anything except individual interfaces or implement specs will be expanded.

First, I need to understand what "normalize" means here. The docstring says that the function expands anything but individual interfaces or implements. So, maybe the function is supposed to process a sequence of arguments and flatten them if they are tuples or other iterable structures, while leaving individual interfaces or implement specs as they are.

Wait, the parameters are sequence and output. The output is optional. So perhaps the function is designed to take a sequence (like a list or tuple) and normalize it into a list, expanding any nested sequences except for certain cases. But the docstring says that individual interfaces or implements specs are not expanded. Hmm, maybe the function is part of a system where declarations can be in various forms, and the goal is to flatten them into a list of interfaces or specs.

Let me think about possible scenarios. If the input is a single interface or implement spec, it's returned as is. If it's a tuple or list, it's expanded. But how to distinguish between a single interface and a tuple? Maybe the function checks if the input is an iterable. But the docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So perhaps the function is supposed to recursively flatten the sequence, but stop at certain elements.

Wait, the function's name is _normalizeargs, so maybe it's a helper function. Let me consider the possible implementation. The function takes a sequence and an output parameter. The output could be a list that accumulates the normalized elements.

So, the approach might be: if the input is not a sequence (like a single interface), add it to the output. If it is a sequence, iterate through each element and recursively normalize them. But the docstring says that tuples and single interfaces are allowed. Wait, the first sentence says "Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces." So maybe the function is supposed to handle cases where the arguments are a mix of these types.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to take a sequence (like a list or tuple) and normalize it by expanding any nested sequences into flat lists. For example, if the input is a list containing a tuple and another list, it should flatten them all into a single list. But the docstring says that individual interfaces or implement specs are not expanded. So maybe the function is designed to process arguments that could be a single interface, a tuple of arguments, or a list of interfaces. The normalization would flatten any nested sequences, but leave individual elements (like single interfaces) as they are.

But how to determine what's an interface or implement spec? Maybe those are specific objects, like instances of a class. So the function would check if an element is an instance of such a class, and if not, expand it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle the case where the input is a single element (like a single interface) or a sequence (like a tuple or list) of elements. If it's a sequence, it's expanded into individual elements, but if it's a single element, it's kept as is. However, the docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So perhaps the function is designed to expand sequences, but not individual interfaces or specs.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a sequence (like a list or tuple) and normalize it by expanding any nested sequences into flat lists. For example, if the input is a list containing a tuple, it would expand the tuple into individual elements. But if the input is a single interface (not a sequence), it's added as is. However, the output parameter is optional, which might suggest that the function is supposed to accumulate results into the output list.

Let me think of possible code structure. The function could check if the input is an iterable (like a list or tuple). If it is, then it iterates through each element and recursively normalizes them. If not, it adds the element to the output list. But the docstring says that individual interfaces or implement specs are not expanded. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the element is an interface or implement spec, and if so, not expand it. Otherwise, expand it.

But since the user hasn't provided specific definitions for Declarations, interfaces, or implement specs, I have to make assumptions. Maybe in this context, Declarations are objects that are not sequences, and tuples or lists are sequences that need to be expanded. So the function would process the sequence, and for each element, if it's a sequence (like tuple or list), expand it, else add it to the output.

Wait, the function's name is _normalizeargs, which suggests that it's normalizing arguments. So perhaps the function is meant to take a sequence of arguments (like a list or tuple) and flatten them into a list. For example, if the input is a list containing a tuple, it would expand the tuple into individual elements. But if the input is a single element (not a sequence), it's added as is. However, the docstring says that individual interfaces or implement specs are not expanded. So maybe the function is supposed to leave those as they are, but expand other sequences.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where the arguments can be a mix of different types, and the normalization process is to ensure that all arguments are in a flat list. So, for example, if the input is a tuple, it's expanded into individual elements. If it's a single interface, it's kept as is. But if the input is a list, it's also expanded. Wait, but the docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So perhaps the function is supposed to expand any elements that are not individual interfaces or specs. But how to check that?

This is a bit ambiguous. Let's think of possible code. The function could take a sequence and an output list. If the sequence is not an iterable (like a single element), add it to the output. If it is an iterable, then for each element in the sequence, recursively call _normalizeargs. But the docstring says that individual interfaces or implement specs are not expanded. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the element is an instance of a certain class (like Interface or Implements), and if not, expand it.

But without knowing the exact classes, perhaps the function is intended to handle sequences and flatten them. Let me consider that the function is supposed to take a sequence (like a list or tuple) and return a list of all elements, expanding any nested sequences. For example:

If the input is [A, (B, C), D], then the normalized args would be [A, B, C, D].

But if the input is a single interface, like A, then it's returned as is. However, the output parameter is optional. Maybe the function is designed to accumulate the results into the output list, which is passed in. So the function would modify the output list in place.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a new list. But the presence of an output parameter suggests that it's modifying an existing list. So maybe the function is designed to be used with an output list, appending elements to it.

Let me try to draft code. The function could check if the input is an iterable. If it's not, add it to the output. If it is, iterate through each element and recursively call the function. But wait, the output is a parameter, so maybe the function is supposed to build the output list. Let me think of the code:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    if not isinstance(sequence, (list, tuple)):
        output.append(sequence)
    else:
        for item in sequence:
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
    return output

But that would flatten any list or tuple. However, the docstring says that individual interfaces or implement specs are not expanded. So maybe the function should not expand if the element is an interface or implement spec. But how to check that? Maybe the function is supposed to check if the element is an instance of a specific class, like Interface or Implements.

But since the user hasn't provided those classes, perhaps the function is supposed to handle any sequence, but if the element is not a sequence, it's added as is. Wait, but the docstring says that the arguments might contain Declarations, tuples, or single interfaces. So maybe the function is supposed to process a sequence, and for each element, if it's a Declaration (or something else), it's added as is. Otherwise, if it's a sequence, it's expanded.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to normalize the arguments by expanding any nested sequences into flat lists. For example, if the input is a list or tuple, it's expanded into individual elements. But if the input is a single element (like an interface), it's kept as is.

But the function's name is _normalizeargs, which might imply that it's handling arguments for a declaration. So perhaps the function is part of a system where declarations can be passed as single elements or as sequences, and the function is supposed to flatten them.

In the absence of specific information about Declarations, interfaces, or implement specs, perhaps the function is intended to flatten any sequence into a list, but leave non-sequence elements as they are. So, for example, if the input is a tuple, it's converted into a list of its elements. If the input is a list, it's also expanded. But if the input is a single element (not a sequence), it's added as is.

But the docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So maybe the function is supposed to expand sequences, but not individual interfaces or specs. So if the input is a sequence, expand it. If it's an individual interface or spec, leave it as is.

Wait, perhaps the function is designed to take a sequence (like a list or tuple) and normalize it by expanding any nested sequences. For example, if the input is a list containing a tuple, it would expand the tuple into individual elements. But if the input is a single interface, it's added as is. So the function would recursively process each element.

So the code would look something like this:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """
    Normalize declaration arguments

    Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
    interfaces.

    Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.
    """
    if output is None:
        output = []
    if not isinstance(sequence, (list, tuple)):
        output.append(sequence)
    else:
        for item in sequence:
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
    return output

But then, if the input is a single interface, it's added to the output. If it's a tuple or list, it's expanded. However, the docstring says that the function is supposed to normalize arguments that might contain Declarations, tuples, or single interfaces. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle cases where the arguments could be a mix of these types.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a sequence (like a list or tuple) and normalize it by expanding any nested sequences. But if the element is a Declaration or an implement spec, it's not expanded. So, the function would check if the element is a Declaration or implement spec, and if so, add it directly. Otherwise, if it's a sequence, expand it.

But again, without knowing what a Declaration or implement spec is, it's hard to code. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle sequences and flatten them, but if the element is not a sequence, it's added as is. That would make sense. So the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """
    Normalize declaration arguments

    Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
    interfaces.

    Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.
    """
    if output is None:
        output = []
    if not isinstance(sequence, (list, tuple)):
        output.append(sequence)
    else:
        for item in sequence:
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
    return output

But then, if the input is a single element (like an interface), it's added to the output. If it's a sequence, it's expanded. However, the docstring says that "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So perhaps the function is supposed to expand sequences, but not individual interfaces. So the code would be as above.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a sequence and return a list of all elements, expanding any nested sequences. For example, if the input is a list containing a tuple, it would expand the tuple into individual elements. But if the input is a single element (not a sequence), it's added as is. So the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """

    interfaces.

    """
    if output is None:
        output = []
    if not isinstance(sequence, (list, tuple)):
        output.append(sequence)
    else:
        for item in sequence:
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
    return output

But this code would flatten any list or tuple. For example, if the input is a list, it would expand into individual elements. If the input is a tuple, same thing. But if the input is a single element (like an interface), it's added as is.

But the docstring says that the arguments might contain Declarations, tuples, or single interfaces. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle cases where the input is a Declaration (which is not a sequence), a tuple, or a single interface. So the function would check if the input is a sequence (tuple or list), and if so, expand it. Otherwise, add it to the output.

This seems plausible. So the code would recursively process each element. For example, if the input is a list, each element is processed. If an element is a tuple, it's expanded. If it's a Declaration, it's added as is.

But how to handle the output parameter? The function could be designed to accumulate results into the output list. So if the output is provided, it appends to it; otherwise, it creates a new list.

So the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """
    Normalize declaration arguments

    Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
    interfaces.

    Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.
    """
    if output is None:
        output = []
    if not isinstance(sequence, (list, tuple)):
        output.append(sequence)
    else:
        for item in sequence:
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
    return output

But then, if the input is a single element (not a sequence), it's added to the output. If it's a sequence, each item is processed recursively. This would flatten all sequences into a single list.

But the docstring says that "individual interfaces or implements specs" are not expanded. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the element is an interface or implement spec, and if so, not expand it. But without knowing what those are, perhaps the function is intended to handle sequences and flatten them, while leaving non-sequences as is.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a sequence of arguments and normalize them into a list, expanding any nested sequences. So the code would be as above.

Another possibility is that the function is supposed to handle the case where the arguments could be a single interface or a sequence of interfaces. So if the input is a single interface, return it as a list. If it's a sequence, expand it. But the docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So perhaps the function is supposed to expand sequences, but not individual interfaces.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a sequence (like a list or tuple) and return a list of all elements, expanding any nested sequences. For example, if the input is a list containing a tuple, it would expand the tuple into individual elements. But if the input is a single element (like an interface), it's added as is.

But the function's parameters are sequence and output. So maybe the function is designed to be called recursively, accumulating results into the output list. So the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    if not isinstance(sequence, (list, tuple)):
        output.append(sequence)
    else:
        for item in sequence:
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
    return output

This code would take a sequence (list or tuple) and recursively expand it into a flat list. If the input is not a sequence, it's added to the output. So for example, if the input is a list, each element is processed. If an element is a tuple, it's expanded. If it's a single interface, it's added as is.

But the docstring says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So maybe the function is supposed to expand sequences, but not individual interfaces. So the code above would do that.

But the function's name is _normalizeargs, which suggests that it's a helper function. So perhaps the function is intended to be used in a way that if the input is a sequence, it's expanded, otherwise, it's added as is. The output parameter is for accumulating results.

So the code would be as above. Let me test with some examples.

Example 1: _normalizeargs([1, 2, (3, 4)]) would return [1, 2, 3, 4].

Example 2: _normalizeargs(5) would return [5].

Example 3: _normalizeargs((6, 7)) would return [6, 7].

But what if the input is a Declaration object? Let's say Declaration is a class. Then, if the input is an instance of Declaration, it's added as is. So the code would work.

But the user's docstring says that the arguments might contain Declarations, tuples, or single interfaces. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle those cases. The code would treat any non-sequence as a single element, and sequences as being expanded.

So the code seems to fit. Therefore, the generated code would be as written above.

But the user said to output only the code in Python markdown format. So I need to write the function with that code, ensuring that the docstring is included.

Wait, the user provided the docstring, so I need to include that. The original function signature is:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """
    Normalize declaration arguments

    Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
    interfaces.

    Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.
    """
    # code here

So the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """
    Normalize declaration arguments

    Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
    interfaces.

    Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.
    """
    if output is None:
        output = []
    if not isinstance(sequence, (list, tuple)):
        output.append(sequence)
    else:
        for item in sequence:
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
    return output

But wait, the function is named _normalizeargs, and the docstring mentions "Declarions" (probably a typo for Declarations). Also, the code may need to handle other iterable types, like sets or generators. But the docstring says "tuples or single interfaces," so maybe only lists and tuples are considered sequences here.

So the code checks if the input is a list or tuple. If not, appends it. If it is, processes each item recursively. That seems to fit the description.

Therefore, the code should be as above.
