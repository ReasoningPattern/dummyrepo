Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called deprecated that issues a warning when a function or method is called. The user provided the function signature and a docstring, so I should follow that.

First, the decorator should be a function that takes a message argument. Then, it returns another function that can be used as a decorator. So the outer function is deprecated, which takes message, and the inner function is the actual decorator.

When the decorated function is called, it should print a warning message. The warning should include the message passed to the decorator and the name of the function being called. Also, I should make sure to include the docstring from the original function in the decorated one. Oh right, the inner function needs to have the same name as the original function, so I should use __name__ to get that.

Wait, how to handle the docstring? The inner function should have the same docstring as the original. So maybe I need to assign the original function's __doc__ to the inner function. But if the original function has a docstring, the decorator should preserve it. So in the inner function, I'll set __doc__ = original_func.__doc__.

Also, the warning message should mention that the function is deprecated. So when the user applies the decorator, like @deprecated("use new_function instead"), then when the function is called, it should warn with that message.

I should use the warnings module. The warning should be a DeprecationWarning. So in the inner function, when it's called, it will trigger a warning using warnings.warn.

Wait, but the user might want to have the message from the decorator and the function name. So the message should be formatted to include both. Like, "Function {name} is deprecated. {message}".

So putting it all together: the deprecated function returns a decorator that, when applied to a function, creates a new function that when called, issues a DeprecationWarning with the message and the function's name.

Let me structure the code. The outer function deprecated takes message. The inner function is the decorator. It takes a function, then defines a new function that when called, issues the warning and then calls the original function.

Wait, but the inner function needs to have the same name as the original. So maybe the inner function should be called with the original function's name. Oh right, the decorator is applied to a function, so the inner function is the one that's called when the decorator is used. So the inner function should take the original function as an argument, then return a new function that wraps it.

So the code would look like this:

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        def new_func(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(f"Function {func.__name__} is deprecated. {message}", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        new_func.__doc__ = func.__doc__
        return new_func
    return decorator

Wait, but the user might want to have the message as part of the warning. So the message passed to the decorator is included in the warning. Also, the stacklevel=2 is to point the warning to the caller, not the decorator itself.

But I need to make sure that the new_func has the same docstring as the original function. So assigning new_func.__doc__ = func.__doc__ would do that.

Also, the original function's name is preserved in new_func.__name__.

But wait, when you use a decorator, the __name__ attribute of the function can be overwritten. So to preserve the original name, maybe I should set new_func.__name__ = func.__name__ as well. But the user's docstring says that the decorator is for deprecating functions and methods, so maybe that's necessary.

Wait, the user's example in the docstring might not include that, but it's better practice to preserve the original function's name and docstring. So in the new_func, set __name__ and __doc__ to the original's.

But in Python, when you use a decorator, the __name__ is often changed. So to prevent that, the decorator should assign the original function's name and docstring to the new function.

So in the code, inside the decorator function, after defining new_func, set new_func.__name__ = func.__name__ and new_func.__doc__ = func.__doc__.

Wait, but in the code above, the new_func is defined inside the decorator, which is inside the deprecated function. So when the decorator is applied, the new_func will have the __name__ and __doc__ of the original function.

Wait, no. Because when you define new_func inside the decorator, it's a nested function. By default, the __name__ of new_func would be 'new_func', but if we assign new_func.__name__ = func.__name__, then it would take the original function's name.

So yes, that's needed. Otherwise, the function's name would be changed, which might be confusing.

So the code should include that.

Also, the message parameter is passed to the deprecated function, which is then used in the warning message. So the user can provide a custom message when applying the decorator.

Testing this: if someone writes @deprecated("use new_function instead"), then when the function is called, it will warn with that message.

So putting all that together, the code should be:

import warnings

def deprecated(message):
    """
    Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def new_func(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(f"Function {func.__name__} is deprecated. {message}", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        new_func.__name__ = func.__name__
        new_func.__doc__ = func.__doc__
        return new_func
    return decorator

Wait, but the user didn't mention importing warnings. But the code will need to import it. So I should include that.

But the user's code might not have it, so the generated code should include the necessary import.

So the code starts with importing warnings, then defines the deprecated function.

Yes. That's the correct approach. So the final code would be as above.

But let me check: when the decorator is applied, the new_func is the one that's called. So when the user calls the decorated function, the warning is issued, then the original function is executed.

Also, stacklevel=2 is used so that the warning points to the caller, not the decorator itself. That's a good practice.

So this should meet the requirements. The user didn't specify any other parameters, so the code is straightforward.
