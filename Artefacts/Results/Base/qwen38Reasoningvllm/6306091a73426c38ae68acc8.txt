Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called list_of_file_names, and it takes two parameters: settings_dirs and spec_option. The docstring says to create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

Wait, the docstring mentions using cli.ListOfFileNames(), but the function name is list_of_file_names. Maybe that's a typo or a mistake. Let me check again. Oh, right, the function is supposed to return an IniType complex type, but the docstring says to use cli.ListOfFileNames(). Hmm, perhaps the user intended to reference a class or function from a module called cli?

But the problem is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. The user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, just the docstring. So I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So maybe the function is supposed to call a method from the cli module named ListOfFileNames, which returns an IniType object?

But the function's name is list_of_file_names, which might be a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the function to generate a list of file names based on the settings_dirs and spec_option, and then create an IniType from that list. However, the docstring isn't very clear. 

Since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation logic, I need to make some assumptions. Let's think: the function's parameters are settings_dirs (probably a list of directories) and spec_option (maybe a specification option). The goal is to create a list of file names, perhaps by scanning those directories for files matching a certain spec, and then return an IniType object constructed from that list.

But without knowing what IniType is or how cli.ListOfFileNames() works, it's a bit tricky. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So maybe the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with the provided parameters and return the result. 

Wait, the docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So perhaps the function is supposed to instantiate an object of type IniType using the cli module's ListOfFileNames method. But how? Maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes settings_dirs and spec_option and returns an IniType instance. 

So the code would be something like:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But I need to make sure that the parameters are passed correctly. However, the user might have intended that the function constructs the IniType object. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names and then create an IniType from that list. 

But given the lack of details, the safest assumption is that the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames with the provided parameters and return the result. So the code would be as simple as that. 

Wait, but the function name is list_of_file_names, and the docstring says to create an IniType via cli.ListOfFileNames(). Maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names and then use that to create an IniType. However, without knowing the specifics of IniType's constructor, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant that the function returns a list of file names, but the docstring says IniType. But the user's instruction is to follow the given docstring. 

So, given the ambiguity, I think the correct approach is to implement the function as per the docstring's instruction. The function's name might be a typo, but the user might have intended that it returns an IniType object created by cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

Therefore, the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. However, the user hasn't provided any more details, so this is the best I can do. Also, the user mentioned not to include any explanations, just the code. So I should output that.
