Okay, I need to write a Python function called regex_dict that takes a dictionary and converts its keys from filenames with wildcards into regex patterns. The values should stay the same. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should process each key in the input dictionary. The keys are filenames that might have wildcards like * or ?. So, I need to replace those wildcards with their regex equivalents. I remember that in regex, * matches zero or more of the preceding element, but in filename wildcards, * matches any sequence of characters. So, to convert a filename wildcard to regex, I should replace * with .* and ? with ., but also make sure to escape any existing regex characters in the filename. Wait, but maybe the original keys have other regex characters that should be treated as literals? Or maybe the wildcards are only * and ?, and other characters are meant to be literals. The problem says "convert only the keys into equivalent regexes", so perhaps the function should replace * and ? with their regex counterparts, but leave other characters as is. However, I need to ensure that any existing regex metacharacters in the original key are properly escaped so that they are treated as literals.

So the steps are: for each key in the input dict, convert it to a regex pattern by replacing * with .* and ? with ., and escape any other special regex characters. Then, the value remains unchanged.

Wait, but how to handle the escaping? For example, if a key has a . in it, that's a literal dot in the filename, but in regex it's a special character. So, the function should escape all characters except * and ? which are replaced. So, the plan is: take each key, escape all characters except * and ?, then replace * with .* and ? with ., and then compile it into a regex pattern. But wait, maybe the original keys are meant to be treated as simple patterns, and the function should convert them into regex patterns that match the same files. So, for example, "file*.cpp" becomes "file.*\.cpp"? Wait, no. Wait, the original key is a filename with wildcards. So, when converting to regex, the * should match any sequence of characters, and ? should match any single character. So, the conversion would be: replace * with .* and ? with ., and then escape the entire string to treat all other characters as literals. But wait, maybe the original key's * and ? are the only wildcards, and other characters are literals. So, the function needs to escape all characters except * and ?, which are replaced by their regex equivalents.

Wait, but the problem says "convert only the keys into equivalent regexes". So perhaps the keys are patterns like "file*.cpp" and we need to convert them into regex patterns that match the same files. So, for example, "file*.cpp" would become "file.*\.cpp"? Or maybe not. Let me think: the original key is a filename pattern. So, when converting to regex, the * should be replaced with .* and ? with ., but also, the entire pattern should be treated as a regex. However, the original key might have other characters that are not wildcards but are regex special characters. For example, if a key is "file[1-9].cpp", then the [1-9] is a regex character, but in the original key, it's part of a filename pattern. Wait, but the problem says that the keys are filenames with wildcards. So maybe the wildcards are only * and ?, and other characters are literals. However, to be safe, perhaps the function should escape all characters except * and ?, which are replaced. Or maybe the function should treat the entire key as a regex pattern, but replace the * and ? with their equivalents. Wait, the docstring says "convert only the keys into equivalent regexes", so maybe the keys are intended to be simple filename patterns, and the function should convert them into regex patterns that match those filenames. For example, "file*.cpp" becomes "file.*\.cpp"? Or maybe not. Let me think: in regex, the . matches any character, so if the original key is "file*.cpp", then the * is a wildcard for any number of characters. So, to convert that to regex, we need to replace * with .* and ? with ., but also ensure that the rest of the characters are treated as literals. So, for example, the key "file?test.cpp" would become "file.test.cpp" (since ? becomes .). But if the key has a . in it, like "file.test.cpp", then that . is a literal, but in regex it's a special character. So, to make sure that the original key's characters are treated as literals except for * and ?, we need to escape all other characters.

Wait, but maybe the original keys are not regex patterns, but simple filename patterns using * and ?. So, the function's job is to convert those into regex patterns. For example, "file*.cpp" becomes "file.*\.cpp"? Or perhaps the function should replace * with .* and ? with ., but not escape other characters. But that could lead to issues if the original key has regex characters. However, the problem says "convert only the keys into equivalent regexes", which implies that the keys are intended to be treated as simple patterns, and the function should convert them into regex patterns that match the same files. So, perhaps the correct approach is to replace * with .* and ? with ., and then escape the entire string so that any other characters are treated as literals. Wait, no. Because if the original key has a . in it, that's a literal, but in regex it's a special character. So, to make sure that the . is treated as a literal, we need to escape it. So, the process would be: take the key, escape all characters except * and ?, then replace * with .* and ? with ., and then compile it into a regex.

Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to convert the wildcard patterns into regex patterns without escaping other characters. For example, if the key is "file*.cpp", then converting to regex would be "file.*\.cpp"? Or maybe not. Let me think again. Let's say the original key is "file*.cpp". The * is a wildcard for any number of characters. So, in regex, that would be "file.*\.cpp"? Wait, no. Because in regex, the . matches any character, and * matches zero or more of the preceding element. So, if the original key is "file*.cpp", then the * is a wildcard for any characters, so in regex, it should be replaced with .* but also, the entire pattern should be treated as a regex. However, if the original key is "file*.cpp", then the * is part of the pattern, so in regex, it's not a special character unless it's preceded by something. Wait, but in the original key, the * is a wildcard, so when converting to regex, we need to replace it with .* and ensure that the rest of the characters are treated as literals. So, the function should take each key, replace * with .* and ? with ., and then escape any other special regex characters. Wait, but maybe the original key's * and ? are the only wildcards, and other characters are literals. So, perhaps the function should escape all characters except * and ?, then replace * with .* and ? with ., and then compile the regex. But how to do that?

Let me think of an example. Suppose the key is "file*.cpp". The regex equivalent would be "file.*\.cpp"? Or "file.*\.cpp"? Wait, the original key's * is a wildcard for any characters, so in regex, it's replaced with .* and the . in the original key is a literal, so it should be escaped. So, the converted regex would be "file.*\.cpp". But if the original key is "file?test.cpp", then the ? is replaced with ., so the regex becomes "file.test.cpp". But if the original key has a . in it, like "file.test.cpp", then that . is a literal and should be escaped. So, the function needs to escape all characters except * and ?, then replace * with .* and ? with ., and then compile the regex.

So the steps for each key would be:

1. Escape all characters in the key except * and ?.
2. Replace * with .* and ? with .
3. Compile the resulting string into a regex pattern.

Wait, but how to escape the other characters? For example, if the key is "file[1-9].cpp", then the [1-9] is a regex character, but in the original key, it's part of a filename pattern. Wait, but the problem says that the keys are filenames with wildcards. So perhaps the original keys only use * and ? as wildcards, and other characters are literals. But to be safe, maybe the function should escape all characters except * and ?, so that any other regex special characters are treated as literals. For example, if a key is "file*.cpp", then the . in the original key is a literal, so in regex it should be escaped. So, the process would be:

Take the key string, escape all characters except * and ?, then replace * with .* and ? with ., and then compile that into a regex.

But how to do that in Python? Let's think. The re module has re.escape() which escapes all special characters. But if we use re.escape on the entire key, that would escape * and ?, which we don't want. So, perhaps we need to first escape all characters except * and ?, then replace * with .* and ? with .?

Alternatively, maybe the function should replace * with .* and ? with ., and then escape the rest. Wait, but if we first replace * and ? with their regex equivalents, then escape the rest, that might not be correct. For example, if the key is "file?test*cpp", then replacing ? with . and * with .* would give "file.test.*cpp", but then we need to escape any other special characters. Wait, but maybe the original key's * and ? are the only wildcards. So, the approach is:

For each key, replace * with .* and ? with ., and then escape the entire string. Wait, no. Because if you escape the entire string, then the * and ? would be escaped, which is not desired. So, perhaps the correct way is to first replace * and ? with their regex equivalents, then escape the rest of the characters. But how to do that?

Alternatively, we can process the key string by iterating through each character and replacing * and ? with their regex counterparts, and escaping all other characters. So, for each character in the key:

- If it's *, replace with .*
- If it's ?, replace with .
- Else, escape it.

But how to implement that? Let's think. For example, the key "file*.cpp" would become "file.*\.cpp". Wait, but the original key's * is a wildcard, so in regex, it's replaced with .* and the . in the original key is a literal, so it should be escaped. So, the function would process each character:

Original key: "file*.cpp"

Processing each character:

f -> f (escaped as \f? No, wait. Wait, if we escape all characters except * and ?, then the . would be escaped. So, for example, the original key's . is a literal, so in regex, it needs to be escaped. So, the process is:

Take the key string, and for each character:

- If it's a *, replace with .*
- If it's a ?, replace with .
- Else, escape the character.

Wait, but how to handle the * and ? in the string. For example, if the key is "file*test?cpp", then the * becomes .* and ? becomes ., but the other characters are escaped. So, the converted regex would be "file\*test\.cpp". Wait, no. Wait, the * and ? are replaced, but the other characters are escaped. So, the original key's * and ? are not escaped, but other characters are. So, the code would need to:

For each key in the input dictionary:

- Iterate through each character in the key.
- For each character:
   - if it's *, replace with .*
   - if it's ?, replace with .
   - else, escape the character.

Wait, but how to do that. Let's think. For example, the key "file?test*cpp" would be processed as follows:

Each character:

f → \f (escaped)
i → \i
l → \l
e → \e
? → .
t → \t
e → \e
s → \s
t → \t
* → .*
c → \c
p → \p
p → \p

So the resulting regex would be r"\f\e\l\e.test.\t\e\s\t.*\c\p\p".

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the original key's ? is replaced with ., and * is replaced with .*. But the other characters are escaped. So, the key "file?test*cpp" would become "file.test.*cpp" but with all other characters escaped. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the original key is "file?test*cpp". The ? is a wildcard, so it's replaced with ., and * is replaced with .*. The rest of the characters are literals. So, the regex would be "file.test.*cpp", but with the other characters escaped. Wait, but how? Because if you just replace * and ? and leave others as is, then the . in the original key would be a regex special character. So, perhaps the correct approach is to first escape all characters except * and ?, then replace * with .* and ? with .?

Wait, no. Let's think. Let's say the original key is "file*.cpp". The * is a wildcard, so in regex it's replaced with .*. The . in the original key is a literal, so it should be escaped. So, the correct regex would be "file.*\.cpp". So, the steps would be:

1. For each character in the key:
   a. If it's *, replace with .*
   b. If it's ?, replace with .
   c. Else, escape the character.

But how to do that in Python. For example, for each character in the key string, check if it's * or ?, and replace accordingly. Otherwise, escape it.

So, perhaps the code would look like this:

def regex_dict(item):
    new_dict = {}
    for key, value in item.items():
        # process key
        regex_key = ''
        for c in key:
            if c == '*':
                regex_key += '.*'
            elif c == '?':
                regex_key += '.'
            else:
                regex_key += re.escape(c)
        new_dict[regex_key] = value
    return new_dict

Wait, but that would replace each * with .* and each ? with ., and escape all other characters. Let me test this logic with some examples.

Example 1: key is "file*.cpp"

Processing each character:

f → re.escape('f') → 'f'

i → 'i'

l → 'l'

e → 'e'

* → '.*'

. → re.escape('.') → '\.'

c → 'c'

p → 'p'

p → 'p'

So the regex key would be "f ile.*\..cpp" → "file.*\.cpp". Which is correct.

Another example: key is "file?test"

Processing each character:

f → 'f'

i → 'i'

l → 'l'

e → 'e'

? → '.'

t → 't'

e → 'e'

s → 's'

t → 't'

So the regex key becomes "file.test".

Another example: key is "file[1-9].cpp"

Processing each character:

f → 'f'

i → 'i'

l → 'l'

e → 'e'

[ → re.escape('[') → '\['

1 → '1'

- → re.escape('-') → '\-'

9 → '9'

] → re.escape(']') → '\]'

. → re.escape('.') → '\.'

c → 'c'

p → 'p'

p → 'p'

So the regex key would be "file\[\1\-9\]\.cpp". Which would match "file[1-9].cpp" as a regex. But wait, the original key is a filename pattern. If the original key is "file[1-9].cpp", then the [1-9] is part of the filename pattern, but in regex, that's a character class. However, the problem says that the keys are filenames with wildcards, so maybe the [1-9] is not a wildcard but part of the filename. So, in that case, the function should treat it as a literal. Therefore, the code above would correctly escape all characters except * and ?, which are replaced.

But perhaps the original key's * and ? are the only wildcards, and other characters are literals. Therefore, the code should replace * and ? with their regex equivalents and escape all other characters.

But how to handle cases where the key has other regex special characters. For example, if the key is "file+test", then the + is a regex special character. But in the original key, it's part of the filename. So, the function should escape it. So, the code would replace + with \+.

So, the code above would do that.

But then, what about the original key's * and ?? For example, if the key is "file*test?", then the code would replace * with .* and ? with ., resulting in "file.*test.".

But wait, the original key's ? is a wildcard, so in regex, it's replaced with a single ., which matches any single character. So that's correct.

So, the code would process each key by replacing * with .* and ? with ., and escaping all other characters. That seems right.

But how to implement this in Python. The code would need to loop through each character in the key, check if it's * or ?, and replace accordingly. Otherwise, escape it.

So, the code would be:

import re

def regex_dict(item):
    """
    Convert *.cpp keys to regex keys.
    Given a dict where the keys are all filenames with wildcards,
    convert only the keys into equivalent regexes and leave the values intact.

    Args:
        item: dict to convert
    Returns:
        dict with keys converted to regexes
    """
    new_dict = {}
    for key, value in item.items():
        regex_key = ''
        for c in key:
            if c == '*':
                regex_key += '.*'
            elif c == '?':
                regex_key += '.'
            else:
                regex_key += re.escape(c)
        new_dict[regex_key] = value
    return new_dict

Wait, but what about cases where the key has multiple * or ?? For example, "file**.cpp" would become "file.*.*.cpp", which is correct because each * is replaced with .*.

But wait, in filename wildcards, ** can match any number of characters, but in regex, it's two .* which would match any two characters. Wait, no. In filename wildcards, * matches any number of characters, so "file**.cpp" would be equivalent to "file*.cpp" in terms of matching. But in regex, replacing each * with .* would result in "file.*.*.cpp", which would match "file" followed by any two characters, then .cpp. But that's not the same as the original wildcard. Wait, maybe the original key's * is a single wildcard, so replacing it with .* is correct. But if the key has multiple *s, like "**.cpp", then replacing each * with .* would result in ".*.*.cpp", which would match any string ending with .cpp, but with any characters in between. However, in filename wildcards, "**.cpp" would match any filename ending with .cpp, regardless of the number of characters before. So, the regex conversion would be correct.

But perhaps the original key's * and ? are the only wildcards, and the function is supposed to convert them into regex equivalents. So, the code above is correct.

But perhaps there's a better way. For example, using a translation table or a regex substitution. However, since the replacement for * is .* and for ? is ., and other characters need to be escaped, perhaps the code can be written with a loop as above.

But maybe there's a more efficient way. For example, using re.sub with a lambda function. Let's think. We can create a regex that matches * and ? and replace them, but also escape other characters. Wait, but how to do that. For example, using re.sub to replace each * with .* and each ? with ., but also escape other characters. However, that's not straightforward. Because re.sub would replace * and ? first, but then the other characters need to be escaped. Alternatively, perhaps we can first escape all characters, then replace * and ? with their regex equivalents. Wait, but that would escape * and ?, which is not desired. So, perhaps the correct approach is to first replace * and ? with their regex equivalents, then escape the rest. Wait, no. Because if you first replace * and ? and then escape the rest, you would escape the . which is part of the regex replacement. Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose the original key is "file*.cpp". Let's first replace * with .* and ? with ., then escape all other characters. But in this case, after replacement, the key becomes "file.*.cpp". Then, escape all other characters. Wait, but the . in the original key is now part of the regex. So, if we escape all other characters, then the . would be escaped. But that's not correct. Because the . in the original key is a literal, but after replacing * with .*, the . is part of the regex. So, perhaps the code should first replace * and ? with their regex equivalents, then escape the rest of the characters. But how?

Alternatively, the code can first escape all characters, then replace * and ? with their regex equivalents. Wait, but that would escape * and ?, which we don't want. For example, if the original key is "file*.cpp", then re.escape would turn it into "file\*.cpp", then replacing * with .* would result in "file.*.cpp". But that's not correct because the original * is a wildcard. So, the correct approach is to first process the key by replacing * and ? with their regex equivalents, and then escape the rest. Wait, but how to do that. Because if you replace * and ? first, then the other characters are not escaped. For example, if the key is "file?test", then replacing ? with . gives "file.test", but the other characters are not escaped. However, if the key has a . in it, like "file.test", then the . is a regex special character and should be escaped. So, the code would need to escape all characters except * and ?. Therefore, the code as written before is correct.

So, the code loops through each character, checks if it's * or ?, replaces accordingly, else escapes it. That seems right.

But then, the code would generate a regex pattern for each key. However, the function is supposed to return a dictionary with keys converted to regexes. So, the keys in the new dictionary are regex patterns, and the values are the same as before.

So, the code would be as follows. Also, need to import re.

Wait, but the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should be written as a function that takes a dict and returns a new dict with keys converted to regex patterns.

But perhaps there's a better way. For example, using a regex substitution. Let's think: for each key, we can create a regex by replacing * with .* and ? with ., and then escape all other characters. But how to do that. For example, using re.sub to replace * and ? with their equivalents, but also escape other characters. Wait, but that's not possible with a simple substitution. So, the loop approach is better.

So, the code would be:

import re

def regex_dict(item):
    """
    Convert *.cpp keys to regex keys.
    Given a dict where the keys are all filenames with wildcards,
    convert only the keys into equivalent regexes and leave the values intact.

    Returns:
        dict with keys converted to regexes
    """
    new_dict = {}
    for key, value in item.items():

        for c in key:
            if c == '*':
                regex_key += '.*'
            elif c == '?':
                regex_key += '.'
            else:
                regex_key += re.escape(c)
        new_dict[regex_key] = value
    return new_dict

But wait, the original key may have other characters that are not * or ?, but are regex special characters. For example, if the key is "file+test", then the + is a regex special character. So, in the regex, it should be escaped. The code above would escape it, which is correct.

Another example: key is "file[1-9].cpp". The code would escape [ and ] and the - as well, so the regex key becomes "file$$1-9$$\.cpp", which would match "file[1-9].cpp" as a regex. But in the original key, the [1-9] is part of the filename pattern. Wait, but the original key's [1-9] is not a wildcard. So, the function is supposed to convert the keys that have wildcards (like * and ?) into regex patterns. So, if the key has [1-9], that's part of the filename, not a wildcard. So, the code should treat it as a literal. Therefore, the code is correct.

But perhaps the problem expects that the keys are simple patterns with * and ? as wildcards, and other characters are literals. So, the code above is correct.

But let's test some cases.

Case 1: key is "file*.cpp" → regex key is "file.*\.cpp"

Case 2: key is "file?test" → regex key is "file.test"

Case 3: key is "file?test*" → regex key is "file.test.*"

Case 4: key is "file[1-9].cpp" → regex key is "file$$1-9$$\.cpp"

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the code should be as written. Now, the user wants the code generated, and they specified not to include any explanation, just the code. So, the code should be written with the function definition, import re, and the loop.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a dict with keys converted to regexes. So, the code is correct.

But what about the original key's * and ?? For example, if the key is "file*?test", then the code would replace * with .* and ? with ., resulting in "file.*.test".

Yes.

So, the code seems correct. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format. So, the code should be written with triple backticks.

But the user said to output only the code, no explanation. So, the code would be:

import re

def regex_dict(item):

        new_dict[regex_key] = value
    return new_dict

But wait, the function is supposed to convert the keys into regex patterns. However, the code above is building the regex pattern as a string, but not compiling it. The problem says to return a dict with keys converted to regexes. Wait, the docstring says "convert only the keys into equivalent regexes". So, perhaps the keys are regex patterns, but the function is supposed to return them as regex patterns. But the function is not compiling them into regex objects. It's just converting the keys into strings that represent regex patterns. So, the code is correct.

But maybe the user expects that the keys are converted into regex patterns, but the function returns a dictionary where the keys are regex strings. So, the code is correct.

So, the final code is as above. Now, I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted with the function signature and docstring, and that the code is written correctly.

Another thing to consider: the original keys may have other characters that are not * or ?, but are part of the filename. The code escapes them, which is correct.

Yes, this should work.
