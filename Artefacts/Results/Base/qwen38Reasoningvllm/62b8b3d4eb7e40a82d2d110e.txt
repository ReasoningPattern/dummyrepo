Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called _c_optimizations_ignored. The docstring says it should return True if the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable is not none and not 0, else False. 

First, I need to check how to access environment variables in Python. Oh right, using os.environ. So I'll import os.

Then, the function needs to check if "PURE_PYTHON" is present. Wait, the docstring says if the environ is not none. Wait, environment variables are accessed as strings. So maybe they mean if the variable is set and its value is not "0"?

Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. The docstring says "if get 'PURE_PYTHON' environ is not none and not 0". Hmm. So perhaps the function checks if the environment variable is set (i.e., exists and is not empty) and its value is not "0".

Wait, but in Python, os.environ.get returns None if the variable isn't set. So the first condition is checking if the variable is not None. Then, also checking that it's not equal to "0".

Wait, but maybe the user intended that the variable is set to a non-zero value. But the docstring says "not none and not 0". So, the function should return True only when PURE_PYTHON is set and its value is not "0".

Wait, but environment variables are strings. So the value is a string. So, the check would be: if the variable exists (i.e., os.environ.get('PURE_PYTHON') is not None) and the value is not "0", then return True. Otherwise, False.

So the code would be something like:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    """
    Return True if get "PURE_PYTHON" environ is not none and not 0, else return False
    """
    pure_python = os.environ.get('PURE_PYTHON')
    return pure_python is not None and pure_python != '0'

Wait, but maybe the user wants to check if the variable is set and its value is not 0 as an integer? But that's less likely. Because environment variables are strings. So comparing to '0' makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe they want to check if the variable is set to a non-zero value, but the docstring says "not none and not 0". So the code should check that the variable exists (not None) and that its value is not the string "0".

So that's the logic. So the code would be as above. Let me make sure I don't include any explanations, just the code. Also, the user said to output only the code in python markdown format. So the code should be written with triple backticks.

Wait, but the function is named _c_optimizations_ignored. Maybe the actual check is whether the variable is set to a non-zero value. But the docstring says "not none and not 0". So the code should check if the variable is present (not None) and its value is not "0".

Yes, that's the correct approach. So the code would be:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    """
    Return True if get "PURE_PYTHON" environ is not none and not 0, else return False
    """
    return os.environ.get('PURE_PYTHON') is not None and os.environ.get('PURE_PYTHON') != '0'

Wait, but getting the environment variable twice might be inefficient. But for code brevity, it's acceptable. Alternatively, we can store it in a variable.

But the user didn't specify any constraints on efficiency, so the code can be written as:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    """
    Return True if get "PURE_PYTHON" environ is not none and not 0, else return False
    """
    pure_python = os.environ.get('PURE_PYTHON')
    return pure_python is not None and pure_python != '0'

But the user wants the code generated, so I'll write that. Also, the function is supposed to return a boolean. That's covered.

Testing possible cases: if PURE_PYTHON is not set, returns False. If it's set to '0', returns False. If set to any other value, returns True.

Yes, that's correct. So the code should be as written.
