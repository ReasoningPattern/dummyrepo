Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called is_fill_compute_el. The function's purpose is to check if the given object's class has both 'fill' and 'compute' methods. 

First, I need to understand the function signature. The function takes an 'obj' parameter. The docstring says it checks whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods. Wait, so it's checking the class of the object, not the object itself. Because methods are part of the class, right? So even if the object has those methods, the function is checking the class.

So, the approach would be to check if the class of the object has both 'fill' and 'compute' methods. How do I check if a class has a method in Python? Well, I can use the hasattr() function. For example, hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') would check if the class has a 'fill' method. Similarly for 'compute'.

But wait, the function is called is_fill_compute_el. Maybe 'el' is a typo? Like, maybe it's supposed to be 'obj'? Or perhaps 'el' stands for something else. But the user provided the function signature as is, so I should stick with that. The parameter is 'obj', so the function is checking the object's class.

So the code would need to check if both 'fill' and 'compute' methods are present in the class of the given object. Let me think about possible edge cases. What if the object is None? Then obj.__class__ would raise an error. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that, so maybe we assume obj is a valid object.

So the code would be something like:

return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')

But wait, maybe the user wants to check if the object has those methods, not the class. But the docstring says "obj class has the fill and compute methods", so it's definitely the class.

So the function should return True if both methods exist in the class, else False. That's straightforward. Let me write that.

Wait, but in Python, methods are attributes of the class. So using hasattr on the class should work. So the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')

But maybe the user wants to check if the object instance has those methods. Like, if the methods are overridden in the instance. But the docstring says "obj class", so it's the class, not the instance. So the code is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to check if the object has those methods, but the docstring is a bit ambiguous. However, the function name is is_fill_compute_el, which might be a typo for is_fill_compute, but the user specified the signature, so I should follow that.

Another thing: what if the object is a class itself? Like, if obj is a class, not an instance. Then obj.__class__ would be type, which might not have those methods. But the function is supposed to check the class of the object, so if the object is a class, then its class is type. But the user probably expects that the object is an instance, and the function checks if its class has those methods.

So the code as written should work. Let me make sure there's no other way. For example, checking the methods of the class. But using hasattr is the simplest way.

So the final code is as above. Let me check again. The function returns True if both methods are present. That's all. So the code is correct.
