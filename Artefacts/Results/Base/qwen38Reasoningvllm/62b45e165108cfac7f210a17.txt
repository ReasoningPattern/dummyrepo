Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_logical_path_map based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns a dictionary of file paths for the states in the inventory. So, the function takes an 'inventory' and a 'version' as parameters.

First, I should figure out what the inventory structure looks like. Since it's not specified, maybe I should assume that the inventory is a list of state entries. Each state might have some attributes, like a logical path or a file path. The version parameter probably affects how the paths are determined or which states are included.

The goal is to map each state in the inventory to its logical path. But without knowing the exact structure of the inventory, I need to make some assumptions. Let's say each state in the inventory has a 'logical_path' key. Then, the function could simply collect those paths into a dictionary where the keys are the state names or identifiers and the values are the paths.

Wait, but the docstring mentions "file paths of the states". Maybe the inventory contains state files, and the function needs to generate their logical paths based on the version. For example, if the inventory is a list of state names, and each state's path is constructed using the version, like 'states/v1/state_name.py' or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with 'name' and 'path' keys, and the function is supposed to filter or process them based on the version. But the docstring doesn't mention filtering, just returning the paths.

Another possibility: the function is part of a larger system where 'inventory' refers to some data structure that holds state information, and 'version' is used to determine the correct path. For instance, in a configuration management tool, states might be versioned, and the logical path could be something like 'version/state_name'.

Since the problem doesn't provide specific details, I'll have to make a reasonable assumption. Let's assume that the inventory is a list of state objects, each with a 'name' and a 'path' attribute. The version might be used to construct the logical path, perhaps by appending the version to the path or using it in some way.

Wait, the docstring says "file paths of the states in the inventory". So maybe the inventory is a list of state files, and the function needs to map each state to its logical path. For example, if each state has a 'logical_path' key, then the function could return a dictionary where the keys are the state names and the values are their logical paths.

Alternatively, if the inventory is a list of state names, and the logical path is determined by some logic involving the version, like combining the state name with the version to form the path. For example, 'states/v{version}/{state_name}.yml'.

But without more info, I need to create a generic example. Let me think of a simple implementation. Suppose the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with 'name' and 'path' keys. The function could create a dictionary mapping each name to its path. But how does the version factor in?

Maybe the version is used to determine the directory structure. For example, the logical path could be constructed as 'version/{state_name}.py' or similar. Or perhaps the version is part of the path, like 'states/{version}/{state_name}.yml'.

Alternatively, the version might be used to select which states to include. But the docstring doesn't mention that. It just says returns the file paths of the states in the inventory. So maybe the version is irrelevant, or perhaps it's used in some way to generate the paths.

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to take the inventory and version, and for each state in the inventory, generate a logical path based on the version. For example, if the inventory has state names, and the logical path is a combination of the version and the state name.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary.
2. Iterate over each state in the inventory.
3. For each state, determine its logical path using the version.
4. Add the state's identifier (like name) as the key and the logical path as the value.
5. Return the dictionary.

But how exactly? Let's think of a possible example. Suppose each state in the inventory has a 'name' and a 'file_path' attribute. The logical path might be the file_path with the version appended. Or maybe the version is part of the path.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state files, and the logical path is derived from their names and the version. For example, if the state is called 'example_state', the logical path could be 'states/v{version}/example_state.py'.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. The user probably expects a basic implementation that uses the version to construct the paths. Let me make an assumption here.

Let's assume that the inventory is a list of state names, and the logical path is constructed by combining the version with the state name. For example, if the version is '1.0', the path might be 'states/1.0/{state_name}.yml'.

So, the function could look like this:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        logical_path = f"states/{version}/{state}.yml"
        path_map[state] = logical_path
    return path_map

But maybe the inventory is a list of dictionaries with more details. For instance, each state has a 'name' and 'path' key. Then, the function could map the name to the path, but perhaps the path is adjusted based on the version.

Alternatively, maybe the version is used to determine the directory structure. For example, the path is 'states/{version}/{state_name}.py'.

Another possibility: the inventory is a list of state objects, and each has a method or attribute to get the logical path. But again, without specifics, it's hard.

Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with a simple approach. Let's assume that the inventory is a list of state names, and the logical path is constructed using the version. The function returns a dictionary where each key is a state name and the value is the constructed path.

So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    return {state: f"states/{version}/{state}.yml" for state in inventory}

But maybe the version is part of the path in a different way. For example, if the version is a string that needs to be included in the path, but the exact format isn't specified. Alternatively, perhaps the version is used to generate a unique path for each state.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state objects, and each has a 'logical_path' attribute that's version-dependent. But again, without knowing, I need to make an assumption.

Another angle: the function could be part of a system where the inventory is a list of state files, and the logical path is determined by some logic, like the version number. For example, if the inventory contains file paths, and the version is used to create a mapping.

Wait, the docstring says "file paths of the states in the inventory". So maybe the inventory is a list of state files, and the function returns a dictionary mapping each state's identifier to its file path. But how does the version come into play?

Perhaps the version is used to determine the directory structure. For instance, the logical path could be something like 'states/v{version}/{state_name}.py'. So the function would take each state name from the inventory and create a path with the version.

Alternatively, if the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with 'name' and 'path' keys, then the function could return a dictionary of names to paths, but maybe the path is adjusted based on the version.

But since the user hasn't provided specifics, I think the best approach is to create a function that uses the version to construct the logical path. Let's assume that each state in the inventory is a string (like the state name), and the logical path is built by appending the version to a base directory.

So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        path = f"states/{version}/{state}.yml"
        path_map[state] = path
    return path_map

This is a simple implementation. But maybe the inventory is a list of objects, and we need to extract the name and path from them. However, without knowing the structure, it's hard to code that.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of file paths, and the function is supposed to map them to logical paths based on the version. For example, if the inventory contains absolute paths, the logical path could be a relative path derived from the version.

But again, without more info, I'll proceed with the first approach. The function takes a list of state names and a version, and returns a dictionary mapping each state to a path that includes the version.

So the code would be as above. Let me check if that's acceptable. The user said to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and not include explanations. So the code should be a simple implementation that fits the description.

Another possibility: the inventory is a list of state entries, each with a 'logical_path' key, and the version is used to filter or select which states to include. But the docstring doesn't mention filtering, just returning the paths.

Hmm. Maybe the version is part of the path. For example, the logical path is constructed as 'states/{version}/{state_name}.py'.

So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    return {state: f"states/{version}/{state}.py" for state in inventory}

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Since the user hasn't provided more details, this is a plausible approach. The function is supposed to return a dictionary of file paths, so the code should create that mapping.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state objects, and each has a method to get the logical path. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

I think the best way is to create a function that takes the inventory (assuming it's a list of state names) and version, then constructs the logical path as a string with the version included. The code would be straightforward.

So the final code would be as follows.
