Okay, I need to generate Python code for the find_roots function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it finds roots in a transitive hierarchy. The example uses RDFS.subClassOf, which suggests that the function is meant to find all nodes that don't have a parent via the given property. So, the idea is that in the graph, triples are of the form (child, prop, parent), and the roots are the nodes that aren't pointed to by any such triple. 

The function takes a graph, a property (like RDFS.subClassOf), and an optional set of roots. It returns a set of roots. So, the task is to find all nodes in the graph that are not the child in any triple with the given property. 

Wait, but how do I handle the transitive closure? Because if there's a chain like A -> B -> C, then the root would be C. But the function is supposed to find all roots, which are the nodes that are not children in any triple. So, maybe the function is to find all nodes that have no incoming edges for the given property. 

So, the approach would be to collect all nodes that are the target of the property (i.e., parents) and then subtract those from the set of all nodes in the graph. The remaining nodes are the roots. 

But wait, the function is called find_roots, so maybe it's the other way around. Let me recheck the example. The example says find_roots(graph, RDFS.subClassOf) returns all roots of the sub-class hierarchy. In RDFS.subClassOf, the direction is such that if A is a subclass of B, then (A, RDFS.subClassOf, B) is a triple. So the roots would be the classes that are not subclasses of anything else. So, the roots are the nodes that are not the subject of any triple with the given property. Wait, no. Wait, the triple is (child, prop, parent). So the child is the subject, parent is the object. So the roots are the parents that are not the object of any triple with that property. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a hierarchy where each node points to its parent, then the root is the one that has no parent. So, for the property prop, the roots are the nodes that are not the child in any triple. So, the function needs to find all nodes that are not the subject of any triple where the predicate is prop. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the triples are (child, prop, parent). So, for RDFS.subClassOf, the child is a subclass of the parent. So the root would be a class that isn't a subclass of any other class. Therefore, the roots are the nodes that are not the subject of any triple with prop as the predicate. Wait, no. Wait, if a node is a root, then there are no triples where it is the child. So, the roots are all nodes that are not the subject of any triple with the given prop. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to find nodes that are not the object of any triple with the given prop. Wait, that would be the case if the prop is used as a subclass relation. Let me think: in RDFS, the subclassOf relation is such that if A is a subclass of B, then (A, RDFS.subClassOf, B) is a triple. So, the root classes are those that are not the object of any such triple. Because if they were, they would have a parent. So, to find roots, we need to find all nodes that are not the object of any triple with the given property. 

Wait, but the function's docstring says that find_roots(graph, rdflib.RDFS.subClassOf) returns all roots of the sub-class hierarchy. So, for example, if there's a chain A → B → C, then the roots would be C. But if there are multiple roots, like C and D, then they would both be included. 

So the correct approach is to find all nodes that are not the object of any triple with the given property. Because those nodes don't have a parent in the hierarchy. 

So the steps would be:

1. Collect all nodes in the graph.
2. Find all nodes that are the object of any triple with the given prop.
3. Subtract that set from the set of all nodes to get the roots.

But wait, the roots parameter is optional. The function is supposed to return the roots. So, the function should process the graph and find all nodes that are not the object of any triple with the prop. 

So, the code would need to iterate through all triples in the graph where the predicate is prop, collect all the objects (parents), and then find all nodes not in that set. 

But how to get all nodes in the graph? Well, maybe using graph.nodes(), but I need to check what the Graph class provides. Assuming that the Graph class has a method to get all nodes, perhaps graph.nodes() returns a set of all nodes. 

Wait, but in rdflib, the Graph class has a method called nodes(), which returns a set of all nodes in the graph. So, perhaps that's the way to go. 

So, the code would look like:

def find_roots(graph, prop, roots=None):
    if roots is None:
        roots = set()
    # Get all nodes in the graph
    all_nodes = set(graph.nodes())
    # Get all objects of triples with predicate prop
    parents = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        parents.add(o)
    # Roots are all nodes not in parents
    return all_nodes - parents

Wait, but the function's docstring says that the roots are the ones that are not children. So, the children are the subjects of the triples with prop. So, the parents are the objects. Therefore, the roots are the nodes that are not in the parents set. 

But maybe the function is supposed to find nodes that are not the object of any triple with prop. So, the code above would do that. 

But what about if the graph has multiple triples with the same prop? For example, if a node is a parent in multiple triples, it's still only added once to the parents set. 

Yes, that's correct. 

But wait, the function's parameters: the roots argument is an optional set of Node objects. The docstring says that the function returns a set of roots. So, maybe the roots parameter is for providing a starting set, but the example doesn't use it. Wait, the example shows that when you call find_roots with the graph and prop, it returns all roots. So perhaps the roots parameter is for allowing the user to specify a subset of nodes to check, but the default is all nodes. 

Wait, the function signature says roots is an optional Set of Node. So maybe the function is intended to find roots in the graph, but if roots is provided, it's considering only those nodes. But the docstring's example doesn't use it. 

Wait, the docstring says: "find_roots(graph, rdflib.RDFS.subClassOf) will return a set of all roots of the sub-class hierarchy". So the roots parameter is not used in that example. So perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to check for being roots, but the default is all nodes. Or maybe it's a mistake in the docstring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the roots parameter is a set of nodes that are already considered roots, and the function is supposed to find additional roots? But that doesn't make much sense. 

Looking back at the function signature: the roots parameter is Optional[Set["Node"]], and the return is a set of nodes. So maybe the function is supposed to find roots that are not in the given roots set? Or maybe the roots parameter is for providing a starting set, and the function is to find roots in the hierarchy. 

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to find all nodes that are roots in the hierarchy defined by the property. So, regardless of the roots parameter, the function is to find all nodes that are not the object of any triple with the given prop. 

But the presence of the roots parameter is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in the docstring, or maybe the function is intended to find roots that are not in the provided roots set. But the example doesn't use it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already known to be roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that's not clear. 

Wait, maybe the roots parameter is for allowing the user to specify a set of nodes to consider as potential roots, and the function will return those that are indeed roots. But the default is None, which would mean all nodes. 

But the docstring's example doesn't use it. So perhaps the roots parameter is not used in the function. Maybe it's a mistake. Or perhaps the function is intended to find roots that are not in the provided roots set. 

Alternatively, perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that's not clear. 

Wait, the function's docstring says that the example returns all roots. So perhaps the roots parameter is not used in the function. Maybe the docstring is incorrect. Or perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to check, but the function is supposed to find roots in the hierarchy. 

Alternatively, perhaps the roots parameter is a set of nodes that are already considered roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that seems odd. 

Alternatively, maybe the roots parameter is for providing a starting set, and the function is to find the roots of the hierarchy that are not in the provided roots. But I'm not sure. 

But given the example, perhaps the roots parameter is not used. So the function is supposed to find all nodes that are not the object of any triple with the given prop. 

So the code would be:

def find_roots(graph, prop, roots=None):
    # Get all nodes in the graph
    all_nodes = set(graph.nodes())
    # Get all parents (objects of triples with prop)
    parents = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        parents.add(o)
    # Roots are all nodes not in parents
    return all_nodes - parents

But wait, the function's return is supposed to be a set of roots. So that's the approach. 

But maybe the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to check. For example, if the user wants to find roots in a subset of nodes. But the example doesn't use it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that's not clear. 

But given the example, perhaps the roots parameter is not used. So the code would ignore it. 

Wait, the function's parameters are graph, prop, and roots. The docstring says that the example uses the first two parameters. So perhaps the roots parameter is not used in the function. But that seems odd. Maybe the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to consider as roots, and the function returns those that are indeed roots. But the default is None, which would mean all nodes. 

Alternatively, maybe the roots parameter is a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that's not clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the roots parameter is a set of nodes that are to be considered as possible roots, and the function returns those that are not children. But again, the example doesn't use it. 

Hmm. Well, the docstring says that the function returns a set of all roots. So perhaps the roots parameter is not used. Maybe it's a mistake. But the user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the roots parameter is not used. 

But perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to check, and the function returns the roots among them. For example, if you have a graph and a property, and you want to find which of the given roots are actually roots. But the example shows that when roots is not provided, it returns all roots. 

Alternatively, maybe the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that seems redundant. 

Alternatively, perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to start with, and the function is to find the roots of the hierarchy that are not in the provided roots. But that's unclear. 

Well, given the ambiguity, perhaps the roots parameter is not used. But the function's parameters include it. So maybe the function is intended to find roots in the graph, but if roots is provided, it's used as a starting set. 

Alternatively, maybe the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that would require that the roots parameter is a set of nodes that are not children. 

But given the example, I think the roots parameter is not used. So the code would ignore it. 

But perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to check, and the function returns the ones that are roots. For example, if you have a graph and a property, and you want to check which of the given nodes are roots. 

But the docstring says that the example returns all roots. So perhaps the roots parameter is not used. 

Alternatively, maybe the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that would be redundant. 

Hmm. Well, perhaps the roots parameter is not used. Let me proceed with that assumption. 

So the code would collect all nodes in the graph, then collect all objects of triples with the given prop, then subtract those objects from the all_nodes set. 

But wait, in the example, if you have (A, prop, B), (B, prop, C), then the roots would be C. So the code would collect all objects (B and C), then subtract them from all_nodes (A, B, C). So the result would be A. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no. Because in that case, the parents are B and C. So all_nodes minus parents would be A. But A is the child here. Wait, that's not correct. 

Wait, I think I have the direction wrong. Let me think again. 

If the triple is (child, prop, parent), then the parent is the object. So, the roots are the nodes that are not the object of any triple with prop. Because those nodes don't have a parent. 

Wait, in the example where A is a subclass of B, and B is a subclass of C, then the triples are (A, prop, B), (B, prop, C). The parents (objects) are B and C. So all_nodes minus parents would be A. But A is a child. So that's not correct. 

Wait, that suggests that the code is wrong. Because in that case, the root is C, not A. 

Ah, so I have the direction reversed. 

The root is the node that is not a child. So, the roots are the nodes that are not the subject of any triple with prop. Wait, no. Because if a node is a subject of a triple with prop, that means it's a child. So the roots are the nodes that are not the subject of any triple with prop. 

Wait, that makes more sense. For example, in the case of A → B → C, the subjects are A and B. The objects are B and C. So the roots would be the nodes that are not subjects. So, the roots are C. 

So, the code should collect all subjects of triples with prop, and then subtract those from all_nodes. 

Wait, but then the roots would be the nodes that are not children. So, the code would be:

def find_roots(graph, prop, roots=None):
    all_nodes = set(graph.nodes())
    children = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    return all_nodes - children

But then, in the example, if the triples are (A, prop, B), (B, prop, C), then children would be {A, B}, so all_nodes minus children would be {C}, which is correct. 

But then, what if there are multiple roots? Like, if there are two nodes D and E that are not children. Then they would both be in the result. 

Yes, that makes sense. 

So the function is supposed to find all nodes that are not the subject of any triple with the given prop. 

But then why is the roots parameter there? Maybe the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to check, and the function returns those that are not children. 

But the docstring's example doesn't use it. So perhaps the roots parameter is not used. 

But the function's parameters include roots as an optional set. So maybe the function is intended to find roots in the graph, but if roots is provided, it's used as a starting set. 

Alternatively, maybe the roots parameter is a set of nodes that are already considered roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that's not clear. 

But given the example, the function is supposed to return all roots. So perhaps the roots parameter is not used. 

But the user might have intended that the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to check. For example, if you have a graph and you want to find which of the given roots are actually roots.

Alternatively, perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. But that's not clear.

Wait, but the function's parameters have roots as an optional set. So perhaps the function is intended to find roots in the graph, but if roots is provided, it's used as a starting set.

    # Get all children (subjects of triples with prop)

    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    # Roots are all nodes not in children
    return all_nodes - children

But wait, the function's parameters have roots as an optional set. Maybe the function is supposed to take a set of nodes to check, and return those that are roots. For example, if you have a subset of nodes, and you want to find which of them are roots. 

In that case, the code would be:

def find_roots(graph, prop, roots=None):
    if roots is None:
        roots = set(graph.nodes())
    # Get all children (subjects of triples with prop)

        children.add(s)
    # Roots are the ones in the provided roots set that are not children
    return roots - children

But then the example would be when roots is None, it uses all nodes. So that would return all nodes not in children, which are the roots. 

But the original docstring says that find_roots(graph, RDFS.subClassOf) returns all roots. So in this case, the roots parameter is not used. 

But why is it there? Maybe the user intended that the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes to check, but the default is all nodes. 

But the function's docstring doesn't mention that. So perhaps the roots parameter is a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to find the roots of the hierarchy starting from the given roots. 

But without more information, it's hard to tell. 

But given the function signature and the docstring, the most logical code is to find all nodes that are not children (i.e., not the subject of any triple with the given prop). 

So the code would be:

    all_nodes = set(graph.nodes())

    return all_nodes - children

But then the roots parameter is not used. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Assumes triple of the form (child, prop, parent)" which suggests that the prop is used as a relation from child to parent. 

So, the roots are the nodes that are not children. So the function should find all nodes that are not in the children set.

But since the user provided the function signature, I need to follow that. 

So, perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. 

But that would mean that the function is supposed to find roots in the graph, but if roots is provided, it's a starting set.

Alternatively, perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. 

But that's not clear. 

Well, given the uncertainty, but based on the example, the code should find all nodes that are not children. 

So the code would be as written earlier. 

But I need to make sure that the code uses the roots parameter if provided. 

Wait, the function's docstring says that the roots parameter is optional. So perhaps the function is intended to find roots in the graph, but if roots is provided, it's used as the set of nodes to check. 

So, for example, if you have a graph with multiple nodes, and you want to find which of the provided roots are actually roots. 

In that case, the code would be:

def find_roots(graph, prop, roots=None):
    if roots is None:
        roots = set(graph.nodes())
    children = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    return roots - children

But that would make sense. 

So, the function first checks if roots is None, and if so, uses all nodes. Then, it finds all children (subjects of triples with prop) and subtracts them from the roots set. 

That would give the roots in the graph. 

So, that's probably the correct approach. 

Thus, the code would be as follows. 

But I need to make sure that the code uses the roots parameter. 

So, the code would look like this. 

But what if the roots parameter is not None? Then, the function returns the roots that are not children. 

But the docstring's example doesn't use it, but that's okay. 

So, the code is:

def find_roots(graph, prop, roots=None):
    if roots is None:
        roots = set(graph.nodes())
    children = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    return roots - children

But then, the function's name is find_roots, which implies that it's finding the roots in the graph. 

So, this code would work. 

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. 

Another way: perhaps the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. 

But that would mean that the function is to find the roots in the graph, regardless of the roots parameter. 

So, in that case, the roots parameter is not used. 

But the user included it in the function signature. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the roots parameter is for providing a set of nodes that are already roots, and the function is to find all roots by checking which nodes are not children. 

But that's not clear. 

Well, given the ambiguity, but based on the example, I'll proceed with the code that uses the roots parameter as the set of nodes to check, and returns those that are not children. 

So, the code would be as above. 

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. 

Another thing to consider: in rdflib, graph.triples((None, prop, None)) would return all triples where the predicate is prop. 

So, the code is correct. 

Therefore, the generated code is:

def find_roots(graph: "Graph", prop: "URIRef", roots: Optional[Set["Node"]] = None) -> Set["Node"]:
    if roots is None:
        roots = set(graph.nodes())
    children = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    return roots - children

But wait, the function's return is a set of nodes. 

Yes. 

But the user's docstring says that the function returns a set of roots. 

So this code would do that. 

But maybe the roots parameter is supposed to be the set of nodes to check, and the function returns the roots among them. 

Yes. 

So, the code should be as above. 

But I need to check if the roots parameter is a set. 

Yes, the function signature says roots is Optional[Set["Node"]]. 

So, the code is correct. 

But in the case where roots is provided, it's the set of nodes to check. 

So, the code is correct. 

Therefore, the generated code is:

def find_roots(graph: "Graph", prop: "URIRef", roots: Optional[Set["Node"]] = None) -> Set["Node"]:
    if roots is None:
        roots = set(graph.nodes())
    children = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    return roots - children

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. 

Another possible edge case: if a node is both a child and a root. But that's impossible. 

Wait, no. A root is a node that is not a child. So, if a node is in the roots set and is not a child, it's included. 

Yes. 

So, this code should work. 

Therefore, the final code is as written.
