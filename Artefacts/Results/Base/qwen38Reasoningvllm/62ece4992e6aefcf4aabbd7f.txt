Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function _parse_image_ref based on the given signature and docstring. The function takes an image_href string and returns a tuple with image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. It should raise a ValueError.

First, I need to figure out how to parse the image href. The docstring mentions using urllib, so maybe I should use urllib.parse. The href is probably a URL, so splitting it into components makes sense.

The return tuple has image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. Netloc is the network location part, like the domain. Use_ssl would be whether the URL uses HTTPS. So, the steps might be: split the URL into parts, extract the netloc, check if it starts with https, and then get the image ID from the path.

Wait, but how is the image_id determined? Maybe the path part after the domain. For example, if the URL is https://example.com/images/12345, then netloc is example.com, use_ssl is True, and image_id is 12345. But the exact structure isn't specified. The user might expect that the image ID is the last part of the path.

So, I'll need to parse the URL using urlparse. Let's import urlparse from urllib.parse. Then, split the href into scheme, netloc, path, etc. The scheme will tell us if it's HTTPS. The netloc is the domain. The image_id could be the last segment of the path.

But what if the path is empty or doesn't have segments? Maybe the image_id is the entire path if it's just a single part. Or perhaps the path is expected to have an ID. Also, need to handle cases where the URL might not be properly formatted.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So, the image_id is probably the part after the domain. Let me think: for a URL like "http://example.com/path/to/image", the netloc is "example.com", and the image_id would be "image" or maybe the entire path? The problem isn't clear. But maybe the image_id is the last part of the path. For example, if the href is "http://example.com/images/abc123", then image_id is "abc123".

So, steps:

1. Parse the image_href using urlparse.
2. Check if the scheme is 'https' to determine use_ssl.
3. Extract the netloc part.
4. Split the path into segments and take the last one as image_id.

But need to handle cases where the path might not have any segments. Like if the href is "http://example.com", then the image_id would be empty? Or maybe the function expects the path to have at least one segment. But the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps we should assume that the image_id is the last part of the path, even if it's just the root.

Wait, maybe the image_href is something like "http://example.com/images/123", so the path is '/images/123'. Splitting by '/' would give ['', 'images', '123'], so the last part is '123'.

So, code steps:

Parse the URL with urlparse.

Check if the scheme is 'https' (use_ssl is True if scheme is 'https', else False).

Netloc is the network location, which is the domain part.

For image_id, split the path into parts, take the last part. But if the path is empty, maybe return an empty string?

But what if the href is not a valid URL? The function should raise ValueError. So, perhaps we need to validate that the href is a proper URL. But the docstring doesn't mention validation, just that it raises ValueError. So maybe the function expects that the input is a valid URL, but in practice, we should handle possible exceptions.

Wait, the user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says to import urllib, so maybe the code should use urllib.parse.

So, code outline:

import urllib.parse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    # parse the href
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    # check if scheme is valid?
    # extract netloc
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    # determine use_ssl
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    # get image_id from path
    path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
    image_id = path_parts[-1] if path_parts else ''
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, the path might have multiple parts. For example, if the URL is "http://example.com/images/abc/def", then the image_id would be 'def'.

But what if the path is empty? Like if the href is "http://example.com"? Then parsed.path is empty, so image_id would be empty string.

But maybe the function expects that the image_id is present. However, the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the code should handle that case, returning an empty string if there's no path.

But the user's example in the docstring isn't given. So, perhaps that's the correct approach.

But need to make sure that the function raises ValueError if the href is invalid. However, urlparse will handle invalid URLs by returning some components, but maybe the function should check if the netloc is present? Or maybe the function assumes that the href is a valid URL.

Alternatively, maybe the image_href is a string that's supposed to be a valid image reference, so the code can proceed under that assumption. But the function should raise ValueError if something's wrong. However, the current code doesn't have any error checking. So perhaps the user expects that the function will raise ValueError if the URL is invalid, but how?

Wait, the function's docstring says it raises ValueError, but the code isn't shown. So maybe the code should validate that the URL is properly formatted. For example, if the netloc is empty, or if the path is not present, etc.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided specific examples. So perhaps the code should just parse the URL as per standard urlparse, and if any of the components are missing, it's considered invalid and raises ValueError.

But how to check that? For example, if the URL is missing the scheme, like "example.com/images/123", then parsed.scheme would be empty. So in that case, use_ssl would be False, but maybe that's not correct. Or maybe the function expects that the href is a valid URL with scheme.

Hmm. The function's parameters are image_href, which is a string. The docstring says to import urllib, so perhaps the code is intended to parse the URL using urlparse.

But the user might have specific requirements. Since the docstring isn't detailed, perhaps the code should proceed with the standard parsing.

So, the code would be:

import urllib.parse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: missing netloc")
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
    image_id = path_parts[-1] if path_parts else ''
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but what if the path is something like '/images/123'? Then split into ['', 'images', '123'], so last part is '123'.

But maybe the image_id is supposed to be the entire path, but that's unlikely. The tuple is (image_id, netloc, use_ssl), so image_id is likely the identifier part.

But perhaps the image_href is a URL that's supposed to have the image ID in the path. So the code above would extract that.

But the function may need to handle cases where the URL is not properly formatted. For example, if the href is just a filename, like 'image.jpg', then parsed.netloc would be empty, leading to a ValueError.

So, the code checks if parsed.netloc is empty and raises ValueError. That makes sense.

But what about if the URL has a query or fragment? The function doesn't mention those, so perhaps they are ignored.

So, the code would parse the URL, check for netloc, then extract image_id from the path.

But maybe the image_id is the part after the last slash. So the code is correct.

So, the code would be as above. Also, need to import Tuple from typing.

But the user says to generate the code, not include explanations. So the code would be:

import urllib.parse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: missing netloc")
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
    image_id = path_parts[-1] if path_parts else ''
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, the docstring says to import urllib, but the code already has that. So the code is correct.

But maybe the user wants to use urllib.request or something else? The docstring says "import urllib." but that's probably a typo. The correct way is to import urllib.parse.

So the code should import urllib.parse.

Yes, that's what I did.

So the final code is as above. Now, check for any possible errors. For example, if the image_href is empty, then parsed.netloc would be empty, leading to ValueError.

But the function's parameters are image_href: str, so it's possible that the input is invalid. The code raises ValueError in that case.

I think this meets the requirements. So the code is written.
