Okay, I need to create a Python function called strip_root that takes a path and a root, and removes the root from the path. If it fails, it should throw an exception. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should check if the path starts with the root. But wait, maybe the root is a directory, so I should check if the path is under the root. For example, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs/file.txt', then stripping the root would give 'docs/file.txt'. But if the path is '/home/user/docs', then the result would be 'docs'.

Wait, but how do I handle cases where the root is not a prefix of the path? Like if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/root', then it's not under the root. In that case, the function should throw an exception.

So the first step is to check if the path starts with the root. But maybe the root is a directory, so I should check if the path is within that directory. For example, if the root is '/home/user', then the path must start with that exact string. But if the root is a parent directory, like '/home', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then stripping the root would give 'user/docs'.

Wait, but the problem says "remove root from path". So perhaps the function is intended to remove the root directory from the path. So, the root must be a prefix of the path. So, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', then the result is 'user/docs'. If the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user', then the result is 'docs'.

But how to handle cases where the root is not a prefix? For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/root', then it's not a prefix, so the function should raise an exception.

So the function needs to check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception. Then, return the substring after the root.

But wait, what if the root is a substring but not a prefix? Like path is 'home/user/docs' and root is 'home'? Then it's not a prefix, so it should raise an exception.

So the first thing is to check if the path starts with the root. But how to do that in Python? Using the startswith method.

But maybe the root is a directory, so we need to ensure that the path is under that directory. For example, if the root is '/home/user', then the path must start with that exact string. However, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', then it's under the root. So the function should check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then remove it and return the rest. Otherwise, raise an exception.

Wait, but what if the root is a directory that's not the exact prefix? Like, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user/docs', then the result is an empty string. But if the root is '/home/user/docs/', then the path would start with that, but the trailing slash might matter. Hmm, maybe the function should handle cases where the root is a directory, and the path is within it. So perhaps we should normalize the paths by stripping any trailing slashes before checking.

Wait, but the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So maybe the function is supposed to check if the path is under the root, and if not, raise an error. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to remove the root directory from the path. So, for example, if the path is '/a/b/c' and the root is '/a', then the result is '/b/c'. Wait, no. Wait, if the root is '/a', then stripping it would leave 'b/c'.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to remove the root directory from the path. So, the root is a directory, and the path is a path relative to that root. So, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', then the result is 'user/docs'. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user', then the result is 'docs'.

But how to handle cases where the root is not a prefix? For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/root', then it's not a prefix, so the function should raise an exception.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception.
2. If it does, then remove the root from the path and return the remaining part.

But how to handle cases where the root is a directory and the path is a subpath. For example, if the root is '/home/user', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the result is 'docs'. But if the path is '/home/user/docs/', then the result would be 'docs/'.

Wait, but maybe the function should normalize the path. Like, if the root is '/home/user', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then return 'docs'. If the path is '/home/user/docs/', then return 'docs/'.

But perhaps the function is supposed to remove the root exactly once. So, if the path starts with the root, then we can split it and take the rest.

But how to handle cases where the root is not a prefix? For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/root', then it's not a prefix, so raise an exception.

So the code would be something like:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is a directory that's not the exact prefix? Like, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the code works. But if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the code would return 'user/docs'.

But maybe there's a case where the root is not a prefix but the path is under it. For example, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's correct. But if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's under the root. So the code as written would work.

But what if the root is a directory that's not a prefix? Like, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user/docs/', then the path starts with the root? No, because the root has a trailing slash and the path doesn't. So in that case, the code would not match. So maybe we need to normalize the paths by removing trailing slashes before checking.

Wait, but the problem says nothing about trailing slashes. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle paths as they are. So, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's correct. But if the root is '/home/user/' (with a trailing slash), and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the startswith would return False. So maybe the function should normalize both paths by stripping trailing slashes before checking.

Alternatively, maybe the function should check if the path is under the root, regardless of trailing slashes. For example, if the root is '/home/user', then the path '/home/user/docs/' is under it. But how to check that?

Hmm, perhaps the function is intended to work with absolute paths. So the root and path are both absolute. So, the code can check if the path starts with the root. But if the root is a directory, then maybe the path should be under that directory. So, for example, if the root is '/home/user', then the path must start with that. But if the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's under the root. So the code would work.

But what if the root is not a directory? Like, if the root is a file path. But the function's description says "remove root from path", which implies that the root is a directory. So perhaps the function is designed to remove the root directory from the path.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So maybe the function should check if the path is under the root directory. So, for example, if the root is '/home/user', then the path must be '/home/user/...' or '/home/user' exactly. So, the code would check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then return the rest. Otherwise, raise an error.

But there's a problem with this approach. For example, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the code would return 'user/docs'. But if the root is '/home/user', then the path '/home/user/docs' would return 'docs'.

But what if the root is not a prefix? Like, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/root'? Then the code would raise an exception.

So the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is an empty string? Or if the path is exactly the root? For example, if path is '/home/user' and root is '/home/user', then the code returns an empty string. That's probably acceptable.

But what if the root is not absolute? Like, if the root is 'home' and the path is '/home/user/docs'? Then the code would not match. So perhaps the function is intended to work with absolute paths. So the root and path should be absolute.

But the function's parameters are just 'path' and 'root', so maybe they can be relative. But the problem says "remove root from path", which suggests that the root is a directory that's part of the path.

But the function's docstring says "If fails, throw exception". So maybe the function is intended to check if the path is under the root. For example, if the root is '/home', then the path could be '/home/user/docs' or '/home/docs', etc. So the code would check if the path starts with the root. But if the root is a directory, then the path must be a subpath of it.

But perhaps there's a case where the root is a parent directory. For example, if the root is '/home', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then stripping the root would give 'user/docs'.

But what if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user'? Then the code would return 'docs'.

But what if the root is '/home/user/docs' and the path is '/home/user/docs'? Then it returns an empty string.

But what if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home'? Then the code returns 'user/docs'.

But what if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user/docs/'? Then the code would check if the path starts with the root. Since the root has a trailing slash and the path doesn't, it would return False, and raise an exception.

So perhaps the function should normalize the paths by stripping any trailing slashes before checking. For example, if the root is '/home/user/docs/', then we can strip the trailing slash and check if the path starts with that. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to work with the exact strings. So if the root is '/home/user/docs/', then the path must start with that exact string. But that might not be flexible.

But the problem says nothing about trailing slashes, so perhaps the function should just check if the path starts with the root. So, the code would be as simple as:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is not a directory? Like, if the root is a file. But the function's purpose is to remove the root directory, so maybe the root is supposed to be a directory. However, the function doesn't check that. So maybe the function is designed to work with the given root string, regardless of whether it's a directory or not.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So perhaps the function is intended to check that the path is under the root directory. So, for example, if the root is '/home', then the path must be '/home/...' or exactly '/home'.

But how to handle cases where the root is not a prefix. For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/root', then it's not a prefix, so raise an exception.

But what if the root is a substring but not a prefix? Like, path is '/home/user/docs' and root is 'user'? Then the code would check if the path starts with 'user', which it doesn't, so raise an exception.

So the code as written would work for that case.

But perhaps there's a case where the root is a directory, and the path is a subpath. For example, if the root is '/home/user', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the code returns 'docs'.

But what if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home'? Then the code returns 'user/docs'.

But maybe the function should also check that the root is a directory. However, the problem doesn't mention that. So perhaps the function doesn't need to check if the root exists as a directory, just that the path starts with the root.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So perhaps the function is supposed to check that the path is under the root. So, for example, if the root is '/home', then the path must be '/home/...' or exactly '/home'.

But how to handle cases where the path is a subpath of the root? Like, if the root is '/home/user', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's under the root. But if the path is '/home/user/docs/', then it's also under the root. But the code would check if the path starts with the root. So if the root is '/home/user', then the path '/home/user/docs/' would start with the root, so it would return 'docs/'.

But perhaps the function should also check that the path is not outside the root. For example, if the root is '/home', and the path is '/home/user/docs', that's okay. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user', then it's okay. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user/docs', then it returns an empty string.

But the problem says "remove root from path". So, the function is supposed to remove the root directory from the path. So, the code as written would work.

But what if the root is not a prefix? For example, path is '/home/user/docs' and root is '/root'? Then the code raises an exception.

So, the code would be as follows:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is an empty string? Then, the code would check if the path starts with an empty string, which it always does. So, it would return the entire path. But that's probably not intended. However, the problem says nothing about that, so maybe it's acceptable.

But perhaps the function should also check that the root is a valid directory. But again, the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe the function doesn't need to check for that.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So, the function should raise an exception if the path does not start with the root. So the code above would do that.

But maybe there's a case where the root is a directory, and the path is a subpath. For example, if the root is '/home/user', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it works. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user/docs', then it returns an empty string.

But perhaps the function should also check that the root is a directory. However, the problem doesn't mention that, so maybe it's not necessary.

Another thing to consider: what if the root is a relative path? Like, if the root is 'user' and the path is '/home/user/docs'? Then the code would check if the path starts with 'user', which it doesn't. So it would raise an exception. But maybe the function is intended to work with absolute paths. However, the problem doesn't specify that, so perhaps the function should handle both absolute and relative paths as per the given strings.

But the problem says "path" and "root" as parameters. So perhaps the function is designed to work with absolute paths. But the code as written would handle any string, as long as the path starts with the root.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So, the function should raise an exception if the path does not start with the root. So the code above would do that.

But maybe the function should also check that the root is a prefix, and that the path is not outside of it. For example, if the root is '/home', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's okay. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user', then it's okay. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user/docs/', then the code would check if the path starts with the root. Since the root has a trailing slash and the path doesn't, it would return False and raise an exception.

But perhaps the function should normalize the paths by stripping trailing slashes. So, maybe we should first normalize both path and root by stripping any trailing slashes, then check if the path starts with the root.

For example:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    # Normalize paths by stripping trailing slashes
    normalized_path = path.rstrip('/')
    normalized_root = root.rstrip('/')
    if not normalized_path.startswith(normalized_root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return normalized_path[len(normalized_root):]

But this would handle cases where the root or path has trailing slashes. For example, if the root is '/home/user/' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then after stripping, the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', so it would work.

But the problem says nothing about trailing slashes, so maybe this is an overcomplication. However, it's possible that the function is intended to handle such cases. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the original code is sufficient.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So, perhaps the function should check that the path is under the root. For example, if the root is '/home', then the path must be '/home/...' or exactly '/home'. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', then the code would return 'user/docs'.

But what if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user'? Then the code would return 'docs'.

But what if the root is '/home/user/docs' and the path is '/home/user/docs'? Then it returns an empty string.

But the problem says "remove root from path". So, the function is supposed to remove the root directory from the path. So, if the path is exactly the root, then the result is an empty string.

But perhaps the function should also check that the root is a directory. However, the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe the function doesn't need to do that.

So, the code would be as follows:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is not a prefix but the path is a subpath? Like, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's okay. But if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's okay. But if the root is '/home/user/docs' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it returns an empty string.

But what if the root is a directory that's not a prefix? Like, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's correct. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', then it's correct.

So, the code seems to handle that.

But what about if the root is empty? Then, the code would check if the path starts with an empty string, which it does, and return the entire path. But that's probably not intended. However, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's acceptable.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So, maybe the function should also check that the root is a valid directory. But again, the problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps it's not necessary.

So, the code would be as written. However, perhaps there's a case where the root is a substring but not a prefix. For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is 'user', then the code would check if the path starts with 'user', which it doesn't, so it raises an exception.

But what if the root is a parent directory? Like, path is '/home/user/docs' and root is '/home'? Then the code works.

So, the code seems to meet the requirements. But perhaps the function should also check that the root is a directory. However, the problem doesn't mention that. So, I'll proceed with the code that checks if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception. Otherwise, return the rest.

But wait, what if the root is a directory that's not the exact prefix? For example, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's okay. But if the root is '/home/user', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's okay.

So, the code is correct.

But perhaps the function should also handle cases where the root is a relative path. For example, if the root is 'user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the code would check if the path starts with 'user', which it doesn't. So, it would raise an exception. But maybe the function is intended to work with absolute paths. However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the function should handle both.

But in that case, the code would not work. For example, if the root is 'user' and the path is 'user/docs', then it would start with 'user' and return 'docs'. But if the root is 'user' and the path is '/user/docs', then it would not start with 'user' (since the path starts with '/'), so it would raise an exception.

But the problem says nothing about that, so perhaps the function is intended to work with absolute paths. However, the code as written would handle any string, as long as the path starts with the root.

But given the problem's description, perhaps the function is supposed to work with absolute paths. However, the code doesn't enforce that. So, maybe the function should check that both path and root are absolute. But again, the problem doesn't mention that.

So, perhaps the function should just check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception. Otherwise, return the rest.

But then, what if the root is a directory that's not a prefix? Like, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's correct. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home/user/docs', then it returns an empty string.

So, the code seems to handle that.

But perhaps the function should also check that the root is a directory. But again, the problem doesn't mention that. So, perhaps it's not necessary.

So, the code would be as follows:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is not a prefix but the path is a subpath? Like, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's okay. But if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/docs', then it's okay.

But in the case where the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs', the code returns 'user/docs', which is correct.

So, this code seems to meet the requirements. But perhaps the function should also check that the root is a valid directory. However, the problem doesn't mention that, so I think the code is acceptable.

But maybe the function should also check that the root is a directory. For example, if the root is a file, then stripping it from the path might not make sense. But again, the problem doesn't mention that, so it's probably not required.

So, the code is as written. But perhaps the exception message should be more specific. For example, "Path does not start with root" is okay.

But the problem says "If fails, throw exception". So, the code would raise an exception if the path does not start with the root. Otherwise, return the rest.

But what about if the root is longer than the path? For example, path is '/home' and root is '/home/user'. Then, path.startswith(root) would return False, so it raises an exception. Which is correct.

So, the code seems correct. Therefore, the generated code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Path does not start with root")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is an empty string? Then, path.startswith('') is always True, so it would return the entire path. But that's probably not intended. However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's acceptable.

But maybe the function should also check that the root is not empty. However, the problem says nothing about that, so I'll leave it as is.

Another thing to consider: the function should return a path without the root. So, if the root is '/home', and the path is '/home/user/docs', then the result is 'user/docs'. But what if the path is exactly the root? Like, path is '/home' and root is '/home', then the result is an empty string.

But the problem says "remove root from path", so that's acceptable.

So, the code is correct.
