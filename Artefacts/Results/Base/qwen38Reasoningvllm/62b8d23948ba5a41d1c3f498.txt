Okay, I need to generate Python code for an LRU cache decorator based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is called lru_cache and takes maxsize and typed as parameters. The docstring mentions it's a decorator that memoizes up to maxsize results using the LRU algorithm. So, I should create a decorator that uses an LRU cache.

In Python, the standard way to implement an LRU cache is by using the functools.lru_cache decorator. But maybe the user wants a custom implementation? Wait, the question says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The standard lru_cache is already part of Python's functools module. However, perhaps the user is asking for a custom version? Or maybe they want me to replicate the functionality?

Wait, the function signature is the same as the standard lru_cache, but the docstring is a bit generic. The standard lru_cache has parameters like maxsize and typed. So maybe the user wants me to write the code for the standard lru_cache decorator? But that's a built-in function. However, perhaps they want a custom implementation for learning purposes or to modify it.

But the user says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So maybe they just want the code that uses the existing lru_cache from functools? Let me check the standard library's lru_cache.

The standard lru_cache decorator is part of the functools module. So the code would be something like:

from functools import lru_cache

def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    return lru_cache(maxsize, typed)

But that's just wrapping the existing function. However, the user might want the actual implementation. But given the constraints, the user probably wants the code that uses the standard library's lru_cache. But the function name is the same as the standard one. Wait, maybe the user is asking to create a decorator with the same name and parameters, but the code is supposed to be their own implementation?

But the user didn't specify whether it's a custom implementation or using the built-in. However, since the docstring is provided, perhaps they want the standard one. But the standard one is already in functools. So maybe the user wants the code that defines the lru_cache decorator from scratch?

Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting a code snippet that uses the standard lru_cache but with the given parameters. But the function signature is the same as the standard one. So maybe they just want the code that returns the standard lru_cache with those parameters. However, the standard lru_cache is a decorator, so the function itself would be a wrapper.

Wait, the function lru_cache is supposed to be a decorator. So the code would be a function that returns another decorator. For example, the standard lru_cache is implemented as a decorator factory. So the code would look like:

import functools

def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    """
    Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves
    up to `maxsize` results based on a Least Recently Used (LRU)
    algorithm.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=maxsize, typed=typed)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, that's not quite right. Because the standard lru_cache is a decorator that can be applied directly. So perhaps the user wants the code to be a decorator that uses the functools.lru_cache. But the function signature is the same as the standard one. However, the standard lru_cache is a function that returns a decorator. So maybe the code is supposed to be a decorator factory that uses the built-in lru_cache.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a custom implementation. But given that the docstring is similar to the standard one, perhaps they just want the code that uses the existing functionality. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the function lru_cache is supposed to be the decorator, but how to implement it?

Wait, perhaps the user is expecting me to write the code for the lru_cache decorator, but since it's a standard one, maybe they want the code that uses the functools.lru_cache. But the function name is the same. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the functools.lru_cache inside the function.

But the standard lru_cache is a decorator that can be applied to a function. So the code would be:

import functools

def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    """
    Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves
    up to `maxsize` results based on a Least Recently Used (LRU)
    algorithm.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=maxsize, typed=typed)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But this is a bit redundant because it's just wrapping the existing lru_cache. However, maybe the user wants this structure. Alternatively, perhaps they want the code to be a decorator that uses a custom LRU implementation.

But given the problem statement, I think the correct answer is to use the functools.lru_cache. However, the user might have intended to have a custom implementation. But since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the docstring is similar to the standard one, perhaps the code is supposed to be the standard one.

Alternatively, maybe the user is asking to create a decorator that behaves like the standard lru_cache but with the same parameters. So the code would be as above. But perhaps the user wants the actual implementation of the LRU cache, not just wrapping the existing one.

But given that the user hasn't specified, and the function signature is the same as the standard one, I think the answer is to use the functools.lru_cache. However, the standard lru_cache is a function, not a decorator. Wait, no, the standard lru_cache is a decorator. Wait, no. The standard lru_cache is a function that returns a decorator. For example, when you use @lru_cache, it's applying the decorator. So the code I wrote earlier is correct.

But maybe the user wants the code to be a decorator that uses the LRU algorithm, but implemented from scratch. However, that would be more complex. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps they just want the code that uses the built-in.

But the problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". So the function is supposed to be the lru_cache decorator. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a decorator that uses the functools.lru_cache. But the standard lru_cache is already in functools. So maybe the code is supposed to be a wrapper around it.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the code to be the actual implementation of the LRU cache. But that would require more code. However, given the function signature and docstring, perhaps the user is expecting the standard implementation.

But I'm not sure. However, given that the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the standard lru_cache has the same parameters, the correct approach is to use the functools.lru_cache inside the function. So the code would be:

import functools

def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    """
    Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves
    up to `maxsize` results based on a Least Recently Used (LRU)
    algorithm.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=maxsize, typed=typed)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But this is a bit redundant. However, this is how the standard lru_cache is used. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the code to be a decorator that uses a custom LRU cache. But without more details, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting the code to be a function that returns a decorator, which in turn uses the LRU cache. But again, this is the same as the standard implementation.

So, given the ambiguity, but following the function signature and docstring, I think the code should be a decorator that uses the functools.lru_cache. Therefore, the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Another possibility: the user wants the code to be the actual LRU cache implementation, not using the built-in. But that's more involved. However, since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the same as the standard one, perhaps the user is expecting the standard code.

But since the user is asking for a Python software engineer to generate the code, maybe they want the standard implementation. However, the standard lru_cache is part of the functools module. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a wrapper around it.

Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the code that defines the lru_cache decorator, which is part of functools. But that's already implemented. So perhaps the answer is to use the functools.lru_cache inside the function.

So the code would be as follows. Also, the docstring is provided, so I need to include that. The code should return the decorator that applies the LRU cache.

So the code would be:

import functools

def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    """
    Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves
    up to `maxsize` results based on a Least Recently Used (LRU)
    algorithm.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=maxsize, typed=typed)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But I need to make sure that this is correct. The standard lru_cache decorator is applied to the function, so this code would work. However, the function lru_cache is a decorator factory, which returns the decorator. So this code is correct.

But maybe the user wants the code to be the actual LRU cache implementation, not using the built-in. But without more details, it's hard to say. However, given the problem statement, I think this is the correct approach.
