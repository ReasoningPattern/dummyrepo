To solve this problem, we need to merge duplicate keys in a list of nodes based on a specific key. If there are multiple nodes with the same key, the nodes should be deeply merged. If the values are non-MappingNode values, the latter value remains. If the values are MappingNodes, they should be deeply merged.

### Approach
1. **Iterate through each node**: We process each node in the input list and check if its key already exists in the result dictionary.
2. **Check for existing key**: If the key exists, we use a helper function to merge the existing value with the new node. If the key does not exist, we add the node directly to the result.
3. **Helper function for deep merge**: The helper function `merge_nodes` takes two nodes and merges them. If both nodes are MappingNodes, they are deeply merged. If one is a MappingNode and the other is not, the latter is returned. If neither is a MappingNode, the latter value is returned.

### Solution Code
```python
def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
        if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
            merged = MappingNode()
            for key in existing:
                if key in new_node:
                    merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
                else:
                    merged[key] = new_node[key]
            return merged
        else:
            if isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
                return new_node
            else:
                return existing

    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        if key in result:
            result[key] = merge_nodes(result[key], node)
        else:
            result[key] = node
    return result
```

### Explanation
- **Iteration and Key Check**: Each node is processed to check if its key exists in the result. If it does, the helper function merges the existing value with the new node.
- **Deep Merge Helper Function**: This function handles the merging of nodes recursively. If both nodes are MappingNodes, they are merged deeply. If one is a MappingNode and the other is not, the latter is returned. This ensures that the latter value overwrites the former if they are non-MappingNodes.
- **Efficiency**: The approach efficiently handles deep merging by leveraging recursion and dictionary operations, ensuring that all nested values are correctly merged without unnecessary overhead.

This solution ensures that duplicate keys are deeply merged while maintaining the order of insertion for non-MatchingNode values, providing an efficient and correct approach to the problem.
