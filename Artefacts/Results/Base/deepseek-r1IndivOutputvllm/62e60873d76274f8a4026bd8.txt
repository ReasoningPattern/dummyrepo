To generate the Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring, we need to implement a function that returns a dictionary of available protocol handlers keyed by version tuples. The function should handle cases where a specific protocol version is requested or when no version is provided.

### Approach
1. **Collect Version Information**: Iterate over each class in the provided `cls` parameter to collect version tuples. Each class may have a `version` attribute that is a tuple. We use a set to collect these versions to avoid duplicates.
2. **Handle Protocol Version**: If a specific `protocol_version` is provided, check if it exists in the collected versions. If it does, return a dictionary with this version as the key and `None` as the value. If it doesn't exist, return an empty dictionary. If no `protocol_version` is provided, return a dictionary containing all collected versions with each version mapping to itself.

### Solution Code
```python
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    versions = set()
    for c in cls:
        version = getattr(c, 'version', None)
        if version is not None:
            versions.add(version)
    
    if protocol_version is None:
        handlers = {v: v for v in versions}
    else:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple or None")
        if protocol_version in versions:
            handlers = {protocol_version: None}
        else:
            handlers = {}
    
    return handlers
```

### Explanation
- **Version Collection**: The function iterates over each class in `cls`, retrieves the `version` attribute, and adds it to a set to ensure uniqueness.
- **Protocol Version Handling**: If `protocol_version` is `None`, the function returns a dictionary where each key is a version tuple and the value is the version itself. If a specific `protocol_version` is provided, it checks if this version exists in the collected versions and returns the appropriate dictionary. If the version is not found, it returns an empty dictionary.
- **Type Checking**: The function raises a `TypeError` if `protocol_version` is not a tuple or `None`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles both cases of `protocol_version` being specified or not, while efficiently collecting and mapping version information from the provided classes.
