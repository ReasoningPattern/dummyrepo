To solve this problem, we need to insert a value into a nested dictionary based on a given key. The key is provided as a string, which represents a chain of nested keys. Each part of the key corresponds to a level in the dictionary, and the value needs to be inserted at the deepest level specified by the key.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:
1. **Split the Key**: Convert the given key string into a list of parts using the dot ('.') character as the delimiter.
2. **Traverse the Dictionary**: Traverse the dictionary using each part of the key. For each part, if it does not exist in the current level of the dictionary, create an empty dictionary for that key.
3. **Insert the Value**: After traversing all parts of the key, insert the value into the dictionary at the deepest level specified by the key.

This approach ensures that each part of the key is handled correctly, and the value is inserted at the appropriate nested level. The function handles cases where intermediate parts of the key might not exist by creating empty dictionaries for those parts.

### Solution Code
```python
def dict_insert(dic, val, key, *keys):
    current = dic
    parts = key.split('.') + list(keys)
    for part in parts[:-1]:
        if part not in current or not isinstance(current[part], dict):
            current[part] = {}
        current = current[part]
    if isinstance(current, dict) and keys[-1] in current:
        current[keys[-1]][val] = val
    else:
        if isinstance(current, dict):
            current[keys[-1]] = {val: val}
        else:
            current[keys[-1]] = val
```

### Explanation
- **Splitting the Key**: The key is split into parts using the dot ('.') character. For example, the key 'a.b.c' is split into ['a', 'b', 'c'].
- **Traversing the Dictionary**: The function iterates through each part of the key. For each part, it checks if the part exists in the current level of the dictionary. If it does not exist, an empty dictionary is created for that part. The function then moves to the next part of the key.
- **Inserting the Value**: After processing all parts of the key, the function inserts the value into the dictionary at the deepest level specified by the key. If the last part of the key does not exist, it is created, and the value is inserted there.

This solution ensures that the dictionary is traversed correctly, and the value is inserted at the appropriate nested level, handling cases where intermediate parts of the key might not exist.
