```python
def create_complex_argumet_type(self, subcommand, type_name, option_name, spec_option):
    # Assume COMPLEX_TYPES is a dictionary with the appropriate functions
    complex_func = COMPLEX_TYPES[type_name]
    # Create a function that applies complex_func with the given parameters
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # args are (self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option
        # But how to pass them? Maybe the wrapper is created with those parameters.
        # Wait, the parameters are passed as (self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option.
        # So the wrapper would need to take those as arguments.
        # However, the function is called as a method, so self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path are already part of the instance.
        # Thus, the wrapper can be created with those parameters.
        # The parameters are passed as (self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, spec_option.
        # So the wrapper would be:
        return complex_func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
