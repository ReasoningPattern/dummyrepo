Okay, I need to write a Python function called file_to_textbuffer that takes a file name and an encoding, and loads the file into a text buffer. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to read the contents of a file and return them as a text buffer. In Python, reading a file is straightforward using the open function. The parameters are file_name and encoding, so I'll need to use those when opening the file.

Wait, the encoding parameter is important here. When opening the file, I should specify the encoding to ensure that the file is read correctly, especially if it's not in the default encoding. So the open statement would be something like open(file_name, 'r', encoding=encoding).

But what about possible exceptions? The user didn't mention error handling, so maybe they just want the basic functionality. The function should return the text buffer, which is probably the entire content of the file as a string. So I'll read the file using read() method.

Putting it all together: the function opens the file in read mode with the given encoding, reads all the content, and returns it. Let me make sure I don't have any typos. The parameters are correctly named? Yes, file_name and encoding. So the code would be:

def file_to_textbuffer(file_name, encoding):
    """
    Load a file toward a text buffer
    """
    with open(file_name, 'r', encoding=encoding) as file:
        return file.read()

Wait, but what if the file doesn't exist? The function might raise a FileNotFoundError. But the user didn't specify handling that, so it's okay to leave it as is. The function is simple and does the job. Let me check if the 'with' statement is necessary. Yes, it's good practice to use a context manager to handle the file, so that it's properly closed after reading. So the code is correct.
