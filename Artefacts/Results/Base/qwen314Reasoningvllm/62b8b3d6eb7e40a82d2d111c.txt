Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the _normalizeargs function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to normalize declaration arguments, which can include Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. The docstring mentions that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what the function does. The name suggests it's normalizing arguments, probably by expanding sequences into individual elements. The parameters are 'sequence' and 'output', which is optional. The output is probably a list or some structure that holds the normalized arguments.

Wait, the docstring says that if the arguments are not individual interfaces or implements specs, they get expanded. So maybe the function is meant to take a sequence (like a list or tuple) and process each element. If an element is a tuple, maybe it's expanded into separate items. But if it's a single interface or implement spec, it's kept as is.

Wait, but what's a Declarion? Maybe that's a typo for 'Declaration'? Or perhaps it's a specific class or term in the context where this function is used. Since the user didn't provide more details, I'll have to make assumptions. Let's assume that Declarions are some objects that need to be handled differently, perhaps not expanded. Similarly, 'interfaces' and 'implements specs' might be specific types or instances that should remain unexpanded.

So the function's task is to process the input sequence. For each element in the sequence, if it's not an individual interface or implement spec, expand it. But how? Maybe if the element is a tuple or a list, we need to unpack them. But if it's a single object (not a sequence), we leave it as is.

Wait, the function's parameters are 'sequence' and 'output'. The output is optional. Maybe the function is supposed to collect the normalized arguments into the output list. If output is None, create a new list. Otherwise, append to it.

Let me think about the steps. The function should iterate over each item in the sequence. For each item, check if it's a tuple or a list (or some other sequence type). If it's a sequence, expand its elements. But if it's an individual interface or implement spec, keep it as is. However, the docstring says that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded. So maybe the check is whether the item is an instance of a specific class, like Interface or ImplementSpec. But since the user hasn't provided those classes, I need to make assumptions here.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to handle cases where the input could be a mix of different types. For example, if the sequence contains tuples, they should be expanded into their elements. But if it's a single interface (like a class or a string representing an interface), it's kept as is. However, without knowing the exact types, I might need to use isinstance checks for common sequence types like tuple or list.

Wait, the original function's name is _normalizeargs, which might be part of a larger system, perhaps related to some kind of declaration processing. Maybe the function is supposed to take a sequence of arguments that can be Declarions (maybe a class or a specific type), tuples, or single interfaces. The normalization process would involve expanding tuples into their elements, but leaving Declarions and individual interfaces as they are.

So, the approach could be: iterate through each element in the sequence. If the element is a tuple or list, iterate through its items and add them to the output. Otherwise, add the element itself. But how to determine if it's an individual interface or implement spec? Maybe those are specific classes, but since they aren't defined, perhaps the function is designed to check if the element is a sequence (like tuple or list) and expand them, otherwise keep as is. That would make sense.

Wait, the docstring says that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded. So if the element is not one of those, it's expanded. So maybe the function checks if the item is an instance of a certain class (like Interface or ImplementSpec), and if not, it's expanded. But without knowing those classes, perhaps the code uses a placeholder or assumes that any non-sequence is considered an individual interface.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the item is a sequence (like a list or tuple) and if so, expand it. But the docstring says that individual interfaces or implements specs are not expanded. So perhaps the function is designed to handle cases where the input is a sequence of elements that can be either individual items (interfaces) or sequences (tuples, lists) that need to be flattened.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a system where arguments can be passed as tuples (for multiple arguments) or single items. The normalization process would flatten any tuples into individual elements. For example, if the input sequence is [ ('a', 'b'), 'c', ('d', 'e', 'f') ], the output would be ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'].

But the docstring mentions Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. So perhaps Declarions are objects that should not be expanded. But again, without knowing what a Declarion is, maybe it's a typo or a specific term in the codebase. Alternatively, maybe it's a reference to a class named Declarion.

But since the user hasn't provided that information, perhaps the function is intended to check if the item is a tuple or list and expand them. So the code would loop through each item in the sequence, and if it's a tuple or list, extend the output with its elements. Otherwise, append the item.

So the code might look something like this:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, (tuple, list)):
            output.extend(item)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but the docstring says that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded. So perhaps the check is whether the item is not an instance of Interface or ImplementSpec. But since those classes aren't defined, maybe the code is using a placeholder or the user expects a certain structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the item is a single interface (like a string or a specific type) and not expand it. For example, if the item is a string, it's kept as is, but if it's a tuple, it's expanded. However, without knowing the exact types, this is a bit ambiguous.

Another possibility: the function is part of a system where arguments can be passed as tuples (for multiple arguments) or as single objects. The normalization process would flatten any tuples into individual elements. So, for example, if the input is a list containing tuples, it would expand them. But if the item is not a tuple, it's added as is.

In that case, the code would check for tuples and lists and expand them. But maybe the original code had more specific checks. However, given the limited information, I think the best approach is to implement a function that flattens tuples and lists within the sequence, appending individual elements to the output.

So, the code would be as I wrote before. Let me test that with some examples.

If sequence is [('a', 'b'), 'c', ('d',)], the output would be ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

If the sequence is ['interface1', ('impl1', 'impl2')], then output would be ['interface1', 'impl1', 'impl2'].

But the docstring says that individual interfaces or implements specs are not expanded. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the item is an instance of a specific class. However, without knowing what those classes are, perhaps the user expects a generic approach where sequences are expanded, and others are not. So the code would handle tuples and lists as sequences to expand, and other objects as individual items.

Therefore, the code would be as I thought earlier. Also, the output parameter is optional, so if provided, it appends to it, else creates a new list.

Wait, but the function's parameters are 'sequence' and 'output'. The output is a list that's being built. So the function might be designed to modify the output list in place. But in Python, lists are mutable, so if you pass output and extend it, the original list outside the function would be modified. However, the function returns the output, which might be the same as the input if output is provided.

But the code example I wrote returns the output list. However, the original function's docstring doesn't mention returning anything, but the signature shows that the function returns something (since it's a def with no return statement, but in Python, it would return None by default). Wait, the original code has no return statement. But the user's example might expect that the function builds the output list and returns it.

Wait, the user provided the function signature with output=None, but didn't show the return. However, in the docstring, the function is supposed to normalize the arguments. So maybe the function returns the output list. Therefore, the code should create a new list if output is None, otherwise use the provided output.

But the code I wrote would do that. So, the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, (tuple, list)):
            output.extend(item)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

But maybe the function is supposed to handle more than just tuples and lists. For example, other iterable types? But the docstring mentions tuples specifically, so perhaps only tuples and lists are considered for expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the item is a Declarion (a specific class) or an interface (another class), and if not, expand it. But since those classes aren't defined, perhaps the code uses isinstance checks for those classes. However, without knowing their names, I can't write that code. So maybe the user expects a generic solution where any sequence (tuple, list) is expanded, and others are kept as is.

Another thought: the function may be part of a larger system where 'Declarions' are objects that have a specific structure. But since the user hasn't provided that, I'll proceed with the assumption that sequences (tuples and lists) are to be expanded, and other items are kept as individual elements.

So the code would be as above. Let me make sure that the function is handling the output correctly. If output is provided, it appends to it. Otherwise, creates a new list. Then returns the output.

Yes, that seems to fit. So the generated code would be that.
