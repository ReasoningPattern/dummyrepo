Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function find_path_type that returns a string indicating the type of thing at the given path. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a 'path' parameter. I assume this is a file system path. So, I need to check if the path exists and determine if it's a file, directory, or something else. The standard way to do this in Python is using os.path module functions like os.path.exists, os.path.isfile, and os.path.isdir.

Wait, but the user didn't specify whether the path is a file path or a directory path. The function should check both. So the steps would be: check if the path exists. If it does, determine if it's a file or directory. If not, return something like 'does not exist'.

But what about other types, like symbolic links or special files? The docstring says "type of thing", so maybe it's more comprehensive. However, the most common types are files and directories. Let me stick with those for now unless there's a need to handle more.

So the function would first check if the path exists. If not, return 'does not exist'. If it does, check if it's a file using isfile. If yes, return 'file'. Else, check if it's a directory with isdir. If yes, return 'directory'. Otherwise, maybe return 'other' or 'unknown'.

Wait, but on some systems, there might be other types like devices, sockets, etc. But perhaps the user just wants basic categorization. Let me proceed with file, directory, and other.

Also, need to handle possible exceptions. For example, if the path is a directory but not accessible, or if there are permission issues. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so maybe it's assumed that the path is valid, or we just return based on what we can check.

So, the code would be:

Import os.

def find_path_type(path):
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        return 'does not exist'
    elif os.path.isfile(path):
        return 'file'
    elif os.path.isdir(path):
        return 'directory'
    else:
        return 'other'

Wait, but what about if the path is a symlink? For example, if it's a symlink to a file or directory. The isfile and isdir functions follow the symlink by default. So if the path is a symlink pointing to a file, isfile would return True. But maybe the user wants to know if the path itself is a symlink. However, the docstring isn't specific. The original problem says "the type of thing at the given path", which might refer to the target. But perhaps the function is supposed to check the type of the path itself, not following symlinks. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous.

But given the function's name and the typical use cases, I think checking the type of the path's target (following symlinks) is more likely. However, the default behavior of os.path.isfile and isdir is to follow symlinks. For example, if the path is a symlink to a file, isfile returns True. If the user wants to check the type of the symlink itself, they would need to use os.path.islink. But the problem statement isn't clear on that. Since the original function's docstring is vague, I'll proceed with the standard approach, which is to check the target's type.

Another thing: the function should return a string. So the possible returns are 'file', 'directory', 'does not exist', or 'other'.

Testing this function: if the path is a regular file, returns 'file'; if a directory, 'directory'; if it doesn't exist, 'does not exist'; else, 'other'.

I think that's a reasonable approach. So the code would be as I outlined.
