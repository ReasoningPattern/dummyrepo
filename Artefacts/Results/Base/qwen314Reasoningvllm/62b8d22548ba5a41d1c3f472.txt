Okay, I need to generate a Python function called cachedmethod based on the given signature and docstring. The parameters are cache, key=hashkey, and lock=None. The docstring says it returns a decorator that can call a result in the cache.

First, I remember that decorators in Python are functions that wrap other functions. So cachedmethod should return a decorator that can be used to cache method results. The cache is probably a dictionary or some similar structure. The key parameter is set to hashkey by default, which I think is a function that generates a hashable key from the method's arguments. The lock is for thread safety, maybe using a threading.Lock.

So the decorator needs to check if the result for a given key is already in the cache. If it is, return it; otherwise, compute it and store it in the cache. But since it's a method, I have to consider the instance (self) and maybe the class. Wait, the key function might need to include the instance or class in the key to avoid conflicts between different instances.

The hashkey function isn't defined here, but maybe it's from somewhere else, like functools. Oh right, in Python's functools, there's a function called _make_key that's used for lru_cache. But the user provided key=hashkey, so perhaps they expect that hashkey is a predefined function that generates the key. Alternatively, maybe they want to use a default key function that uses the arguments and maybe the instance.

Wait, the parameters for the decorator: the cache is passed in, and the key function is used to generate the key from the method's arguments. The lock is optional for synchronization.

So the cachedmethod function will create a decorator. Let me think about how to structure this. The decorator needs to take a method and return a wrapped version. The wrapped method should check the cache using the key function. If the key is present, return the cached value. Otherwise, compute it, store it in the cache, and return.

But how to handle the instance? For methods, the first argument is self. So when the key function is called, it should include self as part of the key. Otherwise, different instances would overwrite each other's cached results. So maybe the key function needs to be adjusted to include the instance.

Wait, the default key is hashkey. Maybe hashkey is a function that takes the method's arguments and returns a hashable key. But if the method is part of a class, the instance (self) should be part of the key. So perhaps the key function should be something like functools._make_key, which includes the arguments and the instance.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the key function is designed to handle the method's parameters, including the instance. So the decorator would use the key function to generate a key from the method's arguments, including self.

So the steps for the decorator:

1. When the method is called, generate a key using the key function, which probably takes the method's arguments (including self) and returns a hashable value.
2. Check if the key is in the cache. If yes, return the cached result.
3. If not, compute the result by calling the original method, then store it in the cache with the generated key.
4. Use a lock if provided to make the cache access thread-safe.

But how to implement this? Let me think about the structure. The cachedmethod function returns a decorator, which is a function that takes a method and returns a wrapped function.

So the code would look something like:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            # generate key using key function, maybe with self, args, kwargs
            k = key(self, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if k in cache:
                        return cache[k]
                    else:
                        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                        cache[k] = result
                        return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                else:
                    result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the key function's default is hashkey. However, in Python, the hashkey might not be a standard function. Maybe the user intended to use a function similar to functools.lru_cache's key generation. Alternatively, perhaps hashkey is a placeholder, and the actual key function needs to be defined. But since the user provided the default as hashkey, maybe they expect that the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the arguments, including the instance.

But I need to make sure that the key function is called with the correct parameters. The default key is hashkey, which I assume is a function that takes the arguments of the method (including self) and returns a hashable key. However, in standard Python, there's no built-in hashkey function. Maybe the user meant to use a function that creates a tuple of the arguments and the instance, then hashes them. Or perhaps they are using a custom hashkey function from somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to be the same as the one used in functools.lru_cache, which uses the arguments and the instance. But without knowing the exact implementation of hashkey, I have to proceed with the given info.

Another point: the cache is probably a dictionary. The lock is for concurrent access. So when using the lock, we need to acquire it before checking the cache and storing the result.

But in the code above, the lock is used in a with statement. However, if the lock is not provided, then no synchronization is done. That's okay.

Wait, but in the code, when the lock is present, the with lock: block will handle acquiring and releasing. However, the code as written would check the cache inside the lock. But if the key is not present, it would compute the result inside the lock as well. That's correct to prevent race conditions.

But the problem is that the key function might not be properly handling the arguments. For example, if the method has parameters, the key function should generate a key based on those. So the default key function, hashkey, probably takes the arguments and returns a tuple or something hashable.

Wait, maybe the user intended for the key function to be similar to the one in functools, which uses the arguments and the instance. But since the default is hashkey, perhaps that's a typo or placeholder. Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to be a function that takes the method's arguments and returns a key. So the user would pass in a key function, like lambda self, *args, **kwargs: (self, args, kwargs), but that's not hashable. So maybe the key function is supposed to generate a tuple of hashable elements.

But since the user hasn't provided the implementation of hashkey, I need to assume that it's a function that can generate a key from the method's arguments. So in the code, when the wrapper is called, it uses key(self, *args, **kwargs) to generate the key.

Wait, but the key function's parameters? If the key is supposed to be a function that generates the key, then the default is hashkey, which may be a predefined function. However, in Python's standard library, there's no such function. Maybe the user meant to use a function that creates a key from the arguments, like using the parameters of the method. So perhaps the key function should be something like:

def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But that's just a guess. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, not to assume any specific implementation of hashkey. Therefore, the code should use the key function as provided, which is passed to cachedmethod.

So the code structure would be as follows: the decorator wraps the method, and when the method is called, it generates a key using the key function, which is passed the instance (self) and the method's arguments. Then, it checks the cache, and if the key is present, returns it. Otherwise, computes the result, stores it in the cache, and returns.

But how to handle the lock? The lock is passed to cachedmethod, and if it's not None, the code should use it to synchronize access to the cache.

Another thing: the wrapper function needs to be a method, so it should be bound to the instance. However, when using decorators, the wrapper is usually a function that's called with the instance as the first argument. So the code above seems okay.

Wait, but the key function might need to be called with the method's arguments, including self. So in the wrapper, when we call key(self, *args, **kwargs), that's correct.

But what if the key function is not designed to take self? Well, the user's responsibility is to provide the correct key function. The default is hashkey, which presumably is designed to handle that.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            k = key(self, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if k in cache:
                        return cache[k]
                    else:
                        result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                        cache[k] = result
                        return result
            else:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                else:
                    result = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, this code might have an issue with the lock. Because if two threads try to access the same key, they might both check if it's in the cache, and if not, compute it. But with the lock, the first thread will acquire it, check, compute, and store. The second thread will wait until the lock is released. That's correct.

However, the code for the wrapper is duplicated for the lock case and no lock case. Maybe we can factor that out.

Alternatively, the code can be written as:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            k = key(self, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if k not in cache:
                        cache[k] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
            else:
                if k not in cache:
                    cache[k] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)
            return cache[k]
        return wrapper
    return decorator

This way, whether there's a lock or not, the code checks if the key is in the cache. If not, compute and store. Then return the value. This is more concise.

But what about the case where the key is not in the cache, and during the computation, another thread adds it? Well, with the lock, that's prevented. Without the lock, it's possible for multiple threads to compute the same value. But the lock is optional, so the user would have to handle that if they need thread safety.

Another thing: the key function might not be hashkey. The user can pass a custom key function. So the code uses the key parameter as a function to generate the key.

But in Python, the default value for key is hashkey. However, if hashkey is not defined, this code would throw a NameError. So maybe the user expects that hashkey is a predefined function, perhaps from functools or another module. But since the problem doesn't mention it, I'll proceed with the code as is.

So the final code would be as above. Let me check for possible errors.

Wait, in the case where lock is not None, the code uses the lock to protect the cache access. However, the code first checks if k is in cache, then if not, computes and stores. But if two threads enter the wrapper at the same time, and the key is not in the cache, the first thread will acquire the lock, check, and compute. The second thread will wait until the lock is released. Once the first thread stores the value, the second thread can then return it.

Yes, that's correct. So the code is okay.

But what about the key function? Suppose the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the method's arguments. For example, if the method is part of a class, and the key is based on self and the arguments. So the key function should take the instance, args, and kwargs. The default hashkey function is probably designed for that.

So the code should be correct. Now, I need to write this in Python syntax, making sure that the decorator is properly structured.

Another thing: the wrapper function should have the same name as the original method, but in Python, the name is preserved via the __name__ attribute, but that's handled automatically when using decorators.

So the code seems okay. Now, I'll write it as per the instructions.
