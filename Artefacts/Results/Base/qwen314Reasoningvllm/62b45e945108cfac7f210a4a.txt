Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_hierarchy method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does.

The function is supposed to validate the storage root hierarchy. The parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings. The return values are num_objects and good_objects. 

First, I should figure out what the method is doing. Since it's part of a class (self is present), maybe it's related to some storage structure, like a tree or hierarchy of objects. The parameters suggest that it can validate individual objects and check their digests, and whether to show warnings.

The docstring says it returns the number of objects checked and the number of valid ones. So, I need to initialize counters for these. If validate_objects is True, then the method should check each object in the hierarchy. If check_digests is True, it might verify some kind of hash or digest value for each object. The show_warnings parameter would control if any warnings are printed during validation.

I don't have the actual implementation details, but I can make some assumptions. For example, maybe the hierarchy is stored in a data structure like a list or a tree, and each object has a method to check its validity. If check_digests is True, then each object's digest is validated. 

I'll start by initializing num_objects and good_objects to 0. Then, iterate over all objects in the hierarchy. For each object, increment num_objects. Then, check if it's valid. If validate_objects is True, perform the validation. If check_digests is also True, maybe check the digest as part of the validation. If the object is valid, increment good_objects. If show_warnings is True, print any issues found.

Wait, but how does the hierarchy look? Maybe the class has a root attribute that's the top of the hierarchy, and each node has children. So, I need to traverse the hierarchy, perhaps using a recursive approach or a queue.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize counters.
2. Traverse the hierarchy starting from the root.
3. For each object encountered:
   a. Increment num_objects.
   b. Check if it's valid based on validate_objects and check_digests.
   c. If valid, increment good_objects.
   d. If show_warnings is True, log any issues.
4. Return the counters.

But since I don't know the actual structure, I'll have to make placeholders. Maybe the method has access to a root node, and each node has a 'children' attribute. So, a BFS or DFS traversal would be needed.

Also, the parameters validate_objects and check_digests might be flags that determine which checks are performed. For example, if validate_objects is False, we don't check the objects themselves, but maybe still check digests? Or perhaps check_digests is only relevant if validate_objects is True.

I need to make sure that the code structure aligns with the parameters. Let me think of a possible implementation. The method might have a root attribute, and each object has a validate method. So:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Assuming self.root is the top of the hierarchy
    # Traverse all objects in the hierarchy
    # Maybe using a queue for BFS
    queue = [self.root]
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        num_objects += 1
        is_valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            # Check object validity
            if not current.is_valid():
                is_valid = False
        if check_digests:
            # Check digest
            if not current.check_digest():
                is_valid = False
        if is_valid:
            good_objects += 1
        else:
            if show_warnings:
                print(f"Warning: Invalid object found at {current.path}")
        # Add children to the queue
        queue.extend(current.children)
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is just a guess. The actual code would depend on how the hierarchy is structured and what methods are available on the objects. Since the user hasn't provided specific details, I'll need to use placeholders like is_valid() and check_digest() methods. Also, the path attribute might not exist, but for the sake of example, I can include it.

Alternatively, maybe the objects are stored in a list, and the method checks each one. But without knowing the actual data structure, it's hard to say. However, the function's purpose is to validate the hierarchy, so traversal is likely involved.

I should make sure that the parameters are used correctly. If validate_objects is False, then even if check_digests is True, maybe the object's digest isn't checked unless the object is validated. Or maybe check_digests is a separate check. The code above assumes that both checks are done if their flags are True, regardless of each other.

Another thing: the return type is two values, so the function returns a tuple. The code should return (num_objects, good_objects).

I think that's a reasonable approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, using placeholders for the actual validation logic, assuming that each object in the hierarchy has methods is_valid() and check_digest(), and that the hierarchy is traversed via a BFS approach starting from self.root.
