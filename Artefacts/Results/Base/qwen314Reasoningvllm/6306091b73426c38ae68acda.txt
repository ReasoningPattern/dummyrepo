Okay, I need to generate Python code for the plugins_manager function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what the docstring says. It mentions getting the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

So, the function is a method that retrieves a plugin manager from some service. The parameter is 'cls', which suggests it's a class method. The docstring refers to ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER, so I should probably use that as a key when calling cls._get_service().

Wait, the function is defined with 'cls' as the parameter, so it's likely a class method. But in Python, class methods are defined with @classmethod, but the given code doesn't have that. Hmm, maybe the user expects it to be a regular method, but the parameter is 'cls' which is a bit confusing. Or perhaps it's a static method? Or maybe it's intended to be used as a class method.

But the original code provided doesn't have the @classmethod decorator. The user might have made a mistake, but I should follow the given signature. So the function is a method that takes 'cls' as an argument. Maybe it's intended to be called on the class, not an instance. But in Python, if it's a class method, the first parameter is 'cls', and if it's a static method, it might not have that. However, the user's code shows def plugins_manager(cls):, so I need to stick with that.

The function's purpose is to get the plugin manager from the service. So the code would call cls._get_service() and pass ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER as the argument. But where is ServiceName defined? It's probably an enum or a class with a PLUGINS_MANAGER attribute. Since the user didn't provide that, I'll assume it's a predefined constant.

So the code inside the function would be returning cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER). But wait, the original code's docstring says "via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()", which might mean that the _get_service method is called with that key. Therefore, the function should return the result of cls._get_service() using that key.

But how is ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER structured? Maybe it's a string or an enum value. The code should reference it correctly. Since the user hasn't provided the ServiceName definition, I'll just use it as is, assuming it's available in the scope.

Putting it all together, the function would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

Wait, but the original code's function is written with 'cls' as the parameter. So when called, it's probably meant to be a class method. However, in Python, if you define a function with 'cls' as the first parameter, it's not automatically a class method unless decorated with @classmethod. But the user's code doesn't have that. Maybe they intended it to be a regular method, but that's a bit odd. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given signature, so I shouldn't add the decorator unless specified.

So the code is as simple as that. Just call cls._get_service with the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. But I need to make sure that ServiceName is properly referenced. If it's a module-level variable, then it's okay. If it's part of the class, maybe it's cls.ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. But the docstring says "in cls._get_service()", so maybe the _get_service method is part of the class, and ServiceName is a separate entity.

Alternatively, maybe ServiceName is a class attribute. But without more context, it's safer to assume that ServiceName is a predefined constant, perhaps from another module or the same class. However, since the user hasn't provided that, I'll just use ServiceName as is. So the code would be returning cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER). 

I think that's the correct approach here. The function is straightforward, just accessing the service with the specified key. So the generated code should be that return statement.
