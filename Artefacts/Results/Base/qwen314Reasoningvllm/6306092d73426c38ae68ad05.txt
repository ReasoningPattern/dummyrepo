Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_option_spec based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it gets the specification for a specified option name. It mentions using self.get_parser_option_specs() to get options of the given command_name. So, the function probably needs to retrieve the options for a command and then find the specific one by argument_name.

First, I should check if the method get_parser_option_specs is already defined in the class. Since the user provided the function signature, I assume that method exists. The function needs to take command_name and argument_name as parameters.

The steps might be: call self.get_parser_option_specs() with command_name, which returns a dictionary or a list of options. Then, look up the argument_name in that result. If found, return the corresponding spec; otherwise, maybe return None or raise an error.

Wait, the docstring doesn't specify handling for when the option isn't found. But the function's purpose is to get the spec, so perhaps it's expected to return None if not present. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to raise a KeyError or something similar. However, since the original code isn't provided, I need to make an assumption here.

Looking at the parameters, the function is part of a class (since it uses self). The get_parser_option_specs method is likely a helper that returns all option specs for a command. So, the get_option_spec function would call that helper, then retrieve the specific argument.

So the code would be something like:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    return options.get(argument_name)

But wait, what if get_parser_option_specs returns a list instead of a dictionary? Then, the code would need to iterate through the list to find the option with the matching argument name. However, the docstring says "get the specification for the specified option name," implying that argument_name is a key in the options structure.

Alternatively, maybe get_parser_option_specs returns a dictionary where keys are option names, so using .get() makes sense. That seems more likely. So the code would retrieve the options for the command and then get the specific argument's spec.

I think that's the right approach. The function calls get_parser_option_specs with command_name, then uses get on the resulting dictionary to find the argument_name. If it's not present, returns None. That's a common pattern. So the code would be as I wrote above.
