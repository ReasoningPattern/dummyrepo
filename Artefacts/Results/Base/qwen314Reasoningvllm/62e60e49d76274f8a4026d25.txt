Okay, I need to generate a Python function called unit_of_work that returns a decorator. The decorator should have metadata and timeout attributes. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function unit_of_work takes two optional parameters: metadata and timeout. The goal is to create a decorator that can be applied to other functions. Decorators in Python are usually functions that return another function, so I'll need to structure this accordingly.

Wait, the docstring says the decorator has metadata and timeout attributes. So maybe the decorator itself is a class or a function that can hold those attributes. But since the function returns a decorator, perhaps it's a function that wraps another function and adds those attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a class-based decorator that can store metadata and timeout as instance variables. But the function signature is for a function, not a class. Let me check the standard way to create decorators with parameters.

Right, when a decorator has parameters, it's typically a function that returns a decorator. So unit_of_work is a function that takes metadata and timeout, and returns a decorator. The decorator itself would be a function that takes the target function and possibly other parameters.

Wait, but in Python, the standard way is that the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper function. So maybe the unit_of_work function returns a decorator function that can be applied to another function. The metadata and timeout would be part of the decorator's state.

So the structure would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # maybe assign metadata and timeout to the func or the decorator
        # then return a wrapper function
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # some logic here, maybe using the metadata and timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes. So perhaps the metadata and timeout are stored on the decorator function itself. Or maybe on the wrapped function. Let me think. If someone applies the decorator to a function, they might want to access those attributes later. For example, if they have a function decorated with @unit_of_work(metadata={'key': 'value'}, timeout=10), then the decorated function should have access to metadata and timeout.

So, maybe when the decorator is applied, it adds those attributes to the function. So inside the decorator, after wrapping, we can set func.metadata = metadata and func.timeout = timeout. But in Python, functions can have attributes assigned to them. So that's possible.

Wait, but the unit_of_work function returns the decorator. So the decorator is the function that takes func as an argument. Let me adjust that. The outer function unit_of_work is the one that takes metadata and timeout. Then, it returns a decorator, which is a function that takes the target function and returns a wrapper.

So, in the decorator function, when it's applied to a function, it can set the metadata and timeout as attributes of that function. Let me try writing that.

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        func.metadata = metadata
        func.timeout = timeout
        return func
    return decorator

Wait, but that would just assign the attributes to the original function and return it. But if the decorator is supposed to wrap the function, maybe there's more to it. However, the problem statement doesn't mention any specific behavior of the decorator beyond having those attributes. So maybe the decorator is just adding the attributes and not modifying the function's behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is intended to be used with some kind of unit of work pattern, like managing transactions or something. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I shouldn't assume. The main thing is that the decorator has those attributes.

So the code above would work. When you apply @unit_of_work(metadata=..., timeout=...), the decorator function is called with the parameters, and then it takes the function and assigns the attributes. But wait, in Python, when you use a decorator, the syntax @decorator is equivalent to func = decorator(func). So if the decorator returns the original function with attributes added, that's acceptable.

But maybe the user expects the decorator to have those attributes, not the decorated function. Hmm. Let me re-read the docstring: "Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes." So the decorator itself (the function returned by unit_of_work) should have those attributes. Wait, but the parameters are passed to unit_of_work, which returns the decorator. So the decorator function (the one that's returned by unit_of_work) would have the metadata and timeout as parameters. But how to store them as attributes?

Wait, perhaps the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that is a closure capturing metadata and timeout. Then, when the decorator is applied to a function, it can use those parameters. But the problem says the decorator has those attributes. So maybe the decorator function (the one returned by unit_of_work) has attributes metadata and timeout. But how to set that?

Wait, the unit_of_work function is creating a decorator. So when you call unit_of_work(metadata=..., timeout=...), it returns a decorator function that has those parameters. But if the decorator is supposed to have those as attributes, then perhaps we can assign them to the decorator function.

So modifying the code:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # maybe the decorator itself has the metadata and timeout?
        # Or the wrapped function?
        # According to the docstring, the decorator has those attributes.
        # So perhaps assign them to the decorator function.
        decorator.metadata = metadata
        decorator.timeout = timeout
        return func
    return decorator

But then, when you apply the decorator, the decorator's attributes are set. However, the returned function is the original func. So the attributes would be on the decorator, not on the decorated function. But how would that be useful? Maybe the decorator is used in some framework where the decorator's attributes are accessed.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the decorated function has those attributes. Let's check the example. Suppose someone does:

@unit_of_work(metadata={'a': 1}, timeout=5)
def my_func():
    pass

Then, my_func.metadata should be {'a': 1} and my_func.timeout should be 5. So in that case, the decorator needs to assign those attributes to the function it's decorating.

So the correct approach is that the decorator function (the one returned by unit_of_work) takes the func, assigns the metadata and timeout as attributes to func, and returns it. So the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        func.metadata = metadata
        func.timeout = timeout
        return func
    return decorator

But wait, in this case, the decorator is a function that takes func and returns it with attributes. But when you use @decorator, the function is replaced by the return value of the decorator. So this would work. The decorated function would have those attributes.

So that's probably the correct approach. The code is straightforward. Let me make sure that the parameters are correctly handled. The unit_of_work function is a factory that creates a decorator with specific metadata and timeout. Then, when the decorator is applied to a function, it adds those attributes to the function.

Yes, that seems to fit the docstring. The code would look like that. So the final code is as written above. Let me test this in my mind. If I call unit_of_work with metadata and timeout, it returns a decorator. Applying that decorator to a function adds the attributes. So the code should be correct.
