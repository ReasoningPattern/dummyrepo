Okay, I need to write a Python function called replace_dots that takes two arguments: value and arg. The docstring says it replaces all '.' in the given string with arg. So the task is straightforward. Let me think about how to do this.

Hmm, in Python, the string method replace can be used here. The replace method replaces all occurrences of a substring with another. So for example, 'a.b.c'.replace('.', 'x') would become 'axbx'. So applying that here, I should take the value string and replace every '.' with the arg string.

Wait, the parameters are value and arg. So the function would return value.replace('.', arg). That seems simple enough. Let me check if there are any edge cases. What if value is not a string? Well, the function expects a string as per the docstring, but maybe I should handle that? But the problem says to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, so perhaps we assume that value is a string. The docstring says "given string", so probably the inputs are correctly typed.

So the code would be:

def replace_dots(value, arg):
    """
    Replaces all values of '.' to arg from the given string
    Args:
        value: old string
        arg: new string to replace '.'
    Returns:
        str, the replaced string
    """
    return value.replace('.', arg)

That's it. I think that's all. Let me make sure there's no typo. The function name is correct, the parameters are in the right order. The replace method's first argument is the substring to replace, which is '.', and the second is the replacement string, which is arg. Yes, that's right. So the code should work as expected.
