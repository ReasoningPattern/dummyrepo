Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_fill_compute_el based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring says the function checks if the obj class has fill and compute methods. So, the task is to determine whether the object's class has both methods.

First, I should think about how to check if a class has certain methods. In Python, you can use the hasattr() function to check for the presence of an attribute, which includes methods. So, for the object obj, I need to check if its class has both 'fill' and 'compute' methods.

Wait, but the function is named is_fill_compute_el. Maybe 'el' stands for something, but the docstring doesn't mention it. The name might be a typo or shorthand. However, the docstring clearly states that it's checking for fill and compute methods. So I'll focus on that.

The function takes an obj as an argument. So, inside the function, I'll check if the obj has both methods. But wait, the docstring says "obj class has the fill and compute methods." So maybe it's checking the class of the object, not the instance. But in Python, methods are attributes of the class. However, when you check hasattr on an instance, it will look for the method in the instance's class hierarchy. So perhaps checking the instance is sufficient.

So the code would be something like:

return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'compute')

But wait, maybe the docstring is referring to the class itself, not the instance. For example, if the obj is a class, then check if the class has those methods. But the function's parameter is obj, which is likely an instance. However, the wording says "obj class has the methods," which could mean checking the class's attributes.

Wait, the function is called is_fill_compute_el. Maybe 'el' refers to element, but that's unclear. However, the docstring is clear: check if the obj's class has fill and compute methods.

So, perhaps the function is intended to check if the class of the object (not the instance) has those methods. But in Python, when you have an instance, you can check the class's methods via the __class__ attribute. However, using hasattr on the instance will check if the method exists in the instance's class or any parent classes. So maybe the function is intended to check if the instance has those methods, which would be the same as checking the class hierarchy.

But the docstring says "obj class has the fill and compute methods." So maybe the function is supposed to check the class itself, not the instance. For example, if the obj is a class, then check if it has those methods as class attributes. But that's a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to check if the object has both methods, regardless of whether they are inherited. The standard way to check for method existence in an instance is using hasattr. So the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods.
    """
    return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'compute')

But maybe the user wants to check if the class (not the instance) has those methods. For example, if the obj is an instance, then checking the class would be:

return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')

But that's not common. Usually, when you check for methods on an instance, you use the instance itself. However, the docstring says "obj class has the methods," which might imply checking the class's attributes. But in Python, when you use hasattr on the instance, it will look up the method in the class hierarchy. So maybe the original code is correct.

But perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring. Let me think again. The function's name is is_fill_compute_el. Maybe 'el' is a typo for 'has'? Not sure. But the docstring says to check if the obj's class has those methods. So, the function should check if the class of obj has both methods.

Wait, but if the obj is an instance, then the class is obj.__class__. So, the code would check if obj's class has the methods. However, in Python, when you check hasattr(obj, 'method'), it checks if the instance has the method, which could be from the class or inherited. But if the user specifically wants to check the class itself (not inherited), then we need to check the __dict__ of the class. But that's more complicated.

The original docstring says "obj class has the fill and compute methods." So perhaps the function is intended to check if the class (not the instance) has those methods. But how to do that? For example, if the obj is an instance, then the class is obj.__class__. So, checking if obj.__class__ has those methods as attributes.

But in Python, methods are usually defined on the class, and instances can access them. So, using hasattr(obj, 'fill') would return True if the method exists in the class or any parent classes. However, if the user wants to check if the class itself (not inherited) has the methods, then we need to check the class's __dict__.

But the docstring doesn't specify that. It just says "obj class has the methods." So maybe the intended approach is to check if the obj's class has those methods, regardless of inheritance. But that's not standard. Typically, you check if the instance has the method, which includes inherited ones.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the class (the type of obj) has both methods. So, the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods.
    """
    cls = obj.__class__
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

But that's the same as checking the instance, because when you check hasattr on the instance, it will look up the class. Wait, no. If the instance has an overridden method, then hasattr(obj, 'fill') would return True even if the class doesn't have it. But if the method is defined in the class, then it's present. However, the function's docstring says to check the class, not the instance. So maybe the correct approach is to check the class's attributes, not the instance's.

But in Python, the hasattr function on the instance will check the class hierarchy. So if the method is present in the class or any parent class, it will return True. But if the user wants to check if the class itself (not any parent) has the methods, then we need to check the class's __dict__.

But the docstring is ambiguous. However, given the function's name and the docstring, the most straightforward interpretation is that the function checks if the object has both fill and compute methods. So the code would be as simple as using hasattr on the obj.

But perhaps the user intended to check the class, not the instance. For example, if the obj is a class, then check if it has those methods. But that's not the usual case. Let me think again. The function's name is is_fill_compute_el, which might be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be is_fill_compute_able? Or something else. But given the information, I have to go with the docstring.

The docstring says: Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods. So, the class of obj must have both methods. So, the code would check if the class (obj.__class__) has those methods. However, in Python, when you check hasattr on the class, it will check the class and its parents. So, perhaps the user wants to check if the class (not the instance) has those methods. But how to do that?

Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the object has those methods. For example, if the obj is an instance of a class that has fill and compute methods. In that case, the code would be:

return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'compute')

But I need to make sure that the code is correct based on the given docstring. The docstring says "obj class has the fill and compute methods." So, perhaps the function is intended to check if the class (the type of obj) has those methods. For example, if the obj is an instance, then the class is obj.__class__, and we check if that class has the methods.

But in Python, the hasattr(obj, 'fill') would check if the obj's class (or any parent) has the method. So, the code could be written either way. However, if the user wants to check if the class itself (not inherited) has the methods, then the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods.
    """
    return 'fill' in obj.__class__.__dict__ and 'compute' in obj.__class__.__dict__

But that's more restrictive. However, the docstring doesn't specify whether inherited methods should be considered. Since the docstring says "obj class has the methods," it's possible that they want the methods to be directly present in the class, not inherited. But that's not clear.

But given that the function is named is_fill_compute_el, maybe it's checking if the object is of a class that has those methods. The most common way to check if an object has a method is to use hasattr on the instance. So, the code would be:

return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'compute')

But the docstring says "obj class has the methods," which could be interpreted as checking the class's attributes. However, in practice, when you check hasattr(obj, 'method'), it checks the class hierarchy. So maybe the user intended that.

But to be safe, perhaps the user wants to check if the class (the type of obj) has those methods, regardless of whether they are inherited. However, that's not standard. For example, if a parent class has the method, then the instance will have it, but the class's __dict__ may not.

But the docstring is a bit unclear. However, given the function's name and the docstring, the most straightforward implementation is checking if the object has both methods. Therefore, the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods.
    """
    return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'compute')

But maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant to check if the object has those methods. That's the most common scenario. So I think that's the correct approach.
