Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the formatmany function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, probably a database or query formatter. The parameters are sql, which is an AnyStr, and many_params, which can be either an iterable of dictionaries with keys as Union[str, int] and values as Any, or an iterable of sequences. The return type is a tuple containing the converted SQL string and a list of either dictionaries or sequences, depending on the input.

First, I should check what self._converter.convert_many does. Since the docstring says to convert sql using that method, the function likely calls it. The parameters for convert_many might be similar. The function needs to handle both cases for many_params: either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. But how does the converter know which one to use? Maybe the converter can handle both types, or perhaps the function needs to determine the type and pass it accordingly.

Wait, the return type includes a list of either Dict or Sequence. So the function probably returns the same structure as many_params. So maybe the code checks if the elements of many_params are dicts or sequences and then uses that to determine the output type.

But the function's job is to call self._converter.convert_many with the sql and many_params, then return the converted SQL and the same many_params structure. However, the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many", which implies that the converter's method is responsible for the conversion. So maybe the function just delegates to that method and returns the result along with the parameters?

Wait, the return type is a tuple of the converted SQL and the same many_params structure. So the function's body would be something like:

return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But wait, the parameters for convert_many might be different. Let me think. The function signature for formatmany has sql and many_params as parameters. The converter's convert_many method probably takes similar parameters. So the code is straightforward: call the converter's method and return the tuple.

But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. The many_params is an iterable of either dicts or sequences. The converter's method might expect the same. So the code would be:

def formatmany(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:
		"""
		Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many
		"""
		return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But wait, the return type is a tuple where the first element is the converted SQL (AnyStr) and the second is a list of either dicts or sequences. The converter's method might return a tuple of (converted_sql, params_list). So the formatmany function just returns that tuple.

I think that's all. The code is simple, just delegating the call. No need for additional logic here. The type hints are already provided, so the implementation is just the return statement.
