Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the function get_nested_custom_and_control_args based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to split the input arguments into control, nested, and custom ones. The return is two dictionaries: control_args and nested_args. Wait, the docstring says it returns a tuple of (control_args, nested_args), but the custom arguments are mentioned as being part of the nested ones? Or maybe the custom arguments are a separate part?

The docstring says that control arguments are those that control the IR behavior and aren't put into the spec yml. Nested arguments are used by Ansible playbooks and go into the spec. Custom arguments are variables used instead of normal nested ones. Hmm, so maybe the function is supposed to separate the args into control_args (which are not included in the spec) and nested_args (which are included, but maybe some are custom? Or perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested ones but need to be handled differently? The docstring isn't entirely clear on that.

Wait, the return is two dicts: control_args and nested_args. The custom arguments are mentioned as being custom ansible variables to replace normal nested usage. So maybe the custom args are part of the nested_args but need to be identified somehow. But the function's return doesn't include a custom_args dict. The problem might be that the user wants to split the args into control and nested, but also identify which of the nested are custom. However, the return type is only two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but the function is supposed to separate the control ones from the rest, and then within the nested, perhaps there's a way to mark them as custom. But the return is just two dicts. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the input args into control arguments (which are not part of the spec) and nested arguments (which are part of the spec). The custom arguments might be a subset of the nested ones that are intended to be used as custom variables. But how to determine which are custom? The function's parameters don't mention any way to distinguish them. 

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where certain prefixes or keys indicate whether an argument is a control argument or a nested/custom one. For example, maybe control arguments have a specific prefix like '--control' or something. But since the problem doesn't specify, I need to make assumptions here.

Looking at the function name and the parameters, maybe the args are a list of arguments, and the function needs to parse them into control and nested categories. However, without knowing the specific keys or patterns to look for, it's challenging. The original code might have some logic based on keys. For example, control arguments might be those that start with a certain prefix, and nested ones are the rest. But the user hasn't provided that detail. 

Wait, the user hasn't given any specific implementation details, so I need to come up with a plausible way to split them. Maybe the function is supposed to separate arguments that are meant for control (like flags) from those that are nested or custom. But again, without knowing the exact criteria, I need to think of a common approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that has some predefined keys for control arguments. For example, maybe the control arguments are those that are in a specific set, and the rest are considered nested or custom. But since I don't have access to the class's other methods or variables, I can't know that. 

Wait, maybe the function is intended to process the args by checking for certain keys. For example, if an argument is in a list of control arguments, it's placed in control_args, otherwise, it's in nested_args. But the user hasn't specified which keys are control arguments. This is a problem. Without knowing the criteria, how can I write the code?

Wait, perhaps the original code had some logic that the user expects me to replicate, but since they didn't provide it, maybe I need to make a generic example. For instance, assuming that control arguments are those that start with a specific prefix, like 'control_', and nested arguments are those that start with 'nested_' or 'custom_'. But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on their presence in certain groups. For example, if the args have keys that are known to be control parameters, they are separated. The rest are considered nested, and among those, some might be custom. But again, without more info, I can't be sure.

Wait, the function's docstring says that control arguments are not put into the spec yml, while nested and custom are. But the return is only two dicts: control_args and nested_args. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but the function is supposed to handle them in a way that they are not the default nested ones. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested, and the custom arguments are those in the nested_args that are not part of the default nested parameters. But again, without knowing the default parameters, I can't code that.

Hmm, perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Let's think of a possible scenario. Suppose that the args are a dictionary where certain keys are designated as control arguments. For example, maybe the control arguments are those that start with a certain prefix, like 'control_', and the rest are considered nested. But the custom arguments might be a subset of the nested ones, perhaps those that start with 'custom_'. However, the return is only two dicts: control_args and nested_args. So maybe the custom arguments are included in the nested_args, but the function doesn't return them separately. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate the arguments into control and nested, and the custom arguments are those that are in the nested_args but have a specific marker. But again, without knowing the exact criteria, this is speculative.

Wait, perhaps the original function was intended to process command-line arguments, where some are flags (control) and others are parameters that get nested into the spec. But the parameters are a list, and the function needs to parse them into control and nested. For example, in argparse, you might have flags and positional arguments. But the function's parameter is a list of args, which could be a list of strings or a dictionary.

Wait, the function's parameter is 'args', which is a collected list of args. If it's a list of strings, perhaps it's splitting them into control and nested based on some prefix. For example, if an argument starts with '--control', it's a control argument. Otherwise, it's a nested or custom one. But again, this is a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the args are a dictionary, and the function is splitting the keys into control and nested. For example, if the keys are in a predefined list of control parameters, they go into control_args, else into nested_args. But without knowing those predefined keys, how can I code that?

This is a bit of a problem. Since the user hasn't provided any specific implementation details, I need to come up with a generic solution. Maybe the function is intended to separate the arguments into control and nested based on their presence in certain groups. For example, if the class has attributes like _control_args and _nested_args, the function could split the input args accordingly.

Wait, the function is part of a class (since it has 'self' as the first parameter). So perhaps the class has some predefined keys that are considered control arguments. For example, maybe the class has a set of control parameters, and the rest are nested. But again, without knowing that, I can't code it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and split them into two groups: control and nested, with the custom ones being part of the nested group. But how to determine that? Maybe the custom arguments are those that are not in a predefined list of nested parameters. But again, without knowing that list, I can't code that.

Wait, perhaps the original code had a way to identify control and nested arguments. For example, control arguments might be those that are not meant to be passed to the playbook, while nested ones are. Maybe the function is supposed to take the args and split them into two dictionaries based on some criteria. Since I don't have that info, maybe I can create a sample implementation where control_args are those with keys starting with 'control_' and nested_args are the rest. But the user might have intended something else.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate the arguments into control and nested, and the custom arguments are those that are in the nested group but are not standard. But again, without knowing the standard ones, this is tricky.

Given that the user hasn't provided any specific details, perhaps the intended code is to separate the arguments into two dictionaries, perhaps by checking for certain keys. For example, if the args are a dictionary, and the control arguments are those that are in a predefined set, like {'control1', 'control2'}, then the function would extract those into control_args and the rest into nested_args. But since I don't have that info, I need to make a generic example.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of a specific key, like 'control' being a boolean. But that's unclear.

Wait, the function's name is get_nested_custom_and_control_args, which suggests that it's handling three types: nested, custom, and control. But the return is only two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested ones. So the function returns control_args and nested_args, which includes both the normal nested and custom ones. But how to differentiate them in the code?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and split them into control arguments (which are not part of the spec) and the rest as nested, which might include custom ones. But again, without knowing how to identify custom, perhaps the function is not handling that part, and the custom arguments are just part of the nested ones.

In the absence of specific information, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's say that the control arguments are those that start with a certain prefix, like 'control_', and the rest are considered nested. Then, the function would split the args into those two groups. However, the docstring mentions custom arguments as well. Maybe the custom arguments are those that are in the nested group but have a different prefix, like 'custom_'.

But the return is only two dicts. So perhaps the function is supposed to separate the control arguments from the rest, and within the rest, some are custom. However, the return doesn't include the custom ones. That doesn't make sense. Wait, the docstring says that nested arguments are used by the playbooks and are put into the spec yml, while custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested ones. So maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but they are not the default ones. But how to represent that? Maybe the function is supposed to return the control_args and the nested_args, which includes both the normal nested and custom ones. But the user's docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested ones, which might imply that they are separate.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom ones are part of the nested. But how to code that? Maybe the function is supposed to take all the args, split them into control and nested, and then for the nested, some are custom. But the return is only two dicts, so maybe the custom ones are included in the nested_args, and the function doesn't return them separately. 

This is quite ambiguous. However, given the function's return type is (dict, dict), perhaps the code is supposed to split the input args into two groups. Let me think of a possible implementation. For example, if the args are a dictionary, and the control arguments are those that are not to be included in the spec. So, maybe the function is supposed to separate the args into control_args (which are not included) and nested_args (which are included). The custom arguments might be part of the nested_args but have a specific key. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and split them into control and nested, with the custom ones being a subset of the nested. But without knowing how to identify them, perhaps the function isn't handling that part. 

Since the user hasn't provided any specific criteria, perhaps the function is a placeholder and the actual implementation would depend on the specific application. However, the user expects me to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, so I need to come up with a plausible example.

Let me think of a possible approach. Suppose that the control arguments are those that start with a certain prefix, like 'control_', and the nested arguments are the rest. The custom arguments might be those that are in the nested group but are not part of the standard parameters. However, the return is only two dicts, so maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, and the function is supposed to return them as such. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and split them into control and nested, with the custom arguments being those in the nested group that are not part of a predefined set. But again, without knowing the predefined set, I can't code that.

Wait, perhaps the original code had something like:

control_args = {key: value for key, value in args.items() if key in self.control_keys}
nested_args = {key: value for key, value in args.items() if key not in self.control_keys}

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe I can create a generic version. For example, assuming that the control arguments are those that are in a predefined list, like ['control1', 'control2'].

But since the function is part of a class, maybe the class has some attributes that define which keys are control arguments. However, without that information, I can't reference them. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into two parts based on their type. For example, if an argument is a boolean, it's a control argument. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args list and split them into control and nested based on the presence of a certain keyword. For example, if an argument is prefixed with '--control', it's a control argument. But again, this is speculative.

In the absence of specific information, perhaps the best approach is to create a function that splits the args into two dictionaries, perhaps based on some arbitrary criteria. For example, if the args are a dictionary, and the control arguments are those with keys that start with 'control_', and the rest are nested. But the custom arguments are not mentioned in the return, so maybe they are part of the nested ones.

So, here's a possible code:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just an example. However, the docstring mentions custom arguments, which are supposed to be used instead of the normal nested ones. Maybe the custom arguments are those that start with 'custom_', and the normal nested ones are others. But the return is only two dicts. So perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, and the function doesn't return them separately. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the control_args and the nested_args, which includes both the normal nested and custom ones. But the user's docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested ones. So maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and then the nested_args might have some entries that are custom. But again, without knowing how to identify them, perhaps the code isn't handling that part yet.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and split them into control and nested, and the custom ones are a subset of the nested. But the return doesn't include a third dict. 

Hmm. Since the user hasn't given any specific details, I need to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the function is supposed to separate the arguments into control and nested, with control arguments being those that are not to be included in the spec. The custom arguments are part of the nested ones, perhaps those that have a specific key. But since the return is only two dicts, maybe the function is not handling the custom part, or the custom is merged into nested_args. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom ones are those that are in the nested_args but are not part of the standard parameters. However, without knowing the standard parameters, I can't code that. 

Given that, perhaps the user expects a simple example that separates the arguments into two groups. For example, control_args could be a subset of the args, and the rest are nested. Maybe the code is supposed to take the args and split them into two dictionaries. Let's proceed with that approach, even though it's a guess.

Another possibility is that the function is part of a command-line tool where certain flags are control arguments and others are nested. For example, if the args are a list of strings, the function could parse them into control and nested. But again, without knowing the exact parsing logic, it's hard to say.

Wait, the function's parameter is a list of args. So maybe the args are a list of strings, like command-line arguments. Then, the function needs to split them into control arguments and nested ones. For example, if the arguments start with '--control', they are control arguments, else they are nested. But how to process that into dictionaries?

Alternatively, maybe the args are a dictionary, and the function is supposed to separate them. The initial code might have something like:

control_args = {k: v for k, v in args.items() if k in self._control_keys}
nested_args = {k: v for k, v in args.items() if k not in self._control_keys}

But again, without knowing what self._control_keys is, this is just a guess. However, since the function is part of a class, it's possible that the class has some predefined keys for control arguments.

But the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a template, and the actual implementation would depend on the class's attributes. However, the user wants code that can be generated based on the given info.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and return two dictionaries, with the control arguments being those that are not to be included in the spec. For example, if the args are a dictionary, and the control arguments are those that are not in the spec. But without knowing the spec's keys, this is impossible.

This is really challenging. Maybe the user expects a function that simply returns empty dicts, or a placeholder. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the args and split them into two groups based on some arbitrary condition. For example, even and odd keys, or something like that. But that's not useful.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and split them into control and nested, with the nested being those that are not control. For example:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key in self.control_keys:
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But again, without knowing what self.control_keys is, this is just a guess. However, the user might have intended that the class has such an attribute. 

Alternatively, maybe the control arguments are those that are not part of the nested structure. For example, if the args are a dictionary, and the nested arguments are those that are part of a specific structure. But without more info, I can't code that.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that splits the args into two dictionaries, assuming that control arguments are those with a certain prefix. For example, let's say that any key starting with 'control_' is a control argument, and the rest are nested. The custom arguments might be those with a 'custom_' prefix, but since the return is only two dicts, maybe they are included in the nested_args. 

So the code would be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But the docstring mentions custom arguments, which are supposed to be used instead of the normal nested ones. Maybe the custom arguments are those that start with 'custom_', and the normal nested ones are others. However, the return is only two dicts, so perhaps the function is supposed to include custom in nested_args. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested ones. But the user's docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested ones. So maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and then the nested_args would include both the normal and custom ones. But how to differentiate them in the code? 

This is really unclear. But given that the user hasn't provided any specific information, perhaps the code is a placeholder that needs to be filled in based on the actual application's logic. However, the user expects me to generate code, so I need to proceed with a possible implementation.

Another angle: the function's return is (dict, dict), which are flat dicts. The docstring says that control arguments are not put into the spec yml. So, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and separate them into control and nested, where nested includes the custom ones. 

In that case, the code could be something like:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for key, value in args.items():
        if key in self.control_parameters:
            control_args[key] = value
        else:
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But again, without knowing what self.control_parameters is, this is just a guess. However, the user might have intended that the class has such an attribute. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the args and split them into control and nested based on the presence of a certain key. For example, if the key is 'custom', then it's part of the nested_args. But this is not helpful.

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that the control arguments are those with a specific prefix, and the rest are nested. The custom arguments are part of the nested ones. So the code would separate based on that prefix. Here's the code:
