Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_spec_defaults based on the given signature and docstring. The user specified not to include any explanations, so I'll focus just on writing the code.

The function is a method, so it's part of a class. The docstring says it resolves arguments' values from the spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). That suggests that the function might be calling another method _get_defaults, which is probably defined elsewhere in the class.

Looking at the function signature: def get_spec_defaults(self). The body is empty except for the docstring. The user wants me to fill that in. But how?

The docstring mentions "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources". So maybe this function is supposed to retrieve default values for parameters from some specification, perhaps a schema or a configuration, and combine them with other sources like environment variables or user input. But without more context, I have to make assumptions.

Since the function calls self._get_defaults(), I should check if that method exists. If not, maybe I need to define it. However, the user didn't mention that. They only provided the get_spec_defaults function. So perhaps _get_defaults is an existing method in the class.

Wait, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The existing code has the function with the docstring but no implementation. So I need to provide the implementation.

But what exactly does get_spec_defaults do? The docstring says it resolves arguments' values from spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). Maybe the spec is a dictionary or some structure that holds default values, and the function is supposed to extract those, possibly merging with other defaults from _get_defaults.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the default values from the spec, and the _get_defaults() method handles the actual resolution logic. But since the user hasn't provided the implementation of _get_defaults, perhaps the code for get_spec_defaults is just a placeholder that calls that method.

Wait, the original code provided by the user has the function with the docstring but no body. The user wants me to generate the code for that function. So maybe the function is intended to return the result of self._get_defaults(), but the docstring mentions resolving from spec and other sources. So perhaps the _get_defaults method is responsible for that.

But without knowing the specifics of the spec or other sources, I can't write detailed code. The safest approach is to implement get_spec_defaults as a method that calls self._get_defaults() and returns its result. However, maybe the spec is an attribute of the class, and the function is supposed to process it.

Alternatively, maybe the spec is a parameter or part of the class's state. For example, if the class has a spec attribute that's a dictionary, then get_spec_defaults could extract default values from there. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.

The user's example might be part of a larger class, perhaps a configuration loader or a function argument resolver. Since the function's name is get_spec_defaults, it's possible that it's retrieving default values from a specification, which could be a data structure like a dictionary.

If I have to make an educated guess, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary of default values derived from the spec. But since the docstring mentions using self._get_defaults(), perhaps the actual implementation is just returning that method's result.

Wait, the original code has the function with the docstring but no implementation. The user wants me to generate the code. So maybe the function is supposed to call self._get_defaults() and return whatever that method returns. But the docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()". That suggests that _get_defaults is the method that does the resolving, and get_spec_defaults is just a wrapper or a method that uses it.

In that case, the code for get_spec_defaults would be something like:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But I need to make sure that _get_defaults is defined in the class. However, the user hasn't provided that, so maybe it's assumed to exist. Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to define _get_defaults as well. But the original question only asks for get_spec_defaults.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The existing code only has the function signature and the docstring. The user didn't mention any other methods. So the generated code should just implement get_spec_defaults, possibly calling _get_defaults if that's part of the intended logic.

But if the user hasn't provided the _get_defaults method, maybe it's a helper method that's supposed to be implemented elsewhere. So the code for get_spec_defaults would just be a method that calls that helper.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to process the spec attribute. For example, if the class has a spec attribute that's a dictionary, then get_spec_defaults could return a copy of it or process it in some way.

But given the limited information, the most straightforward implementation is to have get_spec_defaults call self._get_defaults() and return the result. That aligns with the docstring's mention of using that method.

So the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But I need to make sure that this is the correct approach. Since the user hasn't provided more details, this is the minimal implementation that fits the given signature and docstring. It's possible that the actual code might involve more steps, but without further information, this is the best I can do.
