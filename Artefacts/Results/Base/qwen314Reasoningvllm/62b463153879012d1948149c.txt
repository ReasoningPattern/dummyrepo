Okay, I need to write a Python function called select_filenames_by_prefix that takes a prefix and a list of files, and returns all the files that match that prefix. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to filter files based on a prefix. So, for each file in the input list, I should check if it starts with the given prefix. The standard way to check this in Python is using the startswith() method of strings.

The parameters are prefix and files. The files parameter is a list, I assume, of filenames. So the function will loop through each filename in the list and collect those that start with the prefix.

Wait, the docstring says "return all files that match the given prefix". So the output should be a list of the matching filenames. That makes sense.

So the steps are: iterate over each file in the files list, check if the file starts with prefix, and if yes, include it in the result list.

But wait, what about case sensitivity? The problem doesn't mention it, so I'll assume that the comparison is case-sensitive. Unless specified otherwise, it's safer to do a case-sensitive check.

So the code structure would be:

def select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files):
    """
    For each file in files, return all files that match the given prefix
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the matching files
    matching_files = []
    # Iterate over each file in the files list
    for file in files:
        # Check if the file starts with the prefix
        if file.startswith(prefix):
            # If yes, add to matching_files
            matching_files.append(file)
    # Return the list of matching files
    return matching_files

Wait, but maybe there's a more concise way using list comprehensions. Like:

return [file for file in files if file.startswith(prefix)]

That would do the same thing. So the function can be written in one line. But maybe the user wants a more explicit loop? However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and doesn't specify any constraints on style. So using a list comprehension is efficient and clean.

I should make sure that the parameters are correctly handled. The prefix is a string, and files is a list of strings. The function should return a list of strings.

Testing some examples: if prefix is 'data_' and files is ['data_1.txt', 'image.png', 'data_2.csv'], the function should return ['data_1.txt', 'data_2.csv'].

What if the prefix is empty? Well, startswith('') returns True for any string, so all files would be returned. But according to the problem statement, maybe that's acceptable. The function's docstring doesn't mention handling empty prefixes, so I'll leave it as is.

Another edge case: files is an empty list. Then the function returns an empty list, which is correct.

So the code seems straightforward. Just use the startswith method in a list comprehension. That should do it.
