Okay, I need to write a Python function called normalize_cmd that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a tuple of strings. The docstring says it's supposed to complement the full path to an executable and return it in its original form. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about what exactly that means. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the function is meant to take a command that might be a relative path or just the executable name and convert it into a full path. But then why return it in its original form? Oh, perhaps the original form is the full path, but the function is supposed to ensure that the command is properly normalized, like adding the executable extension if it's missing on Windows, or something like that.

Wait, the function's name is normalize_cmd. So maybe it's about making sure the command is in a standard format. For example, on Windows, if the command is just "notepad", it should be converted to "notepad.exe". But on Unix-like systems, the extension isn't needed. However, the function's docstring mentions complementing the full path to the exe. So maybe it's about resolving the full path of the executable, but the user wants it to return the original form, which might be the full path with the executable name.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a tuple, like ("cmd", "arg1", "arg2"), and ensure that the first element is the full path to the executable. For example, if the first element is just "python", it should be replaced with the full path, like "/usr/bin/python". But how do I determine the full path? That would require looking up the executable in the system's PATH, which can be done using shutil.which or something similar.

Wait, the user didn't mention anything about the system, but maybe the function is intended to work on Windows. Let me check the parameters. The input is a tuple of strings. So the first element is the command, and the rest are arguments. The function needs to normalize the command part, possibly by adding .exe if it's a Windows system and the command doesn't have an extension.

But how do I check the operating system? Well, maybe the function should check if the command has an extension. If not, append .exe. However, that's a Windows-specific thing. But the user didn't specify, so perhaps the function is intended for Windows. Or maybe it's a general approach, but the docstring mentions "full path to exe", which might imply that the command is a path to an executable, and we need to make sure it's in the correct format.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a relative path and convert it to an absolute path. For example, if the command is "scripts/myapp", it should be converted to the full path like "/home/user/scripts/myapp". But how to determine the base path? That's unclear. The function might need to use os.path.abspath or something similar, but without knowing the current working directory, that's tricky.

Wait, the docstring says "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Maybe the original form is the full path, but the function is supposed to ensure that the command is properly normalized. For instance, if the command is given as a relative path, it's converted to absolute. Or if the command is just the name without path, it's looked up in the PATH environment variable.

But how to implement that? Let's think. The function takes a tuple, so the first element is the command. Let's assume that the command is the executable name, possibly with a path. The goal is to find the full path of that executable. So perhaps using shutil.which to find the executable in the PATH. But shutil.which returns the full path if found. However, if the command already has a path, like "C:\\Program Files\\cmd.exe", then it would return that as is. But maybe the function is supposed to normalize the path, like converting to absolute, or ensuring that it's properly formatted.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to handle cases where the command is a relative path and convert it to an absolute one. For example, if the command is "./myapp", it should be converted to the full path. But how to do that? Using os.path.abspath on the first element of the tuple.

Wait, but the docstring says "complement the full path to exe", which might mean that if the command is just the executable name without a path, it should be resolved to the full path. So, for example, if the input is ("python", "arg1"), the function would find the full path to python, like "/usr/bin/python", and return that as the first element of the tuple, keeping the rest the same.

So the steps would be:

1. Take the first element of the cmd tuple as the executable name.
2. Check if it's a full path. If not, resolve it using the system's PATH.
3. If the executable is found, replace the first element with the full path.
4. Return the modified tuple.

But how to resolve the executable? On Windows, you might need to check for .exe extensions. On Unix, it's not necessary. However, the function's docstring might be specific to Windows. Alternatively, the function could be cross-platform, using shutil.which which works on both.

So, using shutil.which(executable) would find the full path. However, if the executable already has a path, it would return that path if it exists. But if the executable is just the name, it would find it in PATH.

But then, what if the executable is not found? The docstring doesn't mention error handling, so maybe the function assumes that the executable exists.

So the code could be:

import shutil
import os

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    full_path = shutil.which(executable)
    if full_path:
        return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    else:
        # What if it's not found? Maybe return original?
        return cmd

Wait, but the docstring says "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Maybe the original form is the full path. So if the executable is not found, perhaps it's an error, but the function doesn't handle that. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to add the .exe extension if missing on Windows.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to the case where the command is a relative path or just the name. For example, if the command is "python", it should be converted to the full path. But if the command is already a full path, like "/usr/bin/python", it should leave it as is.

But how to determine if it's a full path? Well, on Windows, a full path starts with a drive letter (like C:\) or a UNC path. On Unix, it starts with a slash. So perhaps the function checks if the executable is a full path. If not, resolve it via PATH.

But the problem is that the function's parameters are a tuple of strings. So the first element is the command. So the code would need to check if the first element is a full path. If not, find it in the PATH.

But how to check if it's a full path? For example, on Unix, if the string starts with '/', it's a full path. On Windows, if it starts with a drive letter followed by a colon and a backslash, like 'C:\', or a UNC path like '\\\server\share\...'.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to be platform-specific. Let me think about the possible scenarios.

Another approach: if the command is not an absolute path, then resolve it using the system's PATH. Otherwise, leave it as is.

So, for example:

If cmd is ("notepad", "file.txt"), then on Windows, it would find the full path to notepad.exe, like "C:\\Windows\\notepad.exe", and return that as the first element.

If the cmd is already an absolute path, like ("C:\\Program Files\\MyApp\\app.exe", "arg"), then return it as is.

But how to check if it's an absolute path? Using os.path.isabs.

So the code could be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(executable):
        return cmd
    else:
        full_path = shutil.which(executable)
        if full_path:
            return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
        else:
            return cmd

Wait, but shutil.which returns the full path if the executable is found in PATH. However, if the executable is not found, it returns None. So in that case, the function would return the original cmd tuple. But the docstring says "complement the full path to exe", implying that it's supposed to find the full path. However, if the executable isn't found, maybe that's an error, but the function doesn't handle it. The user's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps the function assumes that the executable exists.

But maybe the user wants to ensure that the command is in the form of a full path, even if it's just the name. So if the command is "python", it would find the full path. But if the command is a relative path, like "./python", then it would resolve it to the absolute path.

Wait, but os.path.isabs would check if it's an absolute path. So for "./python", it's not absolute, so the function would use shutil.which to find it. But if the user provides a relative path, maybe they want it converted to absolute. However, the docstring says "complement the full path to exe", which might mean that the function is supposed to resolve the executable's full path, not the relative path.

Hmm, perhaps the function is intended to take a command that may not have the full path and resolve it. So for example, if the command is just the name, like "cmd", then it's resolved to the full path. If it's a relative path, like "scripts/cmd", then it's resolved to the absolute path. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a path (possibly relative) and convert it to an absolute path. For example, if the command is "scripts/myapp", then it's converted to the absolute path based on the current working directory.

In that case, the code would be:

import os

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    full_path = os.path.abspath(executable)
    return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]

But that would convert any relative path to absolute, but if the executable is already absolute, it leaves it as is. However, this approach doesn't check if the executable exists. It just converts the path to absolute. But the docstring says "complement the full path to exe", which might imply that the executable is present in the system, and the function is to find its full path.

But how to distinguish between a relative path and an executable name? For example, if the command is "myapp", it's an executable name, but if it's "./myapp", it's a relative path. The function may need to handle both cases.

But the original problem is unclear. Let me re-read the docstring: "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Maybe the original form refers to the original command, but with the full path. For example, if the command is "python", it's replaced with the full path, but if it's already a full path, it's left as is.

So combining both approaches: first check if the command is an absolute path. If not, resolve it using shutil.which. But that might not be correct. For example, if the command is a relative path, like "scripts/python", then shutil.which would not find it unless it's in the PATH. But os.path.abspath would convert it to an absolute path.

But perhaps the function is intended to resolve the executable's full path by searching in the PATH environment variable, and if not found, return the original. So, for example, if the command is "python", it would find the full path. If it's "scripts/python", then it would check if that's in the PATH, but maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a path (could be relative or absolute) and convert it to an absolute path. But then, the original form would be the absolute path. So the code would be:

import os

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    full_path = os.path.abspath(executable)
    return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]

But that would take any relative path and make it absolute. However, if the executable is just the name, like "python", then os.path.abspath would return the absolute path of the current directory's "python" file, which may not be the correct executable. So that's not right.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use shutil.which to find the executable in the PATH. But if the command is a full path, then return it as is. Otherwise, look it up in the PATH.

So the code would be:

import shutil
import os

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(executable):
        return cmd
    else:
        full_path = shutil.which(executable)
        if full_path:
            return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
        else:
            return cmd

This way, if the executable is already an absolute path, it's left as is. Otherwise, it's looked up in the PATH. But what if the executable is a relative path, like "./python"? Then shutil.which would not find it unless it's in the PATH. But the user might want to resolve relative paths to absolute ones. However, the docstring doesn't mention that. It says "complement the full path to exe", which might imply that the executable is in the PATH, not that it's a relative path.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to ensure that the first element is the full path of the executable, regardless of whether it's provided as a relative path or just the name. But how to do that?

For example, if the command is "python", then find the full path. If the command is "./python", then resolve it to the absolute path, but that's a file in the current directory. However, if that file exists, then the full path is correct. But if it's not in the PATH, then shutil.which won't find it. So maybe the function is intended to handle both cases: when the command is just the name (look in PATH), or a relative path (resolve to absolute), but that's not clear.

The original docstring is a bit ambiguous. But given the name "normalize_cmd", perhaps it's intended to make sure that the command is in the form of a full path, possibly by adding the .exe extension on Windows if missing.

Another angle: perhaps the function is supposed to take a command that's a path (possibly without the .exe extension on Windows) and ensure that it's a full path with the correct extension. For example, on Windows, if the command is "notepad", it should become "C:\\Windows\\notepad.exe".

But how to determine the OS? The function might need to check the platform.

So, code could be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(executable):
        return cmd
    # Check if the OS is Windows
    if os.name == 'nt':
        # Check if the executable has an extension
        if not os.path.splitext(executable)[1]:
            # Add .exe extension
            executable += '.exe'
    # Now find the full path
    full_path = shutil.which(executable)
    if full_path:
        return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    else:
        return cmd

But this approach adds .exe if the executable doesn't have an extension on Windows, then uses shutil.which to find it in the PATH. However, if the original executable was a relative path, like "scripts/notepad", then this code would first check if it's absolute (no), then add .exe if on Windows, then look it up in the PATH. But that might not be correct. For example, if the user intended to run a script named "notepad" in the current directory, but the code adds .exe and looks for "notepad.exe" in the PATH, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a path (without extension) and add the extension, then resolve it. But again, the docstring is unclear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended solution is to use shutil.which to find the full path of the executable, and if it's not found, return the original. But the function's name is normalize_cmd, which suggests that it's supposed to normalize the command to a full path. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.

Another possibility: the function is part of a larger system where the command is passed as a tuple, and the first element is the executable. The task is to ensure that the first element is the full path, possibly by resolving it from the PATH environment variable. So the code would use shutil.which on the first element, and if found, replace it with the full path.

So the code would be:

import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    full_path = shutil.which(executable)
    if full_path:
        return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    else:
        return cmd

But this would only work if the executable is in the PATH. If the user provided a relative path, like "./myapp", then shutil.which would not find it unless it's in the PATH. But maybe that's the intended behavior.

But the docstring says "complement the full path to exe", which might mean that if the command is not a full path, it's complemented. However, the function as written would only complement if the executable is in the PATH. If the executable is not in the PATH, it returns the original.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a relative path and convert it to absolute, but that's not clear.

Given the lack of clarity, perhaps the intended solution is to use shutil.which to find the full path of the executable. So the code would be as above. But then, what if the executable is already a full path? For example, if the input is ("C:\\Program Files\\cmd.exe", "arg"), then shutil.which would return that path if it exists. However, if the path is not in the PATH environment variable, but is an absolute path, then maybe the function should return it as is.

Wait, but shutil.which checks the PATH environment variable. If the executable is an absolute path, it would check if that path exists. However, if the user provides an absolute path, maybe they want it to be used as is, even if it's not in the PATH. For example, if the command is "/usr/bin/python", then the function should return that as is.

But in that case, the code above would check if the executable is in the PATH. If it's an absolute path, then shutil.which would return it if it exists. Otherwise, it would return None.

So, perhaps the function should check if the executable is an absolute path. If it is, then return it as is. If not, then use shutil.which to find it in the PATH. But that's not exactly what the code does. Because if the executable is not absolute, then shutil.which is used, which looks in the PATH. However, if the user provided a relative path, like "./myapp", then it's not in the PATH, so it would not be found. But maybe the function should resolve relative paths to absolute ones.

Hmm, this is tricky. Without more context, it's hard to know exactly what the user wants. But given the docstring, perhaps the main goal is to resolve the executable's full path by looking it up in the system's PATH. So the function would take the first element, look it up in the PATH using shutil.which, and if found, replace it with the full path. If not found, return the original.

But then, what if the original command is already a full path? For example, if the user provides ("C:\\Program Files\\cmd.exe", "arg"), then the function would check if that exists in the PATH. But that's not correct because the full path may not be in the PATH. However, the function's purpose is to complement the full path, so maybe if the command is not a full path, it's resolved, otherwise left as is.

So combining that logic:

import shutil
import os

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(executable):
        return cmd
    full_path = shutil.which(executable)
    if full_path:
        return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    else:
        return cmd

This code first checks if the executable is an absolute path. If yes, returns as is. If not, uses shutil.which to find it in the PATH. If found, returns the full path. If not, returns original.

But what about cases where the executable is a relative path, like "./myapp"? Then, shutil.which would not find it unless it's in the PATH. But maybe the user wants to resolve relative paths to absolute paths. However, that's not what shutil.which does. It looks in the PATH, not in the current directory.

So, perhaps the function should first check if the executable is a full path. If not, then check if it's a relative path and resolve it to absolute using os.path.abspath. But then again, that's not the same as finding the executable in the PATH.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command that's a path (relative or absolute) and ensure that it's an absolute path. For example, if the command is "python", then it's resolved to the full path. If it's "./python", then it's converted to the absolute path. But how to handle that?

In that case, the code would be:

import os

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    full_path = os.path.abspath(executable)
    return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]

But this would convert any relative path to absolute, but if the executable is just the name, like "python", then os.path.abspath would return the absolute path of the current directory's "python" file, which may not be the correct executable. So that's not ideal.

But the original docstring says "complement the full path to exe", which might imply that the command is an executable name, not a path. So perhaps the function is intended to find the full path of the executable by looking in the PATH environment variable, and return that path as the first element of the tuple.

In that case, the code using shutil.which is appropriate. However, on Windows, if the executable doesn't have the .exe extension, it's added automatically. But shutil.which does that on Windows, right?

Yes, shutil.which on Windows will try adding .exe if the file isn't found. So for example, if you call shutil.which("notepad"), it would find "notepad.exe" if present.

So the code would be:

import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    full_path = shutil.which(executable)
    if full_path:
        return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    else:
        return cmd

This code would take the first element of the cmd tuple, look it up in the system's PATH using shutil.which, which handles adding extensions on Windows, and returns the full path if found. Otherwise, returns the original.

But the docstring says "return it in its original form". Wait, that's confusing. If the full path is found, then it's returned as the full path. But the original form would be the original command. Maybe the docstring is saying that the full path is returned, but in the original form (like, without any changes except making it full path). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the original command tuple, but with the executable's full path. For example, if the original command was ("python", "arg"), it becomes (full_path, "arg").

So the code above would do that. However, if the original command was already a full path, like ("/usr/bin/python", "arg"), then it would return that as is, since shutil.which would return the same path if it exists.

But if the user provides a full path that's not in the PATH, like "/usr/local/bin/python", then shutil.which would not find it unless it's in the PATH. Wait, no. shutil.which searches the PATH environment variable. If the executable is a full path, then it would check if that path exists. But if the user provides a full path, but it's not in the PATH, then it would not be found. However, the function's purpose is to complement the full path, so perhaps if the user provides a full path, it's already correct and should be returned as is. But if it's not a full path, then resolve it.

But how to check if the executable is a full path? Using os.path.isabs. So the code would first check if it's an absolute path. If yes, return as is. If not, look it up in the PATH.

So combining that:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(executable):
        return cmd
    full_path = shutil.which(executable)
    if full_path:
        return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    else:
        return cmd

This way, if the executable is already an absolute path, it's left as is. Otherwise, it's resolved using the PATH. But what if the executable is a relative path, like "./myapp"? Then, shutil.which would not find it unless it's in the PATH. However, the function may not handle that case, but perhaps that's beyond the scope.

Given the ambiguity, I think the most plausible solution is using shutil.which to find the full path of the executable, assuming that the command is the name of the executable (without path), and return that full path. If the command is already an absolute path, return it as is. Otherwise, if it's not found, return the original.

So the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that it's correct. Let me test with some examples.

Example 1: cmd = ("python", "arg") → find the full path of python in PATH, return that.

Example 2: cmd = ("/usr/bin/python", "arg") → return as is.

Example 3: cmd = ("./myapp", "arg") → since it's not absolute, it's looked up in PATH. But if the current directory's myapp is not in PATH, it won't be found. But maybe that's not the intended use case.

But given the docstring, perhaps that's the correct approach. So I'll proceed with that code.
