Okay, I need to generate a Python function called parse_arguments that takes *unparsed_arguments and returns a dictionary mapping. The docstring says it parses parameters into a dict. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function is supposed to handle variable arguments, which are passed as a tuple. The goal is to convert these into a dictionary. But how? Well, maybe the arguments are in the form of key-value pairs. For example, if someone calls parse_arguments('key1', 'value1', 'key2', 'value2'), the function should return {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}.

Wait, but the parameters are positional. So the function would need to process them in pairs. If the number of arguments is odd, that's an error. So first, I should check if the length of the arguments is even. If not, raise a ValueError.

So the steps are: check if len(unparsed_arguments) is even. If not, raise an error. Then, loop through the arguments two at a time, taking each even index as the key and the next as the value. Then, create a dictionary from those pairs.

But wait, what if the keys are not strings? The function might need to handle that, but the docstring doesn't specify. The problem says to generate code based on the signature and docstring, so maybe it's assumed that the arguments are properly formatted as key-value pairs.

So the code would be something like:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    """
    Parses parameters and returns them as dict maps
    """
    if len(unparsed_arguments) % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of arguments must be even.")
    return dict(zip(unparsed_arguments[::2], unparsed_arguments[1::2]))

Wait, that's a possible solution. Using zip on the even and odd indices. Let me test this logic. For example, if the arguments are ['a', 1, 'b', 2], then [::2] would take 'a' and 'b', and [1::2] would take 1 and 2. Then zip them into pairs and create a dict. That seems right.

But what if there are no arguments? Then it returns an empty dict, which is correct. Also, if there's an even number of arguments, it works. So that's the approach. The function will pair up the arguments as key-value pairs and return the dictionary. If the count is odd, it raises an error. That should meet the requirements given the docstring.
