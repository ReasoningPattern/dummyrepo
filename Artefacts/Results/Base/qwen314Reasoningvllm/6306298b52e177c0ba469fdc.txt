Okay, I need to write a Python function called xml_children_as_dict that takes an XML node and returns a dictionary of its children keyed by their tag names. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, when dealing with XML, the xml.etree.ElementTree module is commonly used. So the node parameter is probably an ElementTree Element object. The function's goal is to collect all the children of this node and group them by their tag names.

Wait, the docstring says "children of node <xml>", so maybe the node is the root of an XML tree. But regardless, the function should process all direct children of the given node.

So, the steps would be: iterate over each child of the node, and for each child, add it to the dictionary with the key being the tag name. But if there are multiple children with the same tag name, how to handle them? The problem says "keyed by tag name," so maybe each key maps to a list of elements with that tag. Or perhaps the user expects only the first occurrence? The docstring isn't clear, but looking at common practices, when converting children to a dict, it's typical to have each tag as a key, and the value could be a list of all elements with that tag. However, sometimes people might expect the last one or just one. But since the function's name is plural ("children"), it's more likely that multiple children can exist under the same tag. So the dictionary should map each tag to a list of its children elements.

Wait, but maybe the user wants each tag to have the last child, or the first? Let me check the problem statement again. The docstring says "Turn the children of node <xml> into a dict, keyed by tag name." It doesn't specify handling duplicates. Hmm. In XML, having multiple elements with the same tag under the same parent is allowed. So the function should collect all children, grouping them by their tag names. Therefore, the dictionary values should be lists.

So, the plan is:

- Initialize an empty dictionary.
- Iterate over each child in node's children.
- For each child, check if its tag is already a key in the dictionary.
- If it is, append the child to the list.
- If not, create a new key with the tag and set the value as a list containing the child.
- Return the dictionary.

But how to get the children? The Element object in ElementTree has a .iter() method, but that's for iterating through all descendants. Wait, no, the direct children are accessed via node.getchildren(), but in newer versions of ElementTree (like in Python 3), getchildren() is deprecated. Instead, you can iterate over node directly, like for child in node: ... So maybe the code should loop through node's children using a for loop.

Wait, in Python's xml.etree.ElementTree, the Element class is iterable, and iterating over it gives all the direct children. So yes, for child in node: ... would work.

So, the code would be:

def xml_children_as_dict(node):
    """
    Turn the children of node <xml> into a dict, keyed by tag name.
    """
    result = {}
    for child in node:
        tag = child.tag
        if tag in result:
            result[tag].append(child)
        else:
            result[tag] = [child]
    return result

Wait, but maybe the user wants the text of the children, not the elements themselves? The docstring says "children of node <xml>", but it's not specified whether to store the elements or their text. However, the function's name suggests that it's returning a dict of the children, which are elements. So the code above would collect the elements.

Alternatively, if the user wants the text content, then we'd store the text. But the problem statement isn't clear. However, given the function name, I think it's more likely that the elements themselves are the values. For example, if you have multiple elements with the same tag, you'd want to have a list of those elements.

Testing this code: suppose the node has children with tags 'a', 'b', 'a'. The resulting dict would have 'a' as a key with a list of both 'a' elements, and 'b' with its own list. That seems correct.

So the code should be as written. Let me make sure there are no typos. The function is named correctly, and the loop is over node's children. Yes. The code uses the 'tag' attribute of each child, which is correct. The initial result is an empty dict. So this should work.
