Okay, I need to write a Python function called fix_namespace_prefix_w that takes a string content and replaces all occurrences of "w:st=" with "w-st=". Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem is straightforward: it's a string replacement. The original string has "w:st=" and I need to change the colon to a hyphen. So, the simplest way is to use the replace method in Python. Let me check the syntax for that. The replace method takes the old substring and the new substring as arguments. So, content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=") should do the trick.

Wait, but I need to make sure that this replacement only happens when "w:st=" is a standalone prefix, not part of a longer string. For example, if there's something like "w:st=other", replacing "w:st=" with "w-st=" would change it to "w-st=other", which is correct. But what if there's a case where "w:st" is part of another word? Like "w:stabc"? Then the replacement would incorrectly change "w:stabc" to "w-stabc". But according to the docstring, the function is supposed to replace "w:st=" specifically. So the colon is followed by an equals sign. So the pattern is exactly "w:st=".

So using a simple string replace should work because the colon is right before the equals sign. There's no need for regular expressions here. The replace method will substitute every instance of "w:st=" with "w-st=".

So the function will take the input string, perform the replacement, and return the new string. That's all. Let me test this logic with some examples.

If content is "This is a w:st=example", after replacement it should be "This is a w-st=example". Another example: "w:st=123" becomes "w-st=123". What if there are multiple occurrences? Like "w:st=hello w:st=world" becomes "w-st=hello w-st=world". That seems correct.

So the code would be:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

That's it. No edge cases to handle unless there's something I'm missing. The docstring says to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=", so this should fulfill the requirement.
