Okay, I need to write a Python function called remove_ending_os_sep that takes an input list and returns a new list with trailing OS separators removed from each string. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function checks if the input list is None. If it is, return an empty list. That's straightforward. Then, for each string in the list, I need to check two things: if the string's length is greater than one, and if the last character is the OS separator. The OS separator can be either '/' or '\\' depending on the operating system. But wait, the problem says "trailing os seperator characters"—so maybe it's referring to the current OS's separator. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify which one to use. Hmm, maybe it's better to use os.path.sep from the os module to get the correct separator for the current OS. That way, the function is more portable.

So, I'll import os. Then, for each item in the input list, I'll check if it ends with os.path.sep. But also, the length has to be more than one. For example, if the string is just a single '/', we shouldn't remove it because the length is one. Wait, the docstring says "if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator." So both conditions must be met. So, for each string in the list, if len(s) > 1 and s ends with the separator, then we remove the last character. Otherwise, leave it as is.

Wait, but what about cases where the separator is part of the middle of the string? Like 'path/to/file/'—we only want to remove the trailing separator. So, using rstrip might be better. Or maybe check if the last character is the separator. Let me think. For example, if the string is 'folder/', then we remove the last '/' to get 'folder'. But if the string is 'file.txt/', we remove the '/' to get 'file.txt'. However, if the string is 'C:\\', then we need to check if the length is more than one. But in that case, the string is 'C:\\', which has length 3 (assuming it's a Windows path with backslash). Wait, no, in Python, a single backslash in a string is escaped, so actually, the string would be represented as 'C:\\\\', but when using os.path.sep, which is '\\' on Windows, the check would be for the last character being that.

Wait, maybe I should use the os.path.normpath function? Or perhaps just check the last character. Let me think. The function's docstring says to check if the last character is the separator. So for each string, if it ends with the OS separator and its length is more than one, then we remove the last character. Otherwise, leave it.

So the steps are:

1. Check if input_list is None. If yes, return empty list.
2. Iterate over each string in input_list.
3. For each string, check if len(s) > 1 and s[-1] == os.path.sep.
4. If both conditions are true, then remove the last character. Else, keep the string as is.
5. Collect all modified or unmodified strings into a new list and return it.

Wait, but what about cases where the string is empty? The docstring says to check length greater than one, so empty strings would be skipped. But maybe the input list could have empty strings. However, the problem says it's a list of strings, so perhaps that's allowed.

So, code-wise:

Import os.

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    sep = os.path.sep
    result = []
    for s in input_list:
        if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(sep):
            result.append(s[:-1])
        else:
            result.append(s)
    return result

Wait, but using endswith is more accurate than checking the last character. Because endswith will check if the string ends with the separator, which could be more than one character? Wait, os.path.sep is either '/' or '\\' which are single characters. So s.endswith(sep) is equivalent to checking s[-1] == sep. But endswith is better because it handles the case where the separator is more than one character (though in reality, it's not). So either way works.

But maybe using s[-1] is more efficient. However, for clarity, using endswith might be better. Let me check the docstring again. It says "the last character is the pathname separator." So it's checking the last character, not the entire path. So using endswith is correct here.

But wait, what if the separator is a slash, and the string ends with multiple slashes? Like 'path//'. Then, endswith would check for the presence of the separator at the end. However, the problem says to remove the trailing separator. So if the string ends with one or more separators, we only remove the last one. For example, 'path//' would become 'path/'? Or do we need to remove all trailing separators?

The docstring says "remove trailing os seperator characters"—but the wording is a bit ambiguous. However, looking at the example in the docstring: Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the separator. So the function is supposed to check if the last character is the separator, and if so, remove it. So even if there are multiple trailing separators, we only remove one. For example, 'a/b/c/' would become 'a/b/c', but 'a/b/c//' would become 'a/b/c/'.

Wait, but the problem says "trailing os seperator characters"—maybe it's supposed to remove all trailing separators. However, the docstring says "if the last character is the pathname separator"—so the condition is only checking the last character. So the function is supposed to remove only the last character if it's a separator and the length is more than one. So even if there are multiple separators at the end, only the last one is removed. For example, 'path///' would become 'path//' after one removal. But maybe the user wants to remove all trailing separators. But according to the docstring, the condition is only checking the last character. So the code should only remove the last character if it's a separator and the length is more than one.

So the code would be as I wrote before. Let me test with some examples.

Test case 1: input_list is None → returns [].

Test case 2: input_list = ['folder/', 'file.txt', 'C:\\\\', ''] → output would be ['folder', 'file.txt', 'C:\\', ''].

Wait, for 'C:\\\\', the length is 3 (assuming the string is 'C:\\' with one backslash, but in Python, the string would be 'C:\\\\' if written as 'C:\\' in code. Wait, no. Let me clarify. In Python, if you have a string like 'C:\\', it's actually one backslash. Because in a string, each backslash is escaped. So os.path.sep on Windows is '\', so the string 'C:\\' would have len 3: 'C', '\', ' '? Wait, no. Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is 'C:\\', which in Python is written as 'C:\\' (because each backslash in a string needs to be escaped). The actual characters in the string are 'C', '\', and then another backslash? No, wait. Wait, in Python, when you write a string with a single backslash, you need to escape it with another backslash. So the string 'C:\\' is actually two backslashes. But os.path.sep on Windows is a single backslash. So when checking s.endswith(os.path.sep), which is '\', the string 'C:\\' (which is 'C\' followed by a single backslash) would end with a backslash. So the code would remove it, resulting in 'C:'.

Wait, maybe I should use os.path.sep correctly. Let me think. For example, on Windows, os.path.sep is '\', but in a string, you need to represent it as '\\' (since a single backslash is an escape). So when the code is running, the variable sep would be '\', and the string 'C:\\' would end with that separator. So in that case, the code would remove the last character, which is the backslash. So 'C:\\' becomes 'C:'.

But maybe the user intended to remove all trailing separators. However, according to the docstring, it's only checking the last character. So the code as written would only remove one trailing separator, even if there are multiple.

But perhaps the user wants to remove all trailing separators. Let me check the docstring again. The docstring says: "remove trailing os seperator characters." The wording "trailing" could imply that all trailing ones are removed. However, the condition in the docstring says "if the last character is the pathname separator"—so the code is supposed to check if the last character is a separator, and if so, remove it. So it's only removing the last character if it's a separator. So for example, 'path//' would become 'path/'.

But maybe the user wants to remove all trailing separators. However, the docstring's condition is only checking the last character. So perhaps the code should only remove the last character if it's a separator and the length is more than one. Therefore, the code I wrote earlier is correct.

Another example: input_list = ['/home/user/', '/home/user', 'C:\\', 'C:\\\\'] → output would be ['/home/user', '/home/user', 'C:', 'C:\\'].

Wait, for 'C:\\', the length is 3 (assuming the string is 'C:\\', which is 'C' followed by a single backslash). Wait, no. Let's think about how the string is represented. If the string is 'C:\\', then in Python, that's actually two backslashes. Wait, no. Wait, in a Python string, to represent a single backslash, you need to write two backslashes. So if the input string is 'C:\\', then the actual characters are 'C', '\', and then another '\'? No, that's not right. Let me take a concrete example. Suppose the string is 'C:\\', which in Python is written as 'C:\\' (because each backslash is escaped). The actual string would have two backslashes? No, no. Wait, when you write a string in Python, like 'C:\\', it's interpreted as a single backslash. Because the backslash is an escape character. So 'C:\\' is the same as 'C\' followed by a single backslash. So the length of that string is 3: 'C', '\', and then nothing else. Wait, no. Let me count. 'C:\\' is three characters: 'C', '\', and then another '\'? No, no. Wait, in a string, each backslash is represented as two backslashes in the code. So the string 'C:\\' would be 'C' followed by a single backslash. So the length is 2. Wait, no. Let me think again. If you have a string in Python like 'C:\\', then when printed, it would show as C\, but the actual string has two characters: 'C' and '\'. Wait, no. Wait, the string 'C:\\' is actually two backslashes. Wait, no. Let me take a concrete example. Let's say I have a string s = 'C:\\', then len(s) would be 3? Or 2? Wait, no. Wait, in Python, the string 'C:\\' is written with two backslashes, but it represents a single backslash. So the actual string is 'C\' followed by a single backslash. So the length is 2. Wait, no. Wait, the string 'C:\\' is three characters: 'C', '\', and then another '\'? No, that's not correct. Let me think. The string is written as 'C:\\', which is 'C' followed by two backslashes. But in Python, when you write a string with two backslashes, it's treated as a single backslash. So the actual string is 'C\' followed by a single backslash. Therefore, the length is 2. So if the input is 'C:\\', then len(s) is 2. So the code would check if len(s) > 1 (yes) and ends with os.path.sep (which is '\' on Windows). So it would remove the last character, resulting in 'C:'.

But if the input is 'C:\\\\', which in Python code would be written as 'C:\\\\', then the actual string is 'C' followed by two backslashes. So len is 3. The last character is a backslash. So the code would remove it, resulting in 'C:\\', which is two backslashes. But that's still a trailing backslash. So maybe the code needs to keep removing until there's no trailing separator. But according to the docstring, it's only checking the last character once. So the code as written would only remove one trailing separator per string.

But the user's docstring says "remove trailing os seperator characters"—maybe they intended to remove all trailing ones. However, the condition in the docstring says "if the last character is the pathname separator"—so perhaps the user wants to remove only the last character if it's a separator. So the code should do that.

Therefore, the code I wrote earlier is correct. So the function would process each string, check if it ends with the separator and has length > 1, then remove the last character. Otherwise, leave it as is.

So the code would be:

import os

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    sep = os.path.sep
    result = []
    for s in input_list:
        if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(sep):
            result.append(s[:-1])
        else:
            result.append(s)
    return result

Wait, but what about if the string is empty? Well, the len(s) > 1 condition would prevent processing. So empty strings are left as is.

Another test case: input_list = ['a/', 'b\\', 'c'] → on Windows, sep is '\', so 'a/' would not end with '\', so it's left as is. 'b\\' ends with '\', len is 2, so it becomes 'b'. 'c' is left as is. On Unix, sep is '/', so 'a/' would become 'a', 'b\\' would be left as is (since it ends with '\', which is not the sep on Unix), and 'c' remains. But the function uses os.path.sep, so it's OS-dependent.

Yes, that's correct. The function should use the OS's separator. So the code is correct.

I think that's the right approach. So the code would be as above. Now, the user said to output only the code in Python markdown format. So I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted with triple backticks and the language specified. Also, the code must not have any explanations. So the final answer is the code block.
