Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _create_converter method based on the given function signature and docstring. The method is supposed to return an instance of _converting._Converter. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is a method of a class, as indicated by the 'self' parameter. The return type is specified as _converting._Converter, which suggests that there's a module or a class named _converting that contains the _Converter class. Since the user hasn't provided any specific implementation details, I'll have to make some assumptions here.

The docstring mentions creating a parameter style converter. Parameter styles in databases usually refer to how parameters are passed in SQL queries, like format strings (e.g., %s, ?). So maybe this converter is responsible for handling different parameter styles. But without more context, I can't be sure. However, the task is to generate code that fits the signature, not necessarily to implement the actual logic.

The method is named _create_converter, which is a private method. The return is an instance of _Converter. So the most straightforward implementation would be to instantiate the _Converter class from the _converting module and return it. But perhaps there's some configuration or parameters needed for the converter? The original function signature doesn't include any parameters except self, so the converter might be created without any arguments.

Wait, the user hasn't provided any existing code, so I need to create a minimal implementation. Let me check the function signature again. The method doesn't take any parameters other than self, and it returns a _Converter instance. So the code would likely be something like:

return _converting._Converter()

But maybe there's more to it. For example, if the _Converter requires some parameters, but the user hasn't specified, perhaps the method is part of a larger class that has attributes which are used here. However, since the docstring doesn't mention any parameters, and the function signature doesn't include any, I can't assume that. So the simplest possible code is to return an instance of _Converter.

Alternatively, maybe the _Converter is a factory or needs some setup. But again, without more information, I can't add that. The user probably expects a basic implementation that just creates and returns the converter. So the code would be:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    """
    Create the parameter style converter.

    Returns the parameter style converter (:class:`._converting._Converter`).
    """
    return _converting._Converter()

I should make sure that the _converting module is imported. But the user didn't mention any imports, so maybe that's handled elsewhere. The code should just create the instance. I think that's all. Let me write that.
