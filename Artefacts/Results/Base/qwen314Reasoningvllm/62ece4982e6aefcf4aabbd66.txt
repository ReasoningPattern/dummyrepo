Okay, I need to write a Python function called was_processed based on the given signature and docstring. Let me read the docstring carefully.

The function's purpose is to check if a file or directory has already been processed. To prevent recursion, it says to expand the path name to an absolute path. Then, it should check if that absolute path is in the processed set. If it is, report the issue and return True. Otherwise, add it to the set and return False.

So the arguments are processed (a set), path_name (the path to check), and verbose (a boolean for output). The return is True if already processed, False otherwise.

First step: Convert path_name to an absolute path. How to do that in Python? Using os.path.abspath, maybe. But I should make sure to import os.

Then, check if this absolute path is in the processed set. If yes, return True. Also, if verbose is True, print a message indicating that the path was already processed.

If it's not in the set, add it to the set and return False.

Wait, the function's return is True if it's already in the set. So the logic is:

abs_path = os.path.abspath(path_name)
if abs_path in processed:
    if verbose:
        print(f"Already processed: {abs_path}")
    return True
else:
    processed.add(abs_path)
    return False

That seems straightforward. But need to handle possible exceptions? The docstring doesn't mention any, so probably not. Assume that path_name is a valid path.

So the code would be:

import os

def was_processed(processed, path_name, verbose):
    abs_path = os.path.abspath(path_name)
    if abs_path in processed:
        if verbose:
            print(f"Already processed: {abs_path}")
        return True
    processed.add(abs_path)
    return False

Wait, but the function is supposed to report the issue. The docstring says "report the issue and return True". So maybe when it's already in the set, we should print a message if verbose is True. Otherwise, just add it and return False.

Yes, that's what the code does. Let me check the parameters again. The processed set is passed in, and the function adds to it. So the function modifies the set in place. That's correct.

I think that's all. The code should be as written.
