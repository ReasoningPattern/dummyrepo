Okay, I need to write a Python function called next_version that takes a version string and returns the next version in the sequence. The docstring says it's supposed to follow the existing pattern, but the example isn't given. Hmm, what's the usual versioning pattern? Maybe semantic versioning like x.x.x?

Wait, the user didn't specify the exact pattern, but the function's name suggests incrementing the version. Let me think. For example, if the version is "1.2.3", the next would be "1.2.4". If it's "1.2.9", then "1.3.0". And if it's "1.9.9", then "2.0.0". Also, maybe handling cases where there are more than three parts, like "1.2.3.4"?

But how to parse the version string? Split it by dots and convert each part to integers. Then increment the last part, and if it overflows (like 9 becomes 10), carry over the increment to the previous part. So, similar to how numbers work.

Let me outline the steps. First, split the version into parts. Then, process each part starting from the end. Increment the last part, check if it's 10, if so, set it to 0 and carry over 1 to the previous part. Repeat this until there's no carry left. If all parts are 9, like "9.9.9", then the next version would be "10.0.0".

Wait, but what if the version has a different format, like "v1.2.3" or "1.2.3-alpha"? The problem says "following existing pattern", so maybe the input is a standard version string without any tags or prereleases. The function might assume that the version is in the format of numbers separated by dots.

So, the plan is: split the version string into a list of integers. Start from the last element, increment by 1. If it's 10, set to 0 and carry over 1 to the previous part. Continue this process until there's no carry. Then, join the parts with dots.

But how to handle the splitting? For example, version could be "1.2.3", split into ["1", "2", "3"], then convert to integers [1,2,3]. Then increment the last part to 4. If it's "1.2.9", increment last to 10, so set to 0 and carry 1 to the previous part, making it 1.3.0.

Let me think about the code structure. The function will take a string, split into parts using split('.'), then convert each part to an integer. Then process the list from the end.

Let me code this step by step. First, split the version into parts. Then, convert each part to integer. Then, start from the last index and increment. Let's see:

def next_version(version):
    parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))
    i = len(parts) - 1
    while i >= 0:
        parts[i] += 1
        if parts[i] < 10:
            break
        else:
            parts[i] = 0
            i -= 1
    # If all parts were 9, then after incrementing, they all become 0, and we need to add a new part 1?
    # Wait, for example, "9.9.9" becomes [10, 0, 0]?
    # Wait, no. Let's see: starting with [9,9,9]. Increment last part to 10. Since it's >=10, set to 0, carry 1 to previous. Now parts is [9,9,0], carry 1. Next, increment the second part (9+1=10), set to 0, carry again. Now parts is [9,0,0], carry 1. Then increment first part (9+1=10), set to 0, carry 1. Now i is -1, so we need to add a new part at the beginning. So the result would be [1,0,0,0], which is "1.0.0.0"?

Wait, but maybe the original version doesn't have a leading 'v' or any other prefix. So the input is just numbers separated by dots. So, for "9.9.9", the next version is "10.0.0".

Wait, in the example above, when all parts are 9, after incrementing the last part, we carry over until the first part. Then, after processing all parts, if there's a carry left, we add a new part at the beginning. So, the code needs to check if after processing all parts, the carry is still 1. For example, if the version is "9.9.9", the code would process each part and end up with carry 1 after the loop. Then, we need to prepend 1 to the parts list.

So, after the loop, if i is -1 (meaning all parts were 9), then we add a 1 at the beginning. Otherwise, the parts are already updated.

Let me code that. So after the loop, check if i is -1. If yes, then insert 1 at the start.

Wait, let's test with "9.9.9". The loop starts at i=2 (third part). Increment to 10, set to 0, carry 1. i becomes 1. Increment that part (9+1=10), set to 0, carry 1. i becomes 0. Increment that part (9+1=10), set to 0, carry 1. Now i is -1. So, we need to add a new part 1 at the beginning. So the parts would be [1, 0, 0, 0], resulting in "1.0.0.0".

Another example: "1.2.3" → increment last part to 4 → no carry, so return "1.2.4".

Another example: "1.2.9" → increment last to 10 → set to 0, carry 1. Then increment second part (2+1=3), so parts are [1,3,0], return "1.3.0".

Another example: "1.9.9" → increment last to 10 → set to 0, carry 1. Second part is 9+1=10 → set to 0, carry 1. First part is 1+1=2 → no carry. So parts are [2,0,0], return "2.0.0".

So the code would be:

Split the version into parts as integers.

Start from the last part, increment by 1.

If the part becomes 10, set to 0 and carry over 1 to the previous part.

Repeat until no carry or all parts are processed.

If after processing all parts, there's still a carry (i.e., all parts were 9), then add a new part 1 at the beginning.

Then, join the parts with dots.

So, code steps:

parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))

carry = 1

for i in reversed(range(len(parts))):

    parts[i] += carry

    if parts[i] < 10:

        carry = 0

        break

    else:

        parts[i] = 0

if carry == 1:

    parts = [1] + parts

return '.'.join(map(str, parts))

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let me think. Let's take the initial version as a list of integers. Then, we start from the end, add 1, check if it's 10. If yes, set to 0 and carry over. But maybe using a carry variable is better.

Wait, let's see. The original code I thought of was:

parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))

i = len(parts) - 1

while i >= 0:

    parts[i] += 1

    if parts[i] < 10:

        break

    else:

        parts[i] = 0

        i -= 1

if i == -1:

    parts = [1] + parts

return '.'.join(map(str, parts))

Yes, that would work. Because if after incrementing the last part and carrying over, i becomes -1, which means all parts were 9, so we add a 1 at the beginning.

Testing this code:

Case 1: "1.2.3" → parts [1,2,3]. i=2, parts[2] becomes 4. Break, return "1.2.4".

Case 2: "1.2.9" → i=2, parts[2] becomes 10 → set to 0, i=1. parts[1] is 2+1=3 → break. So [1,3,0] → "1.3.0".

Case 3: "1.9.9" → i=2 → 10 → 0, i=1. parts[1] is 9+1=10 → 0, i=0. parts[0] is 1+1=2 → break. So [2,0,0] → "2.0.0".

Case 4: "9.9.9" → i=2 → 10 → 0, i=1. parts[1] is 9+1=10 → 0, i=0. parts[0] is 9+1=10 → 0, i=-1. Then, add [1] + parts → [1,0,0,0] → "1.0.0.0".

Yes, that seems correct.

But what about versions with more parts, like "1.2.3.4"? Let's see. Incrementing the last part would make it 5, so "1.2.3.5". If it's "1.2.3.9", then increment to 10 → set to 0, carry to previous part. So "1.2.4.0".

Another edge case: "0.0.0" → next is "0.0.1".

What about "0.9.9"? Increment last part to 10 → 0, carry to previous. Second part is 9+1=10 → 0, carry to first part. First part is 0+1=1 → no carry. So [1,0,0] → "1.0.0".

So the code should handle all these cases.

Now, code:

def next_version(version):
    parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))
    i = len(parts) - 1
    while i >= 0:
        parts[i] += 1
        if parts[i] < 10:
            break
        else:
            parts[i] = 0
            i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        parts = [1] + parts
    return '.'.join(map(str, parts))

Wait, but what if the version is something like "1.0.0"? Then, the next version would be "1.0.1".

Yes. Let me test that. parts is [1,0,0]. i=2, parts[2] becomes 1 → break. So returns "1.0.1".

Another test case: "1.0.9" → becomes "1.1.0".

Yes. And "1.9.9" becomes "2.0.0".

So this code should work. Now, I need to make sure that the input is properly split. Also, what if the version is empty? Probably, the function is supposed to handle valid version strings, but maybe we should assume that the input is a valid version string with at least one part.

But the problem says "given next version identifier following existing pattern", so maybe the input is always a valid version string. So the code can assume that.

So this should be the correct implementation.
