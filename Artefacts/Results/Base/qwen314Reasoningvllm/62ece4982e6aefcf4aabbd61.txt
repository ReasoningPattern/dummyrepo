Okay, I need to write a Python function called _dictsum that takes a list of dictionaries and sums the values for the same keys. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's parameter is 'dicts', which I assume is a list of dictionaries. The goal is to combine them so that if a key exists in multiple dictionaries, their values are added together. If a key is only present in one dictionary, it just carries over that value.

So, how do I do that? Maybe start by initializing an empty dictionary to hold the summed values. Then, iterate through each dictionary in the list. For each key-value pair in the current dictionary, add the value to the corresponding key in the result dictionary. If the key isn't present yet, I need to create it with the initial value.

Wait, right. For each dict in dicts, loop through its items. For each key, check if it's already in the result. If yes, add the value. If not, set it to the value. That makes sense.

But how to handle the initial case when the result is empty? Let's see. Let's say the result starts as an empty dict. For the first dictionary, all keys are new, so they get added directly. For subsequent dictionaries, their keys might already be in the result, so we add to them.

So the steps would be:

1. Initialize a new dictionary, let's call it summed_dict.
2. Iterate over each dictionary in the input list.
3. For each key in the current dictionary:
   a. If the key is already in summed_dict, add the current value to it.
   b. Else, set the key in summed_dict to the current value.
4. Return summed_dict.

Wait, but how do I handle multiple dictionaries? Like, if there are three dictionaries with the same key, sum all their values.

Yes, that's correct. The code should work for any number of dictionaries in the list.

Now, implementing this in Python. Let's think about the code structure.

The function is defined as def _dictsum(dicts):. The parameter is a list of dictionaries.

So inside the function:

summed_dict = {}
for d in dicts:
    for key, value in d.items():
        if key in summed_dict:
            summed_dict[key] += value
        else:
            summed_dict[key] = value
return summed_dict

Wait, but what if the dictionaries have different keys? Like, one has 'a' and another has 'b'? Then the code will just add each key individually. That's correct.

Testing the example given: dict1 {'a':1, 'b':2}, dict2 {'a':5, 'b':0}. The summed_dict would start empty. Then process dict1: 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2. Then process dict2: 'a' is already there, so 1+5=6. 'b' is already there, 2+0=2. So the result is {'a':6, 'b':2}, which matches the example.

What about if a key is present in some dictionaries but not others? Like, if there's a third dict with 'c':3. Then 'c' would be added to the summed_dict as 3.

Yes, that's handled by the else clause.

I think that's all. So the code should be straightforward. Let me write that.
