Okay, I need to write a Python function called paging that takes a response list and a max_results integer. The goal is to return a generator that splits the response into pages, each with up to max_results elements. Let me think about how to approach this.

So, the function should yield chunks of the list. For example, if the response has 10 items and max_results is 3, it should yield three chunks: 0-2, 3-5, 6-9. Wait, but how does the generator work here? Oh right, using a loop that steps through the list in increments of max_results.

I remember that in Python, you can use a for loop with range and slice the list. Let me structure it. The total number of items is len(response). Then, for each page, start at i * max_results and end at (i+1) * max_results. So, iterate i from 0 to (len(response) + max_results - 1) // max_results, but maybe using a range that goes up to len(response) in steps of max_results.

Wait, the standard way to do this is to use a loop where start is i * max_results and end is (i+1) * max_results. So for each i in range(0, len(response), max_results), yield response[start:end]. That makes sense. Let me test that logic with an example. If the list has 10 elements and max_results is 3, then the ranges would be 0,3,6,9. The slices would be [0:3], [3:6], [6:9], [9:12]. The last slice would be from 9 to 12, but since the list only has 10 elements, it's [9:10], which is just the 10th element. Wait, no, 10 elements are indexes 0-9. So when i is 9, the next step is 9+3=12. So the slices would be 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12. The last slice would be from index 9 to 12, but since the list ends at 9, it's just the last element. But that's correct for paging, right? Each page is up to max_results items. So the generator would yield each of those slices.

So the code would be something like:

def paging(response, max_results):
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i+max_results]

Wait, but what if max_results is zero? Oh, but the function's argument is max_results (int), and in practice, it's probably expected to be a positive integer. The problem statement might assume that max_results is valid. So maybe no need to handle that case here.

Let me check the docstring again. The args are response (list) and max_results (int). The returns are a generator object splitting the response into pages. So this code should work. The generator will produce each page as a sublist. That's straightforward. I think that's the correct approach. Let me make sure there are no off-by-one errors. For example, if the list is exactly divisible by max_results, then each page is exactly max_results. If not, the last page has the remaining elements. Yes, that's correct. So the code should be as simple as that.
