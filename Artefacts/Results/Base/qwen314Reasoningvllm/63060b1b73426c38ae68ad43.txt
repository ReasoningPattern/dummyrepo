Okay, I need to generate Python code for the extend_cli function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to add CLI options for a spec to the main entry point. The parameter is root_subparsers, which is a subparser object.

First, I'll check the function name and parameters. The function is called extend_cli and takes self and root_subparsers. The docstring mentions adding spec cli options to the main entry point. So, the goal is to create a subparser under the main entry point for the spec command.

I remember that in argparse, you add subparsers using add_subparsers. But since root_subparsers is already provided, maybe I need to add a new subparser to it. The function might be part of a class that's extending the CLI, so using self makes sense.

I should create a subparser for the 'spec' command. Let's call it spec_parser. Then, add arguments to this subparser. The user might want to specify a file or some options related to the spec. Common CLI options could be --file or -f, maybe --help. Also, the help message should describe what the spec command does.

Wait, the docstring says "Adds the spec cli options to to the main entry point." The wording is a bit off, maybe it's a typo. But the parameter is named root_subparsers, so I need to add the spec subparser to that.

So, inside the function, I'll get the subparsers from root_subparsers. Then, create a new subparser for 'spec' with a help message. Then, add arguments to it. For example, a file argument that's required. Also, maybe a version option, but that's optional.

Let me structure the code. The function will take root_subparsers, add a subparser called 'spec', then add arguments. The code would look something like:

def extend_cli(self, root_subparsers):
    spec_parser = root_subparsers.add_parser('spec', help='Process specification files')
    spec_parser.add_argument('--file', '-f', required=True, help='Path to the specification file')
    spec_parser.add_argument('--version', action='version', version='1.0', help='Show version and exit')

But wait, the original docstring's parameter is named 'subparser' but the function parameter is 'root_subparsers'. Maybe that's a typo in the docstring. But the user provided the function signature with root_subparsers, so I should use that.

I need to make sure that the code is correct. The function is part of a class, so self is used. The root_subparsers is likely an argparse._SubParsersAction object. Adding a subparser to it with add_parser. Then, adding arguments to that subparser.

Maybe the spec command requires a file, so the --file argument is required. Also, a help message for the spec command. That seems right. I'll proceed with that code.
