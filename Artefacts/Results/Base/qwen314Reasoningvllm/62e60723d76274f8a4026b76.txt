Okay, I need to create a Python method called from_ticks that takes in ticks and an optional timezone. The ticks are nanoseconds since midnight, and I have to make sure they're within the valid range. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is a class method, so it should be decorated with @classmethod. The parameters are ticks (an integer) and tz (a tzinfo object, defaulting to None). The return type is a Time object, which I assume is a custom class, maybe similar to datetime.time but with nanoseconds.

The main task is to convert the ticks into a time. Since ticks are nanoseconds, I need to handle that. Let's see, there are 86400 seconds in a day, multiplied by 1e9 for nanoseconds, which gives 86400000000000 as the upper bound. The docstring says that ticks must be between 0 (inclusive) and that number (exclusive). So I need to check if ticks is within that range. If not, raise a ValueError.

How to convert nanoseconds to hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds? Let's break it down. 

First, total_seconds = ticks // 1e9. Wait, but ticks is an integer, so maybe better to use integer division. But 1e9 is a float, so perhaps using 1_000_000_000 as an integer would be better. Let me calculate:

ticks is nanoseconds. So:

- hours = ticks // (3600 * 1e9)
- remaining_ticks = ticks % (3600 * 1e9)
- minutes = remaining_ticks // (60 * 1e9)
- remaining_ticks = remaining_ticks % (60 * 1e9)
- seconds = remaining_ticks // 1e9
- nanoseconds = remaining_ticks % 1e9

Wait, but 3600 * 1e9 is 3,600,000,000,000 nanoseconds per hour. Similarly for minutes and seconds. But maybe there's a better way using the datetime module. Oh, right! Python's datetime module has a timedelta that can handle nanoseconds. But the time class might not directly support nanoseconds. Wait, the standard time class in datetime doesn't have a nanosecond attribute. So perhaps the Time class here is a custom one that includes nanoseconds.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to create a datetime.time object, but with nanoseconds. However, the standard time object only goes up to microseconds. So perhaps the Time class here is a custom class that extends or handles nanoseconds. But since the problem says to return a Time object, I'll assume that the class has attributes for hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds.

So, the steps are:

1. Validate ticks. Check if it's between 0 and 86400000000000 (exclusive). If not, raise ValueError.

2. Convert ticks to hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds.

Wait, but how to compute that correctly. Let me think:

Total nanoseconds in a day: 86400 * 1e9 = 86400000000000.

So, for example, if ticks is 123456789012345, then:

Compute total_seconds = ticks // 1_000_000_000. That would be 123456 seconds. Then, total_seconds can be broken into hours, minutes, seconds.

But maybe there's a more straightforward way. Let me think:

First, check if ticks is negative or >= 86400000000000. If so, raise error.

Then, compute hours = ticks // (3600 * 1e9). Wait, 3600 seconds per hour, multiplied by 1e9 nanoseconds per second gives 3,600,000,000,000 nanoseconds per hour. Then, the remainder after hours is ticks % (3600 * 1e9). Then minutes would be (remainder) // (60 * 1e9), and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps using division and modulus step by step.

Let me code that:

For example:

ticks = 123456789012345

hours = ticks // (3600 * 10**9)
remaining = ticks % (3600 * 10**9)
minutes = remaining // (60 * 10**9)
remaining %= (60 * 10**9)
seconds = remaining // 10**9
nanoseconds = remaining % 10**9

But wait, 3600 * 1e9 is 3,600,000,000,000. Let me compute that as 3600_0000_0000 (using underscores for readability). Similarly for 60 * 1e9 = 60_000_000_000.

But in Python, integers can be written with underscores, so 3600_0000_0000 is 3.6e12.

Once I have hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds, I can create a Time instance with those values. But how does the Time class handle nanoseconds? If it's a standard datetime.time, then nanoseconds aren't supported. So maybe the Time class here is a custom class that has those attributes.

Assuming that the Time class has an __init__ method that takes hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds, then I can proceed.

So the code would be:

class Time:
    def __init__(self, hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds):
        self.hours = hours
        self.minutes = minutes
        self.seconds = seconds
        self.nanoseconds = nanoseconds

But the user hasn't provided the Time class's implementation, so I need to create the from_ticks method that returns an instance of this class.

Putting it all together:

The method will first check if ticks is out of bounds. Then compute the components.

But wait, what about the timezone? The parameter tz is optional. If the Time class is timezone-aware, then perhaps we need to handle that. However, the standard time object in datetime is naive. If the Time class here is similar, maybe the tz parameter is not used, or perhaps it's part of the Time object's initialization. But the docstring says that tz is an optional timezone, so the Time class probably has a tzinfo attribute.

But since the problem says to return a Time object, and the parameters include tz, I need to include that in the creation. So maybe the Time class's __init__ takes tz as well.

But without knowing the exact structure of the Time class, I have to make assumptions. The user's docstring says that the method returns a Time instance, so I'll assume that the Time class can be initialized with hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, and tz.

Alternatively, maybe the Time class is a wrapper around datetime.time, but with nanoseconds. However, since datetime.time doesn't support nanoseconds, perhaps the code is using a different approach.

Another approach: using the datetime module's timedelta. For example, a day is 86400 seconds. So, if we take ticks as nanoseconds, then a day is 86400_000000000 nanoseconds. So, the code can create a timedelta of ticks nanoseconds, then add that to a midnight time (datetime.time.min) and then create a new Time object from that.

But again, the standard datetime.time doesn't support nanoseconds. So maybe the Time class is using a different approach, perhaps using a datetime.datetime object with a specific date, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the Time class is a custom class that has hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds as attributes, and the tz is handled by the class.

Given that, the code would be:

In the from_ticks method:

Check if ticks is between 0 and 86400000000000. If not, raise ValueError.

Then, compute hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds as per the breakdown.

Then, return an instance of the Time class with those values and the tz parameter.

But how to handle the tz? If the Time class is supposed to be timezone-aware, perhaps the tz is passed to the __init__ method.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

@classmethod
def from_ticks(cls, ticks, tz=None):
    if not (0 <= ticks < 86400000000000):
        raise ValueError("ticks is out of bounds")
    # calculate hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds
    ns_per_hour = 3600 * 10**9
    ns_per_minute = 60 * 10**9
    ns_per_second = 10**9
    hours = ticks // ns_per_hour
    remaining = ticks % ns_per_hour
    minutes = remaining // ns_per_minute
    remaining %= ns_per_minute
    seconds = remaining // ns_per_second
    nanoseconds = remaining % ns_per_second
    return cls(hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, tz=tz)

But I need to make sure that the __init__ method of the Time class accepts these parameters. Since the user hasn't provided that, I have to assume that the Time class has an __init__ that takes hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, and tz.

Alternatively, maybe the Time class is using the datetime module's time, but with nanoseconds. However, since the standard time doesn't have nanoseconds, perhaps the code is using a different approach. For example, the Time class might have a tzinfo attribute, and the hours, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds are stored as separate attributes.

In any case, the code for the from_ticks method would involve the validation and breaking down the ticks into the components. The exact implementation of the Time class is not given, so the code here would create an instance with those components and the tz.

So, the final code would be:

def from_ticks(cls, ticks, tz=None):
    """
    Create a time from ticks (nanoseconds since midnight).

    :param ticks: nanoseconds since midnight
    :type ticks: int
    :param tz: optional timezone
    :type tz: datetime.tzinfo

    :rtype: Time

    :raises ValueError: if ticks is out of bounds
    (0 <= ticks < 86400000000000)
    """
    if not (0 <= ticks < 86400000000000):
        raise ValueError("ticks is out of bounds")
    ns_per_hour = 3600 * 10**9
    ns_per_minute = 60 * 10**9
    ns_per_second = 10**9
    hours = ticks // ns_per_hour
    remaining = ticks % ns_per_hour
    minutes = remaining // ns_per_minute
    remaining %= ns_per_minute
    seconds = remaining // ns_per_second
    nanoseconds = remaining % ns_per_second
    return cls(hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, tz=tz)

Wait, but the parameters for the cls constructor would need to match. If the Time class's __init__ expects hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, and tz, then this code would work. But if the __init__ doesn't take tz, then maybe it's handled differently. However, the user's docstring says that tz is an optional parameter, so it's likely that the Time class can accept it.

Another thing: the calculation for remaining after hours. Let me test with some numbers. Suppose ticks is 3600_0000_0000 (1 hour in nanoseconds). Then hours = 1, remaining is 0. Then minutes would be 0, remaining is 0, seconds 0, nanoseconds 0. That's correct.

Another example: ticks = 1_000_000_000 (1 second). Then:

ns_per_hour is 3600 * 1e9 = 3,600,000,000,000. ticks is 1e9, which is less than that. So hours is 0. remaining is 1e9. Then minutes is 0, remaining is 1e9. Then seconds is 1, nanoseconds 0. Correct.

What about ticks = 123456789012345?

Let me compute:

ns_per_hour = 3600 * 1e9 = 3,600,000,000,000

ticks = 123456789012345

hours = 123456789012345 // 3600_0000_000000 → let's compute that. 3600_0000_000000 is 3.6e12. 123456789012345 divided by 3.6e12. Let's see:

Well, 3.6e12 is 3,600,000,000,000. Let's compute 123456789012345 / 3.6e12.

But perhaps I should use integer division. However, in Python, using 10**9 is better for clarity.

But the code seems correct. Also, the upper limit is 86400000000000, which is 24*3600*1e9. So the code checks that ticks is less than that.

Another possible edge case: ticks = 0 → 00:00:00.000...000.

ticks = 86399999999999 → 23:59:59.999999999.

So the code should handle that.

I think that's the correct approach. Now, write the code accordingly.
