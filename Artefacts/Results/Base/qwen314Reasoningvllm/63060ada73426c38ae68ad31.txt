Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _convert_non_cli_args based on the given signature and docstring. The function's purpose is to cast arguments in values_dict to their correct types. The parameters are parser_name and values_dict. The docstring says that by default, all values are strings, so the function should modify the values_dict to change those strings into the appropriate data types.

First, I should think about what kind of arguments might need conversion. Common types could be integers, booleans, floats, or maybe lists. Since the parser_name is provided, maybe different command names have different argument types. For example, if parser_name is 'virsh', certain arguments might be integers, while others might be booleans.

The function needs to iterate through the values_dict and check each value's type. But how do I know which arguments need conversion? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is part of a larger system where the expected types are predefined based on the parser_name. Maybe there's a configuration or a mapping that defines which arguments should be converted to what types for each parser.

Wait, the user hasn't provided any additional information about the specific types or mappings. So I need to make some assumptions here. Maybe the function is supposed to handle common conversions. For instance, if an argument is a string that can be converted to an integer, like "123", then convert it. Similarly, for booleans, check if the string is "True" or "False" (case-insensitive) and convert accordingly. For floats, check if the string represents a number with a decimal point.

But how to determine which arguments to convert? The function might have a predefined set of rules for each parser. For example, for the 'main' parser, certain keys might be expected to be integers, and for 'virsh', others. Since the user hasn't given specifics, perhaps the code should have a dictionary that maps parser names to their respective argument type mappings.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Check the parser_name to determine which arguments need conversion.
2. For each key in values_dict, check if it's in the conversion map for that parser.
3. If it is, convert the value to the specified type.
4. Update the values_dict in place.

But since the user hasn't provided the specific conversion rules, I'll need to create a sample structure. Maybe the function uses a predefined conversion map, like a dictionary where each parser has a list of arguments and their target types.

For example, something like:

conversion_maps = {
    'main': {
        'port': int,
        'debug': bool,
        'timeout': float,
    },
    'virsh': {
        'vm_id': int,
        'force': bool,
    },
    # other parsers...
}

Then, for the given parser_name, the function would look up the conversion rules and apply them to the values_dict.

So the code would start by checking if the parser_name exists in conversion_maps. If it does, iterate through each key in the corresponding conversion map. For each key, if it's present in values_dict, convert the value using the specified type and update the dict.

But how to handle the conversion? For example, converting a string to int might raise a ValueError if it's not a valid integer. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so maybe it's assumed that the values are valid, or perhaps it's handled elsewhere.

So the code would be something like:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    conversion_map = {
        'main': {
            'port': int,
            'debug': lambda x: x.lower() in ['true', 'yes', '1'],
            'timeout': float,
        },
        'virsh': {
            'vm_id': int,
            'force': lambda x: x.lower() in ['true', 'yes', '1'],
        },
        # Add other parsers as needed
    }
    if parser_name in conversion_map:
        for arg, arg_type in conversion_map[parser_name].items():
            if arg in values_dict:
                try:
                    values_dict[arg] = arg_type(values_dict[arg])
                except (ValueError, TypeError):
                    # Handle conversion errors if necessary
                    pass
    return values_dict

Wait, but for booleans, using a lambda might not be the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the conversion map uses the built-in bool type, but that would convert any non-empty string to True. However, the user might expect that the string is explicitly "True" or "False". So perhaps the lambda is better for checking specific strings.

But the original function's docstring says that the values are strings, so maybe the conversion is from string representations to actual types. For example, 'debug' could be a boolean argument that's passed as 'True' or 'False' strings.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert based on some standard conventions, like 'yes/no', 'true/false', '1/0', etc. But without specific instructions, it's hard to tell.

Another approach: The function might be part of a class that has predefined conversion rules for each parser. So perhaps the conversion maps are stored as instance variables or class variables. But since the function is a method, maybe it's using a class-level dictionary.

But the user hasn't provided that context. So I need to make a best guess. The code should be a placeholder that can be extended. For example, using a conversion map that's defined inside the function, or perhaps in the class.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert all values that can be converted to int, float, or bool, regardless of the parser. But that's less likely, as the parser name is a parameter.

The user's example shows that the function is modifying values_dict in place. So, the code should iterate over the keys in the conversion map for the given parser and convert the corresponding values.

So, putting it all together, the code would look like this:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    conversion_map = {
        'main': {
            'port': int,
            'debug': bool,
            'timeout': float,
        },
        'virsh': {
            'vm_id': int,
            'force': bool,
        },
        'ospd': {
            'max_connections': int,
            'log_level': str,
        },
        # Add more parsers and their argument type mappings as needed
    }
    if parser_name in conversion_map:
        for arg, arg_type in conversion_map[parser_name].items():
            if arg in values_dict:
                try:
                    values_dict[arg] = arg_type(values_dict[arg])
                except (ValueError, TypeError):
                    # Handle conversion errors if necessary
                    pass
    return values_dict

Wait, but for the 'log_level' in ospd, it's set to str, which doesn't change anything. Maybe that's a placeholder. Also, the conversion for boolean might need a custom function because converting a string like 'True' to bool would work, but maybe the original code expects a specific format.

Alternatively, using a helper function to convert strings to booleans. For example:

def to_bool(value):
    return value.lower() in ['true', 'yes', '1']

But in the code above, the conversion_map uses bool as the type. However, when you do bool('True'), it returns True, which is correct. But if the string is 'true', 'yes', or '1', it would also return True. But maybe the user expects that the string is exactly 'True' or 'False' (case-sensitive). However, in practice, it's common to handle various representations.

But since the user hasn't specified, the code can use the standard type conversion. So, for example, if the value is 'True', converting to bool would work. However, if the value is '123', converting to int would work, but converting to bool would also return True, which might not be intended. Therefore, the conversion map should specify the correct types for each argument.

In the example code, for 'main' parser, 'port' is converted to int, 'debug' to bool, 'timeout' to float. For 'virsh', 'vm_id' to int, 'force' to bool. For 'ospd', 'max_connections' to int, 'log_level' to str (which is redundant but maybe a placeholder).

The code would check if the parser_name exists in conversion_map, then for each argument in that parser's map, convert the value in values_dict if present.

But the user's function doesn't have a return statement in the original signature. Wait, the original code's function doesn't return anything, but the docstring says it modifies values_dict. However, in Python, dictionaries are mutable, so modifying them in place would affect the original object. But the function might return the modified values_dict for clarity.

But the original function's code isn't provided, so I need to follow the docstring. The docstring says that the function modifies values_dict. So, the code would process the values_dict in place.

Wait, in the sample code I wrote, it returns values_dict. But if the function is supposed to modify it in place, maybe it's not necessary to return it. However, the user's original code may or may not return it. Since the original function's code is empty, I can assume that it's supposed to modify the values_dict in place, and perhaps return it, but the original code might not have a return. But the user's docstring says it modifies the values_dict param, so the function may not need to return it, but it's good practice to return it for clarity.

Alternatively, the function may not return anything, but the code would still modify the dict. However, in Python, if you pass a mutable object like a dict to a function and modify it, the changes are visible outside the function. So, the function could just modify the dict in place and not return it.

But the original code's function signature doesn't have a return statement. However, the user's example code might expect that. So perhaps the code should not return anything, but the sample code I wrote returns the modified dict. That's a bit conflicting.

Wait, looking back, the user provided the function signature as:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):

The docstring says it modifies values_dict. So, the function doesn't need to return it, as the modification is in place. However, in Python, if the function is supposed to modify the dict, it's possible that the code does not return it, but the original code might have a return. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should just modify the dict and return nothing. However, the sample code I wrote returns the values_dict. Maybe the user expects that.

Alternatively, the function could return the modified values_dict, but since it's modifying in place, it's redundant. However, in some cases, it's useful to return it for chaining.

But given that the user hasn't provided any specific instructions on which arguments to convert, I need to create a plausible example. The code I wrote earlier uses a conversion_map with different parsers and their arguments. The function then applies the conversions based on that map.

So the final code would be something like that. However, the user might want the code to be a skeleton that can be filled in later. The conversion_map is a placeholder, and the actual conversion logic would depend on the specific arguments.

Another consideration: The function is named _convert_non_cli_args, which suggests that it's handling arguments that are not from the CLI, perhaps from a config file or another source. The conversion rules would be specific to each parser.

Therefore, the code should include a conversion_map that's specific to each parser, and apply those conversions to the values_dict. The code would need to handle different types, possibly with try-except blocks to avoid errors if the conversion isn't possible.

So, putting all together, the code would look like this.
