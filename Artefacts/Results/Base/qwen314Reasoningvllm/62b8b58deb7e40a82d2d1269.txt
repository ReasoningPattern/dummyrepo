Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function directlyProvidedBy that returns the interfaces directly provided by a given object. The docstring mentions that the return value is an IDeclaration from zope.interface. 

First, I remember that in Zope Interface, an object can provide interfaces through its class or via explicit declarations. The function should check the object's provided interfaces. 

Wait, the zope.interface module has a providedBy function, which returns the interfaces provided by an object. But the question here is about directly provided interfaces. Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly declared on the object, not inherited ones.

Wait, the docstring says the return is an IDeclaration. Oh right, IDeclaration is a declaration of interfaces, perhaps from the class's __provided__ attribute. So maybe the function is looking for the interfaces that are directly provided by the object's class, not through inheritance.

Wait, in Zope Interface, the providedBy function returns all interfaces that the object provides, including those from its class hierarchy. But the question here is about directly provided, so maybe it's about the interfaces that are explicitly declared on the object's class, not inherited. How to get that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly provided by the object, which could be through the __provides__ attribute or something similar. But I'm not sure about the exact method.

Wait, the zope.interface.interfaces module has IDeclaration, which is a declaration of interfaces. So perhaps the function is supposed to retrieve the interfaces that are directly declared on the object's class. 

Wait, looking up Zope Interface documentation: The providedBy() function returns the interfaces provided by an object. But if the object is a class, then it's the interfaces that the class provides. However, if the object is an instance, then it's the interfaces provided by its class. 

But the function's name is directlyProvidedBy, which might imply that it's looking for interfaces that are directly provided, not through inheritance. However, I'm not sure if there's a specific method for that. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly declared on the object's class, using the zope.interface.declarations module. For example, using declarations.directlyProvidedBy, which I think is a function that returns the directly provided interfaces without considering inheritance.

Wait, yes! In Zope Interface, there's a function called directlyProvidedBy in the declarations module. So the correct approach is to import that and use it. 

So the code would be:

from zope.interface.declarations import directlyProvidedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return directlyProvidedBy(object)

But wait, the user's function signature is def directlyProvidedBy(object), and the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. However, the directlyProvidedBy function from zope.interface.declarations returns an IInterface or a list of interfaces? Wait, no. Let me check. 

Actually, the providedBy() function returns an IInterface, but directlyProvidedBy might return a list or something else. Wait, perhaps the user's docstring is incorrect, or maybe they are referring to the declaration of interfaces. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly provided by the object, which could be obtained via the zope.interface.declarations module's directlyProvidedBy function. 

So the correct code would be to import that function and return it. But I need to make sure that the function is correctly imported. 

Wait, the zope.interface.declarations module has a function called directlyProvidedBy, which returns the interfaces directly provided by the object. So the code should be using that. 

Therefore, the generated code would import directlyProvidedBy from zope.interface.declarations and return it. 

I think that's the right approach. So the code is straightforward.
