Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function process_text_links based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to process links in the text, add some attributes, and linkify textual links. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, what does linkifying textual links mean? Probably turning plain text URLs into HTML anchor tags. So, I need to find URLs in the text and wrap them with <a> tags. But the docstring also mentions adding some attributes. Maybe attributes like target="_blank" or rel="nofollow"? The user didn't specify, so I'll have to make an assumption here. Let's say we add target="_blank" and rel="nofollow" for example.

Next, how to detect URLs in the text. Python has libraries like re (regular expressions) for this. I can use a regex pattern to find URLs. Common URL patterns include http://, https://, www., etc. But I should make sure the regex is comprehensive enough. Maybe use a pattern that matches various URL formats.

Then, for each URL found, replace it with an anchor tag. The replacement should include the URL as the href and the text as the link. But wait, the original text might have the URL as part of a sentence. For example, "Visit http://example.com for more info." So, I need to make sure that the URL is properly identified and replaced without breaking the surrounding text.

I should use the re.sub function with a lambda as the replacement function. The lambda will take each match and return the formatted anchor tag. Let me think about the regex pattern. A common one is something like r'(https?://\S+|www\.\S+)', but maybe I need to adjust it to capture URLs properly without including other text.

Wait, but how to handle cases where the URL is part of a larger word? Like in "http://example.com/somepage.txt". The regex should match the entire URL. Maybe using a pattern that looks for sequences starting with http:// or https:// followed by non-whitespace characters, or www. followed by non-whitespace. But I need to make sure that it doesn't match parts of other words. For example, in "http://example.com", the entire thing should be matched, not just parts.

Also, the function's name is process_text_links, so maybe it's intended to process multiple links. The replacement function should handle each match individually. Let me outline the steps:

1. Use re.sub to find all URLs in the text.
2. For each URL found, replace it with an <a> tag that includes the URL as href and the same text as the link, plus the attributes.

But what if the text has other links, like mailto: links? The problem statement says "textual links," so maybe only HTTP and WWW links. Let me stick with that.

So the regex pattern could be r'(https?://\S+|www\.\S+)'.

Now, the replacement. For each match, the href is the matched URL. The link text is the same as the URL. So the replacement would be something like '<a href="{}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{}</a>'.format(match.group(1), match.group(1)).

Wait, but maybe the user wants to keep the original text as the link text. For example, if the text is "Check out example.com", then it should become "<a href="http://example.com" ...>example.com</a>". But if the URL is "http://example.com", then the text is the same as the href. However, sometimes people write links as "Visit http://example.com", so the link text is "http://example.com", but maybe the user wants to make sure that the entire URL is captured and turned into a link.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to find URLs and turn them into links, but also add attributes. So the code would use re.sub with a function that processes each match.

Let me write the code step by step.

Import re.

Define the function process_text_links(text):

Inside the function, use re.sub with a pattern that matches URLs. The pattern should be something like r'(https?://\S+|www\.\S+)'.

Then, for each match, create the anchor tag with the attributes. The attributes could be target="_blank" and rel="nofollow" as examples. So the replacement would be a lambda that takes a match object and returns the formatted string.

Wait, but the original text might have other parts. For example, if the text is "Go to http://example.com or www.test.org", both URLs should be replaced.

Testing the regex: Let's see. The pattern (https?://\S+|www\.\S+) would match http://example.com, https://test.org, www.site.net, etc. But what about URLs with spaces? Probably not, since \S+ matches non-whitespace. But in reality, URLs don't have spaces. So that's okay.

But maybe the regex should be more precise. However, for the scope of this problem, maybe a simple regex is acceptable.

So the code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    def replace_url(match):
        url = match.group(0)
        return f'<a href="{url}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{url}</a>'
    
    pattern = r'https?://\S+|www\.\S+'
    return re.sub(pattern, replace_url, text)

Wait, but the pattern might not capture all cases. For example, URLs with underscores or hyphens. But the \S+ part would include those as they are non-whitespace. So that's okay.

Another consideration: what if the text has other parts that look like URLs but are not? Like "http://example.com is a site". The regex would match the entire URL, so that's correct.

But maybe the user wants to ensure that the URL is properly enclosed, like not matching "http://example.com/path?query=param" incorrectly. However, the regex as written would match the entire sequence up to the next whitespace, which is correct.

So this code should work. It uses a regular expression to find URLs starting with http://, https://, or www., and replaces each with an anchor tag that includes the URL as the href and the same text, adding the specified attributes.

I think that's a reasonable approach. The attributes are added as per the example, but the user didn't specify which ones. Since the docstring says "adding some attributes," I can choose common ones like target and rel. Alternatively, maybe the attributes are to be determined by the user, but since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and no further info, I need to make a best guess. Using target="_blank" and rel="nofollow" is a common practice for linkifying.

So the final code would be as written above.
