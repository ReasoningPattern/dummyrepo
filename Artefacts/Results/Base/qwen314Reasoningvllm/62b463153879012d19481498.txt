Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function files_list that takes a path and returns the list of files in that directory. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to return the files in the given path. So, I should use the os module to interact with the file system. The os.listdir function can list all entries in a directory, but I need to filter out directories and only include files.

Wait, right. os.listdir returns all files and directories. To distinguish between them, I can use os.path.isfile. So, for each item in the list from os.listdir, check if it's a file. But wait, the path parameter might be a directory path, but what if the path itself is a file? Hmm, the function's docstring says "files in given path," so maybe it's intended that the path is a directory. But maybe I should handle cases where the path is a file by returning an empty list or raising an error? The original code example might not have that, but the user didn't specify. Let me check the original problem again.

The user provided the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Return the files in given path." So, perhaps the function is supposed to list files in the directory specified by path. Therefore, I should assume that path is a directory. But in practice, if the path is a file, os.listdir would throw an error. So maybe I need to handle that? Or maybe the function is supposed to return files in the directory, so the path should be a directory. However, the user's example code might not include error handling. Let me see the initial code they provided. The initial code is just the function definition with a docstring, no implementation. So I need to write the code that returns the list of files in the given path.

So the steps are: use os.listdir(path) to get all entries, then filter those that are files using os.path.isfile. But wait, os.path.isfile returns True if the path is a file. However, when using os.listdir, the items are just filenames. So I need to combine the path with each filename to check if it's a file. For example, for each item in os.listdir(path), check if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, item)).

But what about hidden files? The user didn't mention excluding them, so I should include all files, including hidden ones. Also, the function should return a list of filenames, not the full paths. Wait, the docstring says "files in given path," which could be interpreted as the names of the files, not their full paths. But maybe the user wants the full paths? The original problem isn't clear. Let me check the function's name again. It's called files_list, which might return the list of file names in the directory. However, sometimes people might expect full paths. But since the function's parameter is a path, and the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps it's safer to return the filenames without the path. Or maybe return the full paths. Hmm.

Looking at the example code that the user might have in mind. Let's think of a standard way. For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs', then the function should return the list of files in that directory, like ['file1.txt', 'image.png', ...]. But to check if each entry is a file, I need to use os.path.isfile with the full path. So, the code would be something like:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    return [f for f in os.listdir(path) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, f))]

Wait, but what if the path doesn't exist? Or if the user doesn't have permission? The original code might not handle errors, as the user hasn't specified any error handling in the docstring. So the function as written would raise an OSError if the path is invalid. But the user's problem statement says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, without adding explanations. So maybe the code is supposed to be straightforward, without error handling.

Another thing: os.listdir returns the names of the entries in the directory, and os.path.isfile checks if each entry is a file. So combining them as above should work. However, in Python, there's also the possibility of using os.scandir, which might be more efficient. But again, the user hasn't specified performance considerations, so using listdir and isfile is probably acceptable.

So the code would import os, then loop through the listdir, check if each is a file, and collect the names. That's the basic approach. Let me make sure that the code is correct. Testing with a sample directory. Suppose the path is a directory with files and subdirectories. The code should return only the files. Yes.

But wait, what about symbolic links? The os.path.isfile function follows symbolic links, so if there's a symlink pointing to a file, it would be considered a file. But again, unless the user specifies handling symlinks, the code should be as is.

So the final code would be:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    return [f for f in os.listdir(path) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, f))]

Yes, that seems correct. I think that's what the user is expecting. They didn't mention any specific edge cases, so this should suffice.
