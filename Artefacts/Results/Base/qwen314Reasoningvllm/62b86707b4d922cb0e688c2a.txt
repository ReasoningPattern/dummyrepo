Okay, I need to generate Python code for the on method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the on method returns a decorator to add a new handler to a "hook" in the class's registry. 

So, the function is part of a class, probably some kind of event system or hook manager. The hook parameter is the name of the hook, and the decorator should register a function as a handler for that hook.

First, the on method itself should take a hook name and return a decorator. The decorator needs to accept a function and then add it to the registry. Let me think about how decorators work here. The standard way is to have the on method return a function that takes the handler function as an argument. Then, that inner function would add the handler to the registry.

Wait, the registry is in the class. So the class probably has a dictionary or some structure to hold the hooks and their handlers. The on method would need to modify that registry. Let me assume that the class has a registry attribute, maybe a dictionary where keys are hook names and values are lists of handler functions.

So, the on method would return a decorator function. When someone uses @self.on('hook_name'), the decorator should take the function being decorated and append it to the registry entry for 'hook_name'.

Let me structure this. The on method is defined as def on(self, hook):. Inside, it returns a function that takes a handler. Then, that handler is added to self.registry[hook]. But I need to make sure that the registry exists. Maybe the class initializes it in __init__.

Wait, the user didn't provide the class structure. But the code should be self-contained. So perhaps the class has a registry attribute. Let me check the code example.

The code would look like:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(handler):
        if hook not in self.registry:
            self.registry[hook] = []
        self.registry[hook].append(handler)
        return handler
    return decorator

But wait, the registry might not be initialized. So maybe in the class, there's a registry = {} or something similar. But since the user didn't mention that, perhaps the code assumes that the registry exists. Alternatively, maybe the class has a registry attribute that's a dictionary. So the code would need to have that. But the user's instruction is to generate the on method based on the signature and docstring, not the entire class. So maybe the code is part of a class that already has a registry.

But the user wants the code for the on method. So the code should be written as part of a class. However, the user's example might not include the class definition. Let me see the original problem again.

The user provided the function signature and docstring. The code should be generated based on that. So the on method is part of a class. The code needs to be in Python, and the output should be in Python markdown format. But the user says to output only the code generated, not any explanations.

So the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in self.registry:
                self.registry[hook] = []
            self.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator

But maybe the class is already defined, and the on method is part of it. However, the user didn't specify, so perhaps the code should just define the on method, assuming that the registry is already present. But in Python, if the registry isn't initialized, this would cause an error. So maybe the code should include the __init__ method as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the registry is a class variable. But the docstring says "in the class", which might imply an instance variable. So the __init__ method initializes self.registry as a dictionary.

But the user's original code only shows the on method. However, to make the code functional, the registry needs to be initialized. So the generated code should include that. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't mention initializing the registry, so maybe the code assumes that the registry is already present.

Wait, the user's example might be part of a larger class. But since the user only provided the on method's signature and docstring, perhaps the code should just implement the on method, and the registry is assumed to be an existing attribute of the class.

But in reality, without initializing the registry, the code would crash. So maybe the code should include the __init__ method. However, the user didn't mention that. But the problem says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "add a new handler to the 'hook' in the registry in the class". So the class must have a registry. Therefore, the code should include the __init__ method that initializes the registry.

But the user didn't provide the class name. So perhaps the code is part of a class, and the user expects that the class has a registry. But to make the code work, the registry needs to be initialized. So maybe the code should include the __init__ method.

But the original function signature is def on(self, hook):, which implies that it's part of a class. Therefore, the generated code should be part of a class. But the user didn't specify the class name. So perhaps the code is written as a method inside a class, and the registry is an instance variable.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

class HookRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in self.registry:
                self.registry[hook] = []
            self.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator

But the user didn't mention the class name, so maybe they just want the method. However, without the __init__ method, the code would not work. But perhaps the user expects that the registry is already set up. However, to make the code functional, the registry must be initialized. So maybe the code should include that.

Alternatively, maybe the registry is a class-level variable. Let me think. If the registry is a class variable, then the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in SomeClass.registry:
                SomeClass.registry[hook] = []
            SomeClass.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator

But using a class variable might not be thread-safe or allow multiple instances. So more likely, it's an instance variable. Therefore, the __init__ method is needed.

But the user's original code only shows the on method. However, the generated code needs to be complete. So perhaps the user expects that the class has a registry, and the on method is part of that class. Therefore, the code should include the __init__ method initializing the registry.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is def on(self, hook):, and the docstring says it adds a handler to the registry in the class. Therefore, the code for the on method would be as follows, assuming that the registry is an instance variable.

So the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    """
    Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
    """
    def decorator(handler):
        if hook not in self.registry:
            self.registry = []
        self.registry[hook].append(handler)
        return handler
    return decorator

Wait, but in the __init__ method, self.registry is initialized as a dictionary. So in the on method, self.registry is a dictionary. But in the code above, if hook is not in self.registry, then self.registry is set to a list? That doesn't make sense. Oh, no, that's a mistake. The code should check if the hook is in the registry, and if not, create a new list for it. So:

def on(self, hook):
    """
    Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
    """
    def decorator(handler):
        if hook not in self.registry:
            self.registry[hook] = []
        self.registry[hook].append(handler)
        return handler
    return decorator

But this assumes that self.registry is a dictionary. So the class must have that. Therefore, the code for the class would need to have __init__ that initializes self.registry as a dictionary. But the user didn't provide that. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says the registry is in the class, so the code should be part of a class that has that registry.

But the user's example only shows the on method. However, to make the code work, the registry needs to be initialized. Therefore, the generated code should include the __init__ method. But the user didn't mention that. Maybe the user expects that the registry is already present. But for the code to be correct, we need to include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the registry is a class variable. Let me think again. If the registry is a class variable, then multiple instances would share the same registry. But the docstring says "in the class", which could be either instance or class level.

But given that the on method is an instance method, it's more likely that the registry is an instance variable. Therefore, the code should include the __init__ method.

But the user's original code only shows the on method. However, the generated code must be complete. So the answer should be a class that includes both __init__ and on methods.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function signature is for the on method. The docstring doesn't mention the __init__ method, so maybe the user expects that the registry is already initialized. However, without that, the code would not work. Therefore, perhaps the code should include the __init__ method.

But the user might not want the entire class, just the on method. However, the on method can't function without the registry. Therefore, the generated code should be part of a class that has the registry initialized.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is for the on method. So maybe the user expects that the code is written as a method inside a class, and the registry is already present. But that's not possible unless the class is defined elsewhere. However, the user might want the code to be self-contained. Therefore, including the __init__ method is necessary.

So the final code would be a class with __init__ and on methods. The class name can be arbitrary, like HookManager or something. But the user didn't specify, so maybe just a generic class.

Therefore, the code would be:

class HookManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in self.registry:
                self.registry[hook] = []
            self.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator

But the user didn't mention the class name. However, the code must be valid. So perhaps the user expects that the code is part of a class, and the registry is initialized. Therefore, including the __init__ is necessary.

But the original problem didn't provide the class structure. However, the function is part of a class, so the code should be written as part of a class. Therefore, the generated code would be the on method along with the __init__ method that initializes the registry.

So the answer is the code for the on method, assuming that the registry is an instance variable. Therefore, the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in self.registry:
                self.registry[hook] = []
            self.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator

But the user might not want the class name to be MyClass. However, the user didn't specify, so any class name is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the registry is a class variable. But I think instance variable is more likely.

So the code would be as above. But the user's original code only shows the on method. However, to make the code functional, the __init__ is needed. Therefore, the generated code includes both __init__ and on methods.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is for the on method. The docstring says it adds a handler to the registry in the class. Therefore, the code for the on method is as follows, assuming that the registry is initialized in the class.

But the user might not want the entire class, just the method. However, without the registry, the code can't work. Therefore, the generated code must include the __init__ method.

So the final answer includes the class with __init__ and on methods. The class name can be arbitrary. The code is written in Python, and the user wants it in Python markdown format. But the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the answer is:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in self.registry:
                self.registry[hook] = []
            self.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator
```

But maybe the user expects that the registry is a class-level variable. Let me check again. The docstring says "the registry in the class", which could be a class variable. So:

class MyClass:
    registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in MyClass.registry:
                MyClass.registry[hook] = []
            MyClass.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator

But in this case, all instances share the same registry. That might not be intended. However, the docstring says "in the class", which could mean class-level. But the method is an instance method, so perhaps it's intended to have per-instance registries. Therefore, the first approach with instance variable is better.

So I think the correct code is the one with the instance variable. Therefore, the generated code includes the __init__ method initializing self.registry as a dictionary, and the on method as described.
