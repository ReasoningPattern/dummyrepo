Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _parse_image_ref function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it parses an image href into image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. So the input is a string URL, and the output is a tuple with those three components.

First, I should figure out how to extract the image_id. Maybe the URL has a specific pattern. For example, if the href is like "https://example.com/images/12345.jpg", the image_id could be "12345". But the problem is, the exact structure isn't specified. Wait, the function is probably part of a larger system, maybe like a media parser. Let me think of common URL structures. Sometimes image URLs have a path that includes an ID, like /images/{id}/ or /image/{id}. Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the last part of the path before the extension.

But without specific info, I need to make assumptions. Let's look at the parameters again. The function takes image_href as a string. The return is (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). Netloc is the network location part of the URL, which is the domain. Use_ssl is a boolean indicating whether the URL uses HTTPS.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Parse the URL to get the netloc and scheme (to determine use_ssl).
2. Extract the image_id from the path.

For parsing the URL, I can use urllib.parse.urlparse. That will split the URL into components. The netloc is the domain part, and the scheme is http or https. So use_ssl would be True if the scheme is 'https', else False.

Now, the image_id. Let's assume that the image_href is a URL that ends with the image ID. For example, if the URL is "https://example.com/images/12345.jpg", the image_id is "12345". But how to extract that? The path would be "/images/12345.jpg". Splitting the path by '/' gives ['', 'images', '12345.jpg']. So the last part is the filename, which might contain the ID. But maybe the image ID is the part before the extension. So splitting on the last '.' gives the ID.

Wait, but maybe the image_href is structured in a way that the image ID is in a specific part of the path. For example, if the URL is "https://example.com/image/12345", then the image_id is "12345". However, without knowing the exact structure, this is tricky. The original code might have had some logic here, but since it's not provided, I need to make a general approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the image_href is expected to be in a format like "http://example.com/images/{image_id}" or similar. So the image_id is the last segment of the path before the file extension. Let me think of splitting the path into parts and then taking the last part before the extension.

Another approach: maybe the image_href is a full URL, and the image ID is the part after the last slash, but without the file extension. For example, in "https://example.com/images/12345.jpg", the image_id is "12345".

So, steps to extract image_id:

- Split the URL path into parts using urlparse.
- Take the last part of the path (e.g., '12345.jpg').
- Split that part on the last '.' to get the ID.

But what if there's no extension? Like "https://example.com/images/12345"? Then the image_id would be "12345".

So code steps:

Parse the URL with urlparse.

Check the scheme: if it's 'https', use_ssl is True, else False.

For the netloc, that's the parsed.netloc part.

For image_id, take the path, split into parts, get the last part, then split on the last '.' to remove the extension.

But how to split the path? Let's take the example:

path = '/images/12345.jpg'

parts = path.split('/') → ['', 'images', '12345.jpg']

last_part = parts[-1] → '12345.jpg'

Then split last_part on the last '.' to get the image_id. So, split into [ '12345', 'jpg' ] and take the first part.

But how to handle cases where there's no extension? Like '12345' → split on '.' would give ['12345'], so take that.

So code for image_id:

filename = parsed.path.split('/')[-1]
image_id = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[0]

But wait, what if the filename has multiple dots, like 'image.12345.jpg'? Then rsplit with maxsplit=1 would take the part before the last dot, which is 'image.12345'.

But maybe that's acceptable. The problem is that the original function's logic isn't specified, so I need to make a reasonable assumption here.

Now, the function needs to raise ValueError if the href is not properly formatted. For example, if there's no image ID in the path, or if the URL is invalid.

So first, I need to parse the URL. Let's use urllib.parse.urlparse. Then check if the parsed URL has a valid scheme and netloc. If not, raise ValueError.

But the function's docstring doesn't specify what invalid cases are. However, the original code might have had some checks. Since the user didn't provide existing code, I need to assume that the URL must have a scheme (http or https) and a netloc. Also, the path must contain at least one segment after the domain, and that the last part of the path has an extension.

So code outline:

import urllib.parse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.scheme or not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL format")
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    # extract image_id from path
    path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
    if not path_parts or len(path_parts) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Image href path is missing")
    filename = path_parts[-1]
    image_id = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[0]
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the path could be empty. For example, if the URL is "https://example.com", then parsed.path is '/', split into ['', 'example.com']? No, wait, urlparse for "https://example.com" would have path as empty string. So parsed.path.split('/') would be ['', '']? Or maybe ['']?

Wait, let's test. If the URL is "https://example.com", then parsed.path is '/', which when split by '/' gives ['', ''].

So in that case, path_parts would be ['', ''], len is 2. Then path_parts[-1] is '', which when split into filename would be empty. Then image_id would be ''.

But that's probably invalid. So the function should check that the path has at least one non-empty segment. Or perhaps the image_href is supposed to point to an image file, so the path should end with a filename.

So the code would check if the path is empty or not. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the image_href is expected to have a path that includes the image ID. So if the path is '/', then there's no image ID, which is invalid.

So in the code, after splitting the path into parts, we need to check that there's at least one part after the domain. For example, if the URL is "https://example.com/images/12345.jpg", then the path is '/images/12345.jpg', split into ['', 'images', '12345.jpg'], so the last part is '12345.jpg'.

But if the URL is "https://example.com", then path_parts is ['', ''], and the last part is '', which would lead to image_id being empty. So that's invalid. Hence, the function should raise ValueError in that case.

So adding checks:

if not parsed.scheme or not parsed.netloc:
    raise ValueError

if not parsed.path:
    raise ValueError

But even if parsed.path is present, maybe it's just '/' and there's no image ID. So perhaps check that the path has at least one non-empty segment after splitting.

Alternatively, check that the filename is not empty. So:

filename = parsed.path.split('/')[-1]
if not filename:
    raise ValueError

But then, if the URL is "https://example.com/images/", the filename would be 'images', but maybe that's not correct. Wait, the URL ends with a slash, so the path is '/images/', split into ['', 'images', '']? Or maybe the split would be ['', 'images', '']?

Wait, let's think. For the path '/images/', splitting by '/' gives ['', 'images', ''].

So path_parts[-1] is ''. Then filename is empty. So that would be invalid.

So in that case, the function would raise a ValueError.

But maybe the image_href is supposed to be a direct link to an image file. So the code should ensure that the filename has an extension. But how?

Alternatively, the code may not check that, but just extract the image_id as the part before the last dot, even if it's empty. However, the function's docstring says it raises ValueError, but the exact conditions aren't specified. So perhaps the function expects that the image_href is a valid URL with a scheme, netloc, and a path that ends with a filename containing an extension.

But since the user hasn't provided specific examples, I need to code based on the assumption that the image_href is a valid URL pointing to an image, and that the image_id is the part before the last dot in the filename.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

import urllib.parse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.scheme or not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL format")
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
    if not path_parts or len(path_parts) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Image href path is missing")
    filename = path_parts[-1]
    if not filename:
        raise ValueError("Filename is empty")
    image_id = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[0]
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the path_parts could be ['', 'images', '12345.jpg'] for the URL '/images/12345.jpg'. So len(path_parts) is 3, which is >=2. So the check len(path_parts) < 2 would trigger if the path is something like '/', which splits into ['', ''].

But in that case, the path_parts has length 2, so len >= 2. So the check len(path_parts) < 2 would not trigger. However, the filename would be '', which is invalid.

So the code should check that the filename is not empty. So after getting filename, check if it's empty. If yes, raise error.

But maybe there's a case where the path ends with a slash, like 'https://example.com/images/12345/'. Then the filename is empty. So in that case, the code would raise ValueError.

But what if the image_href is 'https://example.com/images/12345'? Then the filename is '12345', which has no extension. Then image_id would be '12345', and that's acceptable.

So the code would handle that.

Another possible case: if the URL is 'https://example.com/12345.jpg', then path_parts is ['', '12345.jpg'], so filename is '12345.jpg', image_id is '12345'.

But what if the path is '/image/12345'? Then filename is '12345', image_id is '12345'.

But maybe the image_href is supposed to have a specific structure, like the image ID being in a certain part of the path. However, without more info, this is the best approach.

So the code would be as above.

Now, the original code may have had some other logic, but since the user hasn't provided it, I need to proceed with this.

Testing the code with some examples:

Example 1: 'https://example.com/images/12345.jpg'

parsed.scheme is 'https', netloc is 'example.com'.

path_parts is ['', 'images', '12345.jpg'], filename is '12345.jpg', image_id is '12345'.

Return ('12345', 'example.com', True).

Example 2: 'http://example.com/images/67890.png'

Return ('67890', 'example.com', False).

Example 3: 'https://example.com/image/12345' → image_id is '12345'.

But if the URL is 'https://example.com', then parsed.path is '/', split into ['', ''], filename is '', which raises ValueError.

Another case: 'https://example.com/images/' → filename is '', raises error.

Another case: 'ftp://example.com/images/12345.jpg' → scheme is 'ftp', which is not http or https. The code checks if the scheme is present, but since the function's docstring doesn't mention handling other schemes, perhaps it's allowed. Wait, the use_ssl is determined by the scheme being 'https'. So if the scheme is 'ftp', use_ssl would be False. But the function may not be intended for such URLs. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that it raises ValueError, but doesn't specify when. So maybe the function expects that the URL is either http or https. But the original code may not have that check. Hmm.

But the original code's docstring doesn't mention that. So maybe the code should allow any scheme, but use_ssl is True only if it's 'https'. However, if the scheme is not http or https, then the code would still parse it, but use_ssl would be False. But perhaps the function is designed for image URLs, so the scheme is expected to be http or https. But the user hasn't specified that. So maybe the code doesn't check for that, but just uses the scheme to determine use_ssl. However, the function may raise ValueError if the scheme is not http or https. But the original problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps it's not required.

But the function's docstring says it raises ValueError, but the user hasn't given specific cases. So perhaps the code should check that the URL is valid, which includes having a scheme and netloc. The current code checks for that. So if the URL is missing scheme or netloc, it raises an error.

So the code as written would handle that.

So the final code would be:

import urllib.parse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.scheme or not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL format")
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
    if not path_parts or len(path_parts) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Image href path is missing")
    filename = path_parts[-1]
    if not filename:
        raise ValueError("Filename is empty")
    image_id = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[0]
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the check for len(path_parts) < 2. If parsed.path is '/', then split into ['', ''], len is 2, so that check would pass. But then filename is '', which is invalid. So that check is redundant. So perhaps remove that check and just check if filename is empty.

So maybe the code can be simplified:

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.scheme or not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL format")
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    filename = parsed.path.split('/')[-1]
    if not filename:
        raise ValueError("Filename is empty")
    image_id = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[0]
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, parsed.path.split('/') could split into multiple parts. For example, if the path is '/a/b/c.jpg', then split into ['', 'a', 'b', 'c.jpg'], and the last part is 'c.jpg'.

But if the path is '/a/b/', then the last part is '', which would trigger the error.

This code would handle that.

Another possible case: if the path is empty. For example, if the URL is 'example.com', then parsed.scheme is empty, which would trigger the first error.

But if the URL is 'http://example.com', then parsed.path is '/', split into ['', ''], so filename is '', which would trigger the second error.

So in that case, the function would raise ValueError for 'http://example.com' because the filename is empty.

But maybe that's acceptable. The function is supposed to parse an image href, which should have a path pointing to an image file. So if the URL is just the domain, it's invalid.

Thus, the code should work.

But what if the image_href is 'http://example.com/images/12345'? Then filename is '12345', image_id is '12345'.

Yes.

Another case: 'http://example.com/images/12345.67890.jpg' → image_id is '12345.67890'.

So that's acceptable.

So this code should meet the requirements. Now, the user's original code may have had different logic, but since they didn't provide it, this is the best approach based on the given info.
