Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_valid and takes an identifier as an argument. The docstring says that in the base implementation, it should always return True. So the user probably wants a simple implementation that just returns True regardless of the identifier.

Let me check the parameters. The function is a method since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The identifier is the second parameter. The base case is to return True always. So the code would be straightforward.

Wait, the user specified not to include any explanation, just the code. But I need to make sure I'm following the correct syntax. The function is part of a class, right? Because it has 'self'. So the code should be inside a class, but the original code snippet doesn't show the class. However, the user provided the function signature, so maybe they just want the method implementation.

The docstring mentions (D) at the end. Not sure what that refers to, maybe a note or a tag, but the user didn't ask for that. The code should have the docstring as given. So the function will have the docstring and return True.

So the code would be:

def is_valid(self, identifier):
    """
    Return True if identifier is valid. In this base implementation, always return True.  (D)
    """
    return True

That's all. No need for any error checking or other logic since the base implementation is supposed to always return True. Just make sure the indentation is correct and the return statement is there.
