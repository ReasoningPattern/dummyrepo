Okay, I need to generate Python code for the to_csv function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is a method, probably part of a class, since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it's deprecated in Lena 0.5, and that iterables are converted to tables. The purpose is to convert a graph's points to CSV format. The parameters are separator (default comma) and header (optional first string).

The note mentions that for each point, first its coordinate is converted to string, separated by the separator, then each part of its value. So, each point in the graph has coordinates and values. For example, if a point is (x, y), then the coordinate part would be "x,y" and the value part would be whatever the value is, maybe another iterable?

Wait, the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe each point is a tuple where the first elements are coordinates, and the rest are values. Like, if a point is (x, y, value1, value2), then coordinates are x and y, converted with the separator, then value1 and value2 are each part of the value. But how are they separated? Maybe the separator is used between coordinates and between values, but perhaps the values are joined with the same separator?

The function should return the CSV string. Let me think about the structure. The header is the first line if provided. Then, for each point in the graph, we need to process coordinates and values.

But wait, the docstring also says that to convert Graph to CSV inside a Lena sequence, use lena.output.ToCSV. So maybe this function is part of a larger framework, and the actual implementation would be handled by that class. However, the user wants code for this function, so perhaps it's a placeholder or a deprecated method that's not used anymore, but still needs to be implemented.

But the docstring says that to_csv is not used in Lena 0.5. So maybe this function is just a stub that raises a deprecation warning. However, the user might want the actual code that would convert the graph's points to CSV, even if it's deprecated.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring mentions that iterables are converted to tables. So perhaps the graph's points are iterables, and each point's coordinates and values are processed.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the graph has points like (x, y, z), where x and y are coordinates, and z is the value. Or maybe coordinates are a tuple and values are another tuple. For instance, a point might be ( (x1, x2, ...), (v1, v2, ...) ), so the coordinates are converted to a string with the separator, then the values are converted similarly.

So the CSV line for each point would be the coordinates joined by the separator, followed by the values joined by the same separator. But how are they separated from each other? Like, if coordinates are (x, y) and values are (a, b), then the line would be "x,y,a,b"?

But the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinates are joined with the separator, then the values are joined with the same separator, and then those two parts are combined with the separator again? Or maybe the coordinates and values are separate fields in the CSV.

Wait, the example in the docstring says that iterables are converted to tables. So maybe each point is an iterable that contains both coordinates and values. For example, a point could be a tuple where the first part is coordinates and the rest are values. But how to split them?

Alternatively, perhaps the graph's points are structured such that each point has coordinates and a value. For example, in a 2D graph, each point is (x, y), and the value is y. But the note says that since it's multidimensional, coordinates and values are handled separately.

Hmm, maybe the graph's points are objects that have 'coordinates' and 'values' attributes. So for each point, we take the coordinates, convert them to strings, join with the separator, then take the values, convert them to strings, and join with the same separator. Then, combine these two parts into a single line with the separator.

But the function's parameters are separator and header. The header is the first string of the output. If header is provided, it's added as the first line. Then, each point's line is constructed as described.

So the code would need to iterate over the graph's points. But how is the graph structured? The function is part of a Graph class, perhaps. So assuming that self has a points attribute which is an iterable of point objects, each with coordinates and values.

Wait, the user hasn't provided the class definition, so I need to make assumptions. Let me think: the function is called on a Graph instance, and it converts the points to CSV. So perhaps each point in the graph is a tuple where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values. For example, a point might be (x, y, value1, value2), and the coordinates are x and y, then the values are value1 and value2. But how to separate them in the CSV line?

The docstring says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value. So maybe the coordinates are joined with the separator, then the values are joined with the same separator, and then those two parts are combined with the separator again. For example, if the point is (1, 2, 3, 4), coordinates are (1,2) joined as "1,2", values are (3,4) joined as "3,4", then the entire line is "1,2,3,4".

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates and values are separate parts. Like, for a 2D graph, each point has x and y coordinates, and the value is y. But the note says that for multidimensional graphs, the coordinates and values are processed. So maybe the coordinates are one part, and the values are another part, each joined by the separator, and then combined with the separator.

But without knowing the exact structure of the Graph class, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the function's name is to_csv, and the parameters are separator and header. The header is a string that's added as the first line. Then, for each point, we need to generate a line.

Assuming that each point in the graph is an object that has a 'coordinates' attribute (which is an iterable) and a 'values' attribute (also an iterable). Then, for each point, we would convert coordinates to strings, join with separator, then convert values to strings, join with the same separator, and then combine those two parts with the separator again.

Wait, but the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinates are joined with the separator, then the values are joined with the same separator, and then those two strings are joined with the separator again. So for a point with coordinates (x1, x2) and values (v1, v2), the line would be "x1,x2,v1,v2".

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates and values are separate fields. For example, in a CSV, the first part is the coordinates, then the values. But how to represent that? Maybe the coordinates are one field and the values are another, but that would require knowing how many coordinates and values there are.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is a collection of points where each point is a tuple of coordinates and values. For example, in a 2D graph, each point is (x, y), and the value is y. But if it's multidimensional, maybe the coordinates are multiple values, and the values are also multiple.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended approach is to take each point, which is an iterable, and split it into coordinates and values. However, the problem is that the user hasn't provided the structure of the graph's points. So maybe the function is supposed to process each point as a tuple where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values. But how to determine where coordinates end and values begin?

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is a collection of (x, y) points, and for each point, the x and y are converted into a CSV line. But the note says that for multidimensional graphs, coordinates and values are handled. So maybe the coordinates are multiple dimensions, and the values are also multiple.

Wait, the user says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinates are one part, and the values are another. For example, if a point is ( (x1, x2), (v1, v2) ), then the line would be "x1,x2,v1,v2".

But how to get that structure from the graph? The function is part of the Graph class, so maybe the graph has a points attribute, which is a list of such tuples.

Alternatively, perhaps each point is an object with a 'coordinates' and 'values' attribute. For example, in Lena, maybe each point has these attributes. So for each point in self.points, we take the coordinates, convert them to strings, join with the separator, then take the values, convert them to strings, join with the separator, and then combine those two parts with the separator.

But without knowing the actual structure, this is speculative. However, given the deprecation note, perhaps this function is no longer used and is just a placeholder. But the user wants the code generated, so maybe it's supposed to be a simple implementation.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a CSV string by iterating through the points, converting each to a string with the separator. But the header is a string that's added first.

Wait, the docstring says that the header is the first string of the output. So if the header is provided, it's added as the first line. Then, each point's line is generated by converting coordinates and values.

But how to structure the lines. Let's think of an example. Suppose the graph has points like (x, y), and the values are y. Then, each line would be x,y. But if it's multidimensional, maybe each point has multiple coordinates and multiple values. For example, a 3D point with coordinates (x, y, z) and values (a, b). Then, the line would be x,y,z,a,b.

But the function's parameters don't specify how to split coordinates and values. So perhaps the function assumes that each point is a tuple where the first part is coordinates (as a tuple) and the rest are values. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the graph is a collection of (coordinates, values) pairs. For example, each point is a tuple where the first element is the coordinates (like a tuple) and the second is the values (another tuple). Then, for each point, we would join the coordinates with the separator, then join the values with the same separator, and then combine them into one line.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, this is a guess. However, given the information, perhaps the code should be written to handle each point as a tuple where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values. But how to split them?

Alternatively, maybe the graph's points are structured such that each point's coordinates and values are separate. For example, the Graph has a 'coordinates' and 'values' attribute. But that's not clear.

Another approach: since the function is deprecated and the note says to use lena.output.ToCSV, perhaps the actual implementation is handled elsewhere, and this function is just a stub that raises a warning. But the user might want the code that would generate the CSV, even if it's deprecated.

But the user hasn't mentioned any deprecation handling. The docstring says that the function is deprecated, but the code may still need to be generated. However, the user might want the code to be a placeholder that issues a warning.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate the CSV lines by combining coordinates and values. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Assuming that each point in the graph is an object with a 'coordinates' attribute (which is an iterable) and a 'values' attribute (another iterable). Then, for each point, we would create a line by joining the coordinates with the separator, then joining the values with the separator, and then combining those two parts with the separator again. So the line would be something like "x1,x2,v1,v2".

But how to get the points? The function is part of the Graph class, so perhaps self.points is a list of such objects.

So the code would look something like:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    # generate CSV content
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coords = separator.join(map(str, point.coordinates))
        values = separator.join(map(str, point.values))
        line = coords + separator + values
        lines.append(line)
    return "\n".join(lines)

But this is assuming that the Graph has points with coordinates and values attributes. However, the user hasn't provided that info. So maybe the actual code is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph's points are stored as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates followed by the values. For example, a point could be (x1, x2, v1, v2). Then, the code would split them into coordinates and values. But how?

If the graph is a collection of points where each point is a tuple, and the first part is coordinates (maybe of length n) and the rest are values (maybe of length m), then how to split them? The problem is that without knowing n and m, it's impossible to split.

Alternatively, maybe the graph is a collection of (x, y) points, and the values are y. Then, each line would be x,y. But the note says that it's multidimensional, so maybe coordinates are multiple values.

Wait, the original function's docstring says that for each point, first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value. So maybe the coordinates are a single value (like a tuple), and the values are another tuple. For example, if the point is ( (x1, x2), (v1, v2) ), then the line would be "x1,x2,v1,v2".

But again, without knowing the structure, this is a guess. However, given the information, perhaps the code should be written to handle that case.

Alternatively, maybe the graph is a collection of points where each point is a tuple of coordinates and a value. For example, (x, y) where x is the coordinate and y is the value. Then, the line would be "x,y".

But the note says that the graph can be multidimensional, so perhaps the coordinates are multiple values. For example, in a 3D graph, each point has (x, y, z) coordinates and maybe a value. But how to represent that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert the graph's data into a CSV where each row represents a point, with the coordinates and values concatenated. For example, if the graph has points with coordinates and values as separate parts, then each line would be the coordinates joined by separator, then the values joined by the same separator, and then combined into one line.

But again, without knowing the actual structure of the Graph class, it's challenging. However, given that the user provided the function signature and the docstring, perhaps the code should be written in a way that's compatible with the Lena framework.

Wait, the note says that to convert Graph to CSV inside a Lena sequence, use lena.output.ToCSV. So maybe this function is part of an older version and is deprecated, but the actual code would be handled by that ToCSV class. However, the user is asking to generate code for this function, not for ToCSV.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a CSV string by iterating through the graph's data points, converting each to a string with the separator. But the header is optional.

If I can't figure out the exact structure, perhaps the code is supposed to be a simple example. Let's think of a possible scenario where the graph's points are a list of tuples, each containing coordinates and values. For example, if each point is a tuple (x, y, value), then the line would be x,y,value. But for multidimensional, maybe more coordinates and values.

But perhaps the function is intended to take each point, which is a tuple of coordinates and values, and join them all with the separator. For example, if a point is (x, y, v1, v2), then the line would be "x,y,v1,v2".

In that case, the code could be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.

    *separator* delimits values, the default is comma.

    *header*, if not ``None``, is the first string of the output
    (new line is added automatically).

    Since a graph can be multidimensional,
    for each point first its coordinate is converted to string
    (separated by *separator*), then each part of its value.

    use :class:`lena.output.ToCSV`.
    """
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        # Assuming point is an iterable that contains coordinates followed by values
        # For example, a point could be (x1, x2, v1, v2)
        # But how to separate coordinates and values?
        # Maybe the first part is coordinates, the rest are values.

        # Alternatively, maybe coordinates and values are separate attributes.
        # Let's assume that each point has 'coordinates' and 'values' attributes.
        coords_str = separator.join(map(str, point.coordinates))
        values_str = separator.join(map(str, point.values))
        line = coords_str + separator + values_str
        lines.append(line)
    return "\n".join(lines)

But again, this is assuming that the points have 'coordinates' and 'values' attributes. If that's not the case, the code would fail.

Alternatively, if the graph's points are stored as a list of tuples where each tuple is (coordinates, values), then for each point, we can process them. For example, if a point is ((x1, x2), (v1, v2)), then coords_str is "x1,x2" and values_str is "v1,v2", and the line is "x1,x2,v1,v2".

But without knowing the actual structure, perhaps the code is supposed to be a generic implementation. However, the user might expect that the code is part of a Graph class that has points, and each point is a tuple of coordinates and values.

Alternatively, maybe the graph is a collection of (x, y) points, and the values are y. Then, each line is x,y. But the note says multidimensional, so perhaps the code should handle that.

Another possibility: the graph's points are stored as a list of tuples, and each tuple represents the coordinates and the value. For example, in a 2D graph, each point is (x, y), and the value is y. But the function is supposed to convert coordinates and then the value parts. Maybe the code is supposed to take the coordinates and the value as separate parts.

But this is getting too speculative. Since the user provided the function signature and the docstring, perhaps the code should be written in a way that's compatible with the Lena framework's structure. However, without knowing the exact structure, I can't be certain.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a CSV where each row is the coordinates of the point followed by the value. For example, if the point is (x, y, z), then the line is "x,y,z".

But the note says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted, then each part of its value. So maybe the coordinates are one part and the values are another. For example, a point has coordinates as a tuple and values as another tuple. Then, the line is the coordinates joined by separator, then the values joined by separator, and then those two joined with the separator.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, I can't be sure. However, given that the function is deprecated, perhaps the code is just a warning and returns an empty string or something. But the user probably wants the actual code that would generate the CSV.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is a collection of data points where each point is a tuple of coordinates and a single value. For example, (x, y) where x is the coordinate and y is the value. Then, the line would be "x,y".

But the note says that for multidimensional graphs, coordinates and values are handled. So maybe the code should handle cases where coordinates are multiple values and values are also multiple.

In the absence of specific information, I'll proceed with the assumption that each point is an iterable where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values. For example, if a point is (x1, x2, v1, v2), then coordinates are x1 and x2, values are v1 and v2. But how to split them? Maybe the coordinates are the first part and the values are the rest. But without knowing how many coordinates there are, it's impossible. So perhaps the code is supposed to take the entire point as a single line, with all elements joined by the separator. But that would ignore the distinction between coordinates and values.

Alternatively, maybe the graph has separate coordinates and values. For example, self has a 'coordinates' and 'values' attribute, and each point is a combination of those. But that's unclear.

Another approach: looking at the parameters. The header is a string that's added as the first line. Then, each point's line is generated. For example, if the header is "x,y,value", then each line would be "x1,y1,value1".

But again, without knowing the structure of the points, this is hard.

Perhaps the correct way is to generate a CSV where each row is the coordinates and values concatenated. For example, if the point is a tuple of coordinates and values, then the line is the concatenation of those two parts, each joined by the separator.

But given that the user hasn't provided the structure, maybe the code is supposed to be a placeholder that raises a deprecation warning and returns an empty string. However, the docstring says that it converts the graph's points to CSV, so the code should do that.

Alternatively, the code could be written to iterate over the points, and for each point, convert all elements to strings, join with the separator, and add to the lines. But that would not separate coordinates and values.

Wait, the docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinates are converted to a string, then the values are converted to a string, and those two are joined with the separator. So for a point with coordinates (x1, x2) and values (v1, v2), the line would be "x1,x2,v1,v2".

Assuming that the graph's points are structured with coordinates and values as separate parts, perhaps the code would look like:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        # Assuming point has coordinates and values attributes
        coords = separator.join(map(str, point.coordinates))
        values = separator.join(map(str, point.values))
        line = f"{coords}{separator}{values}"
        lines.append(line)
    return "\n".join(lines)

But again, this depends on the existence of 'coordinates' and 'values' attributes in the points. If that's not the case, the code would fail. However, given the information provided, this might be the best approach.

Alternatively, if the points are stored as a list of tuples where each tuple contains the coordinates and the value, then perhaps the code would split them. For example, if the graph is 2D, each point is (x, y), and the value is y. But that's not clear.

Another possibility is that the graph is a collection of (x, y) points, and the values are the y components. Then, the code would generate lines like "x,y".

But the note says that it's multidimensional, so maybe coordinates are multiple values. For example, in a 3D graph, each point has (x, y, z) coordinates and maybe multiple values.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the code should be written to handle the case where each point is a tuple of coordinates and values. However, since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code is just a skeleton that raises an error or returns something.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert the graph's data into a CSV format where each row is the coordinates followed by the value. For example, if the graph has points with multiple coordinates and a single value, then each line would be "coord1,coord2,value".

But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard to proceed. Given that the user is asking for code generation based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps the code should be written with the assumption that the graph has a 'points' attribute, and each point is an iterable that can be split into coordinates and values.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to generate a CSV where each line represents a point's coordinates and values, joined by the separator. So for a point (x, y, z), the line would be "x,y,z".

In that case, the code would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        line = separator.join(map(str, point))
        lines.append(line)
    return "\n".join(lines)

But this would not separate coordinates and values. However, the docstring says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted, then the value. So maybe the code should split the point into coordinates and values. But how?

Perhaps the graph has a 'coords' and 'values' attribute. For example, each point's coordinates are in self.coords and values in self.values. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, the graph's points are stored as a list of tuples, where each tuple has coordinates and values. For example, a point might be ( (x1, x2), (v1, v2) ), and the code would join the coordinates and values separately.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, this is guesswork.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to generate code that issues a deprecation warning and returns an empty string, as the function is deprecated and not used. But the user might expect the actual code that would convert the points, even if it's deprecated.

Alternatively, the function might be part of a class that has a 'points' attribute, and each point is a tuple of coordinates and values. For example, in a 2D graph, each point is (x, y), and the value is y. But the code would need to handle that.

But considering that the user provided the function signature and the docstring, and the note says that iterables are converted to tables, maybe the code is supposed to take each point as an iterable and join all elements with the separator. Then, the header is added as the first line.

So the code would be:

        lines.append(line)
    return "\n".join(lines)

But this would not separate coordinates and values. However, the docstring says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted, then the value. So perhaps the code should process coordinates and values separately.

If I can't determine the structure, maybe the code should be written with the assumption that each point has a 'coordinates' and 'values' attribute, which are iterables. Then, the line would be the coordinates joined by separator, followed by the values joined by separator, all in one line.

But again, this is an assumption. However, given the information, this seems plausible.

So, the code would look like:

import warnings

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    output = []
    if header is not None:
        output.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coords_str = separator.join(map(str, point.coordinates))
        values_str = separator.join(map(str, point.values))
        output.append(f"{coords_str}{separator}{values_str}")
    return "\n".join(output)

But this requires that each point has 'coordinates' and 'values' attributes. If that's not the case, the code would fail. However, given the context, this might be the intended approach.

Alternatively, maybe the graph's points are stored as a list of tuples where the first element is the coordinate and the rest are the values. For example, a point is (x, y, z), where x is the coordinate and y and z are values. But how to split that?

In that case, the code would need to know how many coordinates there are. But that's not provided in the function parameters.

Given all these uncertainties, I think the best approach is to generate a function that issues a deprecation warning and returns an empty string, as the function is not used in Lena 0.5. However, the user might want the code that would have been used before deprecation.

Alternatively, the code could be a placeholder that returns a sample CSV string. But that's not helpful.

Wait, the user says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code that matches the signature and docstring. The function is deprecated, but the code should still be generated. The docstring says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value. So maybe the code is supposed to take the coordinates and values of each point, convert them to strings, and join them with the separator.

Assuming that the graph's points are stored as a list of tuples, where each tuple has coordinates and values. For example, in a 2D graph, each point is (x, y), and the value is y. But how to split into coordinates and values.

Alternatively, perhaps the graph is a collection of (x, y) points, and the code is supposed to generate CSV lines with x and y separated by the separator. But that would be simple.

But the note says that for multidimensional graphs, coordinates and values are handled. So maybe the code should handle cases where coordinates are multiple and values are multiple.

In the absence of more information, I'll proceed with the code that issues a deprecation warning and returns an empty string, as the function is not used anymore. But that might not be what the user wants.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to generate a CSV where each line is the coordinates and values concatenated. For example, if the graph has points with coordinates (x1, x2) and values (v1, v2), then the line is "x1,x2,v1,v2".

But again, without knowing the structure, I can't be certain. However, given the function's parameters and the docstring, the code might look like this:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.

    Convert graph's points to CSV.

    *separator* delimits values, the default is comma.

    *header*, if not ``None``, is the first string of the output
    (new line is added automatically).

    Since a graph can be multidimensional,
    for each point first its coordinate is converted to string
    (separated by *separator*), then each part of its value.

    To convert :class:`Graph` to CSV inside a Lena sequence,
    use :class:`lena.output.ToCSV`.
    """
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        # Assuming that the point has a 'coordinates' and 'values' attribute
        coords = separator.join(map(str, point.coordinates))
        values = separator.join(map(str, point.values))
        line = f"{coords}{separator}{values}"
        lines.append(line)
    return "\n".join(lines)

But I'm not sure if this is correct. However, given the information provided, this seems like a plausible implementation. The code includes the deprecation warning and processes each point's coordinates and values, joining them with the separator and combining them into a single line.
