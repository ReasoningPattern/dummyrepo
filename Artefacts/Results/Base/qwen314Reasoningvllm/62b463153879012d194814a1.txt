Okay, I need to generate Python code for the add_rendition method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what the docstring says. It mentions assigning the filepath from filepath() to "lang" in _renditions. So, the method should take lang and file_path as parameters. Wait, the function signature already has those parameters. The docstring says that the filepath is invoked by filepath() in the class. So maybe the file_path is obtained by calling a method called filepath() on the instance?

Wait, the parameters are lang and file_path. But the docstring says "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions". Hmm, maybe the file_path is the result of calling the filepath() method. But the method is supposed to take file_path as an argument. That's a bit confusing. Let me re-read the docstring.

The docstring says: Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions in the class. Oh, maybe the intention is that the file_path is generated by the filepath() method, but the method's parameter is file_path. That might be a mistake. Or perhaps the user intended that the file_path is determined by calling filepath(), but the parameter is passed in. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take the lang and then use the filepath() method to get the file path, but the parameter is named file_path. That seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the docstring is saying that the filepath() method is called, and its return value is assigned to the _renditions dictionary under the key "lang". But the function signature has file_path as a parameter. So perhaps the method is supposed to store the provided file_path into _renditions for the given lang. But why mention filepath() then?

Wait, maybe the original code has a method called filepath() that returns the file path, and the add_rendition method is supposed to call that method to get the file path, then assign it to the _renditions dictionary. But the current function signature has file_path as a parameter. That would mean that the user might have made a mistake in the parameters. But since the function signature is given as part of the problem, I have to follow it.

So the function is supposed to take lang and file_path, and assign the file_path to the _renditions dictionary under the key lang. So the code would be something like self._renditions[lang] = file_path. But I need to make sure that _renditions is initialized as a dictionary in the class. Maybe the class has an _renditions attribute that's a dict. So the method would just add or update the entry for the given lang with the provided file_path.

Wait, the docstring says "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions". So maybe the file_path is not passed as an argument but is obtained by calling the filepath() method. But the function signature includes file_path as a parameter. That's conflicting. Perhaps the user made a typo in the docstring. For example, maybe the method is supposed to call filepath() and use that result as the value for the lang key in _renditions. But the parameters are lang and file_path. So maybe the actual code is supposed to be self._renditions[lang] = self.filepath(), but that would ignore the file_path parameter. That seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the docstring is trying to say that the file_path is determined by invoking the filepath() method, but the parameter is named file_path. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the intended logic is that the add_rendition method uses the filepath() method to get the path, then assigns it to the _renditions for the given lang. But then why pass file_path as a parameter? Unless the parameter is redundant, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the original code had a different parameter name. For example, maybe the method is supposed to take lang and some other parameter, and then call filepath() to get the path. But the user provided the function signature with file_path as the parameter. So maybe the docstring is incorrect, but the function signature is correct. Since the user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, I need to reconcile both.

Alternatively, maybe the docstring is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The function is called add_rendition, and the parameters are lang and file_path. The docstring says "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions". So perhaps the method is supposed to take lang and file_path, and then assign the file_path to the _renditions dictionary for that lang. That would make sense. So the code would be:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    self._renditions[lang] = file_path

But then why mention filepath() in the docstring? Maybe the docstring is incorrect, or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the file_path is supposed to be generated by the filepath() method, but the parameter is named file_path. That seems conflicting. However, since the function signature includes file_path as a parameter, the code would use that parameter. The mention of filepath() in the docstring might be a mistake, or perhaps it's a note that the file_path is obtained via that method elsewhere.

But given the information, the most straightforward implementation is to assign the provided file_path to the _renditions dictionary under the key lang. Therefore, the code would be as simple as that. I should make sure that _renditions is a dictionary attribute of the class. If it's not initialized, perhaps the code should check for that, but the problem doesn't mention that. The user just wants the method based on the given signature and docstring. So assuming that _renditions is already a dictionary in the class, the code is straightforward.
