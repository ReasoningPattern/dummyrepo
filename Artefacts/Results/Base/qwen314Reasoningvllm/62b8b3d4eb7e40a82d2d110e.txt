Okay, I need to write a Python function called _c_optimizations_ignored that returns True if the environment variable "PURE_PYTHON" is not none and not 0, else False. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's docstring says it checks the "PURE_PYTHON" environ. So I should look up that environment variable. In Python, environment variables can be accessed using os.environ. But I need to make sure to handle cases where the variable might not exist.

The condition is: if the variable is not none (so it exists) and not 0, return True. Otherwise, return False. Wait, but environment variables are strings. So what does "not 0" mean here? Maybe the user intended to check if the value is not equal to the string "0" or perhaps if it's not the integer 0. But since environ returns strings, comparing to 0 would be a type error. So probably, the check is whether the value is not "0".

So the steps are: check if "PURE_PYTHON" is in the environment. If it is, check if its value is not "0". If both conditions are true, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Wait, the docstring says "get 'PURE_PYTHON' environ is not none and not 0". So maybe the function is supposed to return True when the environ variable is present (i.e., not None) and its value is not 0. But since environ variables are strings, maybe they meant the string "0".

So the code would be something like:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    value = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    if value is not None and value != "0":
        return True
    else:
        return False

Alternatively, since os.environ.get returns None if the key isn't present, we can simplify it. The function returns True only if the variable exists (so not None) and its value is not "0". So the code can be written as:

return os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON") not in (None, "0")

Wait, but that would check if the value is not None and not "0". So yes, that's equivalent. But maybe the original intention was to check if the variable is set to a non-zero value, but since it's a string, perhaps they want to check if it's not "0".

So the code would be:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    return os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON") not in (None, "0")

But wait, what if the environment variable is set to "0"? Then it's in the tuple, so returns False. If it's set to any other value, like "1", "false", or even an empty string, it would return True. That seems correct based on the docstring.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to check if the variable is not set (i.e., not present) or set to 0. But the docstring says return True if the environ is not none and not 0. So the function returns True when the variable is present and not equal to "0".

Yes, that's the correct interpretation. So the code should check if the environment variable exists (so get returns a value) and that value is not "0".

So the code is as I wrote before. Let me make sure to import os. Also, note that os.environ.get returns the value as a string, so comparing to "0" makes sense.

Another thing: in some cases, environment variables might be in different cases, but the docstring specifies "PURE_PYTHON", so the key is case-sensitive. So we don't need to handle that.

So the final code would be:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    """
    Return True if get "PURE_PYTHON" environ is not none and not 0, else return False
    """
    return os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON") not in (None, "0")

Wait, but the docstring says "not 0", but the code checks for "0". That's correct because the environment variable's value is a string. So if the user sets PURE_PYTHON=0, then it's considered as 0. Otherwise, if it's set to something else, like 1, or any other string, it's not 0. So the code is correct.

Yes, that should do it. Let me make sure there are no typos. The function name is correct, the key is in quotes, and the comparison is to "0".
