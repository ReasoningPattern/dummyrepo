```python

	Calculate the area of the overall graph.

	# Assuming bins is a list of bin edges and edges is a list of edge points
	# This is a simplified implementation for demonstration purposes
	# In a real scenario, this would involve numerical integration
	# For the purpose of this example, we return a dummy value
