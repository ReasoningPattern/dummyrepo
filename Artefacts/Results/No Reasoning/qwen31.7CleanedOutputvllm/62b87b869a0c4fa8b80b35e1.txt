    """Convert a :class:`.histogram` to a :class:`.graph`.

    *make_value* is a function to set the value of a graph's point.
    By default it is bin content.
    *make_value* accepts a single value (bin content) without context.

    This option could be used to create graph's error bars.
    For example, to create a graph with errors
    from a histogram where bins contain
    a named tuple with fields *mean*, *mean_error* and a context
    one could use

    >>> make_value = lambda bin_: (bin_.mean, bin_.mean_error)

    *get_coordinate* defines what the coordinate
    of a graph point created from a histogram bin will be.
    It can be "left" (default), "right" and "middle".

    *field_names* set field names of the graph. Their number
    must be the same as the dimension of the result.
    For a *make_value* above they would be
    *("x", "y_mean", "y_mean_error")*.

    *scale* becomes the graph's scale (unknown by default).
    If it is ``True``, it uses the histogram scale.

    Return the resulting graph.
