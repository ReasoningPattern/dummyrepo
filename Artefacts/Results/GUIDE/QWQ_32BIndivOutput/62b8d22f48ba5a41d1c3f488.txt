```python
def popitem(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_OrderTracker__order') or not self._OrderTracker__order:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    key = self._OrderTracker__order.pop(0)
    value = self._OrderTracker__mapping.pop(key)
    return (key, value)
```

Wait, but this code uses private attributes from a class called OrderTracker, which isn't mentioned in the problem. The user didn't specify the class structure. This might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be written in a way that assumes the class has an order list and a data dictionary. But how to reference them? Maybe the code should be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.order:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    key = self.order.pop(0)
    return key, self.data.pop(key)

But then the code relies on self.order and self.data existing in the class.

However, the problem only provides the method's signature and docstring, so the code must be written in the context of the class that the method belongs to. Since the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, perhaps the code should be written with the assumption that the class has these attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the code should be part of a class that uses a list to track insertion order and a dictionary for storage. So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.insertion_order:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    key = self.insertion_order.pop(0)
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    return (key, value)

But again, the variable names depend on the class's internal structure, which isn't specified. The problem might expect me to assume that the class uses a list and a dictionary, and the method is written accordingly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the class is a subclass of dict, and uses the inherent order of the dictionary (since Python 3.7+ dicts are insertion-ordered). In that case, the method would have to find the first key and remove it. But how?

The first key can be obtained via next(iter(self)), but then you have to delete it. So:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    key = next(iter(self))
    return key, super().pop(key)

Wait, but in the standard dict's popitem(), it removes and returns a (key, value) pair. The default popitem in dict removes and returns an arbitrary item (last in Python 3.7+), but in this problem's requirement, it's the first inserted.

So using next(iter(self)) would get the first key. Then, we can pop that key. But in that case, the method would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    first_key = next(iter(self))
    value = self.pop(first_key)
    return (first_key, value)

This approach uses the inherent order of the dictionary (since Python 3.7+ dicts are ordered), so this would work. However, this might not be efficient for large dictionaries because next(iter(self)) is O(1) in CPython's implementation? Wait, in Python, iterating a dict returns keys in insertion order, so next(iter(self)) would be the first key, and that's O(1) in CPython, since the __iter__ of a dict returns an iterator that goes in insertion order, and the first element is the first inserted key.

Wait, in CPython, the next() of the iterator would be O(1), because the iterator is pointing to the first element. So this code would work. However, this approach depends on the underlying dict's order.

Therefore, if the class is a subclass of dict, then this code would work. But the problem's docstring says "the first inserted key", so this method would satisfy that.

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    first_key = next(iter(self))
    return first_key, self.pop(first_key)

Wait, but when you call self.pop(first_key), that removes it from the dictionary. So the steps are:

1. Check if the dictionary is empty. If so, raise KeyError.

2. Get the first key (using next(iter(self))).

3. Pop that key from the dictionary, which also removes it.

4. Return the key and value as a tuple.

This approach doesn't require any additional data structures, just leveraging the fact that the underlying dict is ordered.

This might be the intended solution. Let me think again.

The problem's docstring says to remove the first inserted key. So if the class is a standard dict (since 3.7+), then this method would work as described. The standard dict's popitem() removes and returns an arbitrary item (last inserted in CPython), but this method would instead pop the first inserted.

Therefore, the code would be as above.

But in that case, the method is part of a class that's a subclass of dict, and the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    first_key = next(iter(self))
    return first_key, super().pop(first_key)

Wait, no. The super().popitem() would do the default, but here we need to pop the first key, so we can't use super().popitem(). Instead, we have to pop the first key explicitly.

Alternatively:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    first_key = next(iter(self))
    value = self[first_key]
    del self[first_key]
    return (first_key, value)

But this requires deleting the key, which is O(1) in a dict. So this code would work.

This approach doesn't require any additional data structures, just using the inherent order of the dict. So this might be the best approach.

So the final code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    first_key = next(iter(self))
    value = self.pop(first_key)
    return (first_key, value)

Wait, but using self.pop(first_key) would remove the key and return its value. So this is correct.

Testing this approach:

Test case 1: empty dict. Raises KeyError.

Test case 2: one item. Pop it, returns (key, value), and the dict is empty.

Test case 3: multiple items. The first inserted key is popped first.

Yes, this should work.

Therefore, the correct code is as above.

So the final answer is:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    first_key = next(iter(self))
    return first_key, self.pop(first_key)

Wait, but in the code above, self.pop(first_key) will return the value, so the tuple is (first_key, value). So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the code should be written like this.
