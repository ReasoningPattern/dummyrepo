```python
def identify_request(request: RequestType) -> bool:
    try:
        return 'events' in request.json
    except AttributeError:
        return False
```

Wait, actually, upon rethinking, the broad exception handling is better to cover all possible parsing errors. Let me adjust:

```python
def identify_request(request: RequestType) -> bool:
    try:
        return 'events' in request.json
    except Exception:
        return False
```

Hmm, but maybe the initial approach was better. Let me check the test cases again. For example, if the request's JSON is not a dictionary but a list, then 'events' in that list would check for the presence of the string "events" as an element, which might not be intended. However, the problem states that the request body is loaded using JSON, implying that the parsed data is a dictionary (since JSON objects are key-value pairs). Therefore, assuming that the JSON is a dictionary is acceptable. The try-except block is necessary to handle cases where the JSON is invalid or the attribute doesn't exist. So the final code should be:

```python
def identify_request(request: RequestType) -> bool:
    try:
        return 'events' in request.json
    except AttributeError:
        return False
```

Wait, but if accessing request.json raises a different exception (like JSONDecodeError), then this code would not catch it. Hence, better to use a broader exception. Let me correct:

```python
def identify_request(request: RequestType) -> bool:
    try:
        return 'events' in request.json
    except Exception:
        return False
```

This version handles any exception that occurs when accessing or evaluating the JSON data. This aligns with the test-driven approach where we account for all possible failures in parsing or accessing the JSON body.
