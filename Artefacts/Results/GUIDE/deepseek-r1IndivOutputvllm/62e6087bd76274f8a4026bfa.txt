To solve this problem, we need to create a method that removes the last two elements from a list stored within an object and returns those elements. This method should handle cases where there are fewer than two elements by raising an appropriate error.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to remove the last two elements from a list (`self.data`) and return them. If fewer than two elements exist, an error should be raised.
2. **Intuition**: Using list slicing, we can efficiently remove the last two elements and return them. We need to ensure that the operation only proceeds if there are at least two elements.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the list has fewer than two elements by raising an `IndexError`.
4. **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests to verify normal operation and edge cases.

### Solution Code

```python
def pop_u16(self):
    """
    Remove the last two elements in self.data and return them.
    Raises IndexError if there are fewer than two elements.
    """
    if len(self.data) < 2:
        raise IndexError("Too few elements in data")
    result = self.data[-2:]
    self.data = self.data[:-2]
    return result
```

### Explanation
- **Function Definition**: The method `pop_u16` takes `self` as a parameter, which is typical for a class method.
- **Check Length**: The method first checks if the length of `self.data` is less than 2. If so, it raises an `IndexError`.
- **Extract Elements**: The last two elements are extracted using slicing (`self.data[-2:]`).
- **Modify List**: The list is updated to exclude the last two elements using slicing (`self.data = self.data[:-2]`).
- **Return Elements**: The extracted elements are returned.

This approach ensures that the method operates efficiently and handles edge cases appropriately, providing clear and maintainable code.
