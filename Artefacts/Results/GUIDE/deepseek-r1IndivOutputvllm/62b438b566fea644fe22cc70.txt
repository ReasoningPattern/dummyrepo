To solve this problem, we need to generate a Python function that introspects the command-line argument parsers of the `bash_completion` function and produces the Borgmatic command based on this introspection. The solution involves using the `inspect` module to analyze the function's arguments and construct a command string accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Import the inspect module**: This module provides functions to introspect Python code, allowing us to examine the arguments of a function.
2. **Use inspect.getfullargspec**: This function returns a named tuple containing details about the arguments of a given function, such as their names, types, and default values.
3. **Extract argument details**: From the returned details, we can extract the arguments and their default values to construct the command string.
4. **Construct the command string**: Using the extracted argument information, we build the command string that represents the Borgmatic command.

### Solution Code

```python
import inspect

def bash_completion():
    """
    Produce the borgmatic command by introspecting borgmatic's command-line argument parsers.
    """
    argspec = inspect.getfullargspec(bash_completion)
    
    command = "borgmatic "
    for i, name in enumerate(argspec.args):
        if i == 0:
            command += f"-{name}"
        else:
            command += f" -{name}"
    
    return command
```

### Explanation
1. **Import the inspect module**: This is necessary to use the `inspect.getfullargspec` function, which helps in analyzing the function's arguments.
2. **Call inspect.getfullargspec(bash_completion)**: This function call returns details about the arguments of the `bash_completion` function. The `args` attribute of the returned object contains the names of the function's parameters.
3. **Construct the command string**: We start with a base command string "borgmatic " and then iterate over the argument names. For each argument, we append it to the command string with appropriate spacing and flags (e.g., `-name`).

This approach ensures that we dynamically generate the Borgmatic command based on the introspected arguments of the `bash_completion` function, making it flexible and adaptable to different inputs.
