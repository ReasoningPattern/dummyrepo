To solve this problem, we need to create a function that verifies whether a candidate class can provide the methods defined in a given interface. This is particularly useful when working with Python's Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) or other interfaces.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `verifyClass` should check if the `candidate` class can provide all the methods defined in the `iface`. This involves checking both regular methods and abstract methods (if `iface` is an ABC).

2. **Handling ABCs**: If `iface` is an ABC, the candidate class must either implement the method directly or have it marked as abstract. We will use the `issubclass_` function to determine if `iface` is a subclass of an ABC.

3. **Method Checking**: For each method in `iface`, we will check if it exists in the `candidate`. If `iface` is an ABC, we will also ensure that the method is either present or marked as abstract in the `candidate`.

4. **Imports**: We will import necessary modules such as `ABC`, `ABCMeta`, and `issubclass_` from the `abc` module, and `six` to handle ABC checks correctly.

### Solution Code
```python
from abc import ABC, ABCMeta
from six import issubclass_
import sys

def verifyClass(iface, candidate, tentative=False):
    """
    Verify that the *candidate* might correctly provide *iface*.

    :param iface: The interface to verify against
    :param candidate: The class to test
    :param tentative: (Optional) If True, allows some flexibility in verification
    :return: True if candidate might provide the interface, False otherwise
    """
    if not isinstance(iface, ABC):
        # If it's not an ABC, check all methods are present
        if not issubclass_(type(iface), ABC):
            raise TypeError("iface must be a subclass of ABC")
        for attr in getattr(iface, "__dict__", {}):
            if attr not in candidate.__dict__:
                return False
        return True
    else:
        # If it's an ABC, check all methods are present or abstract in candidate
        for attr in getattr(iface, "__dict__", {}):
            if attr not in candidate.__dict__:
                if tentative:
                    return True
                else:
                    return False
            if isinstance(candidate, ABCMeta) and attr.startswith('__'):
                continue
        return True
```

### Explanation
1. **Imports**: The function starts by importing necessary modules to handle ABCs and perform class checks.

2. **Interface Check**: The function first checks if `iface` is an instance of an ABC. If not, it ensures that `iface` is a subclass of an ABC and then checks that all methods in `iface` are present in `candidate`.

3. **ABC Handling**: If `iface` is an ABC, the function iterates over each method. It ensures that either the method exists in `candidate` or, if `tentative` is True, it allows flexibility. If `tentative` is False, it checks that all methods are present, including abstract methods.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns True if all checks pass, indicating that `candidate` can provide `iface`, and False otherwise.

This approach ensures that the function comprehensively verifies whether a candidate class meets the requirements of a given interface, considering both regular and abstract methods.
