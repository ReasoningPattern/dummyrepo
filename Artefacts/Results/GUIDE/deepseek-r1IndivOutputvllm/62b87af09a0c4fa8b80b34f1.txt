To solve this problem, we need to create a method that fills a histogram with given coordinates and weights. The method should handle edge cases where the coordinates are outside the histogram's valid range.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to fill a histogram at a specified coordinate with a given weight. Coordinates outside the histogram's edges should be ignored. The histogram is represented as an object with edges defining the bin boundaries and a data array storing the weights for each bin.

2. **Intuition**: The solution involves checking if the given coordinate falls within the valid range of the histogram's edges. If it does, we determine the appropriate bin using binary search for efficient lookup. We then update the weight for that bin.

3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point of the coordinate in the edges list. This helps in identifying the correct bin index. We also ensure that the coordinate is within the valid range before proceeding.

4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity for finding the insertion point using `bisect_right` is O(log n), where n is the number of edges. Updating the data array is O(1), making the overall approach efficient.

### Solution Code

```python
import bisect

class Histogram:
    def __init__(self, edges):
        self.edges = edges
        self.data = None
    
    def fill(self, coord, weight=1):
        edges = self.edges
        if not edges or len(edges) < 2:
            return  # Not enough edges to form a bin
        if coord < edges[0] or coord >= edges[-1]:
            return  # Coordinate is outside the valid range
        bin_index = bisect.bisect_right(edges, coord) - 1
        if bin_index < 0 or bin_index >= len(edges) - 1:
            return  # Bin index is out of bounds
        if self.data is None or len(self.data) <= bin_index:
            # Initialize data with zeros if not already initialized
            self.data = [0.0] * (bin_index + 1)
        self.data[bin_index] += weight
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The `Histogram` class is initialized with edges defining the bin boundaries. The `data` attribute is initialized to `None` to handle cases where no data has been added yet.

2. **Coordinate Check**: The `fill` method first checks if the given coordinate is within the valid range defined by the edges. If not, it returns immediately.

3. **Binary Search**: Using `bisect_right`, we find the position where the coordinate would fit in the edges list. Subtracting 1 gives the correct bin index.

4. **Data Update**: The method ensures that the data array is initialized if it hasn't been. It then updates the weight for the determined bin.

This approach efficiently handles the filling of the histogram while ensuring that invalid coordinates are ignored and edge cases are managed properly.
