To solve this problem, we need to create a method `popitem` for a class that allows us to remove and return the value corresponding to the first inserted key from an ordered dictionary. This method should maintain the order of elements as they were inserted.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: The `popitem` method should remove the first inserted key and return both the key and its value as a tuple. The underlying data structure should maintain the insertion order to ensure that the first key can be efficiently accessed.
2. **Choose the Appropriate Data Structure**: Using `OrderedDict` from Python's `collections` module is suitable because it maintains the insertion order of keys. This allows us to reliably access the first inserted key.
3. **Override the popitem Method**: Since the default `popitem` method in `OrderedDict` removes the last inserted key by default, we need to override this method to remove the first inserted key. This is achieved by calling `popitem` with `last=False`, which ensures that the first key is removed and returned.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import OrderedDict

class MyOrderedDict(OrderDict):
    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
        """
        if not self:
            raise KeyError("popitem(): empty dict")
        key, value = self.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)
```

### Explanation
- **Class Definition**: The class `MyOrderedDict` inherits from `OrderedDict`, ensuring that the insertion order of keys is maintained.
- **Method Implementation**: The `popitem` method is overridden to remove and return the first inserted key-value pair. If the dictionary is empty, it raises a `KeyError`. Otherwise, it pops the first key using `popitem(last=False)` and returns the key and value as a tuple.
- **Efficiency**: Using `popitem` with `last=False` is efficient as it leverages the optimized C implementation for popping items from `OrderedDict`.

This approach ensures that the method behaves as required, efficiently managing the order of operations and providing the correct functionality for removing and returning the first inserted key-value pair.
