This code provides:
1. A class `OCFLStorageRoot` with an `initialize()` method that creates and initializes an OCFL storage root
2. Test cases in `test OCFLStorageRoot initialize()` to verify the functionality
3. Proper cleanup of resources using context managers
4. Assertions to verify the functionality
5. Temporary directory handling to ensure clean tests

The code follows a test-driven development approach by first writing comprehensive tests before implementing the actual initialization logic.
