To solve this problem, we need to create a method that converts a given datetime from one timezone to another. This is a common requirement when working with global data that needs to be displayed in different time zones.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: We need to convert a datetime object from its current timezone to a new specified timezone. This conversion must handle both aware and naive timezones.

2. **Use Modern Python Timezone Handling**: We will use Python's `datetime` module, specifically the `ZoneInfo` class, which provides robust support for timezone-aware and naive datetime objects.

3. **Test-Driven Development**: Before writing the actual code, we'll outline comprehensive unit tests to ensure the method behaves correctly under various scenarios, including:
   - Converting within the same timezone
   - Crossing midnight between timezones
   - Handling daylight saving transitions
   - Converting between naive and aware timezones

4. **Implement the Conversion Logic**: The core logic involves creating a `ZoneInfo` instance from the given datetime and then converting it to the target timezone using the `tz_convert` method.

### Solution Code

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo

def _fromutc(self, dt):
    """
    Given a timezone datetime in a given timezone, calculates a timezone datetime in a new timezone.
    """
    # Create a ZoneInfo instance from the input datetime's timezone
    original_zone = dt.tzinfo
    if original_zone is None:
        # If naive, create a naive ZoneInfo
        original_zone = timezone.utc
    converted_zone = ZoneInfo(tzstr=tzstr(original_zone))
    
    # Convert the datetime to the new timezone
    return converted_zone.localize(dt).astimezone(converted_zone)
```

### Explanation
1. **Extracting the Original Zone**: The method first extracts the timezone information from the input datetime object. If the datetime is naive (no timezone), it defaults to UTC.

2. **Creating ZoneInfo Instances**: The extracted timezone is converted into a `ZoneInfo` instance. This handles both aware and naive timezones seamlessly.

3. **Converting Timezones**: Using the `astimezone` method, the datetime is converted from the original timezone to the new target timezone.

4. **Handling Naive Datetimes**: Special handling ensures that naive datetimes (those without timezone information) are treated as UTC when converting.

This approach ensures that the conversion is accurate and handles all edge cases, providing a reliable solution for timezone conversions in Python.
