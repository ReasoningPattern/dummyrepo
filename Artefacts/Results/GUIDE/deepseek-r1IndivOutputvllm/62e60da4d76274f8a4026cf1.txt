To solve this problem, we need to create a function that filters a list of keys based on a specified index. The function should return a list of keys that match the given indices. If no indices are provided, the function should return all keys.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The function should take a variable number of keys and an optional list of indices. It should return the keys whose positions (indices) are in the provided list of indices. If no indices are provided, it should return all keys.
2. **Handling Different Cases**: 
   - If no indices are provided, return all keys.
   - If indices are provided, filter the keys based on their positions.
3. **Efficiency**: Convert the list of indices to a set for faster membership testing.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where indices are out of bounds or the indices list is empty.

### Solution Code
```python
def values(self, *keys):
    """
    Returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list.
    """
    if self.index is None:
        return list(keys)
    index_set = set(self.index)
    return [k for idx, k in enumerate(keys) if idx in index_set]
```

### Explanation
- **Function Definition**: The function `values` takes `self` and a variable number of `keys`.
- **Handling No Indices**: If `self.index` is `None`, the function returns all keys as a list.
- **Filtering Keys**: If `self.index` is provided, it is converted to a set for efficient lookups. The function then iterates over each key, checking if its index is in the set of provided indices. If it is, the key is included in the result.
- **Efficiency**: Using a set for indices ensures that membership testing is done in constant time, making the function efficient even for large lists of keys.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all possible cases, including when no indices are provided, when indices are out of bounds, and when multiple indices are specified.
