To solve this problem, we need to parse an image reference URL into its constituent parts: the image ID, the network location (netloc), and whether SSL is used (use_ssl). The function should handle various URL formats and raise a ValueError for invalid inputs.

### Approach
1. **Parse the URL**: Use Python's `urllib.parse` module to break down the URL into its components. Specifically, we'll use `urlparse` to extract the scheme, netloc, and query parameters.
2. **Extract Components**:
   - The `netloc` is directly obtained from the parsed URL.
   - The `scheme` (http or https) determines if SSL is used. If the scheme is http, use_ssl is False; if https, use_ssl is True.
   - The image ID is extracted from the query parameters. If no query parameters exist or the image ID is missing, raise a ValueError.
3. **Handle Exceptions**: Use a try-except block to handle any parsing errors and ensure the function raises a ValueError for invalid inputs.

### Solution Code
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    """
    Parse an image reference URL into composite parts.

    :param image_href: href of an image
    :returns: a tuple of the form (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)
    :raises ValueError:
    """
    try:
        parsed_url = urlparse(image_href)
        netloc = parsed_url.netloc
        scheme = parsed_url.scheme
        
        use_ssl = False if scheme == 'http' else True
        
        query_params = parse_qs(parsed_url.query)
        image_id = next((v[0] for k, v in query_params.items() if k == 'image_id'), None)
        
        if image_id is None:
            raise ValueError("Image ID not found in the query parameters.")
        
        return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid image reference URL: {e}")
```

### Explanation
- **Parsing the URL**: The `urlparse` function is used to decompose the URL into its components. This helps in extracting the scheme, netloc, and query parameters efficiently.
- **Determining SSL Usage**: The scheme of the URL (http or https) is checked to determine if SSL is used. This is straightforward and ensures that we correctly identify secure connections.
- **Extracting Image ID**: The image ID is looked for in the query parameters. If it's not present, a ValueError is raised. This ensures that the function handles invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Error Handling**: A try-except block is used to catch any parsing errors, ensuring that the function raises a ValueError for invalid URLs.

This approach ensures that the function is robust, handles various URL formats, and provides clear feedback for invalid inputs.
