To solve this problem, we need to create a function that checks if a given filename is a 'doxyfile'. The function should return `True` if the filename is a string and its lowercase version is exactly 'doxyfile'. 

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to determine if the given filename is a 'doxyfile'. A doxyfile is a specific type of file used in DOXtools, and in this context, we need to check if the filename is a string and its lowercase version matches 'doxyfile'.
2. **Type Checking**: We need to ensure that the filename is a string. In Python, strings are of type `str`, while other data types like integers, bytes, etc., are not.
3. **Case Insensitivity**: The comparison should be case-insensitive, meaning the filename should be converted to lowercase before checking against 'doxyfile'.
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: We will write unit tests to cover various scenarios, including valid doxyfiles, invalid filenames, different data types, and edge cases like empty strings or strings with additional characters.

### Solution Code
```python
def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the given filename is a 'doxyfile'.

    Args:
        filename: The filename to check.
    Returns:
        True if the filename is a string and its lowercase is 'doxyfile', False otherwise.
    """
    return isinstance(filename, str) and filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'
```

### Explanation
- **Function Definition**: The function `match` takes a single argument `filename`.
- **Type Check**: `isinstance(filename, str)` ensures that the input is a string.
- **Case Insensitive Check**: `filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'` converts the filename to lowercase and checks if it matches 'doxyfile'.
- **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if both conditions are met, otherwise it returns `False`.

This approach ensures that only valid doxyfiles are identified, and it handles various edge cases and different data types appropriately.
