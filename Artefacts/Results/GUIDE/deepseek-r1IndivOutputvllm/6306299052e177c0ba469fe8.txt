To solve this problem, we need to create a function that checks whether two given handles are the same. The function will take two string arguments and return a boolean indicating whether they are identical.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem is straightforward:
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to compare two strings and determine if they are identical.
2. **Intuition**: In Python, string comparison can be done directly using the equality operator `==`, which checks if two strings are identical character by character.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: We will use the equality operator to compare the two input strings.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the length of the strings, since each character is compared until a mismatch is found or the end of the shorter string is reached.

### Solution Code
```python
def check_sender_and_entity_handle_match(sender_handle, entity_handle):
    """
    Check whether sender_handle is the same as entity_handle. If yes, return True. Otherwise, return False.
    """
    return sender_handle == entity_handle
```

### Explanation
The function `check_sender_and_entity_handle_match` takes two parameters, `sender_handle` and `entity_handle`, both of which are expected to be strings. The function returns `True` if the two handles are identical and `False` otherwise. This is achieved by simply comparing the two strings using the equality operator `==`. 

This solution is efficient and handles all cases where the handles are the same, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for any valid input strings.
