To solve this problem, we need to create a function `scale` that can both get and set the scale of a graph based on the provided parameters. The function should handle various edge cases, such as when the scale is zero or when the provided value is not a number.

### Approach
The function `scale` is designed to work with graph objects that have coordinates. The approach involves the following steps:

1. **Check if `other` is `None`:** If `other` is `None`, the function returns the current scale of the graph. The scale is determined by the last coordinate of the last field (e.g., `z` in a 3D graph).

2. **Check if `other` is a numeric value:** If `other` is not `None`, the function checks if it is a numeric value (either integer or float). If not, it raises a `TypeError`.

3. **Handle zero scale:** If the current scale (last coordinate) is zero, the function raises a `LenaValueError` as scaling to zero is not allowed.

4. **Rescale the last coordinate:** If the scale is valid, the function calculates the scaling factor and updates the last coordinate to the new value. This effectively rescales the graph.

### Solution Code

```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.coords = None  # Assume coords is a list of arrays or None

    def scale(self, other=None):
        """
        Get or set the scale of the graph.

        If *other* is ``None``, return the current scale.
        If *other* is a numeric, rescale to that value.
        If the graph's scale is unknown or zero, raises LenaValueError.
        """
        if other is None:
            if self.coords is None or len(self.coords) == 0 or len(self.coords[-1]) == 0:
                raise AttributeError("Cannot get scale from a graph without coordinates.")
            return self.coords[-1][-1]
        else:
            if not isinstance(other, (int, float)):
                raise TypeError("Other must be a number.")
            if self.coords is None or len(self.coords) == 0 or len(self.coords[-1]) == 0:
                raise AttributeError("Cannot scale a graph without coordinates.")
            current_scale = self.coords[-1][-1]
            if current_scale == 0:
                raise LenaValueError("Scale cannot be zero.")
            scaling_factor = other / current_scale
            self.coords[-1][-1] = other
            return self
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization:** The `Graph` class is initialized without any coordinates, and the `scale` method is defined to handle scaling operations.
- **Getting the Scale:** When `other` is `None`, the method returns the last element of the last coordinate array, which represents the current scale.
- **Setting the Scale:** When `other` is a numeric value, the method checks if the current scale is valid (non-zero). If valid, it calculates the scaling factor and updates the last coordinate to the new value, effectively rescaling the graph.
- **Error Handling:** The method raises appropriate errors for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values for `other` and zero or unknown scales.

This approach ensures that the function handles all specified cases correctly and efficiently, providing a robust solution for graph scaling.
