To solve this problem, we need to write a function that sets the time zone information (tzinfo) on naive datetime objects only. Naive datetime objects are those that do not have an explicit time zone associated with them. This function is particularly useful when dealing with datetime objects that might have an implicit or explicit time zone, such as when parsing time zone strings.

### Approach
1. **Identify Naive Datetimes**: Check if the provided datetime object (`dt`) is naive. A naive datetime is one that does not have a `tzinfo` attribute.
2. **Set Time Zone Information**: If the datetime is naive and a `tzinfo` is provided, create a new datetime instance with the specified time zone information.
3. **Return the Result**: If the datetime is naive and `tzinfo` is provided, return the new datetime. If the datetime is already aware (has a `tzinfo`), return it unchanged.

The function uses the `isnaive()` method to check if the datetime is naive. If it is, and a `tzinfo` is provided, it creates a new datetime instance using `replace()` to set the time zone information. This ensures that only naive datetimes are affected by the provided `tzinfo`.

### Solution Code
```python
from datetime import datetime

def default_tzinfo(dt, tzinfo):
    """
    Sets the ``tzinfo`` parameter on naive datetimes only.

    This function is useful for converting naive datetime objects to aware
    datetime objects by setting the provided timezone information.

    :param dt: The datetime object on which to set the tzinfo
    :param tzinfo: The datetime.tzinfo subclass instance to assign to dt if it is naive
    :return: An aware datetime object with the specified tzinfo
    """
    if dt.isnaive() and tzinfo is not None:
        return dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
    else:
        return dt
```

### Explanation
- **Function Parameters**: The function takes two parameters, `dt` (a datetime object) and `tzinfo` (a timezone information object).
- **Check for Naive Datetime**: The function first checks if `dt` is naive using `dt.isnaive()`.
- **Set Time Zone if Necessary**: If `dt` is naive and `tzinfo` is provided, the function creates a new datetime instance with the specified timezone using `dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)`.
- **Return the Result**: The function returns the modified datetime if it was naive and `tzinfo` was provided, otherwise it returns the original datetime.

This approach ensures that only naive datetimes are affected, and aware datetimes remain unchanged, providing a robust solution for handling timezone conversions in datetime objects.
