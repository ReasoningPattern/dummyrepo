To solve this problem, we need to create a custom dictionary class that allows us to remove and return the least frequently used item. The least frequently used item is determined by tracking the number of times each key is accessed or modified.

### Approach
The approach involves creating a custom dictionary class with an additional method `popitem()` that removes and returns the least frequently used item. Here are the key steps:

1. **Data Structures**: Use a dictionary to store the key-value pairs and another dictionary to track the access count for each key.
2. **Override Methods**: Override the `__setitem__`, `__getitem__`, and `__delitem__` methods to update the access count each time a key is set, retrieved, or deleted.
3. **Popitem Method**: Implement the `popitem()` method to find the key with the smallest access count, remove it from the dictionary, and return the corresponding value along with the key.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class PopItemDict(dict):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.counts = defaultdict(int)
    
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if key not in self:
            self[key] = value
            self.counts[key] += 1
        else:
            self.counts[key] += 1
    
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if key in self:
            self.counts[key] += 1
            return self[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError
    
    def __delitem__(self, key):
        if key in self:
            self.counts[key] -= 1
            del self[key]
            del self.counts[key]
    
    def popitem(self):
        if not self:
            raise KeyError("popitem(): empty")
        min_count = None
        min_key = None
        for key in self:
            count = self.counts[key]
            if (min_count is None) or (count < min_count):
                min_count = count
                min_key = key
        del self[min_key]
        del self.counts[min_key]
        return (self[min_key], min_key)
```

### Explanation
- **Data Structures**: The class uses a dictionary `self` to store the key-value pairs and a `defaultdict` `self.counts` to keep track of how many times each key has been accessed or modified.
- **Override Methods**:
  - `__setitem__`: Increments the access count when a new key is set or an existing key is modified.
  - `__getitem__`: Increments the access count when a key is accessed and returns the corresponding value.
  - `__delitem__`: Decrements the access count when a key is deleted and removes the key from both the dictionary and the counts.
- **Popitem Method**: Iterates through the keys to find the one with the smallest access count, removes it from the dictionary, and returns the key-value pair.

This approach ensures that the least frequently used item is efficiently identified and removed, providing the required functionality in a clear and maintainable manner.
