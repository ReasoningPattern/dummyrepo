To solve this problem, we need to create a method that retrieves the target class name without any 'Py' or 'Fallback' suffixes. This is particularly useful in contexts where different implementations (like database drivers) are used, and we need to reference the base class name.

### Approach
The approach involves the following steps:
1. **Retrieve the Class Name**: Use the `__class__.__name__` attribute to get the fully qualified class name as a string.
2. **Check for Suffixes**: Iterate over the possible suffixes ('Fallback' and 'Py') and check if the class name ends with any of these suffixes.
3. **Return the Base Class Name**: If a suffix is found, return the class name without the suffix. If neither suffix is found, return the full class name.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle each suffix individually, making the solution both robust and easy to understand. It avoids potential issues with multiple splits and handles edge cases where the class name might end with multiple suffixes.

### Solution Code
```python
def _getTargetClass(self):
    """
    Define this to return the implementation in use,
    without the 'Py' or 'Fallback' suffix.
    """
    name = self.__class__.__name__
    for suffix in ['Fallback', 'Py']:
        if name.endswith(suffix):
            return name[:-len(suffix)]
    return name
```

### Explanation
- **Retrieve the Class Name**: The method starts by obtaining the class name using `self.__class__.__name__`.
- **Check for Suffixes**: It then iterates over the suffixes 'Fallback' and 'Py'. For each suffix, it checks if the class name ends with that suffix using `endswith()`.
- **Return the Base Class Name**: If a suffix is found, it returns the class name without that suffix by slicing the string up to the length of the suffix. If no suffix is found, it returns the full class name.

This solution efficiently handles the task with clear and readable code, ensuring that the correct base class name is returned regardless of the presence of common implementation suffixes.
