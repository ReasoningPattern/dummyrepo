To solve this problem, we need to write a function that inserts a value into a nested key within a dictionary. The function should traverse the dictionary using a chain of keys and set the value at the deepest nested key.

### Approach
The function `dict_insert` takes four parameters: a dictionary, a value to insert, a key for the first level of the nested key chain, and an arbitrary number of additional keys for deeper levels. The approach involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start at the given dictionary.
2. **Traversal**: Traverse the dictionary using the provided keys. The first key is used to access the initial level, and subsequent keys are used to traverse deeper levels.
3. **Insertion**: Once all keys in the chain are processed, set the value at the deepest nested key.
4. **Error Handling**: If any key in the chain is missing, the function returns `None` to indicate the failure to insert the value.

### Solution Code

```python
def dict_insert(dic, val, key, *keys):
    current = dic
    current = current.get(key, None)
    if current is None:
        return None
    for k in keys:
        current = current.get(k, None)
        if current is None:
            return None
    current[k] = val
    return current
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing `current` to the input dictionary `dic`.
2. **First Key Check**: It then checks if the key exists in the initial dictionary. If not, it returns `None`.
3. **Subsequent Keys Check**: For each additional key, it checks if the key exists in the current level of the dictionary. If any key is missing, it returns `None`.
4. **Insert Value**: If all keys are present, the function inserts the value at the deepest nested key and returns the modified dictionary.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles nested keys and returns `None` if any key in the chain is missing, providing a robust solution to the problem.
