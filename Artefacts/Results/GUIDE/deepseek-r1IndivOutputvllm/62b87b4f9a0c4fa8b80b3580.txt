To solve this problem, we need to calculate the integral of a histogram defined by bin edges and corresponding bin values. The integral represents the total area under the histogram, which can be interpreted as the sum of the areas of each bin.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Parameters**: The function takes two parameters, `bins` and `edges`. `edges` is a list of bin edges, and `bins` is a list of values corresponding to each bin. The number of bins is always one less than the number of edges.
2. **Calculate Bin Widths**: For each pair of consecutive edges, compute the width of the bin. This is done by subtracting the current edge from the next edge in the list.
3. **Compute Area for Each Bin**: Multiply the width of each bin by its corresponding bin value to get the area of that bin.
4. **Sum the Areas**: Sum the areas of all bins to get the total integral, which represents the total area under the histogram.

### Solution Code
```python
def integral(bins, edges):
    """
    Calculate the area of the overall graph defined by bin edges and values.
    
    Parameters:
    bins (list): List of values corresponding to each bin.
    edges (list): List of bin edges, one more than the number of bins.
    
    Returns:
    float: The total area under the histogram.
    """
    total_area = 0.0
    for i in range(len(edges) - 1):
        width = edges[i+1] - edges[i]
        total_area += width * bins[i]
    return total_area
```

### Explanation
- **Parameter Handling**: The function assumes that `edges` is a list with one more element than `bins`, where each bin corresponds to the interval defined by consecutive edges.
- **Loop Through Edges**: The loop iterates through each pair of consecutive edges to compute the width of each bin.
- **Area Calculation**: For each bin, the width is multiplied by the bin value to compute the bin's area, which is then added to the total area.
- **Return Total Area**: The function returns the sum of all bin areas, which is the total integral of the histogram.

This approach efficiently computes the integral by breaking down the problem into smaller parts, each corresponding to a bin's contribution to the total area.
