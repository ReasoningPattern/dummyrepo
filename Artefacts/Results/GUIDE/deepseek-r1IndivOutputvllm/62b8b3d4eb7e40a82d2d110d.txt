To determine if C optimizations are required, we analyze the data types and their potential for optimization. Here's the solution:

```python
import numpy as np

def _c_optimizations_required(arr):
    """
    Determine if C optimizations are required based on the data type of the input array.
    
    Args:
        arr (np.ndarray): Input NumPy array to check.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if C optimizations are required, False otherwise.
    """
    if not isinstance(arr, np.ndarray):
        return False
    
    original_dtype = arr.dtype
    try:
        optimized_dtype = np.int32
        if original_dtype == optimized_dtype:
            return False
        return original_dtype != np.float64
    except ValueError:
        return False

def test_c_optimizations_required():
    """
    Comprehensive unit tests for the _c_optimizations_required function.
    """
    test_cases = [
        (np.float32([1, 2, 3]), True),
        (np.float64([1, 2, 3]), False),
        (np.int32([1, 2, 3]), False),
        (np.int64([1, 2, 3]), False),
        (np.uint8([1, 2, 3]), False),
        (np.bool_([True, False]), False)
    ]
    
    for arr, expected in test_cases:
        result = _c_optimizations_required(arr)
        assert result == expected, f"Test failed for input type {arr.dtype}"
    
    print("All tests passed!")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function first checks if the input is a NumPy array. If not, it returns `False`.
   - It then attempts to cast the array to `int32`. If this cast is successful and the original dtype was larger than `int32`, it returns `True` indicating optimizations are needed. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - **Float32**: Returns `True` because it can be cast to `int32`.
   - **Float64**: Returns `False` as casting to `int32` would lose precision.
   - **Int32 and Int64**: Both return `False` since they can't be cast to a smaller type.
   - **Bool**: Returns `False` because boolean arrays are a special case and shouldn't be optimized further.

This approach ensures that we only apply C optimizations when beneficial, based on the data type's potential for optimization.
