To address the problem, we need to create a Python function that validates an inventory based on a specified version. The function should handle cases where the version might be extracted from the inventory or provided by the class itself. 

### Approach
The function `validate` takes two parameters: `inventory` and `extract_spec_version` (defaulting to `False`). The approach involves the following steps:
1. **Determine the Version**: If `extract_spec_version` is `True`, the function attempts to extract the version from the inventory. If the inventory does not have a version attribute, it falls back to using `self.spec_version`. If `extract_spec_version` is `False`, it directly uses `self.spec_version`.
2. **Validation Check**: The function then checks if the extracted version (or default version) matches the expected version (`self.spec_version`). If they match, the inventory is considered valid; otherwise, it is not.

This approach ensures flexibility by allowing the extraction of the version from the inventory when needed, while also providing a default validation mechanism when extraction is not required.

### Solution Code
```python
import unittest

def validate(self, inventory, extract_spec_version=False):
    """
    Validate a given inventory. If extract_spec_version is True then will look at the type value to determine the specification version. In the case that there is no type value or it isn't valid, then other tests will be based on the version given in self.spec_version. (D)
    """
    if extract_spec_version:
        extracted_version = inventory.version if hasattr(inventory, 'version') else self.spec_version
    else:
        extracted_version = self.spec_version
    return extracted_version == self.spec_version
```

### Explanation
- **Version Extraction**: The function first checks if `extract_spec_version` is `True`. If so, it looks for a `version` attribute in the inventory. If the inventory does not have this attribute, it defaults to `self.spec_version`.
- **Validation Check**: The extracted version is then compared to `self.spec_version`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating the inventory is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution efficiently handles both scenarios where the version is extracted from the inventory and where it is provided by the class itself, ensuring robust validation logic.
