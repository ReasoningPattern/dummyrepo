This implementation:
1. Creates a class `LanguageRenderings` with an empty dictionary `_renditions`
2. Implements `add_rendition` method that takes a language code and file path, storing the path in `_renditions`
3. Includes a test class with integration tests verifying the method works as expected

The code follows a test-driven development approach by first writing comprehensive tests before implementing the actual functionality.
