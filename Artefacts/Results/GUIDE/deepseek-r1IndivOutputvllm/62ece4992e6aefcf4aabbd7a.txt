To determine if the current program is running in a Windows gitbash terminal, we can check if the output of the `git` command includes the message "Forked from". This indicates that the `git` command was executed in a separate process, which is characteristic of a gitbash terminal.

```python
import subprocess

def is_gitbash():
    """
    Check whether the current program is run in a Windows gitbash terminal

    Returns:
            boolean, True if gitbash else False
    """
    result = subprocess.run(['git'], shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return 'Forked from' in result.stdout
```
