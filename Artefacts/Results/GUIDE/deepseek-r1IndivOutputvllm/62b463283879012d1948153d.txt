To solve this problem, we need to write a function that takes a node and a list of XPath expressions, and returns the first matching element found in the node based on the given XPath expressions. This function will utilize the Beautiful Soup library to evaluate the XPath expressions against the provided node.

### Approach
1. **Iterate through each XPath**: The function will loop through each XPath expression provided in the list.
2. **Evaluate XPath against node**: For each XPath, the function will use the `find()` method of the node to evaluate the XPath. The `find()` method returns the first matching element if the XPath is valid, otherwise it returns `None`.
3. **Return the first match**: As soon as a matching element is found for any of the XPath expressions, the function returns that element. If no matching element is found after evaluating all the XPath expressions, the function returns `None`.

### Solution Code
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def match_pubdate(node, pubdate_xpaths):
    """
    For the given node, returns the first match in the pubdate_xpaths list.
    """
    for xpath in pubdate_xpaths:
        pubdate = node.find(xpath)
        if pubdate is not None:
            return pubdate
    return None
```

### Explanation
- **Iteration through XPaths**: The function iterates over each XPath expression in the provided list. This ensures that the first matching element is found based on the order of the XPath expressions.
- **Using `find()` Method**: The `find()` method is used because it efficiently returns the first matching element without raising an exception if no match is found. This method is particularly useful for evaluating multiple XPaths as it stops at the first valid match.
- **Handling No Matches**: If none of the XPath expressions find a matching element, the function returns `None`, indicating no matches were found.

This approach ensures that the function efficiently finds the first matching element based on the given XPath expressions, adhering to the problem requirements and leveraging the capabilities of the Beautiful Soup library.
