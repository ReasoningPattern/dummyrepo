To solve this problem, we need to create a function that returns a string representation of a log status with an optional prefix. The function should handle different cases, including an empty prefix and various types of log statuses.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to generate a string that combines an optional prefix with the result of `self.log.status_str`. The prefix is added before the log status string.
2. **Intuitions and Insights**: 
   - The function should handle cases where the prefix is empty.
   - The log status string should be converted to a string if it isn't already one.
   - The function should be able to handle various characters in the prefix, including special characters.
3. **Algorithm Selection**: We will use simple string concatenation to prepend the prefix to the log status string.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity is O(1) since string operations in Python are efficient and the length of the strings is fixed.

### Solution Code
```python
def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return string representation with self.log.status_str, with optional prefix.
    """
    return prefix + str(self.log.status_str)
```

### Explanation
- **Function Definition**: The function `status_str` takes an optional parameter `prefix` which defaults to an empty string.
- **String Conversion**: The log status string from `self.log.status_str` is converted to a string to handle any potential non-string return values.
- **Concatenation**: The prefix is concatenated with the converted log status string and returned.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for various inputs, including different prefixes and log statuses, while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.
