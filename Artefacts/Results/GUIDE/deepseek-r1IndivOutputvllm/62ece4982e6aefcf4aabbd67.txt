To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that takes a list of vertices representing a polygon and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain three points: the current vertex and the two adjacent vertices. The polygon is considered circular, meaning the first and last vertices are adjacent.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to generate a list of tuples where each tuple contains a vertex and its two adjacent vertices. The polygon is circular, so after the last vertex, we loop back to the first vertex.
2. **Intuition**: For each vertex at index `i`, the previous vertex is at index `i-1` and the next vertex is at index `i+1`. Since the list is circular, we use modulo operation to handle the wrap-around when `i` is 0 or the last index.
3. **Algorithm**:
   - Loop through each index `i` in the list of vertices.
   - For each index, compute the previous index as `(i-1) % len(vertices)` and the next index as `(i+1) % len(vertices)`.
   - Create a tuple with the current vertex, previous vertex, and next vertex.
   - Collect all tuples into a result list and return it.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the vertices list is empty or has only one vertex by ensuring the modulo operation correctly wraps around.

### Solution Code

```python
def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    """
    Get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon.
    This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex
    If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0
    Args:
        vertices: vertices to be converted

    Returns:
        A list where the elements of vertices represented by tuple
    """
    result = []
    n = len(vertices)
    for i in range(n):
        prev_i = (i - 1) % n
        next_i = (i + 1) % n
        current = vertices[i]
        prev = vertices[prev_i]
        next_v = vertices[next_i]
        result.append((current, prev, next_v))
    return result

# Example unit tests
import unittest

class TestVertex3Tuple(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(vertex3tuple([]), [])

    def test_single_vertex(self):
        self.assertEqual(vertex3tuple([A]), (A, A, A))

    def test_triangle(self):
        vertices = [A, B, C]
        expected = [(A,B,C), (B,C,A), (C,A,B)]
        self.assertEqual(vertex3tuple(vertices), expected)

# Replace A, B, C with actual test data
# For example:
# A = (0,0)
# B = (1,0)
# C = (0,1)
# self.assertEqual(test_triangle(), expected)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### Explanation
- **Function Definition**: The function `vertex3tuple` takes a list of vertices as input.
- **Loop Through Vertices**: For each vertex, compute the previous and next indices using modulo to handle circular wrapping.
- **Create Tuples**: For each vertex, create a tuple containing the current vertex, previous vertex, and next vertex.
- **Return Result**: Collect all tuples into a list and return it.

This approach ensures that each vertex is correctly paired with its adjacent vertices in a circular manner, handling edge cases gracefully.
