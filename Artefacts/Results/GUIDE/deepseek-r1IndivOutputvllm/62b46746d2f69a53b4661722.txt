To solve this problem, we need to generate Python code based on a function signature and docstring that describe the behavior of the `absorb` method. The goal is to implement the `absorb` method such that it processes a list of expressions and returns a new list where expressions that can be absorbed by others are removed.

### Approach
The `absorb` method is designed to simplify a list of expressions by removing those that can be absorbed by others. In this context, an expression E is considered absorbed by another expression F if all variables in E are a subset of the variables in F. This means that E can be simplified or removed because it does not add any new variables that are not already covered by F.

The approach involves the following steps:
1. **Extract Variables**: For each expression, extract the set of variables it contains.
2. **Compare Expressions**: For each pair of expressions, check if one is a subset of the other in terms of their variables.
3. **Remove Subsets**: If one expression is a subset of another, remove the subset expression from the list.

This approach ensures that the resulting list contains only expressions that cannot be simplified further by combining with others.

### Solution Code
```python
def absorb(self, args):
    """
    Given an `args` sequence of expressions, return a new list of expressions applying absorption.
    """
    expressions = [e for e in args]
    for i in range(len(expressions)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(expressions)):
            if expressions[i].variables.issubset(expressions[j].variables):
                expressions.pop(i)
    return expressions
```

### Explanation
1. **Extract Variables**: Each expression is processed to extract its variables. This is assumed to be a property of the expression object, such as `variables`.
2. **Compare Expressions**: The method iterates through each pair of expressions. For each pair, it checks if the variables of one expression are a subset of the variables of the other.
3. **Remove Subsets**: If an expression's variables are a subset of another expression's variables, the subset expression is removed from the list. This is done using the `pop` method on the list of expressions.

This method ensures that the resulting list of expressions is minimal, containing only those expressions that cannot be absorbed by any other expression in the list. This approach efficiently reduces the list to its simplest form based on the absorption criterion.
