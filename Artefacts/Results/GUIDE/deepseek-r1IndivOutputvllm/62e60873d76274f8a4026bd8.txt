To solve this problem, we need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function should return a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes, either for a specific protocol version or all supported versions if none is provided.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Function Requirements**: The function `protocol_handlers` takes a class and an optional protocol version. It returns a dictionary where keys are version tuples and values are handler classes. If a specific protocol version is provided, it returns a dictionary with that version if supported; otherwise, it returns an empty dictionary. If no version is provided, it returns all supported versions.

2. **Generate Supported Versions**: We generate a list of version tuples starting from (3, 0) up to (3, 10). This range is arbitrary but reasonable for a protocol.

3. **Create Handler Classes**: For each version, dynamically create a handler class. Each class will have a `version` attribute set to the current version tuple.

4. **Return the Dictionary**: Depending on whether a specific protocol version is provided, return the appropriate dictionary of handler classes.

### Solution Code
```python
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version
    is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class
    """
    supported_versions = [(3, v) for v in range(11)]
    handler_dict = {}
    for version in supported_versions:
        class_name = f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}"
        class BoltHandler:
            version = version
        handler_dict[version] = BoltHandler
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if protocol_version in supported_versions:
            return {protocol_version: handler_dict[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        return handler_dict
```

### Explanation
1. **Dynamic Class Creation**: For each version tuple in the generated list, a new class `BoltHandler` is created dynamically. This class has a `version` attribute set to the current version tuple.

2. **Version Check**: When a specific protocol version is provided, the function checks if it exists in the supported versions. If it does, the function returns a dictionary with this version as the key and the corresponding handler class as the value. If the version is not supported, an empty dictionary is returned.

3. **Return All Handlers**: If no protocol version is provided, the function returns a dictionary containing all supported versions with their respective handler classes.

This approach ensures that the function dynamically generates the necessary handler classes and correctly returns the appropriate dictionary based on the provided protocol version.
