To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given host is the localhost. The function should return True if the host is localhost, its IP address is 127.0.0.1, or if it is a hostname that resolves to 127.0.0.1. 

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:
1. **Check if the host is an IP address**: Use the `socket.gethostbyname()` function to resolve the given host to its corresponding IP address. If the resolved IP address is `127.0.0.1`, then the host is considered localhost.
2. **Check if the host is a hostname**: If the host is not an IP address, use `socket.gethostname()` to get the hostname. If the hostname is `localhost`, then the host is considered localhost.
3. **Handle different address types**: The approach handles both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, as well as IPv6 hostnames.

This method ensures that both the IP address and hostname checks are performed comprehensively, covering all edge cases including IPv6 addresses.

### Solution Code
```python
import socket

def is_local(host):
    try:
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(host)
        return ip == '127.0.0.1'
    except socket.error:
        pass
    hostname = socket.gethostname()
    return hostname == 'localhost'
```

### Explanation
- **Checking the IP Address**: The function first attempts to resolve the given host to its IP address using `socket.gethostbyname()`. If the resolved IP address is `127.0.0.1`, the function returns True, indicating the host is localhost.
- **Handling Exceptions**: If `socket.gethostbyname()` raises an error (e.g., when the host is an IPv6 address), the function catches the exception and proceeds to the next step.
- **Checking the Hostname**: If the host is not an IP address, the function then retrieves the hostname using `socket.gethostname()`. If the hostname is `localhost`, the function returns True.

This approach ensures that all possible cases are covered, including IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and both domain names and IP addresses. The function efficiently determines if the given host is localhost by leveraging socket operations.
