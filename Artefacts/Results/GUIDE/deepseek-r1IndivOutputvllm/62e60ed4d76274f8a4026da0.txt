To implement the `keys()` method as described, we need to create a method that returns the `__keys` property of a class as a list. Based on the test-driven development approach, we'll first outline what the method should do and then implement it.

### Solution Code

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__keys = []

    def keys(self):
        """
        Returns the __keys property of the class as a list.
        """
        return self.__keys.copy()
```

### Explanation

1. **Class Initialization**: The class `MyClass` is initialized with an empty list `__keys`.
2. **keys Method**: The `keys()` method returns a copy of the `__keys` list. This ensures that modifications to the returned list do not affect the internal state.

### Unit Tests

Here are some unit tests to verify the functionality:

```python
import unittest

class TestMyClass(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.my_instance = MyClass()

    def test_keys(self):
        self.assertEqual([], self.my_instance.keys())
        self.my_instance.keys().append('key1')
        self.assertEqual(['key1'], self.my_instance.keys())

    def test_copy(self):
        keys = self.my_instance.keys()
        keys.append('key2')
        self.assertEqual(['key1'], self.my_instance.keys())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

These tests ensure that:
- The `keys()` method returns a list.
- The method correctly returns an empty list initially.
- Modifying the returned list does not affect the internal state (achieved by returning a copy).
- The internal state is updated when new keys are added.
