To solve this problem, we need to write a Python function that converts the children of an XML node into a dictionary, where the keys are the tag names of the children and the values are the child nodes themselves. This approach allows us to easily map each child element by its tag name, making it straightforward to access and manipulate the children in a structured manner.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: We will use the `lxml` library, which provides a convenient `Element` class for handling XML data. This library allows us to easily access children of an element using the `.children` attribute.

2. **Initialize an Empty Dictionary**: We will create an empty dictionary to store the children of the given XML node, with the tag names as keys and the corresponding child nodes as values.

3. **Iterate Over Children**: Using a loop, we will iterate over each child node of the given XML node. For each child, we will extract its tag name and add it to the dictionary with the child node as the value.

4. **Return the Result**: After processing all children, we will return the dictionary containing the children mapped by their tag names.

This approach ensures that we efficiently convert the XML node's children into a dictionary, which can be used for further processing or analysis.

### Solution Code
```python
import lxml.etree as etree

def xml_children_as_dict(node):
    """
    Convert the children of an XML node into a dictionary keyed by tag name.
    """
    children_dict = {}
    for child in node.children:
        children_dict[child.tag] = child
    return children_dict
```

### Explanation
- **Importing Libraries**: The `lxml.etree` module is imported to work with XML elements, providing access to the `.children` attribute which contains the child nodes.
  
- **Dictionary Initialization**: An empty dictionary `children_dict` is created to store the children, with their tag names as keys.

- **Looping Through Children**: We loop through each child node in `node.children`. For each child, we extract the tag name using `child.tag` and add the child node to the dictionary.

- **Returning the Result**: The function returns the `children_dict` containing all the children of the given XML node, each keyed by their respective tag name.

This solution efficiently handles the conversion of XML children into a dictionary, making it easy to access and manipulate the child nodes based on their tag names.
