To solve this problem, we need to create a method `fromutc` that converts a given timezone-aware datetime from its current timezone to a new timezone, while handling potential ambiguity in the new timezone. The method should determine if the converted datetime is ambiguous and raise an error if it is.

### Approach
1. **Convert to UTC**: First, convert the given datetime from its current timezone to UTC. This gives us a naive datetime in UTC.
2. **Convert to New Timezone**: Convert the UTC datetime to the target timezone. This results in a timezone-aware datetime in the new timezone.
3. **Check for Ambiguity**: Determine if the converted datetime in the new timezone is ambiguous. This is done by checking if the date falls within the DST transition period of the new timezone. If it does, raise a `ValueError` indicating that the datetime is in a fold state and cannot be determined uniquely.

### Solution Code
```python
import pytz
from datetime import datetime

class TimezoneAware(datetime):
    def fromutc(self, dt):
        """
        Given a timezone-aware datetime in a given timezone, calculates a
        timezone-aware datetime in a new timezone.

        Since this is the one time that we *know* we have an unambiguous
        datetime object, we take this opportunity to determine whether the
        datetime is ambiguous and in a "fold" state (e.g., if it's the first
        occurrence, chronologically, of the ambiguous datetime).

        :param dt: A timezone-aware :class:`datetime.datetime` object.
        :return: A timezone-aware datetime in the new timezone.
        :raises ValueError: If the resulting datetime is ambiguous.
        """
        # Convert dt to UTC
        utc_dt = dt.astimezone(pytz.timezone('UTC'))
        
        # Get the new timezone
        new_tz = self.tz  # Assuming self.tz is the target timezone
        
        # Convert utc_dt to new_tz
        new_dt = utc_dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone(new_tz))
        
        # Check if new_dt is ambiguous
        dst_start, dst_end = new_tz.dstinterval()
        
        if dst_start is not None and dst_end is not None:
            dt_date = new_dt.date()
            if dst_start <= dt_date <= dst_end:
                raise ValueError("Resulting datetime is in a fold state, cannot determine correct time.")
        
        return new_dt
```

### Explanation
- **Convert to UTC**: The given datetime is converted to UTC using `astimezone`, resulting in a naive datetime object.
- **Convert to New Timezone**: The UTC datetime is then converted to the target timezone using `replace(tzinfo=...)`, resulting in a timezone-aware datetime in the new timezone.
- **Check for Ambiguity**: The method checks if the date part of the new datetime falls within the DST transition period of the new timezone. If it does, the method raises a `ValueError` to indicate ambiguity. This ensures that the method handles cases where the converted datetime could correspond to two different times in the same day.

This approach ensures that the method correctly handles timezone conversions and identifies ambiguous times, providing a robust solution for converting datetime objects while maintaining accuracy.
