To solve this problem, we need to create a function that replaces all occurrences of the string "w:st=" with "w-st=" in a given input string. This transformation should be case-sensitive and should handle multiple occurrences correctly.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to replace the exact substring "w:st=" with "w-st=". The function should handle multiple occurrences and should be case-sensitive.
2. **Intuition**: Using Python's built-in string `replace` method is efficient for this task as it replaces all occurrences of a substring in a single pass.
3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the input is not a string, return it unchanged.
   - If there are no occurrences of "w:st=", return the input as is.
4. **Algorithm**: 
   - Check if the input is a string. If not, return it.
   - Use the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of "w:st=" with "w-st=".

### Solution Code

```python
def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    """
    Replace "w:st=" in content with "w-st=".
    """
    if not isinstance(content, str):
        return content
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")
```

### Explanation
- **Type Check**: The function first checks if the input `content` is a string. If it is not, the function returns `content` unchanged.
- **String Replacement**: If the input is a string, the function uses the `replace` method to replace every occurrence of "w:st=" with "w-st=". This method is efficient and handles all occurrences in one pass.
- **Edge Cases**: The solution handles cases where the input string does not contain "w:st=" by simply returning the input as is.

This approach ensures that the function is both efficient and robust, handling various edge cases appropriately.
