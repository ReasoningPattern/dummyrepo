To solve this problem, we need to create a function that normalizes declaration arguments. The function should handle tuples by expanding them into individual elements while keeping other types as single elements. This is useful in scenarios where arguments are passed in various formats, such as nested tuples or individual objects.

### Approach
The approach to solving this problem involves iterating over each element in the input sequence. For each element:
1. If the element is a tuple, we expand it into multiple elements.
2. If the element is not a tuple, we keep it as a single element in the result.

This approach ensures that any nested structures, such as tuples, are properly expanded, while other data types are maintained as single elements. This normalization is crucial for consistent argument handling in functions that may receive arguments in various formats.

### Solution Code

```python
def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """
    Normalize declaration arguments.

    This function takes a sequence of arguments and expands tuples into individual elements,
    while keeping other types as single elements. This ensures that arguments are properly
    normalized for further processing.
    """
    normalized = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            normalized.extend(item)
        else:
            normalized.append(item)
    return normalized
```

### Explanation
The function `_normalizeargs` processes each element in the input sequence as follows:
1. It initializes an empty list `normalized` to store the processed arguments.
2. It iterates over each element in the input `sequence`.
3. For each element, it checks if the element is a tuple using `isinstance(item, tuple)`.
4. If the element is a tuple, it extends the `normalized` list with the elements of the tuple.
5. If the element is not a tuple, it appends the element to the `normalized` list as a single element.
6. Finally, the function returns the `normalized` list containing the properly processed arguments.

This solution efficiently handles the normalization of arguments, ensuring that tuples are expanded while other data types remain unchanged. This makes the function versatile and suitable for various argument processing scenarios.
