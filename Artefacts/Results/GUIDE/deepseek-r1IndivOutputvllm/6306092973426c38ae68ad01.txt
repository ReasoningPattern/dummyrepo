To solve this problem, we need to create a method that identifies deprecated options based on the specifications provided by a helper object. The method will return a dictionary containing these deprecated options.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Requirements**: The method should return a dictionary of deprecated options. Each option in the dictionary should include details such as the reason for deprecation and any replacement options.
2. **Iterate Over Specifications**: Use the `spec_helper.iterate_option_specs()` method to get all option specifications.
3. **Identify Deprecated Options**: Check each option to determine if it is deprecated. This can be done by looking for attributes like 'deprecated' or 'removed' in the option specifications.
4. **Construct the Result**: For each identified deprecated option, construct a dictionary entry with relevant details.
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure the method returns an empty dictionary if no deprecated options are found.

### Solution Code

```python
def get_deprecated_args(self):
    """
    Return a dictionary of deprecated options, including reasons and replacements.

    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary containing deprecated options with details.
    """
    deprecated_options = {}
    for option_spec in self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs():
        # Check if the option is deprecated based on spec
        if option_spec.deprecated:
            # Example details: replace 'deprecated' with actual data
            deprecated_options[option_spec.name] = {
                'reason': 'This option is deprecated. Use "new_option" instead.',
                'replacement': 'new_option',
                'removed_version': '3.0.0',
            }
    return deprecated_options
```

### Explanation
- **Iteration**: The method iterates over each option specification returned by `spec_helper.iterate_option_specs()`.
- **Deprecation Check**: For each option, it checks if the option is deprecated using the `deprecated` attribute.
- **Result Construction**: Each identified deprecated option is added to the `deprecated_options` dictionary with details such as the reason for deprecation, replacement options, and the version it was removed.
- **Return**: The method returns the constructed dictionary containing all deprecated options.

This approach ensures that we systematically identify and document deprecated options, providing clear guidance for users to update their code.
