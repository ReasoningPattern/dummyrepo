To create a decorator that registers a method as a handler for a VCS, we'll write a function that takes the VCS instance and the method, then returns a decorator. This decorator will add the method to the VCS's handler list.

```python
def register_vcs_handler(vcs, method):
    """
    Creates a decorator to register a method as a handler for the VCS.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        # Add the method to the VCS's handler list
        vcs handlers.append(func)
        return func
    return decorator
```
