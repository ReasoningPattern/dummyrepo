```python
def plus_or_dot(pieces):
    closest_tag = pieces[-1]
    return "." if "+" in closest_tag else "+"
```

To ensure the correctness of this implementation, we should write comprehensive unit tests. Here is an example of how the tests might look:

```python
import unittest

class TestPlusOrDot(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_plus_or_dot(self):
        # Test case 1: Should return "+" as there is no "+"
        self.assertEqual(plus_or_dot(["dot"]), "+")
        
        # Test case 2: Should return "." as there is a "+"
        self.assertEqual(plus_or_dot(["plus"]), ".")
        
        # Test case 3: Should return "." as there is a "+"
        self.assertEqual(plus_or_dot(["tag1+tag2"]), ".")
        
        # Test case 4: Should return "." as there is a "+"
        self.assertEqual(plus_or_dot(["tag1", "another+tag"]), ".")
        
        # Test case 5: Should return "." as the last tag is "+"
        self.assertEqual(plus_or_dot(["tag", "another+tag"]), ".")
        
        # Test case 6: Should return "." even with empty string in pieces
        self.assertEqual(plus_or_dot(["", "+"]), ".")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
