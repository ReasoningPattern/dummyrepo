Okay, so I need to write a Python function called _resolve_string based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to get the value from the environment using a matcher that contains a name and an optional default value. If the variable isn't defined and no default is provided, it should raise an Error.

Hmm, first, I should think about how to structure this function. The matcher is probably a regex match object, right? So the groups in the matcher's dict should have 'name' and maybe 'default'. I remember that in regex, group names can be accessed via the groups() method, but here it's already in the match object's group dict.

So, the function needs to extract the 'name' from the matcher's groups. Then, check if there's a 'default' value. If not, it should look up the environment variable with that name. If the variable isn't found and there's no default, it should raise an Error.

Wait, but how do I get the environment variable? I think using os.environ would be appropriate here. So, I'll need to import the os module.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Import os module.
2. Define the function _resolve_string(matcher).
3. Extract the name from matcher.group('name'). But wait, what if 'name' isn't a key in the groups? That could cause a KeyError. Maybe I should handle that, but the problem statement says the matcher contains a name, so perhaps it's safe.
4. Check if 'default' is in the groups. If it is, use it as the default value.
5. Get the value from os.environ using the name. But os.environ can return None if the variable isn't found, so I need to handle that case.
6. If the value is None and there's no default, raise an Error. Otherwise, return the value.

Wait, the function is supposed to raise an Error when the variable isn't found and no default is provided. So, after getting the value, if it's None and 'default' isn't present, raise an error. Otherwise, return the value, which could be None if the default is provided.

But looking at the docstring, it says if the variable isn't defined and no default is provided, raise an Error. So, if default is provided, it's okay to return None. Only when both are missing should it raise an error.

So, the logic would be:
- value = os.environ.get(matcher.group('name'), default)
- if value is None and default is None:
    raise Error
- else:
    return value

Wait, but in the matcher's group dict, the default is optional. So, the function should extract the default if it exists, else use None.

Alternatively, using os.environ.get with default is cleaner. So, the code would be something like:

value = os.environ.get(matcher.group('name'), matcher.get('default')) if 'default' in matcher.group else os.environ.get(matcher.group('name'))

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if 'default' exists, we should use it as the default in os.environ.get. If 'default' doesn't exist, then os.environ.get will return None, which is correct.

Wait, actually, the function can be written as:

name = matcher.group('name')
default = matcher.group('default') if 'default' in matcher.group else None
value = os.environ.get(name, default)
if value is None:
    raise Error
return value

But wait, in the code, the default is optional, so in the matcher's group dict, 'default' may or may not be present. So, the function should check if 'default' is in the group dict. If it is, use it as the default value for os.environ.get. If not, then the default is None, meaning that if the environment variable isn't found, it should raise an error.

So, putting it all together:

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    import os
    name = matcher.group('name')
    default = matcher.group('default') if 'default' in matcher.group else None
    value = os.environ.get(name, default)
    if value is None:
        raise Error
    return value

Wait, but in the code, I should import os at the top, not inside the function. So, I'll move the import statement to the top.

Also, the error to raise isn't specified, just an Error. So, I'll import the Error class from somewhere, maybe from the standard library. Oh, wait, in Python, 'Error' is a base exception, so I can raise it directly.

Wait, but in the code, the function is supposed to raise an Error, but in Python, it's more common to use ValueError or a custom exception. But the problem statement just says 'Error', so I'll assume it's a custom exception. So, I'll need to import it.

Wait, but looking at the code, the function is named _resolve_string, so maybe it's part of a module. So, I'll need to import Error from the appropriate module. Alternatively, I can raise a ValueError, but the problem says Error, so I'll proceed.

Wait, but in Python, there's a standard Error class in the exceptions module. So, I'll import it.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import os
from exceptions import Error

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    name = matcher.group('name')
    default = matcher.group('default') if 'default' in matcher.group else None
    value = os.environ.get(name, default)
    if value is None:
        raise Error
    return value

Wait, but in the code, the 'default' is being accessed as matcher.group('default'), but matcher.group() returns a dictionary of the groups. So, 'default' may not be present, so the ternary operator correctly checks if 'default' is in the group dict.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to extract 'default' as an optional parameter, but the function signature doesn't allow that. So, using the group method is the way to go.

Wait, but the group method returns None if the group isn't present, which would cause 'default' to be None, which is correct because if there's no default, it's treated as None.

Wait, no, because matcher.group('default') would return None if the group isn't present. So, in that case, 'default' would be None, which is correct.

So, the code can be simplified as:

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    name = matcher.group('name')
    default = matcher.group('default')
    value = os.environ.get(name, default)
    if value is None:
        raise Error
    return value

Because if 'default' isn't in the group dict, matcher.group('default') returns None, which is the correct default for os.environ.get.

Wait, that's a better approach. So, the code doesn't need to check if 'default' is present in the group dict. Because if it's not, group('default') returns None, which is the default for os.environ.get.

So, the code becomes even simpler.

Testing this logic: if the matcher has a 'default' group, it's used; else, None is used as default. Then, os.environ.get looks for the name, using default if present. If not found, raises Error.

Yes, that should work.

So, the final code is:

import os
from exceptions import Error

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    name = matcher.group('name')
    default = matcher.group('default')
    value = os.environ.get(name, default)
    if value is None:
        raise Error
    return value

Wait, but in the code, 'default' is assigned as matcher.group('default'), which could be None. So, when os.environ.get is called with None as default, it's equivalent to not providing a default. So, if the variable isn't found, it returns None, and then we raise an error.

Yes, that's correct.

I think that's the correct implementation.
