Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called from_raw_values and it's supposed to create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark strings. 

First, I should understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it creates a Bookmarks object, which I assume is an instance of a class, maybe Bookmarks. The input is a list of strings, each representing a bookmark value.

I remember that in Python, when you have a class, you can instantiate it using the constructor. So, the function probably returns an instance of the Bookmarks class. 

The function takes two arguments: cls, which is the class to instantiate, and values, which is a list of strings. So, the function needs to create an instance of cls and pass the values somehow.

I'm thinking that the Bookmarks class might have a __init__ method that accepts a list of values. So, the from_raw_values function would create a Bookmarks instance and then pass the values into that constructor.

Wait, but how does the Bookmarks class handle the initialization? Maybe it expects the values to be passed as a single argument, like a list. So, the function would create a Bookmarks instance and then set the values somehow. Perhaps through a method or by directly assigning.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class has a method like _from_raw_values that does the actual processing. But since the function is named from_raw_values, it's probably intended to handle the creation internally.

So, the function would create a new instance of cls and then use the values to initialize it. For example, if Bookmarks has an __init__ that takes a list of strings, then we can pass values directly. But if the __init__ expects individual arguments, we might need to unpack the list. However, since the function is called from_raw_values, it's more likely that the __init__ expects the entire list as a single argument.

Putting it together, the function would look like this: create an instance of cls, then pass the values into the __init__ method. So, the code would be something like return cls(values).

But wait, maybe the Bookmarks class expects the values to be set via another method, like _set_values. So, perhaps the function should create the instance and then call that method. But without seeing the class, it's hard to tell. Since the user is asking for the function, I'll assume that the __init__ method accepts a list of values.

Therefore, the function is straightforward: it instantiates cls with the values list and returns it. 

I should also consider writing unit tests, as per the tips. The tests would cover various cases, like an empty list, a single bookmark, and multiple bookmarks. Each test would create a list, call the function, and assert that the instance's values match the input.

So, in code, the function is simple. I'll write it as return cls(values). Then, I'll outline the tests, but since the user only asked for the code, I'll focus on that part.
