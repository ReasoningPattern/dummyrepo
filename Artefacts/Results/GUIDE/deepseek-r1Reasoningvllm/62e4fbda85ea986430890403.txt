Okay, I need to write a Python function called _shuffled that takes a sequence of strings and returns a shuffled list of those strings. The function should use a fixed random seed, which is important for reproducibility. 

First, I should think about how to shuffle a sequence in Python. I remember that the random.shuffle function can shuffle a list in place. But since the function is supposed to return a new list, I'll need to create a copy of the input sequence. So I'll convert the sequence into a list and then shuffle it.

Next, the function needs a fixed random seed. That means every time the function is called, it will shuffle the same way if given the same input. I'll set the seed using random.seed() at the beginning of the function.

I should also handle the case where the input sequence is empty or has only one element. In those cases, the function should just return the input as there's nothing to shuffle.

Now, considering unit tests, I should test the function with different inputs. For example, an empty list, a list with one element, a list with multiple elements, and a list of strings. I'll check if the output is indeed a shuffled version each time and that the same input produces the same output every time because of the fixed seed.

I should also make sure that the function doesn't modify the original sequence. So, I'll create a copy of the input sequence to shuffle. Using list(seq) should create a shallow copy, which is sufficient here.

Putting it all together, the function will:
1. Set the random seed.
2. Check if the sequence is empty or has one element and return early if so.
3. Convert the sequence to a list.
4. Shuffle the list.
5. Return the shuffled list.

I'll also include a docstring explaining what the function does, its arguments, return value, and the fixed seed note.

Finally, I'll write comprehensive test cases to ensure the function behaves as expected in various scenarios. This will help catch any bugs early on, especially edge cases.
