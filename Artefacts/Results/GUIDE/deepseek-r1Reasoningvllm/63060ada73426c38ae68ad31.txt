Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _convert_non_cli_args, and it's part of a class. The parameters are parser_name and values_dict. The docstring says that this function casts arguments to the correct types by modifying values_dict. By default, all values are strings.

Hmm, I remember that in argparse, when you parse command-line arguments, you often have a parser object that knows about the arguments. So this function is probably part of a custom argparse handler. The parser_name is likely the name of the parser, like 'main' or 'virsh'. The values_dict contains the parsed arguments as strings, but some might need to be converted to other types, like integers, floats, booleans, or None.

I should think about what types are common and might need conversion. For example, options that are turned on or off are booleans, version numbers are strings but should be converted to ints, port numbers are ints, etc. So the function needs to identify which arguments should be converted and apply the appropriate type conversion.

First, I'll need to get the parser object from the values_dict. Usually, in argparse, the parser is stored in the action object, which is in the args attribute. So I'll access parser = values_dict[parser_name + '_parser'].

Then, I'll loop through all the arguments in the parser's action. For each argument, if the value is not None, I'll check the type of the argument. For example, if the argument is of type action with choices, it might be a boolean. If it's a version string, convert to int. If it's a port, convert to int as well.

Wait, but how do I determine what type each argument should be? Maybe I can check the 'dest' attribute of the action. For example, if dest is 'bool', then the value should be converted to a boolean. If dest is 'version', convert to int. For 'port', also int.

But I'm not sure if all actions have a 'dest' attribute. Maybe I should check if the action has a 'type' or 'dest' that indicates the expected type.

Alternatively, I can check if the value is a string and see if it can be converted to an integer or a boolean. For example, if the value is 'true' or 'false', convert to bool. If it's a number string, convert to int or float.

I should also handle cases where the conversion isn't possible, maybe by leaving the value as a string or raising an error, depending on the requirements.

Putting this together, the function will:

1. Access the parser object from values_dict using parser_name.
2. Iterate over each argument in the parser's action.
3. For each argument, if the value is not None and not already the correct type, convert it.
4. Update values_dict with the converted values.

I should also consider edge cases, like when the argument is None, or when the conversion isn't straightforward. For example, a port might be specified as None, which should probably remain None.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Get the parser from values_dict.
- Iterate over each argument in parser.action.
- For each arg, if value is not None:
   - Check if it's a string.
   - If it's a string, try converting to bool, int, float, or leave as string.
   - Update the values_dict with the converted value.

Wait, but in argparse, the 'dest' attribute can help determine the type. For example, if dest is 'bool', the value should be converted to bool. So perhaps I can check the dest and act accordingly.

Alternatively, I can check if the value is a string and see if it's a number or boolean. For example:

value = arg.value
if value is None:
    continue
if arg.dest == 'bool':
    converted = bool(value)
elif arg.dest == 'version':
    converted = int(value)
elif arg.dest == 'port':
    converted = int(value)
else:
    converted = value

But I'm not sure about all possible dest values. Maybe it's safer to check if the value can be converted to an integer or float, and if so, do so. Otherwise, leave as string or bool.

Another approach is to try converting and catch exceptions if the conversion isn't possible.

Putting it all together, the function will loop through each argument, determine the appropriate type, and update the values_dict accordingly.

I should also consider that some arguments might not need conversion, like if they are already in the correct type. So the function should only modify the values_dict when necessary.

Testing this function would involve creating a values_dict with various string representations of different types and ensuring that they are correctly converted.

For example, if the parser is for 'main' and the values_dict has {'--version': '2.0', '-p': '80'}, the function should convert '--version' to 2.0 (float) and '-p' to 80 (int).

I think this approach covers the necessary steps. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
