Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring. The function is called to_csv and it's part of a class, probably something related to handling graphs, maybe in a data processing or visualization library.

First, I'll read the docstring carefully. It says that to_csv is deprecated in version 0.5 and that it's not used anymore. So the function is probably outdated, but maybe it's still present for backward compatibility. The main purpose is to convert the graph's points into a CSV format.

The function takes two parameters: separator, which defaults to ",", and header, which defaults to None. The docstring mentions that if header is not None, it's added as the first string of the output, followed by a new line. Also, each point's coordinate is converted to a string with parts separated by the separator, and then each part of its value is also separated by the same separator.

Wait, the description says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted to a string, then each part of its value. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. So each point has coordinates and values. For example, a point might have a position (x, y, z) and some associated values. The function should first convert the position to a string separated by the separator, then each value is also separated by the separator.

But looking at the code example, the function is supposed to output lines where each line represents a point. Each line starts with the coordinate string, then the values are added, each separated by the separator.

Wait, the docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe each point's coordinate is a tuple, and each element is converted to a string, then joined with the separator. Then, each value of the point is also converted to a string and joined with the separator.

So, for example, a point with coordinate (1,2,3) and values [4,5,6] would be converted to "1,2,3,4,5,6" if the separator is ",".

But wait, the function is supposed to output each point as a line. So each line is the coordinate string followed by the values, each part separated by the separator.

Wait, the function's docstring says that the points are converted to tables. So each point is a row in the CSV, with the first part being the coordinate and the rest being the values.

So the function should take each point, process it to create a row, and then write all rows to a CSV, optionally adding a header.

But how are the points structured? Are they instances of a certain class, maybe a GraphPoint or similar? Or perhaps the points are stored as a list of tuples or lists.

The function is part of a class, so I'll assume it's an instance method, so 'self' contains the data. The data is probably an attribute like self.points or something similar.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Process each point in self.points.
2. For each point, create a string representation.
3. The string starts with the coordinate, which is the position, converted to a string with parts separated by the separator.
4. Then, each value of the point is added, also separated by the separator.
5. If a header is provided, it's added as the first line, followed by a newline.

Now, considering the function is deprecated, maybe it's better to handle it in a way that's compatible but also noting that it's deprecated. However, since the function is provided, I'll proceed to implement it.

Potential issues to consider:

- How are the points structured? Are they tuples, lists, or custom objects? If they are custom objects, I'll need to convert their coordinates and values to strings, possibly using __str__ or __repr__ methods.

But since the function is part of a class, perhaps the points are stored as a list of tuples or lists where each tuple represents a point's coordinates followed by its values.

Wait, the docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So each point has a coordinate (like x, y, z) and then values. So each point is a list where the first elements are the coordinates, and the rest are the values.

So, for example, a point could be [(x, y, z), v1, v2, v3], meaning the coordinate is (x, y, z) and the values are v1, v2, v3.

Alternatively, maybe each point is a dictionary with 'coordinate' and 'values' keys. But the function's docstring doesn't specify, so I'll assume that each point is a list where the first elements are the coordinates and the rest are the values.

So, for each point, I'll take the first part as the coordinate string, then the rest as the values.

Wait, but the function's docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe each point is a list where the first element is the coordinate string, and the rest are the values. Or perhaps the coordinate is a tuple, which is then converted to a string.

I think the safest approach is to process each point by taking all elements, but perhaps the first part is the coordinate and the rest are the values.

Wait, perhaps the points are stored as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has 'coords' and 'values' keys. For example, each point is {'coords': (x, y, z), 'values': [v1, v2, v3]}.

But since the function is part of a class, perhaps the data is stored as an attribute, maybe self.points, which is a list of points, each of which is a list where the first elements are the coordinates and the rest are the values.

Alternatively, perhaps each point is a tuple where the first element is the coordinate tuple, and the rest are the values.

But without more information, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's assume that each point is a list where the first elements are the coordinates, and the rest are the values.

So, for each point in self.points:

- Convert the coordinate part to a string, separated by the separator.
- Then, convert each value to a string, separated by the separator.
- Combine them into a single string for the row.

If the header is provided, add it as the first line.

Now, considering that the function is deprecated, maybe it's better to note that it's deprecated but still provide the code for it. However, perhaps the code should raise a DeprecationWarning and suggest using another method.

But the user's instructions say to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so I'll proceed to write the code as per the given specifications.

Potential code structure:

- Check if the header is not None, and if so, add it as the first line.
- For each point in self.points:
   - Convert the coordinate to a string, separated by separator.
   - Convert each value in the point to a string, separated by separator.
   - Combine them into a line.
- Join all lines with newline separators.

But how to handle the points? Let's assume that self.points is a list where each element is a list or tuple where the first elements are the coordinates and the rest are the values.

Wait, perhaps the points are stored as a list of lists, where each sublist represents a point, and each point has a coordinate and values. Alternatively, perhaps the points are stored as a list of dictionaries with 'coords' and 'values' keys.

But without more information, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's assume that each point is a list where the first elements are the coordinates, and the rest are the values.

So, for example, a point could be [x, y, z, v1, v2], where x, y, z are the coordinates, and v1, v2 are the values.

So, for each point, I can take all elements, but perhaps the first part is the coordinate and the rest are the values.

Wait, but the function's docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So perhaps the point is a list where the first element is the coordinate string, and the rest are the values.

Wait, that might make more sense. So each point is a list where the first element is the coordinate string, and the rest are the values.

So, for example, a point could be ["x,y,z", "v1", "v2", "v3"], meaning the coordinate is "x,y,z" and the values are "v1", "v2", "v3".

In that case, for each point, the first element is the coordinate string, and the rest are the values.

So, the code would process each point as follows:

- Take the first element as the coordinate string.
- Take the remaining elements, join them with the separator.
- Combine the coordinate string and the values into a single string, separated by the separator.

Wait, but the function's docstring says: "first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So perhaps the coordinate is converted to a string with separator, and then each value is also converted to a string with separator.

Wait, maybe the coordinate is a tuple or list that is converted to a string with separator. Then, the values are a list, each converted to a string, and joined with the separator.

So, for example:

Point: (1, 2, 3)
Separator: comma
Coordinate string: "1,2,3"
Values: [4,5,6] -> "4,5,6"
Combined line: "1,2,3,4,5,6"

So, the code would process each point by first converting the coordinate to a string, then converting each value to a string, and then joining all of them with the separator.

So, the steps are:

1. If header is not None, add it as the first line.
2. For each point in self.points:
   a. Convert the coordinate to a string, using str() or by joining with separator.
   b. Convert each value in the point to a string, then join with separator.
   c. Combine the coordinate string and the values string with separator.
3. Write all lines to a CSV.

But how are the points structured? Let's assume that each point is a list where the first element is the coordinate, and the rest are the values. Or perhaps the coordinate is a tuple or list that needs to be converted to a string.

Wait, perhaps the points are stored as a list of tuples, where each tuple is (coordinate, values). For example, point = ( (x, y, z), [v1, v2, v3] )

In that case, for each point, we can extract the coordinate and the values.

So, the code would be:

lines = []
if header is not None:
    lines.append(header)
for point in self.points:
    coordinate = point[0]
    values = point[1]
    coord_str = ','.join(str(c) for c in coordinate)
    values_str = ','.join(str(v) for v in values)
    line = f"{coord_str},{values_str}"
    lines.append(line)
# Then, join all lines with newlines and return as a string.

But wait, the function is supposed to return the CSV as a string, or write to a file? The function's docstring says it "converts graph's points to CSV", but the code example in the user's message shows a function that returns a string, as it's returning lines.

Wait, looking back, the user provided a code example:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    # docstring
    pass

So, the function is supposed to return the CSV as a string.

But in the code example, the user wrote:

# Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format.

So, the code should generate the function.

But perhaps the function should return the CSV as a string, with lines separated by newlines.

So, the code would process each point, create a line, collect all lines, and then join them with newlines.

Now, considering that the function is deprecated, perhaps it's better to issue a warning and suggest using another method, but since the function is provided, I'll proceed.

Putting it all together, the code would:

- Check if header is not None, add it as the first line.
- For each point, process the coordinate and values, create a line.
- Collect all lines and join with newlines.

Now, considering potential issues:

- What if a point has no values? Then values would be an empty list, and values_str would be an empty string.
- What if the separator is an empty string? Probably, the function should handle it, but the default is ",".
- What if the coordinate is empty? Then coord_str would be empty, but that might not be intended.

But since the function is provided, I'll proceed under the assumption that the points are structured correctly.

So, the code would look something like this:

import csv
from io import StringIO

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.

    Convert graph's points to CSV.

    *separator* delimits values, the default is comma.

    *header* is the first string of the output (new line is added).
    """
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        # Assuming each point is a tuple where the first element is the coordinate and the rest are values
        coord = point[0]
        values = point[1]
        coord_str = ','.join(str(c) for c in coord)
        values_str = ','.join(str(v) for v in values)
        line = f"{coord_str},{values_str}"
        lines.append(line)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

Wait, but in the code example, the function is supposed to return the CSV as a string. So, the above code should work.

But wait, in the code example, the user wrote:

# Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format.

So, the code should be in a markdown formatted code block.

But the user's initial message included a code example with the function signature and docstring.

So, the final code should be the function as above, but perhaps with some error handling or more robust processing.

But given the information, this should be the approach.
