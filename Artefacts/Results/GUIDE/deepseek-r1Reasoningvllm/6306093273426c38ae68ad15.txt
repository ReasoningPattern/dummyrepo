Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _run_playbook and it's supposed to run Ansible CLI with a vars dict. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Ansible, when you pass extra variables, you can do so in a few ways. One common method is using the -e option in the CLI, which takes a string of Ansible variables. Another way is to pass them as extra-vars, which is the default behavior when you don't use -e.

Looking at the function parameters, I see cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. The function should return the Ansible results. So, the code inside the function needs to execute the Ansible playbook with the provided variables.

I think the first step is to construct the command string that includes the playbook path and the variables. Using os.path.join to combine the playbook file path with the __init__.py file makes sense because Ansible looks for the playbook in the plugin's directory.

Next, I'll need to create a list of arguments for the subprocess. The command should be ['ansible', 'playbook'], then the constructed path, and then the -e option followed by the vars_dict string.

But wait, if the user has already provided extra-vars in the environment, we don't want to override them. So, before adding the -e option, I should check if extra_vars is not None. If it is None, then we proceed to add the variables.

I'll import the necessary modules: os, subprocess, shlex, and click. Using shlex for safe string handling and click for command line argument parsing might be useful, but in this case, since cli_args is already a list, maybe it's better to handle it directly.

Wait, the function already has cli_args as a parameter, so perhaps we should merge those with our constructed command line. But looking at the code example I wrote, it seems I'm creating a new command list that includes the Ansible CLI, the playbook path, and the -e option. So, cli_args might be the Ansible CLI arguments, like --tasks or something else. So, perhaps the function is designed to take a list of Ansible CLI arguments and then add the variables to them.

Wait, no, in the code example, the command list starts with ['ansible', 'playbook'], then the path, then the -e option. So, cli_args might be the other parts of the Ansible CLI, like tasks or modules. So, the code is constructing the full command line by combining cli_args with the other parts.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if cli_args is a list like ['tasks', 'all'], then the command would be ['ansible', 'playbook', 'my_playbook.py', '-e', 'VAR_NAME=value'] plus the tasks. But in the code example, the command list is ['ansible', 'playbook', path, '-e', ...] which would be incorrect because Ansible expects the CLI arguments first, then the playbook path, then the variables.

Wait, no, the Ansible CLI is run as ansible <command> <path>, so the code should construct the command as ['ansible'] + cli_args + [playbook_path] + ['-e', ...]. But in the code example I wrote, it's ['ansible', 'playbook'], which is incorrect because 'playbook' is a subcommand. So, the correct approach is to have the CLI arguments, then the playbook path.

Wait, in Ansible, when you run 'ansible playbook path/to/playbook', the 'playbook' is a subcommand. So, the correct way is to have the CLI arguments, then 'playbook', then the path. So, in the code, the command should be ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...].

Wait, but in the code example, the command list starts with ['ansible', 'playbook'], which would run 'ansible playbook path', which is not correct. So, I think the code example is incorrect. Instead, the command should be ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...].

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to take a list of arguments that includes everything except the playbook path and variables. So, the code should construct the command as ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...].

But looking at the code example I wrote earlier, it's just ['ansible', 'playbook', path, '-e', ...], which is incorrect. So, I need to fix that.

Wait, perhaps the function is designed such that cli_args includes everything except the playbook path and the variables. So, the code should combine cli_args with the playbook path and then the variables.

So, the correct command would be ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...]. Or, perhaps, the cli_args already include 'playbook', but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to take a list of arguments that includes the playbook path, but that's not clear.

Wait, looking back at the function signature, cli_args is a list of command line arguments. So, perhaps the function is meant to take the CLI arguments (like --tasks, --playbook-file, etc.) and then add the playbook path and variables.

So, the code should construct the command as ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...].

But in the code example I wrote earlier, I didn't include the 'playbook' part. So, I think that's a mistake.

Wait, no, in the code example, the command is ['ansible', 'playbook', path, '-e', ...], which is incorrect because 'playbook' is a subcommand and should come after the CLI arguments.

Wait, no, in Ansible, the CLI is ansible <command> <path>, where <command> can be 'playbook', 'all', etc. So, the correct way is to have the CLI arguments first, then 'playbook', then the path, then the variables.

So, the command should be ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...].

But in the code example I wrote, it's just ['ansible', 'playbook', path, '-e', ...], which is incorrect because 'playbook' is a subcommand and should be part of the CLI arguments.

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to take the CLI arguments, including the 'playbook' part. For example, if the user runs 'ansible playbook path', then cli_args would be ['playbook', 'path/to/path'], and the code would need to extract the playbook path from cli_args.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to take cli_args as the other parts of the CLI, and the code constructs the full command.

I think I need to clarify this. Let's assume that cli_args is a list of other CLI arguments, not including the playbook path or the -e option. So, the code should combine cli_args with the playbook path and the variables.

So, the command would be ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...].

Wait, but in the code example I wrote earlier, I didn't include the 'playbook' part. So, that's incorrect. I think I need to fix that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to take the full CLI arguments, including the playbook path. But that would complicate things because the playbook path is a positional argument, not a subcommand.

Hmm, perhaps the function is designed to take the playbook path as part of cli_args. For example, if the user runs 'ansible my_playbook.py', then cli_args would be ['my_playbook.py'], and the code would extract that.

But that's not how Ansible works. The playbook path is passed as a positional argument, not as a subcommand. So, the code should include 'playbook' as a subcommand.

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to take the playbook path as part of cli_args. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to take the playbook path as part of the cli_args, but that's not standard. Typically, the playbook path is the second positional argument after the CLI options.

So, perhaps the function is designed to take a list of other CLI arguments, and then the code constructs the command line as ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...].

But in the code example I wrote earlier, I didn't include the 'playbook' part. So, that's a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. The code example I wrote earlier was:

command = ['ansible', 'playbook', path, '-e', var_str]

But that's incorrect because 'playbook' is a subcommand and should come after the other CLI arguments.

Wait, no, in Ansible, the CLI is ansible <command> <path>, so the correct way is to have the other CLI arguments first, then 'playbook', then the path, then the variables.

So, the correct command should be ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + ['-e', ...].

But in the code example I wrote earlier, it's missing the 'playbook' part. So, I need to correct that.

Wait, no, in the code example, the command is ['ansible', 'playbook', path, '-e', var_str], which is incorrect because 'playbook' is a subcommand and should be part of the CLI arguments.

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to take the playbook path as part of the cli_args. For example, if the user runs 'ansible my_playbook.py', then cli_args would be ['my_playbook.py'], and the code would extract that.

But in that case, the code would need to check if the playbook path is in cli_args and then remove it before constructing the command.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to take the playbook path as the first argument, and then the other CLI arguments. So, the code would extract the playbook path from cli_args[0], then the rest are other arguments.

But that's not standard. Typically, the playbook path is the second positional argument.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about how the Ansible CLI works.

When you run 'ansible playbook path/to/playbook', the 'playbook' is the subcommand, and 'path/to/playbook' is the argument.

So, the CLI arguments are: ['ansible', 'playbook', 'path/to/playbook'].

In this case, cli_args would be ['playbook', 'path/to/playbook'] if the function is called with that as cli_args.

But that's not typical. Usually, the playbook path is the second argument, so cli_args would be ['path/to/playbook'].

Wait, perhaps the function is designed to take the playbook path as part of the cli_args. So, the code would construct the command as ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['-e', ...].

But that would be incorrect because 'playbook' is a subcommand.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently.

The function needs to run Ansible with the given variables. It can do this in two ways: either via the -e option with the variables string, or via the extra_vars option in the IR Workspace.

The function should construct the Ansible CLI command, including the playbook path and the variables.

So, the steps are:

1. Construct the playbook path using os.path.join(ir_workspace, __init__.py).

2. Create a list of Ansible CLI arguments: ['ansible', 'playbook', playbook_path].

3. Add the variables either via -e option or via extra_vars.

4. If extra_vars is not None, add the variables without the -e option.

But how to handle the variables? The function has vars_dict as a parameter. So, the variables can be passed either via the -e option or via the extra_vars in the IR Workspace.

So, in the code, if extra_vars is not None, we should add the variables without the -e option. Otherwise, use the -e option.

Putting it all together, the code should:

- Check if extra_vars is not None. If so, add the variables as extra_vars. Else, add them via -e.

- Construct the command line with the Ansible CLI, playbook path, and variables.

Wait, but the function parameters include cli_args, which are the other CLI arguments. So, perhaps cli_args includes any other options, like --tasks, etc.

So, the full command line should be:

['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + (['-e', var_str] if not extra_vars else [])

But wait, in the code example I wrote earlier, I didn't include the 'playbook' part, which is incorrect. So, I need to correct that.

Alternatively, perhaps cli_args already includes the 'playbook' part. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps cli_args is a list that includes all the other CLI arguments except the playbook path and variables. So, the code should construct the command as ['ansible'] + cli_args + ['playbook'] + [path] + (['-e', ...] or extra_vars).

So, the code would be:

import os
import subprocess
import shlex
import click

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    playbook_path = os.path.join(ir_workspace, __init__.py)
    var_str = shlex.join(vars_dict)
    command = ['ansible']
    if cli_args:
        command += cli_args
    command += ['playbook']
    command.append(playbook_path)
    if not vars_dict:
        command += ['-e', var_str]
    else:
        command.extend(extra_vars)
    # Run the command
    result = subprocess.run(command, text=True, capture_output=True, shell=True)
    return result

Wait, but this is a test-driven approach. So, perhaps I should write unit tests first to ensure the function works correctly.

But the user asked to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so I need to make sure the code is correct.

Wait, another thing: in Ansible, when you pass extra_vars, you don't need to use -e. So, the code should check if extra_vars is not None. If it is, add the variables as extra_vars. Otherwise, use -e.

But in the code above, I have 'if not vars_dict', which is incorrect because vars_dict is a dictionary, not a boolean. So, that condition is wrong. It should be 'if vars_dict is not None'.

Also, when constructing the var_str, using shlex.join is correct to handle spaces in variable names.

Another thing: the code uses subprocess.run with text=True, which is available in Python 3.5 and above, which is acceptable.

But I think the code can be improved. Let me think about the parameters.

Wait, the function parameters are cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin. So, the code should use these correctly.

Also, the code should handle the case where cli_args is empty. So, the command should still start with 'ansible' and 'playbook'.

Putting it all together, the code should:

- Import necessary modules.

- Construct the playbook path.

- Create a list of command arguments.

- Add the playbook path.

- Add the variables either via -e or via extra_vars.

- Run the command and return the result.

So, the final code would look something like this:

import os
import subprocess
import shlex
import click

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param cli_args: the list  of command line arguments
    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active
                          workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    playbook_path = os.path.join(ir_workspace, __init__.py)
    var_str = shlex.join(vars_dict)
    command = ['ansible']
    if cli_args:
        command += cli_args
    command += ['playbook']
    command.append(playbook_path)
    if vars_dict is None:
        command += ['-e', var_str]
    else:
        command.extend(vars_dict)
    result = subprocess.run(
        command,
        text=True,
        shell=True,
        capture_output=True,
        check=False
    )
    return result

Wait, but in the code above, the condition is 'if vars_dict is None', which is incorrect because vars_dict can be an empty dict, which is not None. So, the condition should check if vars_dict is None or empty. Alternatively, perhaps the function should check if vars_dict is not None. Because if vars_dict is None, we shouldn't pass any variables. But in the function signature, the default for vars_dict is not provided, so it's possible that it's None.

Wait, looking back at the function signature, the default for vars_dict is not specified, so it's None. So, in the code, if vars_dict is None, we should use -e. Otherwise, use extra_vars.

So, the condition should be 'if vars_dict is None'.

But in the code above, I have 'if vars_dict is None', which is correct.

Wait, but in the code example I wrote earlier, I had 'if not vars_dict', which is incorrect because it treats an empty dict as a truthy value. So, that's wrong. The correct condition is 'if vars_dict is None'.

So, the code should be:

if vars_dict is None:
    command += ['-e', var_str]
else:
    command.extend(vars_dict)

That's correct.

Another thing: the code uses subprocess.run with check=False, which is correct because we don't care about errors, just want the output.

But perhaps it's better to capture the output and errors, which the code does with capture_output=True.

So, the code seems correct now.

Wait, but in the code, the function is called with cli_args as a list, but in the code, if cli_args is not None, it's added to the command. But if cli_args is empty, it's still added as an empty list, which is fine.

Another thing: the code uses os.path.join, which is correct because ir_workspace is a directory, and __init__.py is the file to join.

So, the code should handle all cases correctly.

I think this should work. Now, I'll write the code as per the requirements.
