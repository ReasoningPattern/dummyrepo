Okay, I need to write a Python function called _eval_file based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function identifies the type of a given file. It returns None if the file doesn't match the given prefix or if it's XML. If the file type is PDF, it returns a dictionary with 'component_id' and 'file_path'. If it's not PDF, it returns a dictionary with 'component_id', 'file_path', 'ftype', and 'file_path' again. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll go with what's written.

First, I need to determine the type of the file. So, the function will open the file and check its extension. But wait, sometimes files can be opened in text mode, which might not give the correct extension. Alternatively, using MIME types could be more reliable. Maybe using the mimetypes module would help here.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Check if the file matches the given prefix. If not, return None.
2. Determine the file type.
3. If the file is XML, return None.
4. If the file is PDF, return a specific dictionary.
5. If it's another type, return a dictionary with additional information.

Wait, the docstring says to return None if it's XML. So, I need to handle that case. Also, I should structure the function to first check the prefix, then the type, and then return the appropriate data.

Let me outline the function structure:

- Function starts by checking if the file matches the prefix. How? Maybe by comparing the file's basename or using Path operations. I'll need to import Path from pathlib for that.
- Once the file is confirmed, determine its type.
- If it's XML, return None.
- If it's PDF, return {'component_id': ..., 'file_path': ...}.
- Otherwise, return a dict with 'component_id', 'file_path', 'ftype', and 'file_path' again. Wait, that seems redundant. Maybe it's a mistake, but I'll proceed as per the docstring.

Now, considering unit tests. The user mentioned using a test-driven approach. So, I should think of various test cases:

1. Test with a non-PDF, non-XML file (e.g., .txt).
2. Test with an XML file.
3. Test with a PDF file.
4. Test with a file that doesn't match the prefix.

I'll need to write these tests to cover each case. Using pytest would be ideal, but since the user is asking for code, I'll focus on the function.

Potential issues to consider:

- Handling different file systems (e.g., relative vs. absolute paths).
- Correctly identifying file types, especially distinguishing between similar extensions.
- Ensuring that the file is read correctly, perhaps using 'with open' in text mode, but that might not always work. Using MIME types is more reliable.

I should also think about error handling. What if the file can't be opened? The function should probably handle exceptions and return None or handle it gracefully.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function step by step:

1. Import necessary modules: Path from pathlib, MIMETypes, and exceptions.
2. Define the function with the given signature.
3. Use Path to check if the file exists and matches the prefix.
4. Use mimetypes.guess_type to determine the file type.
5. Check if the type is XML; if so, return None.
6. If it's PDF, return the appropriate dictionary.
7. Otherwise, return the dictionary with the required keys.

I'll also write test cases to ensure each scenario is covered. For example, test that a PDF file returns the correct dictionary, an XML file returns None, and a txt file returns the expected keys.

Finally, I'll structure the code, making sure to include comments for clarity and handle edge cases, such as unknown MIME types.
