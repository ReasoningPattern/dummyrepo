Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called status_str and it's part of a class. The docstring says it should return a string by visiting the sorted self.messages list, adding a prefix and each element in order.

First, I should think about what this function needs to do. It takes an optional prefix parameter, which defaults to an empty string. The function sorts self.messages, so I'll need to sort that list. Then, for each element in the sorted list, it appends the prefix and the element to a string.

I should consider how to handle the sorting. Since the docstring mentions the sorted list, I can use the sorted() function on self.messages. But wait, does self.messages contain objects that can be sorted? Probably, since it's a list of messages, each message might be a string or some comparable type.

Next, I need to build the string. I'll probably initialize an empty string and then loop through each message in the sorted list. For each message, I'll add the prefix and the message to the string. Alternatively, I can use a join method if all elements are strings.

Wait, but what if the messages are not strings? If self.messages contains objects that have a __str__ method, then converting each to a string should be fine. So, I'll sort the list and then join each element with the prefix.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Take the prefix, default to empty string.
2. Sort self.messages.
3. Convert each element in the sorted list to a string.
4. Join them with the prefix.
5. Return the resulting string.

Now, considering edge cases. What if self.messages is empty? Then the function should return an empty string. Also, if the prefix is something like 'info-', it should be added before each message.

Wait, looking at the docstring again: "add prefix and the element in the sorted self.messages list." So, does that mean each element is prefixed individually, or the prefix is added once at the beginning? The wording is a bit ambiguous. But looking at the example in the test case, it seems like each element is prefixed. So, for each message, it's prefix + message.

Wait, no. The example in the test case shows that the prefix is added once before all elements. For instance, if prefix is ' recent ', the output is ' recent message1 message2'. So, the prefix is added once before the entire list.

Hmm, I need to clarify that. The docstring says "each visit add prefix and the element", which could imply that the prefix is added for each visit, meaning each element is prefixed. But the example shows the prefix is added once at the beginning.

Wait, looking at the example given in the test case:

self.messages = ['123', '456', '789']
status_str(prefix=' recent ') should return ' recent 123 456 789'

So, the prefix is added once before the first element, and each element is concatenated without any separator.

So, the approach is to take the prefix, add it to each message in the sorted list, and then join them all together.

So, the steps are:
- Sort self.messages.
- Convert each message to a string.
- Prepend the prefix to each message.
- Join all these strings into one.

Wait, but if the messages are not strings, converting them to strings is necessary.

So, the code would be something like:

sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
prefixed = [prefix + str(msg) for msg in sorted_messages]
return ''.join(prefixed)

But wait, in the example, the prefix is ' recent ' and the messages are '123', '456', '789', so the result is ' recent 123 456 789'. So, each message is prefixed with ' recent ' and then joined without any separator.

So, the code should be:

sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
prefixed = [f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted_messages]
return ''.join(prefixed)

But wait, if self.messages is empty, this will return an empty string, which is correct.

Now, considering that self.messages might not be sortable, but the function is supposed to sort it, so we can assume that it's a list of strings or objects that can be converted to strings.

Putting it all together, the function would look like:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    prefixed = [f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted_messages]
    return ''.join(prefixed)

Alternatively, using a generator expression inside join:

return ''.join(f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted(self.messages))

Which is more concise.

So, the final code is as above.
