Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's a method of a class. The docstring says it removes the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns a tuple of the key and value.

First, I should think about what kind of data structure would allow accessing elements in the order they were inserted. A dictionary in Python maintains insertion order since version 3.7, so I can use that. The function is part of a class, so it's a method. Let's say the class is called, maybe, OrderedDict or just a regular dict. But since the user didn't specify, I'll assume it's a regular dictionary.

Wait, but in Python, the standard dict doesn't maintain insertion order. Oh, right, so maybe the class is a subclass of dict or perhaps it's an OrderedDict. But the user didn't mention that, so I'll proceed with OrderedDict to ensure insertion order.

So, the function popitem should remove the first key (the one that was inserted first) and return its key and value. But wait, in a dictionary, each key is unique, so if I have multiple items, I need to find the first key that was inserted. But in a regular dict, you can't get the first key directly because it doesn't maintain order. So using OrderedDict makes sense here.

So, the class should be a subclass of OrderedDict. Let's name it, maybe, InsertOrderDict. Then, the popitem method will pop the first key.

Wait, but the default OrderedDict's popitem removes the last key inserted, not the first. So I need to override the popitem method. Alternatively, I can implement my own version of popitem that pops the first key.

So, the class will be a subclass of OrderedDict. The popitem method will check if the dictionary is not empty, then pop the first key using popitem with last=False. Wait, no, in OrderedDict, the popitem method without arguments pops the last inserted item. So to get the first, I need to pass last=False, right?

Wait, let me think. In OrderedDict, when you call popitem(), it pops the last key. So to get the first key, I need to call popitem(last=False). But wait, the default is last=True, so by default, it pops the last key. So to pop the first, I need to pass last=False.

Wait, no. Let me check: in OrderedDict, the popitem() method without arguments pops the last inserted item. So to get the first, I should call popitem(last=False). So in the method, I'll do something like:

if not self:
    raise KeyError("popitem(): empty dict")

key = self.popitem(last=False)
return (key, self[key])

Wait, but if I pop the key using popitem, then the value is already removed. So I need to capture the key before popping, or after. Hmm, no, because if I pop the key, the value is gone. So I should get the key first, then pop it.

Alternatively, I can get the key using self.keys().pop(0), then pop it. Let me think about which approach is better.

Using self.popitem(last=False) pops the key and removes it from the dictionary, so the value is no longer available. So after popping, I can't get the value anymore. Therefore, I should get the key first, then pop it.

So the steps are:

1. Check if the dictionary is empty. If yes, raise KeyError.

2. Get the first key (using self.keys().pop(0)).

3. Pop the key from the dictionary.

4. Return the tuple (key, value).

So the code inside the method would be:

key = next(iter(self))  # This gets the first key

value = self.pop(key)

return (key, value)

Wait, but next(iter(self)) is O(n), which is not efficient for large dictionaries. Alternatively, using keys().pop(0) is also O(n), but perhaps using popitem with last=False is more efficient because it's implemented in C.

Alternatively, maybe using self.items().keys() or something else, but I think using popitem is the way to go.

Wait, another approach: in OrderedDict, the order is preserved. So if I call self.popitem(last=False), it will pop the first key. But then, the value is removed, so I can't get it anymore. So I need to get the key before popping.

So perhaps:

key = self.popitem(last=False)[0]

But wait, popitem returns a tuple (key, value), so I can extract the key. But if I do that, then the value is still in the tuple, but the key is popped. So that might work.

Wait, let me test this logic. Suppose I have an OrderedDict with items {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c':3}.

If I call popitem(last=False), it will pop 'a' and return ('a', 1). So the dictionary now has 'b' and 'c'. So if I do key, value = self.popitem(last=False), then key is 'a' and value is 1, but then the key 'a' is removed from the dictionary. So the next time I access it, it's gone. But in the function, we want to return the key and value, so that's fine.

But in the function, after popping, the key is no longer in the dictionary, but we've already returned it. So that's okay.

So the code could be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): empty dict")
    key, value = self.popitem(last=False)
    return (key, value)

Wait, but wait: when you call popitem(last=False), it pops and returns the first key. So in this case, the key is popped and removed, so the dictionary is modified. But the function is supposed to return the key and value, which it does, and then the key is removed. But if this method is called multiple times, each call will remove the next first key. That seems correct.

Alternatively, using self.keys().pop(0) to get the first key, then pop it.

But using self.popitem(last=False) is more efficient because it's implemented in C.

So the code would be as above.

Wait, but in the function, after popping, the key is gone. So if someone calls popitem again, it will have one less key. But that's correct because each popitem removes the first key.

Wait, but in the test case, if the dictionary is empty, it raises KeyError. Otherwise, it pops the first key and returns it along with its value.

So the code seems correct.

Now, considering that the class is a subclass of OrderedDict. So the code would be:

class InsertOrderDict(OrderDict):
    def popitem(self):
        if not self:
            raise KeyError("popitem(): empty dict")
        key, value = self.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)

Wait, but wait: in OrderedDict, the popitem method without arguments pops the last key. So to pop the first, we need to pass last=False. So the code is correct.

But wait, in the function, after popping, the key is removed from the dictionary. So if someone calls popitem again, the next first key is the new first key.

Yes, that's correct.

So the final code is as above.

But wait, the user didn't specify the class name. They just said it's a Python software engineer to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the class is called something else, or maybe it's part of the OrderedDict.

Alternatively, perhaps the class is just a regular dict, but that wouldn't maintain insertion order. So it's safer to assume it's an OrderedDict subclass.

But the user didn't specify, so perhaps the code should be written as a method of a class that's a subclass of dict, but to maintain insertion order, it's better to subclass OrderedDict.

So the code would be:

class MyDict(dict):
    def popitem(self):
        if not self:
            raise KeyError("popitem(): empty dict")
        key, value = self.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)

Wait, but in this case, the popitem method is called without arguments, which pops the last key. So that's not correct. So the code is wrong.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

In OrderedDict, the popitem() method without arguments pops the last key. So to pop the first key, I need to call popitem(last=False). But wait, no, because in OrderedDict, when you call popitem(last=False), it pops the first key. Let me check the documentation.

Yes, according to the OrderedDict documentation, the popitem() method without arguments removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair. To remove and return the first inserted key-value pair, you need to call popitem(last=False).

Wait, no, wait. Let me check:

In Python's OrderedDict, the popitem() method has two optional parameters: last=True. So by default, it pops the last inserted item. If you set last=False, it pops the first inserted item.

Yes, that's correct. So in the code, to get the first key, we call popitem(last=False).

So in the function, after checking the dictionary isn't empty, we call self.popitem(last=False), which returns a tuple of (key, value). Then, we return that tuple.

So the code is correct as written.

Wait, but in the code I wrote earlier, I used self.popitem(last=False), which is correct.

So the code should be:

class MyDict(dict):
    def popitem(self):
        if not self:
            raise KeyError("popitem(): empty dict")
        key, value = self.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)

Wait, but wait: when you call popitem(last=False), it removes the key from the dictionary. So the next time popitem is called, it will remove the next first key. That's correct.

But in the function, after popping, the key is removed. So if someone calls popitem again, it will have one less key. But that's as intended.

So the code is correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to get the first key using self.keys().pop(0), then pop it.

But using popitem is more efficient because it's implemented in C.

So the code is correct.

Wait, but in the code, after popping, the key is gone. So the function returns the key and value, but the key is no longer in the dictionary. That's correct because the function is supposed to remove it.

So the code is correct.

Therefore, the final code is as above.
