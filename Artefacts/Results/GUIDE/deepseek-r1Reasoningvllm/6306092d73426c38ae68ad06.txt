Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_silent_args and it's part of a class, probably a logging or similar module. The docstring says that this function returns a list of silenced argument names. 

First, I should think about what "silenced arguments" mean. In logging, arguments can be filtered to include or exclude certain log levels. So, the function probably identifies which arguments were logged at a level lower than WARNING, meaning they were silenced.

I'll start by outlining what the function needs to do. It should process the arguments, determine their log levels, and collect those that are below WARNING. 

Next, I'll consider the structure of the code. Since it's a method, it should be indented under a class. I'll need to import logging to access log levels.

I should write comprehensive unit tests. The tests should cover different scenarios: when all arguments are logged, when some are silenced, and when no arguments are logged. Also, tests for different log levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and ERROR would be useful.

In the function itself, I'll loop through each argument. For each, I'll get the log level, check if it's below WARNING, and if so, add it to the silenced list. Then, return the list sorted alphabetically for consistency.

I need to make sure the code is clean and well-commented. The docstring is already provided, so I'll focus on adding docstrings for each helper method if needed.

Finally, I'll test the code with the provided tests to ensure it works as expected. This includes checking for edge cases, like when no arguments are logged or when all are silenced.
