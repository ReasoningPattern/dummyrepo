Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called plugins_manager and it's supposed to get the plugin manager service from cls._get_service(). 

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. It should access the service using the provided method. So, I'll probably use the @property decorator because it's a common way to create getter methods in Python.

Wait, but looking at the example code provided, it's using a function instead of a property. Hmm, maybe I should consider both approaches. Using a property would make the code cleaner, but the example uses a function. Oh, but in the example, the function is named plugins_manager and returns the service. So perhaps the intended approach is to return the service directly.

So, the function should call cls._get_service() with the argument 'plugins_manager'. That makes sense because the docstring mentions ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. So the function should return that service.

I should also think about unit tests. The user mentioned using a test-driven approach, so I need to outline what tests would be necessary. For example, checking that the function returns the correct service and that it raises an error if the service isn't found.

Wait, but the code provided in the example doesn't include error handling. Maybe the function should handle cases where the service isn't found. But the docstring doesn't specify that, so perhaps it's beyond the scope for now.

Putting it all together, the function is straightforward. It's a simple getter that returns the service. So the code would be a function named plugins_manager that returns cls._get_service('plugins_manager').

I should also consider if there are any other considerations, like whether the service is available or not. But without more context, I'll assume that _get_service() handles that internally.

So, the final code is a function that returns the plugin manager service as described.
