Okay, so I need to write a Python function called _dump_string that takes an object and a dumper, and returns a YAML stream. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so I should start by thinking about what test cases I should write before coding.

First, I'll consider what the function should do. It should serialize the given object into a YAML format. The dumper parameter is probably for customizing the YAML output, maybe for adding custom tags or handling nested structures differently.

I should think about different types of objects that this function might receive. The simplest case is a basic data type like an integer, string, or float. For example, if obj is 123, the output should be a stream with -123-.

Next, I'll consider a list. If obj is a list containing various types, like integers, strings, and booleans, the function should output each element correctly, using brackets and commas. Also, nested lists should be handled properly, with each level indented.

Then, there's a dictionary. The function should output key-value pairs, with keys in sorted order. Nested dictionaries should also be serialized, so if a value is another dictionary, it should be properly indented and formatted.

Objects with custom tags might be another case. For instance, if the object has a tag attribute, the function should output it in the format tag: value. This would require checking if the object has a 'tag' attribute and including it in the stream.

Another important case is handling special characters like newlines or colons. If the object's string representation contains a newline, the function should ensure it's properly escaped or formatted in YAML, which typically uses backslashes for escaping. Similarly, colons in strings might need to be handled to avoid breaking the YAML structure.

Now, thinking about the structure of the function, I'll need to iterate over the object's attributes, determine the type, and serialize accordingly. For custom tags, I'll check if the object has a 'tag' attribute and output it. For lists and dictionaries, I'll recursively call _dump_string on each element.

I should also handle strings by ensuring that any special characters are properly escaped. YAML uses backslashes for escaping, so I'll need to escape characters like quotes, colons, and newlines appropriately.

Wait, but in the example provided, the output uses quotes around the string. So, for a string like "hello:world", the output should be 'hello:world'. That means that when serializing strings, any colon should be escaped as : to prevent breaking the YAML structure.

Another thing to consider is the dumper parameter. If a dumper is provided, the function should use it to handle custom formatting. For example, if the dumper is supposed to add a prefix or suffix, the function should pass the serialized data through it.

I should structure the function with these cases in mind. Start by checking if the object has a 'tag' attribute. If it does, output it. Then, handle strings by escaping as needed. If it's a list, serialize each item, ensuring proper indentation. If it's a dictionary, sort the keys and serialize each key-value pair, again with proper indentation for nested structures.

I also need to make sure that if the object is not one of these types, it's handled gracefully, perhaps by converting it to a string and then processing it further.

Testing each of these cases is crucial. I'll write unit tests for each scenario to ensure that the function behaves as expected. For example, a test case where obj is an integer, another where it's a list, a dictionary, and so on.

Once all test cases are covered, I can proceed to implement the function, making sure each case is handled correctly. I'll also need to ensure that the function returns a generator that can be iterated over to produce the YAML stream line by line.

In summary, the function will check the type of the object, handle each case with appropriate serialization, escape necessary characters, and use the provided dumper if available. Comprehensive unit tests will cover all these scenarios to ensure correctness.
