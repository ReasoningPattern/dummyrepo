Okay, I need to write a Python function called paging that takes a WAPI response and a max_results value. The function should return a generator that splits the response into pages, each containing up to max_results items. 

First, I'll think about how the generator should work. It should yield each page one by one. So, for example, if the response has 10 items and max_results is 5, the generator should yield two pages: the first with the first 5 items and the second with the next 5.

I should consider edge cases. What if the response is empty? Then the generator should yield nothing. What if max_results is larger than the length of the response? Then it should yield just one page with all the items.

Next, I'll plan the steps inside the generator. I'll need to loop through the response in chunks. I can calculate the number of pages by dividing the total number of items by max_results and rounding up. But maybe it's easier to loop using a step approach.

I can use a loop where each iteration takes a slice of the response. The starting index for each page is i * max_results, and the ending index is (i+1) * max_results. But I have to make sure that when (i+1)*max_results exceeds the length, it just takes till the end.

Wait, but using a while loop might be more straightforward. Initialize a page_index variable at 0. While page_index is less than the length of the response, yield the slice from page_index to page_index + max_results, then increment page_index by max_results each time.

Now, about the function structure. The function is a generator, so it should use yield statements. The docstring is already provided, so I'll make sure to include that.

I should also handle the case where max_results is zero or negative. But according to the problem statement, max_results is an int, so maybe I should assume it's a positive integer. But perhaps the function should handle cases where max_results is zero by returning nothing, or raise an error. However, since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed under the assumption that max_results is a positive integer.

Putting it all together, the function will loop through the response in chunks of max_results and yield each chunk as a page.

Now, writing the code. The function will start by iterating over the response in steps of max_results. For each step, it slices the response from current index to current index plus max_results. Then it yields this slice. The loop continues until all elements are processed.

I should also make sure that the function returns a generator object, which it naturally does because it uses yield.

Testing this function would involve creating a list, say with 10 elements, and passing max_results as 3. The generator should produce pages of 3, 3, 3, and 1 elements respectively.

Wait, no. If it's 10 elements and max_results is 3, the pages would be 3,3,3,1. So the generator should yield four times. Let me test that logic.

Yes, because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 4 pages in total.

I think that's correct. So the code should handle that correctly.

I should also make sure that if the response is empty, it yields nothing, which it does because the loop won't run.

Another test case: response has 5 elements, max_results is 5. It should yield one page with all 5.

If max_results is 1, it should yield each element as a separate page.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
