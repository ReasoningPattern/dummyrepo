Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function `generate_default_observer_schema_dict` based on the given docstring. The function takes a `manifest_dict` and a boolean `first_level` and returns a dictionary. The docstring explains that the function generates values for a new dictionary based on the types of values in `manifest_dict`.

First, I'll think about what the function needs to do. It should create a schema dictionary where each key is a type found in `manifest_dict`, and the value is a structure that represents how to observe or validate that type.

Since the function is supposed to work with different types, I'll need to handle various data types. The tips suggest using a test-driven development approach, so I'll start by outlining what unit tests would cover.

I'll consider the possible types in `manifest_dict`:
- Strings
- Integers
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Maybe other types like booleans or NoneType, but the example doesn't cover them.

For each type, I'll define what the schema key should be and the corresponding structure.

For strings, the schema key could be 'str'. The structure would be a dictionary with 'type' as the string type and 'example' as an example string.

For integers, the schema key is 'int'. The structure includes 'type' and 'example' similar to strings.

For lists, the schema key is 'list'. Each item in the list should be validated against the schema, so the structure is a list of schema dictionaries.

For dictionaries, the schema key is 'dict'. Each key and value in the dictionary should be validated, so the structure is a dictionary where each key's type is checked, and each value's type as well.

I'll structure the function to iterate over each key-value pair in `manifest_dict`. For each value, determine its type, then populate the schema accordingly.

I'll also need to handle nested structures, but since the function is recursive, it should handle that naturally.

Now, I'll outline the code structure. The function will create an empty dictionary, then loop through each item in `manifest_dict`. For each value, check its type and add the appropriate schema entry.

I'll write helper functions to determine the type and generate the schema for each type. For example, `get_type_name` to return the type name as a string, and `generate_schema` to create the structure based on the type.

Testing is crucial. I'll write unit tests to cover different scenarios, including nested structures and various data types. Each test will call the function and assert the expected structure.

Finally, I'll write the code, making sure it's clean and well-commented. I'll include the unit tests to ensure the function behaves as expected.
