Okay, I need to write a Python function called strip_root that takes a path and a root and removes the root from the path. If it fails, it should throw an exception. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so I should think about what test cases I should cover before writing the code.

First, I should consider different scenarios. Let's see, the function is supposed to remove the root from the path. So, for example, if the path is "/home/user/docs" and the root is "/home/user", then stripping the root should give "/docs". But what if the path doesn't start with the root? Then it should just return the path as is. Also, if the root is an empty string, that might cause issues, so I need to handle that.

I should write unit tests for these cases. Let's outline the test cases:

1. Test case where the path starts with the root. For example, path is "/a/b/c" and root is "/a", the result should be "b/c".
2. Test case where the path doesn't start with the root. Like path is "b/c" and root is "/a", it should return "b/c".
3. Test case where the root is an empty string. If root is "", then the function should just return the path.
4. Test case where the path is exactly the root. For example, path is "/a" and root is "/a", then the result should be an empty string.
5. Test case where the root is part of the path but not at the beginning. Like path is "/a/b/c", root is "/b", then stripping should give "/a/c". Wait, no, actually, if the root is "/b", then the path starts with "/a", which doesn't match the root. So stripping wouldn't affect it, so the result would still be "/a/b/c". Hmm, maybe that's not a good test case. Alternatively, maybe the root could be a substring somewhere in the path, but that's more complex. Maybe it's better to only handle cases where the root is a prefix of the path.

Wait, looking back at the function's docstring, it says to remove the root from the path. So I think the function should remove the root if it's a prefix. So the test cases should reflect that.

So for the test case where the path is "/a/b/c" and root is "/a", the result is "b/c". If the root is "/a/", then it should be "b/c".

Another test case: path is "a/b/c", root is "/a", the result should remain "a/b/c" because the path doesn't start with the root.

What about edge cases? Like if the root is longer than the path. For example, path is "/a" and root is "/a/b". Then, the function should throw an exception because the root is not a prefix.

Also, if the path is empty, what happens? The function might throw an exception because it can't remove the root.

So, the function should first check if the root is a prefix of the path. If it is, then strip it. Otherwise, throw an exception.

Wait, but the function's docstring says to remove the root if it fails, throw an exception. So maybe the function should check if the root is a prefix, and if not, throw an exception. Or perhaps, if the root is not present anywhere in the path, it should throw an exception.

Wait, the function is called strip_root, so it's supposed to remove the root from the path. So perhaps it's more accurate to say that the function should check if the path starts with the root, and if so, remove it. If not, throw an exception.

Alternatively, maybe the function should check if the root is a substring of the path, but that could be more complex because it could be anywhere. But the examples I thought of earlier suggest that the root is a prefix.

So, perhaps the function should only remove the root if it is the prefix of the path. Otherwise, throw an exception.

So, the steps for the function would be:

1. Check if the root is an empty string. If so, return the path as is.
2. Check if the root is a prefix of the path.
   a. If yes, remove the root and return the remaining part.
   b. If no, throw an exception.
3. Handle cases where the root is longer than the path. For example, if the path is "/a" and the root is "/a/b", then it's not a prefix, so throw an exception.

Wait, but in the case where the path is "/a/b/c" and the root is "/a", the function should return "b/c". So, the function is supposed to remove the root as a prefix.

So, the function can be implemented by checking if the path starts with the root. If it does, then return the path[len(root):]. Else, raise an exception.

But wait, what about cases where the root is not at the beginning but somewhere else? For example, path is "/a/b/c", root is "a/". Then, the path starts with "a/", so the function would return "/b/c".

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

First, handle the case where root is an empty string. According to the problem statement, if the root is empty, the function should return the path as is. So, if root is "", return path.

Then, check if the path starts with the root. In Python, we can use the string method startswith(). So, if path.startswith(root), then return path[len(root):].

But wait, what if the root is longer than the path? For example, path is "/a", root is "/a/". Then, path.startswith(root) is False, so it would throw an exception.

But in the case where the root is longer than the path, the function should throw an exception because the root is not a prefix.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the function should remove the root if it fails. So perhaps the function should only remove the root if it is present as a prefix. Otherwise, it's a failure, and it should throw an exception.

So, the function can be implemented as:

if root is empty, return path
else if path starts with root, return path after removing root
else, throw exception

But wait, what about the case where the root is empty? According to the function's docstring, if it fails, it should throw an exception. But in the case where root is empty, the function can return the path as is, which is correct.

So, the function can be written as:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if root == "":
        return path
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root is not a prefix of the path")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what about cases where the root is at the end of the path? Like path is "a/b", root is "a". Then, the function would return "b", which is correct.

Another test case: path is "a/b", root is "a/". Then, the function would return "b".

But what if the path is exactly the root? For example, path is "/a", root is "/a". Then, the function returns an empty string, which is correct.

Another edge case: path is empty string. What should happen? According to the function, if root is empty, return path. So, if path is empty and root is empty, it returns empty. But if path is empty and root is not empty, then it would throw an exception because empty string doesn't start with a non-empty string.

Wait, but in the case where path is empty and root is empty, the function returns empty, which is fine. But if path is empty and root is not empty, then it's an error.

So, the function seems to handle all these cases.

Now, for the test cases:

1. Test case where root is empty:
   - Input: path = "test", root = ""
   - Expected output: "test"

2. Test case where path starts with root:
   - Input: path = "/a/b/c", root = "/a"
   - Expected output: "b/c"

3. Test case where path doesn't start with root:
   - Input: path = "b/c", root = "/a"
   - Expected output: ValueError

4. Test case where root is longer than path:
   - Input: path = "/a", root = "/a/b"
   - Expected output: ValueError

5. Test case where root is at the end:
   - Input: path = "a/b", root = "a"
   - Expected output: "b"

6. Test case where root is a substring but not a prefix:
   - Input: path = "/a/b/c", root = "/b"
   - Expected output: ValueError

So, the function should handle all these cases.

Now, considering the code, I should also handle cases where the root is None. Wait, but according to the function signature, the root is a string. So, if root is None, then in the code, it would throw an AttributeError when calling len(root). So, I should handle that case.

Wait, in the function, the first condition is if root == "", which would handle root being an empty string. But if root is None, then the condition would raise an error because None is not equal to empty string. So, I need to handle the case where root is None.

Wait, looking back at the function signature, the root is a string. So, perhaps the function expects that root is a string. So, if someone passes None, it's an error. But perhaps the function should handle that case.

So, perhaps the first condition should check if root is None, and raise a ValueError.

Alternatively, the function could assume that root is a string, as per the function signature. So, perhaps it's better to proceed without handling None, and let it throw an error if root is None.

But to make the function robust, perhaps it's better to handle that.

So, the function can be modified as:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if root == "":
        return path
    if root is None:
        raise ValueError("Root cannot be None")
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root is not a prefix of the path")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if root is None? For example, if someone passes root=None, then the function will throw an error because it's not equal to empty string. So, perhaps the function should handle that case.

Alternatively, the function can check if root is None and raise an exception before checking if it's empty.

So, perhaps the code should be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if root is None:
        raise ValueError("Root cannot be None")
    if root == "":
        return path
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root is not a prefix of the path")
    return path[len(root):]

But according to the function signature, root is a string, so perhaps it's better to assume that it's a string. So, perhaps the function doesn't need to handle None.

But to be safe, perhaps it's better to include that check.

Now, considering all these, the code should be written accordingly.

Testing the code:

Let's test the test cases I thought of.

Test case 1: root is empty string.
strip_root("test", "") → "test"

Test case 2: path starts with root.
strip_root("/a/b/c", "/a") → "b/c"

Test case 3: path doesn't start with root.
strip_root("b/c", "/a") → ValueError

Test case 4: root is longer than path.
strip_root("/a", "/a/b") → ValueError

Test case 5: root is a substring but not a prefix.
strip_root("/a/b/c", "/b") → ValueError

Test case 6: root is at the end.
strip_root("a/b", "a") → "b"

All these should work.

Another test case: path is empty and root is empty.
strip_root("", "") → "".

Another test case: path is empty and root is not empty.
strip_root("", "/a") → ValueError.

Another test case: path is "/a", root is "/a".
strip_root("/a", "/a") → "".

Another test case: path is "/a/b", root is "/a/".
strip_root("/a/b", "/a/") → "b"

Another test case: path is "a", root is "a".
strip_root("a", "a") → "".

So, the function seems to handle all these cases.

Now, the code:

Implementing all these steps, the function should be as follows.
