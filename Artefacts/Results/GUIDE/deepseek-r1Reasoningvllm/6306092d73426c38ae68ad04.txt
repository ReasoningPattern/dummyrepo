Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_parser_option_specs and it takes a command_name as a parameter, returning a list of options. The user also provided some tips about using test-driven development, so I should consider writing unit tests first before writing the actual code.

First, I'll think about what this function does. It's supposed to get all the options for a specified command. In Python, options can be retrieved from the sys.argv list, but more efficiently, using the getopt module or argparse. Since the function is part of a class, maybe it's related to command-line argument parsing, perhaps using argparse internally.

I remember that when using argparse, each option has a short and long name, a type, and sometimes default values. So, the function might need to extract this information for a given command.

But wait, the function is in a class method. So perhaps it's part of a custom argparse-like parser. Maybe the class has methods to parse arguments, and get_parser_option_specs is a helper to get the options for a specific command.

To proceed, I should consider writing unit tests first. The tests should cover various cases, like when the command has no options, when it has short options, long options, etc. Each test case will call get_parser_option_specs with a specific command_name and check if the returned options match expectations.

For example, one test could be for a command with no options, expecting an empty list. Another test could check for a command with a short option, ensuring that the returned options include both the short and any default long options.

Once the tests are written, I can proceed to implement the function. The function will likely need to parse the command line arguments and extract the options for the specified command. It might involve iterating over the parsed arguments and collecting information about each option.

I should also consider edge cases, such as options without values (like --version) or optional arguments. The function should handle these gracefully, perhaps by returning None for optional arguments or handling them appropriately.

After writing the code, I'll need to run the tests to ensure everything works as expected. If any test fails, I'll debug the function, adjust it as necessary, and rerun the tests until they all pass.

In summary, my approach will be:

1. Write comprehensive unit tests covering various scenarios of command-line options.
2. Implement the get_parser_option_specs function based on the tests.
3. Test the function against all the written test cases to ensure correctness.
4. Iterate on the function and tests as needed until all tests pass.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the code accordingly.
