Okay, so I need to generate Python code for a cachedmethod decorator based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should start by thinking about what unit tests would cover this function.

First, the cachedmethod is a decorator that returns a decorator. It's used to cache the results of a function so that repeated calls with the same arguments return the cached result instead of recalculating. That makes sense.

I should consider what parameters the cachedmethod takes. It has a cache parameter, which I assume is where the results are stored. The key parameter defaults to hashkey, which probably generates a unique key for each set of arguments. The lock parameter is for a threading lock, probably to protect the cache if multiple threads are involved.

I need to think about how to structure the decorator. The outer function takes cache, key, and lock, and returns a decorator. The decorator itself takes a function and returns a new function that, when called, checks the cache, computes the result if necessary, stores it, and then returns it.

For the key function, since it's a default argument, I can't change it unless I set it explicitly. But in the example, I set it to lambda *args, **kwargs: args_tuple, which seems reasonable for hashing the arguments.

The lock is optional, so I need to handle cases where it's None. If it's None, maybe no locking is needed, but in practice, if the cache is shared, a lock would prevent race conditions.

Now, for the tests. I should test the decorator itself to ensure it works as expected. I'll create a test case where the function is decorated, and then call it to see if the result is cached.

I should also test the case where the cache is None, but I'm not sure if that's allowed. Maybe the cache should be a dictionary, so I'll test with a mock dictionary.

Another test could be checking that the key function correctly generates unique keys for different inputs. I'll pass different tuples to the key function and ensure they hash to different values.

I also need to handle the lock properly. If the lock is provided, the code should acquire it before accessing the cache and release it after. But in the example, if lock is None, it doesn't try to lock, which might be okay if the cache is per-thread or if locking isn't necessary.

Wait, in the example code, the lock is used in the with_lock context manager. So if lock is None, the context manager doesn't lock. That makes sense because if the lock is None, it's up to the caller to manage locking or not.

I should also consider edge cases, like if the function is called with the same arguments multiple times. The cache should return the cached result immediately without recomputing.

In the test, I'll create a mock function, decorate it, call it a few times, then check if the cache was hit each time.

Another test is to ensure that the decorated function's __name__ is correctly set, which is important for introspection tools.

I think I've covered the main points. Now, I'll structure the code with these considerations in mind, including the tests to validate each part.
