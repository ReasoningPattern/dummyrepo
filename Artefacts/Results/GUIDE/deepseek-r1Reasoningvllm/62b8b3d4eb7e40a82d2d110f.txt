Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _should_attempt_c_optimizations and it returns a boolean indicating whether to use C optimizations. 

First, I should think about what this function needs to do. The docstring says it returns True if we use C optimizations. So, the function's logic depends on certain conditions.

I remember that in some projects, functions like this are static methods, so I'll make _should_attempt_c_optimizations a static method. That way, it can access instance variables without needing an instance.

Next, the function should check some internal state. Let's say there's a class variable like _should_attempt_c_optimizations_enabled which is a boolean. If this variable is True, the function should return True. Otherwise, it returns False.

I should also consider how to structure the code. Since it's a static method, I'll use self.__class__.should_attempt_c_optimizations or something similar, but in Python, it's more common to just call the class method directly. Wait, no, static methods can be called on the class or an instance. So, in the code, I'll write it as a static method.

I should write a unit test for this function to ensure it works as expected. The test should cover cases where the enabled state is True and False. Using pytest makes sense, so I'll include a test function with pytest.mark tests.

Putting it all together, the code will have a class with the static method, and a test function that checks both scenarios. The static method will return the class variable, and the tests will assert the correct return values based on the enabled state.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
