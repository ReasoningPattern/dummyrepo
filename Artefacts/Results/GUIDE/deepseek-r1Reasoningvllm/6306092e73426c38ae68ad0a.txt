Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_choices_args and it's supposed to check if the value of the given args is one of the available choices. 

First, I should think about what this function needs to do. It takes args as a parameter, which I assume is a single value, not a list. The function should return True if this value is in a predefined list of valid choices and False otherwise. 

Wait, but sometimes functions might receive multiple arguments. Should I check if any of the arguments is a valid choice? Or is args a single argument? The problem statement says "value of the given args", so I think args is a single argument. So the function should check if args is in the choices list.

Next, I need to generate unit tests for this function. Since it's a validation function, I should test both valid and invalid cases. Also, I should test edge cases like when choices are empty, when args is None, and when there are duplicate choices.

Let me outline the unit tests. I'll create a test class that inherits from TestCase. I'll set up the mock class for the object under test. Then, I'll write test cases for when the argument is valid, invalid, when choices are empty, when args is None, and when there are duplicate choices.

For each test case, I'll assert whether the function returns the expected boolean value. For example, when the argument is valid, it should return True; otherwise, False.

Now, I'll structure the code. I'll import the necessary modules like unittest and mock. Then, I'll define the TestValidateChoicesArgs class and the test method. I'll set up the mock object and the choices list. Then, I'll write each test case with an assertRaises for any exceptions, and assertions to check the return value.

Wait, should the function raise any exceptions? The docstring doesn't mention any, so I'll assume it shouldn't raise any. So in the tests, I'll make sure that when choices are empty, it raises an exception, but looking at the function, if choices is empty, the in operator would return False, so the function would return False without raising. Hmm, but in the test, I should check if it correctly handles empty choices.

I think the function should return False if the choices list is empty, regardless of args. So in the test, I'll check that.

Also, what if the choices list has duplicates? For example, if choices is ['a', 'a'], and args is 'a', it should return True because 'a' is in the list. So the function should treat duplicates as valid, as the in operator does.

Now, putting it all together, I'll write the code with the function and the test cases. I'll make sure to include all the necessary imports and structure the code properly.
