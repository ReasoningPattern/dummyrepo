Okay, I need to write Python code for a function called _c_optimizations_available(). The docstring says it should return the C optimization module if available, otherwise False. 

First, I should think about how to test this function. The tips suggest using test-driven development, so I'll start by writing unit tests. I'll need to mock the module loading to see if the function can find it. 

I'll create a test case where the module exists and another where it doesn't. Using unittest.mock should help with loading the module without actually importing it. 

In the test, I'll check that the function returns the mock module when available and False when it's not. Then, I'll write the actual implementation of the function. Since the function doesn't depend on any external modules, it can return sys.modules[__name__], which gives access to the current module's dictionary. 

Wait, but if someone tries to import sys and then call modules[__name__], it might not work as expected because the module's dictionary is read-only. Hmm, maybe I should use a different approach. Alternatively, since the function is supposed to return the module if available, perhaps it's better to return sys.modules[__name__] if the module is loaded, else False. 

But actually, sys.modules gives a dictionary of module names to their module objects. So, if the module is available, it should return sys.modules[__name__], else False. 

So the function can be written as:

import sys

def _c_optimizations_available():
    return sys.modules.get(__name__, False)

Wait, but sys.modules is a dictionary, and __name__ is the module's name. So if the module is loaded, sys.modules[__name__] would be the module object. If not, it would return None, but the function expects False. So maybe I should check if the module exists by trying to import it. 

Alternatively, using hasattr might not work because the module isn't imported yet. So using sys.modules is a way to check if the module is available. If the module is available, sys.modules will have it, else it won't. So the function can return sys.modules.get(__name__, False). 

Testing this with the mock setup should work. In the test, I'll mock the module loading, then call the function and assert the result. 

So the test case will have two scenarios: one where the module is present and another where it's not. For each, I'll assert the function returns the correct value. 

Putting it all together, I'll write the test code first, then the function. That should cover the requirements.
