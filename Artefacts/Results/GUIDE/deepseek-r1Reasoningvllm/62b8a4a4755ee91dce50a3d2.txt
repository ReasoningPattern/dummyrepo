Okay, I need to write a Python method called _fromutc that converts a given datetime from one timezone to another. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that Python's datetime module handles timezones using pytz or other libraries, but since the problem is about converting between any two timezones, I should use the zoneinfo module, which is more modern and reliable.

So, the method will take a datetime object, dt, which has an associated timezone. The goal is to convert this datetime to a new timezone, tz.

I'll start by creating an instance of ZoneInfo with the original timezone of dt. Then, I'll use the tz_convert method to switch to the new timezone tz. This should give me the converted datetime.

Wait, what if the original timezone is naive? Well, the method should handle both aware and naive datetimes since ZoneInfo can manage both.

I should also make sure that the method correctly returns a datetime object with the new timezone. Testing edge cases like the same timezones, crossing midnight, and daylight saving transitions would be important.

So, putting it all together, the method will look like this: create a ZoneInfo instance from dt's tzinfo, then convert to tz. That should cover the functionality needed.
