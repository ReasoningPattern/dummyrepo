Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called on and it's a method that returns a decorator. The docstring says it's used to add a new handler to a "hook" in a registry in the class.

Hmm, first, I should think about what this means. The on method is part of a class, probably a hook registry. The decorator it returns will add a handler for a specific hook.

I remember that in Python, decorators can be functions that take other functions as arguments. So, the decorator returned by on should accept the hook as an argument and then register it somewhere.

Wait, the decorator is used to add a handler to the registry. So, the decorator should probably take the hook name and the handler, then store them in a dictionary or some structure in the class.

I should consider using a class-level dictionary to hold the registered hooks. That way, each class can have its own registry. So, in the on method, when the decorator is called, it should update this dictionary.

But how do I structure the decorator? It should take the hook as an argument and return a function that registers the handler. Wait, noâ€”the on method returns a decorator, which when applied, registers the handler.

Wait, let me clarify. The on method is a class method, right? So, when called, it returns a decorator function. That decorator function, when applied to a function, adds it to the registry under the given hook.

So, the steps are:

1. Define a class with a class-level dictionary, say _HOOKS.
2. The on method is a class method that takes the hook as an argument.
3. The decorator returned by on takes the function to register and the hook name.
4. The decorator updates the _HOOKS dictionary with the function under the hook.

But wait, in the example, the decorator is called with the hook name as the first argument. So, the on method's decorator function should accept the hook and then the function to register.

Wait, no. The on method is called on the class, and it's a decorator factory. So, when you do MyClass.on(some_hook), it returns a decorator. Then, when you apply that decorator to a function, it registers it under some_hook.

So, the structure would be:

class MyClass:
    _HOOKS = {}

    @classmethod
    def on(cls, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            cls._HOOKS[hook] = func
            return func
        return decorator

Wait, but the on method's docstring says it returns a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class. So, the on method is a class method that returns a decorator, which when applied to a function, adds it to the class's _HOOKS under the given hook.

So, when someone does MyClass.on(some_hook)(my_function), it registers my_function under the key some_hook in MyClass._HOOKS.

But wait, in the code I wrote, the decorator function is inside on, and it takes func as an argument. So, when MyClass.on(some_hook) is called, it returns the decorator, which then is applied to my_function. So, the decorator adds my_function to _HOOKS under some_hook.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, considering unit tests. The user mentioned using a test-driven development approach, so I should think about writing tests before writing the code.

What tests would I write? Well, first, I should test that the on method returns a decorator. Then, applying the decorator to a function should add it to the registry. Also, multiple handlers should be registered correctly, and the registry should be accessible.

So, in tests, I can create a class with an on method, apply the decorator to a function, and check if it's in the _HOOKS dictionary.

Wait, but in the example code, the on method is a class method, so in the test, I need to instantiate the class and call on as a class method.

Alternatively, maybe the on method is an instance method, but that's less likely because it's a registry decorator that's meant to be used on the class level.

Hmm, but in the initial example, the on method is called on the class, so it's a class method. So, in the test, I can create an instance and call on as a class method.

Wait, no. Wait, in the example, the on method is a class method because it's decorated with @classmethod. So, in the test, I can do something like:

class Test:
    _HOOKS = {}

    @classmethod
    def on(cls, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            cls._HOOKS[hook] = func
            return func
        return decorator

Then, test it with:

instance = Test()
instance.on('my_hook')(print)

And then assert that Test._HOOKS has 'my_hook' mapped to print.

But wait, Test is a class, so when we do instance.on, it's looking for a method in the instance, but since on is a class method, it's bound as a class method. Hmm, maybe I should make on an instance method instead, but that's probably not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the on method is an instance method, but in the test, it's called on the class.

Wait, perhaps the on method is an instance method, so when you call MyClass.on(hook), it's looking for an attribute in the instance, but that's not the case. So, perhaps it's better to make on a class method.

Alternatively, maybe the on method is a static method, so it can be called on the class or an instance.

But regardless, the code I wrote earlier should handle that.

Wait, but in the code, the on method is a class method, so when you call MyClass.on(some_hook), it's bound as a class method, and the decorator is applied to the function.

So, in the test, I can do:

class MyClass:
    _HOOKS = {}

    @classmethod
    def on(cls, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            cls._HOOKS[hook] = func
            return func
        return decorator

Then, test with:

MyClass.on('test_hook')(lambda: None)

And assert that MyClass._HOOKS['test_hook'] is the lambda function.

Yes, that should work.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

class MyClass:
    _HOOKS = {}

    @classmethod
    def on(cls, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            cls._HOOKS[hook] = func
            return func
        return decorator

But wait, in the initial problem, the on method is part of the class, and the decorator is returned. So, the code I wrote should satisfy that.

I think that's the correct approach. Now, I should write the code in Python markdown format, as per the user's request.
