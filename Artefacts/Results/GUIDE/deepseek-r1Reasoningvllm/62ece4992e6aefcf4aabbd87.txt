Okay, so I need to generate Python code for a function called build_app_logger. The function signature and docstring are given, so I should start by understanding what it's supposed to do. The function is meant to create a logger object for an application, which can handle logging to a file and also support debug mode for more detailed logs.

First, looking at the parameters: name is the logger name, defaulting to 'app'. The log file is 'app.log', and debug is a boolean that determines if we should log debug messages, which I think means setting the logging level to DEBUG. But wait, maybe debug controls whether the logger is active or not. Hmm, the problem says it's "is need to debug", so perhaps when debug is True, the logger is more verbose.

The function should return an instantiated logger object. In Python, logging objects are usually created using logging.getLogger, but since this function is supposed to build the logger, maybe it's better to return a logger that's already configured.

I remember that in unit testing, it's a good practice to test the code before writing it, but since the user is asking to generate the code, I'll focus on writing the function first.

I'll need to import the logging module. Then, inside the function, I'll create a logger instance. If debug is True, the logging level should be set to DEBUG, otherwise, maybe ERROR or something higher. Wait, but the problem says "is need to debug", so perhaps when debug is True, the logger should include debug messages. So, setting the level to DEBUG when debug is True makes sense.

Next, the logger needs to handle both file and console logging. So, I should configure the logger to handle both. I can create two handlers: a file handler and a console handler. The file handler will use the specified logfile, and the console handler will use standard output.

For the file handler, I'll use RotatingFileHandler, which rotates the log file by deleting old copies. I'll set it to rotate when the file size reaches 1MB and keep up to 5 copies. The encoding should be UTF-8 to handle different characters.

The console handler will use the StreamHandler, which routes logs directly to the console. I should set the formatter for both handlers to ensure consistent logging format.

Setting the formatter once is efficient, so I'll do it outside the conditional check for debug. The formatter can include a datefmt for readability.

After setting up the handlers, I'll apply the formatter to both handlers so that all logs have the same structure.

If debug is True, I should add extra debug information, maybe by enabling additional handlers or log levels. Wait, perhaps when debug is True, the logger should log more detailed messages. So, maybe I should adjust the logging level based on the debug flag.

Putting it all together, the function will create the logger, configure it with the file handler and console handler, set the formatter, and adjust the logging level if debug is enabled.

I should also make sure that the function returns the logger instance so that it can be used later. Testing this function with different debug settings would be useful to ensure it behaves as expected.

Wait, but in the initial code, the logging module is imported inside the function. That's not efficient. I should import it at the top. So, the function will have 'import logging' outside, but since the user wants only the code generated, I'll include the import inside the function for the sake of the example, but in practice, it should be at the top.

Wait, no, in Python, imports should be at the top of the file, not inside a function. So, the function will assume that logging is already imported. Therefore, in the code, I'll include the import statement outside the function, but since the user is asking for the function code, I'll have to include the import inside the function for the code to run correctly. Hmm, no, that's not possible. So, perhaps the function should have 'import logging' at the top, but in the code I provide, I'll include it outside the function.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So, I'll write the function with the necessary code, including the import inside the function, but that's not standard. Alternatively, I'll write the function assuming that logging is already imported.

I think the correct approach is to have the import statement outside the function. So, the code will start with 'import logging', then define the function.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Import logging.
2. Create the logger instance with the given name.
3. If debug is True, set the logger's level to DEBUG.
4. Create a RotatingFileHandler for the log file.
5. Create a StreamHandler for console logging.
6. Set up a formatter with a date and time format.
7. Apply the formatter to both handlers.
8. Return the logger instance.

I should also include unit tests as per the tips. So, I'll write tests that check if the logger is created correctly, logs at different levels, and handles both file and console outputs. The tests will use the 'unittest' module, creating an instance of the build_app_logger function and checking the handlers and log levels.

In the tests, I'll check if the file handler's filename matches the expected log file. I'll also verify that the console handler is correctly capturing messages. I'll test both debug and non-debug scenarios to ensure the logger behaves as expected.

I'll write two test cases: one with debug=True and another with debug=False. Each test will check if the logger is initialized correctly, logs messages appropriately, and handles exceptions gracefully.

So, the code will include the function, the necessary imports, and the unit tests. But since the user asked to output only the code generated, I'll structure the response with the function code and the test code, ensuring that everything is properly formatted and executable.

Wait, but the user's example only includes the function code. So, perhaps the tests are optional, but the tips suggested using TDD, so including tests is beneficial. However, the user's main request is to generate the function code based on the signature and docstring. But following the tips, I should include unit tests as part of the solution.

So, in the final answer, I'll provide the function code and the unit tests, all in Python markdown format, as per the user's instructions.
