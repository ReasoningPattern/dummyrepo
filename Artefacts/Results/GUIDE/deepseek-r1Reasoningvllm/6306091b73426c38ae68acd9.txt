Okay, so I need to write a Python function called workspace_manager based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is supposed to get the workspace manager service using a specific method in the class. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, looking at the function signature, it's a class method called workspace_manager that takes 'cls' as the parameter. The docstring says it gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So, I need to call _get_service on the class instance with the service name.

I remember that in Python, class methods can access the class using 'cls'. So, inside the method, I'll probably call cls._get_service with the appropriate service name.

Wait, the docstring mentions ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER, but I don't see a class variable named ServiceName in the provided code. Hmm, maybe I should import ServiceName from another module or define it. But since the code isn't given, I'll assume that ServiceName is available or needs to be imported. Alternatively, perhaps the code should import ServiceName from a module like typing or another where it's defined.

So, the function should look something like this: return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER). That makes sense because it's calling the _get_service method on the class with the service name.

Now, considering unit testing, the user suggested a test-driven development approach. I should think about what test cases I need. Maybe test when the service is found and when it's not. So, I'll write two test functions: one that sets up the mock service to return the workspace manager and another that expects it to raise an exception if not found.

In the first test, I'll mock ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER to return an instance of WorkspaceManager. Then, call workspace_manager() and assert that it returns the mocked workspace manager.

In the second test, I'll mock the service to raise an exception when called. Then, when I call workspace_manager(), it should raise that exception, which I can assert.

I should structure these tests using the unittest framework. I'll write a test class with these test methods. I'll also need to import the necessary modules like unittest, mock, and the ServiceName from where it's defined, assuming it's from typing.

Wait, in the code, I have to make sure that the mocked service is properly set up. So, in the first test, I'll create a mock for ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER and have it return the workspace manager. In the second test, the mock should raise a specific exception when called.

Putting it all together, I'll write the unit tests before defining the actual workspace_manager function. That way, the tests are comprehensive and ensure that the function behaves as expected under different scenarios.

So, the steps are:

1. Write the unit tests using unittest and mock.
2. In the tests, mock ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER to return the workspace manager or raise an exception.
3. Implement the workspace_manager function to call cls._get_service with the service name.
4. Make sure the function is a class method and uses 'cls' correctly.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to include all necessary imports and assertions.
