Okay, so I need to write a Python function called fix_namespace_prefix_w that replaces "w:st=" with "w-st=". The user mentioned using a test-driven approach, so I should start by creating some unit tests.

First, I'll think about what the function needs to do. It's supposed to find all occurrences of "w:st=" in the input string and change them to "w-st=". But wait, does it replace just that exact string or any variations like "w:st"? The docstring says "w:st=", so I'll focus on that.

I should consider different cases. For example, if the string is exactly "w:st=abc", it should become "w-st=abc". What if there are multiple occurrences? Like "w:st=hello w:st=world", it should replace both.

I should also think about edge cases. What if the string doesn't contain "w:st=" at all? The function should just return it as is. What about case sensitivity? The problem says to replace "w:st=", so I assume it's case-sensitive and won't touch other cases like "W:ST=".

Next, I'll write some test cases. Test 1: Replace a single occurrence. Test 2: Replace multiple occurrences. Test 3: No occurrence. Test 4: Case-sensitive, so "W:st=" should remain. Test 5: Replace part of a longer string, like "w:st=123" becomes "w-st=123".

Now, to implement the function, I can use the string replace method. The replace method in Python replaces all occurrences of a substring. So, content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=") should do the trick.

Wait, but what if the replacement affects other parts? For example, if the string is "w:st=w:st=", replacing it would result in "w-st=w-st=", which is correct. So the replace method should handle that correctly.

Putting it all together, the function is straightforward. It uses the replace method on the input string, replacing "w:st=" with "w-st=" wherever it appears.

I should also make sure that the function handles different data types. If content is not a string, like an integer or None, the function should handle it gracefully. But looking at the function signature, the parameter is named content, which is likely a string, but in Python, it's good to check. So, perhaps adding a check to ensure content is a string. If not, return it as is.

Wait, the function signature shows that it's called with 'content', and the docstring doesn't specify, but in the example, the user provided sample inputs as strings. So maybe the function expects content to be a string. However, to make it robust, perhaps adding a check if content is a string, else return it.

So, the function will first check if content is a string. If not, return it. Else, perform the replace.

Putting it all together, the code would look like:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    if not isinstance(content, str):
        return content
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

I think that's it. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
