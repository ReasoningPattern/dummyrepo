Okay, so the user is asking me to generate Python code based on a given function signature and docstring. They also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, which means I should create unit tests first before writing the actual code. 

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The function is called generate_default_observer_schema and it takes an 'app' parameter. The docstring says it generates a default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in spec.manifest where a custom schema hasn't been specified. 

Hmm, so the function is related to Kubernetes and observer schemas. Observer schemas are used in Ansible to monitor changes in Kubernetes resources. The function needs to look through the app's spec.manifest file and create default observer schemas for any resources that don't already have one specified.

I should start by thinking about the structure of the function. It probably needs to read the spec.manifest file, parse it, and then for each resource, check if it has an observer schema already. If not, generate one.

Wait, but how does the app handle this? Maybe app is a collection of resources, each with a 'name' and 'spec' that includes 'kind' and 'manifest'. So each resource in app could be a dictionary with these keys.

I need to import necessary modules. Since it's dealing with files, I'll need 'os' and 'fileinput' to read the manifest. For parsing YAML, 'yaml' module would be useful. Also, for generating the schema, maybe 'json' to handle JSON structures.

Next, I should outline the steps the function will take:

1. Read the spec.manifest file from the app.
2. Parse the YAML content into a structure, probably a list of resources.
3. For each resource, check if it has an 'observer_schema' already.
4. If not, generate a default schema based on the resource type (like pod, service, etc.).
5. Write the default schema back into the manifest file.

But wait, the function is supposed to generate the schema, not modify the manifest. Or maybe it's supposed to add the schema if not present. I think the function should create the schema and write it into the manifest, but perhaps it's better to just generate it without modifying the input. Hmm, the user didn't specify, but I'll assume generating the schema and perhaps adding it to the app.

Now, for unit testing, I need to create test cases. Let's think about different scenarios:

1. Test case where a resource doesn't have an observer_schema in the manifest. The function should generate one.
2. Test case where a resource already has an observer_schema. The function should leave it as is.
3. Test case with multiple resources, some with and without schemas.
4. Test case with invalid or missing data in the manifest.

Each test case will need to set up the app, call generate_default_observer_schema, and then assert that the schema was generated correctly.

I should structure the tests using pytest. Maybe create a temporary directory to write test manifests, then use pytest fixtures to handle that. Each test function will load the manifest, call the function, then check the output.

Wait, but the function might not modify the original manifest. Or does it? The function's docstring says it generates the schema, so perhaps it returns the schema instead of modifying the app. Hmm, the function is supposed to generate the schema, so maybe it doesn't modify the app. So in the test, I might need to check that the schema is present.

Alternatively, maybe the function appends the schema to the manifest. I'm a bit confused. Let me re-read the function's docstring. It says it generates the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in spec.manifest. So perhaps the function is adding the schema to the app, modifying it.

In that case, the function would process the app, find resources without schemas, generate them, and add them to the app. So in the tests, I can check that the app now contains the generated schemas.

But then, how does the function handle the reading and writing? It would need to parse the app into a structure, process it, then write the modified structure back into the app.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate the schema as a string and return it, without modifying the app. That would make more sense, as functions typically return values rather than modifying inputs. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the default schema as a string, not modify the app.

In that case, the tests would need to check that the function returns the correct schema string for each resource type.

Hmm, I think the function is intended to return the generated schema, so it shouldn't modify the app. Therefore, in the tests, I'll need to create a sample app, call the function, and assert that the returned schema is correct.

So, let's outline the function:

- Import necessary modules.
- Define the function.
- Read the spec.manifest from the app.
- Parse it into a list of resources.
- For each resource, if 'observer_schema' is not present, generate one.
- Generate the schema based on the resource's kind. For example, if it's a pod, the schema would specify type 'Pod', and so on.
- Return the generated schema.

For generating the schema, I'll need to structure it as a dictionary. The observer_schema typically has 'type' and 'content' keys. The content can be another dictionary with 'class' and 'properties', and 'annotations' if needed.

Wait, but the observer_schema format in Ansible is a bit different. It usually includes a 'type' and 'content' which contains 'class' and 'properties'. So for a default pod observer, the content would have a 'class' like 'Pod' and properties like 'name', 'namespace', etc.

So, the function will loop through each resource in the manifest. For each, if observer_schema is not present, create a new one with type based on the kind, and content with class and properties.

Now, for the test cases, I'll need to cover different resource kinds, check if schemas are generated correctly, handle cases where schemas are already present, and maybe test for invalid data.

I'll structure the tests to create a base manifest, then modify it for each test case, call the function, and assert the expected schema is present.

I think I've got a rough plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the code, including imports, function, and tests.
