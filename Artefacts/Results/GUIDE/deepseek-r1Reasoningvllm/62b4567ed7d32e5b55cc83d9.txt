Okay, so I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that takes a list of nodes and merges any duplicate keys, returning the last value for each key. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what MappingNode is, but I'll assume it's a node that holds a value which might be another node or a primitive type.

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. For each node in the input list, if a key already exists in the result, I need to check if the current node's value is a MappingNode. If it is, I should merge the nodes deeply. Otherwise, just overwrite the existing value.

Wait, how do I check if something is a MappingNode? Maybe I can use isinstance and compare against a specific class, like if the node is an instance of a class called MappingNode. But since that's not provided, I'll assume that the nodes can be either a single value or another node.

So, the function will iterate through each node. For each node, extract the key. Then, check if the key is already in the result dictionary.

If the key is not present, add it directly. If it is present, check the type of the current value. If the current value is a MappingNode, then we need to merge the new node into it. Otherwise, just assign the new value to the key.

Wait, but how do I merge two MappingNodes? I think I need a helper function that can deep merge two nodes. So, I'll create a helper function called deep_merge that takes two nodes and returns the merged result.

In the helper function, if both nodes are MappingNodes, I'll create a new MappingNode and recursively merge their child nodes. If one is a MappingNode and the other isn't, I'll merge the MappingNode with the other value. If neither is a MappingNode, I'll return the new value.

Putting it all together, the main function will loop through each node, and for each key, either add it if not present or merge if it's already there.

I should also consider edge cases, like when nodes have nested MappingNodes. The deep_merge function should handle that by recursing into each child.

Now, let me outline the steps:

1. Define the deep_merge helper function.
2. Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the merged nodes.
3. Iterate over each node in the input list.
4. For each node, get the key (assuming the node has a key attribute).
5. If the key is not in the result, add it with the current node's value.
6. If the key is already present, check if the current value is a MappingNode.
   a. If it is, merge the new node into the existing one using deep_merge.
   b. If not, replace the existing value with the new one.
7. Return the result dictionary.

Wait, but what if the nodes have different structures? For example, one node is a MappingNode with a key that's another node, and another has a different structure. The helper function needs to handle that by checking each node's type.

I think the helper function should check if both nodes are MappingNodes. If so, create a new MappingNode and recursively merge each child. If only one is a MappingNode, create a new MappingNode and merge the existing one into it. If neither is a MappingNode, just return the new value.

Testing this with some examples would help. For instance, if node1 is a MappingNode with key 'a' pointing to another MappingNode with key 'b' and value 1, and node2 is a MappingNode with key 'a' pointing to a non-MappingNode value 2, the result should have key 'a' pointing to the MappingNode with key 'b' and value 2.

Another example: node3 is a MappingNode with key 'a' and value 3, and node4 is a MappingNode with key 'a' and value 4. Since node4's value is not a MappingNode, it should replace node3's value.

I think this approach should handle these cases correctly.

Now, writing the code. First, the helper function. Then, the main function. Also, I should make sure that the helper function can handle cases where nodes are nested multiple levels deep.

Wait, what about if the value is not a MappingNode but a list or another iterable? The problem statement says "non-MappingNode values", so perhaps the helper function should only handle MappingNode types.

So, in the helper function, I'll check if both nodes are instances of MappingNode. If yes, merge them. Otherwise, if one is a MappingNode, merge it into the other. If neither, return the new value.

I think that's the plan. Now, time to write the code.
