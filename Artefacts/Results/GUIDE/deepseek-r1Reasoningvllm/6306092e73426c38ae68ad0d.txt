Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called create_complex_argument_type and it's supposed to return a function from COMPLEX_TYPES. 

First, I'll look at the parameters: subcommand, type_name, option_name, and spec_option. The docstring says it returns a function that, when called with certain arguments, retrieves something from COMPLEX_TYPES using type_name and option_name.

I remember that in Python, to create functions that return other functions, we can use nested functions. So, I'll define a function inside create_complex_argument_type that takes the arguments self, vars, defaults, plugin_path, subcommand, and spec_option.

Inside this nested function, I'll use the complex_action function. The arguments passed to complex_action are option_name, (self.vars, self.defaults, self.plugin_path), subcommand, and spec_option. Then, I'll retrieve the function from COMPLEX_TYPES using type_name and option_name as keys.

I should also make sure to handle any potential exceptions, but since the user didn't specify error handling, I'll assume it's not required for this basic implementation.

Putting it all together, the nested function will call complex_action with the provided arguments and return the corresponding function from COMPLEX_TYPES. I'll name this nested function create_complex_argumet_type and have it return the fetched function.

I think that's all. I'll write the code accordingly, making sure the indentation and parameter order are correct.
