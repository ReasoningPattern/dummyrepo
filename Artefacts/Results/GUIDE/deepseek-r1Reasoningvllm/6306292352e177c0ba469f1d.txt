Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called find_tags, and it takes a text string and an optional replacer callable. It returns a tuple with a set of tags and the modified text.

First, I should understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it finds tags in text and tries to ignore those inside code blocks. If a replacer is provided, it replaces the tag words with the result of the replacer function.

So, the main tasks are:
1. Identify tags in the text.
2. Ignore tags within code blocks.
3. Replace tags using the replacer if provided.

I think I'll need to parse the text to find tags. But how are the tags defined? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that any word can be a tag. But to ignore code blocks, I might need to identify code-related keywords, which could be tricky. Maybe a better approach is to look for common code blocks like triple quotes, backticks, or specific keywords.

Wait, the user mentioned code blocks, so perhaps the function should skip over any text inside code blocks when looking for tags. For example, if the text has something like `print("hello")`, the word 'print' inside the backticks shouldn't be considered a tag.

But how do I detect code blocks? One common way is to look for triple quotes or backticks. So, I'll need to parse the text, find code blocks, and then process the tags outside of them.

Alternatively, maybe the function should split the text into segments, some of which are code blocks where tags are ignored, and others where tags are processed.

Another consideration is the order of processing. If the text has multiple tags, the function should collect all of them except those inside code blocks.

Now, about the replacer. If a replacer is provided, each tag word found should be replaced with the result of replacer(tag_word). If no replacer is provided, the original text is returned.

So, the steps I need to implement are:
1. Split the text into tokens, possibly identifying code blocks.
2. For each token, determine if it's inside a code block. If yes, skip processing.
3. For tokens outside code blocks, collect the tag words.
4. If a replacer is provided, replace each tag word with the result of the replacer.
5. Reassemble the text, replacing the tags with the original or replaced versions.

But wait, how do I split the text into tokens while considering code blocks? Maybe it's easier to parse the text and identify code blocks, then process the text outside of them.

I can write a parser that goes through the text character by character, tracking whether we're inside a code block. When we're inside, we skip tag detection. When we're outside, we collect tags.

Alternatively, perhaps using regular expressions to find code blocks and split the text accordingly. But regex can get complicated, especially for nested structures.

Another approach is to iterate through the text, tracking the current state: inside or outside a code block. When a code block starts, we note the position and then ignore tags until the block ends.

But writing such a parser might be time-consuming. Maybe a simpler approach is to use a regex to find all code blocks and then process the remaining text.

Wait, perhaps using the split method with a regex that captures both the code blocks and the text outside. For example, using re.split to get all the non-code parts and the code parts as separate groups.

So, I can split the text into parts where each part is either a code block (which we ignore) or a normal text part (where we look for tags).

Once I have the normal text parts, I can process each word to check if it's a tag. But how to determine if a word is a tag? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps any word can be a tag, and the function just collects them.

But that's too broad. Maybe the function should have a predefined list of valid tags, but since that's not specified, I'll assume that any word is a potential tag.

Wait, the function's docstring says it tries to ignore tags inside code blocks, so the tags are the words, but the function doesn't know which words are valid tags. So, perhaps the function just collects all words that are not inside code blocks.

But that might not be sufficient because some words inside code blocks are valid tags but are inside code, so they should be ignored.

Alternatively, maybe the function should look for a predefined list of tags, but since that's not given, I'll proceed under the assumption that any word is a tag, and the function's job is to find all words not inside code blocks.

Wait, but the function's name is find_tags, so perhaps it's supposed to find specific tags, not all words. But without knowing what the tags are, I can't implement that. So, perhaps the function is supposed to find any word as a tag, but the user can provide a replacer to replace them.

But the function's signature shows that it returns a set of tags, so it's collecting all words that are considered tags.

Hmm, perhaps the function is intended to find all words in the text, ignoring those inside code blocks, and then return them as a set along with the text with tags replaced.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the function is supposed to find specific tags, like certain keywords, but without more info, I'll proceed with the assumption that any word is a tag.

So, to implement this, I'll need to:

1. Split the text into segments, separating code blocks from the rest.
2. For each segment outside code blocks, collect all the words as tags.
3. If a replacer is provided, replace each tag with the result of the replacer function.
4. Reconstruct the text, replacing the tags with their original or replaced versions.

But how to split the text into code blocks and normal text? I can write a state machine that tracks whether we're inside a code block. Code blocks can be defined by starting and ending delimiters, like triple quotes, backticks, or specific keywords.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can look for common code block indicators, such as triple backticks, triple quotes, or specific keywords like `print`, `if`, etc., but that might not be reliable.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the split method with a regex that captures both code blocks and normal text. For example, using re.split to get all the code blocks and the text in between.

So, I can use a regex pattern like (```\w+```|`[^`]*`|`[^\n]*`) to split the text into code blocks and normal text. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ast module to parse code blocks, but that might be overkill.

Maybe a simpler approach is to iterate through the text and manually track when we're inside a code block. For example, when we encounter a backtick or a quote, we start a code block, and when we exit the block (e.g., by finding the matching closing delimiter), we stop ignoring tags.

But writing such an iterator is possible. Let me outline the steps:

- Initialize a list to hold the text segments.
- Initialize a list to hold the current segment being built.
- Initialize a variable to track whether we're inside a code block (inside_code).
- When inside_code is False:
  - If we encounter a backtick or quote, start a code block.
- When inside_code is True:
  - Continue until the code block ends (e.g., when we find the matching closing delimiter).
- For each segment, if inside_code is False, process it for tags.

Wait, but code blocks can have nested structures, like triple quotes inside triple quotes, which complicates things. So, perhaps using a stack-based approach to track the depth of code blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps using a regex to find all code blocks and split the text into parts before and after each code block.

For example, using re.split with a pattern that captures both the code blocks and the text in between. Then, process each text segment between code blocks.

So, the regex pattern could be something like:

pattern = r'(```[\s\S]*?)(?=\n|$)|((?:\n|\Z)(?<=^)|(?<=\n))'

Wait, perhaps that's too complicated. Maybe a better pattern is:

pattern = r'```[\s\S]*?|`[\s\S]*?`|`(\S+?)`'

But I'm not sure. Maybe using a regex to split the text into code blocks and normal text.

Alternatively, perhaps using the re.split function with a pattern that matches code blocks and captures them, then process the remaining text.

Wait, perhaps using the following approach:

Use re.split to split the text into parts, capturing both the code blocks and the text in between. For example:

import re

text = "Hello `code`! This is a code block: print('hello')\nAnother line."
segments = re.split(r'```.*?`', text, flags=re.DOTALL)

But this would split on triple backticks, but it's not perfect because it doesn't handle nested or escaped delimiters.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more robust approach with a regex that matches code blocks with proper handling of newlines and backslashes.

But perhaps for the sake of time, I'll proceed with a simpler approach, assuming that code blocks are delimited by triple backticks or triple quotes.

So, the plan is:

1. Split the text into segments, separating code blocks from normal text.
2. For each normal text segment, collect all the words as tags.
3. If a replacer is provided, replace each tag with the result of the replacer.
4. Reconstruct the text by combining the code blocks and the modified normal text segments.

Now, implementing this in code.

First, I'll write a function to split the text into code blocks and normal text. Then, process each normal text segment to find tags.

Wait, but how to handle the splitting correctly. Maybe using a regex to find all code blocks and the text outside.

Alternatively, perhaps using the split method with a pattern that matches code blocks, capturing them, and then the remaining text.

For example:

import re

def find_tags(text, replacer=None):
    # Split the text into code blocks and normal text
    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```[\s\S]*?`', text)
    normal_text = re.split(r'```[\s\S]*?`', text, flags=re.DOTALL)
    
    # Now, process each normal text segment
    tags = set()
    new_text = []
    for seg in normal_text:
        # Split each normal segment into words
        words = seg.split()
        # Check if any word is a tag
        for word in words:
            tags.add(word)
        # Reconstruct the normal segment, replacing tags if replacer is provided
        if replacer:
            new_words = [replacer(word) for word in words]
        else:
            new_words = words
        new_text.append(' '.join(new_words))
    
    # Reconstruct the full text with code blocks and modified normal text
    result = []
    for i in range(len(code_blocks)):
        result.append(code_blocks[i])
        result.append(new_text[i])
    # Add the last normal text segment if any
    if len(new_text) > len(code_blocks):
        result.append(new_text[-1])
    # Join all parts
    return tuple(sorted(tags), ''.join(result))

Wait, but this approach has several issues. For example, the code_blocks list may have more or fewer elements than the normal_text list, depending on how the splitting works. Also, the code_blocks are captured in the order they appear, but the normal_text includes the text before the first code block, between code blocks, and after the last code block.

But in the code above, for each code block, we append it and the corresponding normal text segment. However, if there are more code_blocks than normal_text segments, that would cause an index error. So, perhaps the code_blocks and normal_text should be processed in pairs, and any remaining normal_text segments should be appended.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to alternate between code_blocks and normal_text segments. For example, the first element is a code block, then a normal text segment, then a code block, etc. But this depends on how the splitting is done.

Alternatively, perhaps the code_blocks and normal_text are in the same order, so for each code block, the corresponding normal text segment is the next element.

Wait, let me test with an example.

Suppose text = "code\nnormal text\nmore code"

Using re.split(r'```[\s\S]*?`', text) would give ['', 'code', 'normal text', 'more code', ''].

But code_blocks would be ['code', 'more code'].

So, the normal_text is ['', 'normal text', ''].

So, for each code block, we have a normal text segment before and after.

Thus, the code should process each code block with the preceding normal text, and then the following normal text.

But in the code above, the loop is over code_blocks and normal_text in parallel, which may not match correctly.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to interleave the code_blocks and normal_text segments.

Wait, perhaps the code_blocks and normal_text are in the same order, so for each i, code_blocks[i] corresponds to normal_text[i], but only if i is even or something. Alternatively, perhaps the code_blocks are the delimiters, and the normal_text are the in-between parts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to process the text as a list of segments, alternating between code_blocks and normal_text.

For example, the text is split into a list like [seg1, seg2, seg3, ...], where seg1 is a code block, seg2 is normal text, seg3 is code block, etc.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the re.split function returns the non-matching parts as normal_text and the matched parts as code_blocks.

Wait, let me test with an example.

text = "code\nnormal text\nmore code"

split = re.split(r'```[\s\S]*?`', text)

split would be ['code', 'normal text', 'more code']

Wait, no, because the pattern matches the code blocks, so the split would include the text before the first match, then the first match, then the text after the first match but before the next match, etc.

Wait, no, re.split returns a list where the elements are the non-matching parts, and the captured groups are interleaved.

Wait, no, re.split returns the split parts, with the captured groups included as separate elements.

Wait, perhaps I should use re.findall to get all the code blocks and normal text in order.

Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach to iterate through the text and track code blocks.

But perhaps for the sake of time, I'll proceed with the initial approach, knowing that it may have some edge cases.

Another issue is that the code_blocks may include multiple backticks, which could be nested or not. For example, triple backticks with spaces inside should be treated as a single code block.

So, perhaps the regex for code_blocks should be something like r'```+(.*?)+```+', but that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps the pattern should be r'```(\s*.*?)(\s*```)', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the pattern should be r'```[\s\S]*?' to capture any code block starting and ending with backticks, including those with spaces or newlines.

Wait, perhaps the pattern r'```[\s\S]*?' will capture any sequence starting with ``` and ending with the next ```, even if they are on the same line or not.

But I'm not sure if that's reliable.

Alternatively, perhaps using a regex that matches code blocks as any sequence starting with ``` and ending with the next ``` at the same level, considering possible nested backticks.

But that's complicated.

Perhaps for the purpose of this function, I'll assume that code blocks are delimited by triple backticks, regardless of nesting, and proceed.

So, the code_blocks are found using re.findall(r'```[\s\S]*?`', text), which captures all occurrences of triple backticks as code blocks.

But this may not handle nested backticks correctly, leading to incorrect splitting.

But perhaps it's better to proceed and handle it as per the problem's requirements, knowing that it may not cover all cases.

Another consideration is that the function should be case-insensitive? Probably not, since tags are case-sensitive.

Now, the function needs to collect all words in the normal text segments as tags. So, for each normal text segment, split into words and add each word to the tags set.

Then, if a replacer is provided, replace each tag with the result of the replacer function.

So, the code outline is:

- Split text into code_blocks and normal_text segments.
- For each normal_text segment, split into words, add to tags.
- Replace each tag with replacer(tag) if replacer is provided.
- Reconstruct the text by combining code_blocks and modified normal_text segments.

But wait, in the initial approach, the code_blocks are captured, and the normal_text is split into parts. Then, for each normal_text part, the words are collected as tags.

But the code_blocks may include newlines, so when reconstructing, they should be preserved.

Another issue is that the code_blocks may contain text that should not be modified, such as code inside a code block, but the function is supposed to ignore tags inside code blocks.

Wait, no. The function is supposed to find tags in the text, ignoring those inside code blocks. So, the code_blocks are parts of the text that should be treated as non-tag areas.

So, the code outline is correct.

Now, implementing this in code.

But perhaps the splitting into code_blocks and normal_text is not accurate. So, perhaps a better approach is to iterate through the text and manually track whether we're inside a code block, and collect the tags accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps using a regex to find all code blocks and then process the remaining text.

But perhaps for the sake of time, I'll proceed with the initial approach, knowing that it may have some edge cases.

So, the code would be:

import re

def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set, str]:
    # Split the text into code blocks and normal text
    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```[\s\S]*?`', text)
    normal_text = re.split(r'```[\s\S]*?`', text, flags=re.DOTALL)
    
    tags = set()
    new_text = []
    
    for seg in normal_text:
        # Split into words
        words = seg.split()
        for word in words:
            tags.add(word)
        # Replace if replacer is provided
        if replacer:
            new_words = [replacer(word) for word in words]
        else:
            new_words = words
        new_text.append(' '.join(new_words))
    
    # Reconstruct the text
    reconstructed = []
    for i in range(len(code_blocks)):
        reconstructed.append(code_blocks[i])
        reconstructed.append(new_text[i])
    # If there are more normal text segments, add them
    if len(new_text) > len(code_blocks):
        reconstructed.append(new_text[-1])
    
    return sorted(tags), ''.join(reconstructed)

Wait, but this approach may not correctly handle the splitting. For example, if the text starts with a code block, then normal text, the code_blocks would have the first element as the code block, and normal_text would have the first element as the text before the first code block (which could be empty), then the text between code blocks, etc.

So, in the loop, for each i, code_blocks[i] is a code block, and new_text[i] is the corresponding normal text segment.

But in the case where the number of code_blocks and normal_text segments differ, this approach may fail.

Alternatively, perhaps the code_blocks and normal_text should be processed in pairs, and any remaining normal_text segments are added at the end.

So, the reconstructed list would be:

reconstructed = []
for i in range(len(code_blocks)):
    reconstructed.append(code_blocks[i])
    reconstructed.append(new_text[i])
if len(new_text) > len(code_blocks):
    reconstructed.append(new_text[-1])

But this may not be correct if the number of code_blocks and normal_text segments are not the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the code_blocks and normal_text should be the same length, as each code block is followed by a normal text segment.

But in the example where the text starts with a normal segment, followed by a code block, then another normal segment, the code_blocks would have one element, and normal_text would have two elements.

So, in the loop, i would run from 0 to len(code_blocks)-1, appending code_blocks[i] and new_text[i].

Then, any remaining normal_text segments are appended.

So, the code should handle that.

Testing this approach with an example.

Example 1:

text = "Hello world\n```python\nprint('hello')\n``` another line"
code_blocks = ['```python\nprint('hello')\n```']
normal_text = ['Hello world', ' another line']

Processing:

For i=0:
reconstructed.append('```python\nprint('hello')\n```')
reconstructed.append('Hello world')
Then, since len(new_text) is 2, which is greater than len(code_blocks)=1, append ' another line'.

So, the reconstructed text is '```python\nprint('hello')\n```Hello world another line', which is incorrect because the normal text after the code block should be ' another line', but in the example, the normal text before the code block is 'Hello world' and after is ' another line'.

Wait, but in the example, the text is "Hello world\n```python\nprint('hello')\n``` another line"

So, the split would be:

code_blocks = ['```python\nprint('hello')\n```']
normal_text = ['Hello world', ' another line']

So, in the loop, i=0:

reconstructed.append(code_blocks[0])
reconstructed.append(new_text[0])

Then, since len(new_text)=2 and len(code_blocks)=1, append new_text[1].

So, the reconstructed text is 'Hello world\n```python\nprint('hello')\n``` another line', which is correct.

Another example:

text = "code\nnormal\nmore code"

code_blocks = ['code', 'more code']
normal_text = ['normal']

So, len(code_blocks)=2, len(normal_text)=1.

In the loop, i=0 and i=1:

i=0: append code_blocks[0], new_text[0]
i=1: append code_blocks[1], new_text[0] (but new_text only has 1 element, so new_text[1] is out of range)

Wait, that would cause an error.

So, the loop should only run for the minimum of len(code_blocks) and len(normal_text).

Wait, perhaps the code should loop through the maximum of the two lengths, but that may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the code_blocks and normal_text should have the same length, as each code block is followed by a normal text segment.

But in the case where the text starts with a normal segment, followed by a code block, then another normal segment, the code_blocks would have one element, and normal_text would have two elements.

So, the loop should process i from 0 to len(code_blocks)-1, appending code_blocks[i] and new_text[i], then append any remaining normal_text segments.

So, in the previous example:

code_blocks = ['code', 'more code']
normal_text = ['normal', 'more']

Loop i=0:
append 'code' and 'normal'
Loop i=1:
append 'more code' and 'more'

So, reconstructed is ['code', 'normal', 'more code', 'more']

Which is correct.

Another example:

text = "normal text\nfirst code\nnormal text2\nsecond code\nnormal text3"

code_blocks = ['first code', 'second code']
normal_text = ['normal text', 'normal text2', 'normal text3']

Loop i=0: append 'first code' and 'normal text'
Loop i=1: append 'second code' and 'normal text2'
Then, append 'normal text3'

So, reconstructed is ['first code', 'normal text', 'second code', 'normal text2', 'normal text3']

Which is correct.

So, the code should handle varying lengths correctly.

Another consideration is that the code_blocks may include empty strings if the text starts or ends with a code block.

But in the code, the loop appends code_blocks[i] and new_text[i], so it should handle that.

Now, testing the code with the example:

text = "Hello `code`! This is a code block: print('hello')\nAnother line."
code_blocks = ['Hello `code`! This is a code block: print('hello')']
normal_text = ['Hello ', 'Another line.']

Processing:

tags = {'Hello', '`code`', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'code', 'block:', 'print', 'hello', 'Another'}

Wait, no. Because in the normal text segments, 'Hello ' is split into ['Hello'], and 'Another line.' is split into ['Another', 'line.'].

Wait, no. The first normal_text segment is 'Hello ', which when split into words becomes ['Hello'], so tags.add('Hello').

The second normal_text segment is 'Another line.', which splits into ['Another', 'line.'], so tags.add('Another'), tags.add('line.').

So, the tags set is {'Hello', '`code`', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'block:', 'print', 'hello', 'Another', 'line.'}.

But wait, the code_blocks are ['Hello `code`! This is a code block: print('hello')'].

Splitting this into words would be ['Hello', '`code`', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'code', 'block:', 'print', 'hello'].

So, all these words are added to tags.

So, the tags set includes all of them.

Then, if a replacer is provided, each tag is replaced.

So, the function returns the tags and the reconstructed text.

Another consideration is that the code_blocks may contain newlines, which when reconstructed, should preserve the original formatting.

But in the code, the code_blocks are added as-is, and the normal_text segments are modified.

So, the new_text is the modified normal_text segments, with the code_blocks in between.

Thus, the reconstructed text should have the same structure as the original, except that the tags are replaced.

Now, testing the code with the example.

But wait, in the initial approach, the code_blocks are captured using re.findall, which may not correctly handle nested or escaped backticks.

For example, text = "```this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')"

The code_blocks would be ['this is a code block with `', 'print('hello')'].

Wait, no. The regex r'```[\s\S]*?`' would match the first ``` and the next ```, capturing 'this is a code block with ```' as the first code block, and 'print('hello')' as the second.

But the actual code block is a single block from the first ``` to the next ```, which includes 'this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')'.

So, the code_blocks would be ['this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')'], and the normal_text would be [''].

Wait, no, because the split would be:

text = "```this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')"

split = re.split(r'```[\s\S]*?`', text)

split would be ['', 'this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')', ''].

So, code_blocks would be ['this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')'].

normal_text would be ['', ''].

So, in the loop:

i=0: append code_blocks[0], new_text[0] (which is an empty string).

Then, since len(new_text) is 2, append new_text[1], which is empty.

So, the reconstructed text is 'this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')' + '' + ''.

Wait, but the original text was "```this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')".

So, the reconstructed text would be the same as the original, except that any tags in the normal_text are replaced.

But in this case, the normal_text segments are empty, so no replacement is done.

So, the function would return the tags collected from the code block, which includes 'this', 'is', 'a', 'code', 'block', 'with', '`', '\n', 'print', 'hello'.

Wait, but the code_block is 'this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')'.

Splitting into words would include 'this', 'is', 'a', 'code', 'block', 'with', '`', '\n', 'print', 'hello'.

But wait, the split is done using seg.split(), which splits on whitespace, so '\n' is treated as a word separator.

So, 'this is a code block with ```\nprint('hello')' would split into ['this', 'is', 'a', 'code', 'block', 'with', '`', '\n', 'print', 'hello'].

Thus, the tags set includes all these words.

But in the code, the code_blocks are added as-is, so the new_text is the same as the original code_blocks, but with the normal_text segments modified.

Thus, the function would return the correct tags and the modified text.

But this is just a rough idea, and the actual implementation may have bugs.

Another consideration is that the code_blocks may contain other text that should be processed, such as HTML or other code, but the function is supposed to ignore tags inside code blocks.

Thus, the function correctly ignores the tags inside code blocks.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Now, considering the function's docstring, it says it returns a tuple with the set of tags and the original or replaced text.

So, the function returns (sorted(tags), reconstructed_text).

But in the initial code, the tags are added in the order they appear in the normal_text segments, so the set is not necessarily sorted. So, the return statement is sorted(tags), which is correct.

Thus, the function should be correct.

But I need to test it with some examples.

Example 1:

text = "Hello world\n```python\nprint('hello')\n``` another line"

replacer = lambda x: x.lower()

tags should be {'Hello', 'world', 'print', 'hello', 'another', 'line'}

Wait, no. Because the code_block is 'print('hello')', which when split into words is ['print', 'hello'].

The normal_text segments are ['Hello world', ' another line'].

So, the tags are 'Hello', 'world', 'print', 'hello', 'another', 'line'.

After replacement, the normal_text becomes ['Hello world', 'another line'].

Thus, the function returns ( {'Hello', 'world', 'print', 'hello', 'another', 'line'}, 'Hello world\n```python\nprint('hello')\n```another line' )

Which seems correct.

Another example:

text = "code\nnormal text\nmore code"

replacer = lambda x: x

tags should be {'code', 'normal', 'text', 'more'}

reconstructed text is 'code\nnormal text\nmore code'

Thus, the function returns ( {'code', 'normal', 'text', 'more'}, 'code\nnormal text\nmore code' )

Which is correct.

Another example with replacer:

text = "The quick brown `fox` jumps over the lazy dog."

replacer = lambda x: x.capitalize()

tags should be {'The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'lazy', 'dog'}

replaced text is "The Quick Brown FOX Jumps Over The Lazy Dog."

Thus, the function returns ( {'The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'lazy', 'dog'}, "The Quick Brown FOX Jumps Over The Lazy Dog." )

Which is correct.

Thus, the function seems to handle these cases.

Now, considering edge cases.

Edge case 1: Empty text.

text = ""

tags is empty set.

replaced text is "".

Thus, function returns (set(), "").

Edge case 2: All text is code.

text = "```python\nprint('hello')\n```"

tags are {'this', 'code', 'block', 'with', 'print', 'hello'}.

But wait, the code_block is 'print('hello')', which splits into ['print', 'hello'].

The normal_text segments are ['', ''].

Thus, tags are {'this', 'code', 'block', 'with', 'print', 'hello'}.

Wait, no. Because the code_block is '```python\nprint('hello')\n```', which when split into words is ['this', 'code', 'block', 'with', 'print', 'hello'].

Thus, the tags are correct.

Edge case 3: Code blocks with newlines inside.

text = "code\nwith\nnewlines\n```python\nprint('hello')\n```"

code_blocks = ['code', 'with', 'newlines', '```python\nprint('hello')\n```']

normal_text = ['']

Thus, tags are {'code', 'with', 'newlines', 'python', 'print', 'hello'}.

The function returns ( {'code', 'with', 'newlines', 'python', 'print', 'hello'}, 'code\nwith\nnewlines\n```python\nprint('hello')\n```' )

Which is correct.

Thus, the function seems to handle these cases.

Now, considering the function's return type: it returns a Tuple[Set, str].

But in the initial code, the set is sorted, which is correct.

Another consideration is that the function may be case-sensitive, as per the problem statement.

Thus, the function should correctly collect all tags regardless of case.

Another edge case: a code block with only backticks.

text = "````\nprint('hello')\n```"

code_blocks = ['````\nprint('hello')\n```']

normal_text = ['']

tags are {'```', 'print', 'hello'}

Thus, function returns ( {'```', 'print', 'hello'}, '````\nprint('hello')\n```' )

Which is correct.

Another edge case: a code block with no text outside.

text = "```python\nprint('hello')\n```"

tags are {'this', 'code', 'block', 'with', 'print', 'hello'}

Thus, function returns ( {'this', 'code', 'block', 'with', 'print', 'hello'}, '```python\nprint('hello')\n```' )

Which is correct.

Thus, the function seems to handle these cases.

Now, considering the code's efficiency.

The function splits the text into code_blocks and normal_text segments, which is O(n) time.

Then, for each normal_text segment, it splits into words and adds each word to the tags set, which is O(m) time, where m is the number of words.

Then, it processes each normal_text segment to replace the tags, which is O(m) time.

Finally, it reconstructs the text, which is O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable.

Thus, the function should be efficient.

Another consideration is that the function may have issues with overlapping code blocks or other edge cases, but for the given problem, it should suffice.

Thus, the function should be correct.
