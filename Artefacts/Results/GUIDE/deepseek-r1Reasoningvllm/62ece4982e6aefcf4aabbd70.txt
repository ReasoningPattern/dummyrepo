Okay, I need to write a Python function called os_is_mac that checks if the operating system is macOS. The function should return True if it is macOS and False otherwise. The user provided a function signature and a docstring, so I need to make sure my code matches that.

First, I should think about how to determine if the system is macOS. I remember that the platform module can be useful here. Specifically, platform.system() returns the name of the operating system. So if I import platform and call platform.system(), it should give me something like 'MacOS' for macOS.

So the plan is to import the platform module, check if the result of platform.system() is 'MacOS', and return a boolean based on that.

Wait, but sometimes platform.system() might return None or raise an exception. I should handle that case. Oh, but in most environments, it should return the OS name, so maybe it's safe. Still, it's good practice to handle exceptions, but perhaps for now, I'll just proceed and see.

Another approach is to check the release version. Sometimes, the platform module isn't available or might not be as reliable. But in this case, since the user is asking for a function, using platform seems appropriate.

So the function will import platform, then return whether platform.system() equals 'MacOS'. That should cover it.

Now, considering unit tests. The user mentioned using a test-driven approach, so I should write tests to ensure the function works correctly on macOS and other platforms.

I'll write a test case using pytest. The test should check that os_is_mac() returns True when the system is macOS and False otherwise. I'll run the tests using pytest and make sure they pass.

Putting it all together, I'll write the code, make sure it's clean, and include the necessary imports. I should also add a docstring as provided.

So the function is straightforward. I think this should work. I'll proceed to write the code and then run the tests to confirm.
