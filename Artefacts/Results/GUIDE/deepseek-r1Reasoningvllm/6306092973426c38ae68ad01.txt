Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to implement the get_deprecated_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what's required.

The function is supposed to return a dictionary containing options that deprecate other options. It uses the self.spec_helper.iterate_option_specs() method. From the docstring, I gather that this method should identify which options are deprecated and include them in the returned dictionary.

First, I need to think about how to identify deprecated options. Typically, deprecated options are those that are no longer recommended and should be avoided in favor of newer ones. So, I should look for a way to determine which options are deprecated based on the spec helper's data.

I remember that in some cases, deprecated options are marked with a 'deprecated' attribute or might have a certain version in their metadata. So, I'll check if the spec helper provides any information about deprecation.

Next, I'll outline the steps the method should take:

1. Iterate over all the option specs using iterate_option_specs().
2. For each option, check if it's deprecated. This might involve looking for specific attributes like 'deprecated' or 'removed'.
3. If an option is deprecated, include it in the result dictionary. The key should probably be the option's name, and the value could be a dictionary containing details like the reason for deprecation or a link to the newer option.
4. Ensure that only deprecated options are included, not the active ones.

Now, considering how to structure the code, I'll need to loop through each option spec. For each one, I'll check if it's deprecated. If it is, I'll add it to the result dictionary.

I should also consider edge cases, like if no options are deprecated. In that case, the method should return an empty dictionary.

Putting it all together, I'll write a loop that goes through each option, checks for deprecation, and builds the result accordingly. I'll make sure to test this with some dummy data to see if it works as expected.

Wait, but how exactly does the spec helper's iterate_option_specs() work? Does it return a list of OptionSpec objects, each with attributes indicating deprecation? I think I can assume that each OptionSpec has a method or attribute that tells if it's deprecated.

So, in the code, for each option in the iterator, I'll check if it's deprecated. If yes, add it to the result.

I should also make sure that the result is a dictionary where each key is the option's name, and the value is a dictionary with the deprecation details.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle each step properly.
