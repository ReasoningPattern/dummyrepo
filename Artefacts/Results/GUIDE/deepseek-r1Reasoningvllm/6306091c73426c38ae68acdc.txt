Alright, I need to generate Python code for the `validate_from_content` function based on the given signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should start by outlining the requirements and then create comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

First, I'll break down the function's purpose. The function `validate_from_content` takes a class `cls` and an optional `spec_content` parameter. It's supposed to validate that the YAML content has all required fields and return a dictionary with the loaded data. If mandatory data is missing, it should raise an `IRValidatorException`.

I need to consider what the function should do step by step. It should:

1. Load the YAML content from the provided `spec_content`. If `spec_content` is None, it might need to read from a file, but since the function signature doesn't include file paths, I'll assume `spec_content` is provided when the function is called.

2. Validate that all required fields are present in the loaded data. This means I need to know what fields are required. Since the function doesn't receive any information about required fields, perhaps this is determined elsewhere, maybe from the class `cls`. So, the function might rely on `cls` containing information about required keys.

3. If any required fields are missing, raise an `IRValidatorException`.

4. Return the loaded dictionary.

Now, considering the structure of the code, I'll need to import necessary modules. The most likely ones are `os` for file operations, `yaml` for parsing YAML, and `IRValidatorException` which I assume is part of a custom exception handling system, perhaps imported from another module.

Next, I'll outline the function's logic:

- Use `yaml.safe_load` to load the content safely, handling any potential errors.
- Extract the required keys from `cls`. For example, maybe `cls.REQUIRED_KEYS` is a class attribute containing a list of required field names.
- Check each required key against the loaded data to ensure it exists.
- If any required key is missing, raise the exception with a message indicating which keys are missing.
- If all required keys are present, return the loaded data.

For unit testing, I'll need to create test cases that cover various scenarios:

1. **All required keys present**: Test that the function correctly loads and returns the data without raising an exception.

2. **Some required keys missing**: Ensure that the function raises the exception with the correct message.

3. **No required keys specified**: Although the function should fail without required keys, perhaps the test can check if it handles this gracefully.

4. **Invalid YAML content**: Test if the function can handle cases where the YAML is malformed, but since the function's primary responsibility is validation, maybe the test should focus on required keys rather than YAML errors.

I'll structure the test cases using the `unittest` framework, writing `TestValidateFromContent` class with methods for each test case. Each test will create an instance of `validate_from_content`, pass in the necessary arguments, and assert the expected outcomes, such as exceptions being raised or data being returned correctly.

Potential edge cases to consider:

- What if `spec_content` is an empty string? The function should check if required keys are present regardless of the content.
- How are required keys determined if `cls` doesn't have the necessary attributes? This might be a design flaw, but since the function signature doesn't provide for it, I'll assume that `cls` has the required information.
- Handling of different data types in the YAML content, such as integers, strings, etc. The function should correctly parse and return these types.

I also need to ensure that the code is well-documented, with docstrings explaining each parameter and return value. Additionally, error handling should be in place to catch any exceptions during parsing, perhaps converting them into a specific error type for consistency.

Finally, after writing the code, I'll run the tests to ensure everything works as expected. If any test fails, I'll debug the code, adjust the validation logic, and rerun the tests until all pass.
