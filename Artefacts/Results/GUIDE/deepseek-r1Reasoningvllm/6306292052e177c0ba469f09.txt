Okay, I need to write a Python function called identify_request that checks if the request body contains events in JSON format or has a specific XML tag. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function receives a RequestType, which I assume is the request object from FastAPI. I'll need to access the request body. In FastAPI, the request body is accessed through request.json(), which returns a JSON object. So I should check if this body is not None and not empty.

If the body is present, I should check if it contains any events. Events in JSON are objects with 'type', 'id', and 'payload' keys. So I'll loop through each item in the JSON body and see if any of them match this structure.

If there are no events, I should then check the XML. XML handling is a bit trickier because request.text() gives me the raw text. I'll need to parse this text into an XML object. Using the xml.etree.ElementTree module could help here. I'll parse the text into a root element and then look for the Magic_ENV_TAG within it.

I should also consider error handling. What if the request body is empty or the XML parsing fails? I'll assume that the function should return False in those cases.

Now, for testing. I should write unit tests using pytest. I'll create a test file with various scenarios: a request with events, a request with XML tag but no events, and cases where neither is present. This will ensure the function behaves correctly under different conditions.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function with these checks and then structure the tests to cover all cases. Finally, I'll run the tests to make sure everything works as expected.
