Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called gaussian and takes a single argument x. The docstring says it calculates a Gaussian centered with u=0.2 and sigma=0.1.

First, I should recall the formula for a Gaussian function. The general form is (1/(sigma * sqrt(2 * pi))) * exp(-((x - u)/(sigma))^2 / 2). So I'll need to compute this.

I'll start by importing math to get sqrt and pi. Then, define the function gaussian(x). Inside, calculate the exponent part using the formula. I'll compute the coefficient first, which is 1 divided by (sigma multiplied by the square root of 2*pi). Then, the exponent is negative (x - u) squared divided by (2*sigma squared). Wait, no, the exponent should be -((x - u)/(sigma))^2 / 2. Alternatively, it can be written as - (x - u)**2 / (2 * sigma**2). Either way is correct, but I'll go with the latter for clarity.

Putting it all together, the function returns the coefficient multiplied by the exponential of the exponent.

I should also add a docstring to the function that explains what it does, the parameters, and the return value. The user provided a docstring, so I'll include that verbatim.

Wait, the user's example response only showed the function code, but according to the instructions, I should output only the code in markdown format. So I'll make sure to format it correctly.

I think that's all. The function should now correctly compute the Gaussian with the given mean and standard deviation.
