Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called append_text_to_file, and it's supposed to write the data in the text buffer to a file. The tips suggest using a test-driven development approach, so I should start by thinking about unit tests.

First, I'll outline what the function needs to do. It takes four parameters: file_name, text_buffer, encoding, and overwrite, which is False by default. The function should append the text to the file, but if overwrite is True, it should replace the file instead.

I should consider different scenarios for the tests. For example, when the file doesn't exist, the function should create it. If the file exists, it appends normally or overwrites if needed. I'll need to handle exceptions, like if the file can't be opened or written to.

Next, I'll think about the structure of the code. The function will open the file, check if it needs to overwrite, and then write the text buffer. I'll make sure to close the file properly using a with statement to handle any exceptions automatically.

Testing is crucial. I'll write unit tests that cover cases where the file doesn't exist, where it does exist, and where overwrite is True or False. Each test will set up the necessary conditions, call the function, and assert that the file is created, modified correctly, or that an error is raised if the file can't be written when it shouldn't be.

I'll also need to handle encoding correctly, ensuring that the text is written using the specified encoding. Using the 'wb' mode in the open function and specifying the encoding parameter in the encode() method should suffice.

Finally, I'll write the code, making sure it's clean and well-commented. Then, I'll run the tests to ensure everything works as expected. If any issues arise, I'll debug and adjust the code accordingly before finalizing.
