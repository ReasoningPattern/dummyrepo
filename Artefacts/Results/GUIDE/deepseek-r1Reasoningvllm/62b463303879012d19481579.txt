Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element and it's supposed to return possible values of number and sup from the contents of an issue. 

First, I'll look at the function signature. It's a single function with no parameters, so it's probably going to process some internal data from an issue element. The docstring says it returns possible values of number and sup, so I'm guessing it's returning a tuple or a dictionary with these values.

Since the function is part of a larger project, I should consider what kind of data an issue element might contain. It could be something like HTML or JSON that includes numbers and supplementary information like tags or categories.

The user mentioned using a test-driven development approach. That means I should think about what test cases this function should pass. For example, if the issue has a number like "3", the function should extract that. If there are supplementary elements like 'info', 'tags', etc., it should return those as well.

I'll need to consider different scenarios. What if the issue doesn't have a number? Then it should return None or a default value. Similarly, if there's no supplementary info, it should handle that gracefully.

I'll structure the function to extract the number first. Maybe by searching the issue content for numeric strings. Then, extract supplementary information by checking for specific keys or tags in the content.

I should also think about error handling, but since the function is supposed to return possible values, perhaps it's okay to return None if the information isn't present.

Putting it all together, the function will parse the issue content, extract the number if present, extract supplementary info if available, and return them in a structured format.

I'll write the code to handle these steps, making sure to test it with various inputs to ensure it works as expected.
