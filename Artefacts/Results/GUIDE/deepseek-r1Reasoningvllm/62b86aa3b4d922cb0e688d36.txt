Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _validate_labels and it takes 'labels' as an argument. The docstring says it checks that keys and values in the given labels are validated by validate_key() and validate_value(). 

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. It should validate both the keys and the values of the labels dictionary. So, I'll probably loop through each key and value and apply the respective validation functions.

Wait, but what if the labels is None? Oh, right, the function should return None if it's None. So I'll handle that case first.

Next, I need to import the necessary functions. Since validate_key and validate_value are used, I'll import them from the correct module. Maybe they're in a module called validators or something similar. So I'll import them using from validators import validate_key, validate_value.

Now, the function structure. If labels is None, return None. Otherwise, iterate over each key and value in labels. For each key, call validate_key(key) and ensure it returns True. Do the same for each value using validate_value(value). If any of these return False, the function should raise a ValueError with a message indicating which part failed.

I should also include a docstring for the function that explains what it does, similar to the given one. Maybe something like checking that all keys and values are valid.

Now, for the unit tests. The user mentioned following a test-driven development approach. So I should think about what test cases would cover different scenarios.

Test case 1: Valid labels. The keys and values pass both validations. This should pass without any issues.

Test case 2: A key fails validation. The function should catch this and raise an appropriate error.

Test case 3: A value fails validation. Similar to test case 2.

Test case 4: Empty labels. If labels is an empty dictionary, the function should return None, as there's nothing to validate.

Test case 5: Labels is None. The function should immediately return None.

Test case 6: One of the keys is None. Depending on how validate_key handles None, this might be a valid or invalid case. I need to consider that.

I should write these tests using a testing framework like pytest. Each test will call _validate_labels with specific inputs and check the expected outcomes.

Wait, but in the initial code, the function doesn't have any docstring. Should I include one? Yes, the given function has a docstring, so I should add it to the function.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function with the imports, handle None case, loop through keys and values, validate each, and raise an error if any fail. Then, I'll write the unit tests that cover all these scenarios.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to include all necessary parts and tests.
