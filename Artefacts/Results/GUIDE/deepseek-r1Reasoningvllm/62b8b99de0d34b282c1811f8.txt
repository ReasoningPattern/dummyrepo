Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _reset_logging and it's supposed to reset the logging system. 

First, I should think about what resetting the logging system entails. Logging usually involves handlers, loggers, and maybe handlers being added or configured. So I need to consider what parts of the logging module I can reset.

I remember that logging has a module-level variable called logger, which is a module-level variable. So resetting the logger would involve resetting this variable. Also, the root logger is usually configured with handlers like StreamHandler. So I might need to remove those handlers from the root logger.

Additionally, I should reset the logging configuration. The logging module uses a configuration variable called logconfig. Resetting this would involve clearing it. Also, the root logger's handlers should be reset, so I'll need to get the handlers from the root logger and clear them.

I should also consider any handlers that might have been added dynamically. Using a defaultdict to collect handlers from all loggers and root handlers might be a good idea to ensure all are reset.

Next, I need to write unit tests for this function. Since it's a function that resets logging, the tests should cover scenarios where logging is enabled and disabled, and ensure that after resetting, the logging is in a clean state.

For the tests, I'll mock the logging module to avoid external dependencies. I'll create a mock for the logger and its root. Then, I'll add some logging statements before and after calling _reset_logging to check if they get cleared.

In the test, I'll assert that the number of handlers in the root logger's handlers is zero and that the module-level logger is None. Also, I'll check that no log messages are recorded in a list before and after resetting.

I should structure the tests using pytest fixtures to mock the logging module. This way, each test can reset the logging state as needed.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function _reset_logging that resets the logger variable, clears the loggers and handlers, resets the logconfig, and clears the root handlers. Then, I'll write the unit tests that verify each of these aspects.

I need to make sure that the code is clean and follows best practices, such as using context managers if possible, but since this is a function, maybe a context manager isn't necessary here. 

I should also handle any exceptions that might occur during resetting, but perhaps that's beyond the scope for now. The main goal is to reset the logging system correctly.

Finally, I'll write the code in Python markdown format as per the instructions, making sure to include the function and the tests, and only output the generated code.
