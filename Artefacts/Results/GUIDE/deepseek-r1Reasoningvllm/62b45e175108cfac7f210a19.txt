Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_fixity method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should start by thinking about what unit tests would be necessary before writing the actual code.

First, the method is part of a class, probably Inventory or something similar, since it's validating fixity blocks. The method takes two parameters: fixity and manifest_files. Fixity is a string that represents the fixity block from the inventory file, and manifest_files is a list of allowed file names.

The goal of this method is to check that the fixity block only references files that are in manifest_files. If it finds any invalid references, it should return an error. So, I need to parse the fixity string, extract each file, and compare them against the manifest_files.

I should consider how the fixity block is structured. Typically, it's a multi-line string where each line starts with a level indicator like '---'. Each subsequent line under that is indented and represents a file. So, the first step is to split the fixity string into lines, filter out empty lines, and then look for lines that start with the level indicator.

Once I have the lines that start with the indicator, I need to extract the file names. These are usually at the end of each line, possibly after some whitespace. I'll need to process each of these lines to get the file name and then check if it's in the manifest_files list.

Now, considering edge cases: what if the fixity block is empty? Or if there are no files listed under any level? Also, if the fixity block has comments or other invalid lines, should that be handled? The problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume that the fixity block is well-formed and only contains valid entries, except for possibly invalid file names.

I should structure the method to first parse the fixity, then collect all the file names, and then check each one against manifest_files. If any file is not in the manifest, collect the names of the problematic files and return an error with them.

For the unit tests, I'll need to test various scenarios. For example:

1. Test with a valid fixity block that only includes files from manifest_files.
2. Test with a fixity block that includes a file not in manifest_files and ensure an error is returned.
3. Test with an empty fixity block.
4. Test with a fixity block that has comments or invalid lines, perhaps expecting an error if such lines are considered invalid.
5. Test with a mix of valid and invalid files, ensuring only the invalid ones are reported.

I'll write test cases that cover these scenarios. Each test will call validate_fixity and check the returned error message or absence thereof.

Now, putting it all together, I'll write the method first, then the unit tests. The method will parse the fixity, extract files, check against manifest, and return an error if necessary. The tests will cover different cases to ensure the method behaves correctly.
