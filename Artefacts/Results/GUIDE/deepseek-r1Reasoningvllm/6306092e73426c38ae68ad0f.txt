Alright, I need to figure out how to implement the `get_nested_custom_and_control_args` function based on the provided docstring. Let's break down the requirements and think through the process step by step.

First, the function's purpose is to split a list of arguments (`args`) into three categories: control arguments, nested arguments, and custom arguments. The goal is to determine which arguments go into the spec YAML file (nested and custom) and which control the IR behavior (control).

The docstring mentions that control arguments are those that control the IR behavior and are not put into the spec. Nested arguments are used by Ansible playbooks and are included in the spec. Custom arguments are for ansible variables and replace the normal nested usage.

So, the function needs to categorize each argument into one of these three categories. But how? The problem is that without knowing what each argument represents, it's unclear how to split them. For example, an argument could be a boolean that controls some behavior, or it could be a string that's a configuration value.

The user's initial code attempt doesn't make sense because it's trying to split arguments into control, nested, and custom based on their types, which isn't feasible without additional context. So, I need a better approach.

The tips suggest using a test-driven development approach. That means I should start by writing unit tests that cover different scenarios of how arguments should be categorized. From these tests, I can infer the rules for splitting the arguments.

Let me think about possible test cases:

1. **Control Arguments (Boolean or String Representing a State):**
   - If an argument is a boolean (True/False) or a string that can be evaluated as a boolean (e.g., "yes", "no"), it might be a control argument. For example, `enable ANC` could be a control argument.

2. **Nested Arguments (Strings or Enums):**
   - These are typically configuration values. They could be strings, numbers, or enums. For example, `ansible hosts remote hosts.txt` would go into nested_args.

3. **Custom Arguments (Variables or Special Values):**
   - These could be variables or specific values that don't fit into the other categories. For example, `ansible variable_name` would be a custom argument.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Arguments that are None, empty strings, or other data types like lists, dictionaries, etc.

Based on these test cases, I can start to define the rules:

- **Control Arguments:**
  - Arguments that are boolean (True/False) or can be converted to a boolean (e.g., "true", "false", "yes", "no").
  - Additionally, arguments that are part of control commands (like switches) might be considered control arguments.

- **Nested Arguments:**
  - Strings that represent values (could be numbers, booleans, etc.), but not control arguments.
  - Enums or constants that are used in configuration.

- **Custom Arguments:**
  - Variables, identifiers that don't fit into control or nested categories.

However, without knowing the specific domain of the arguments, it's challenging to create a universal solution. The function might need additional context or parameters to accurately categorize the arguments.

Another approach is to consider that the function is part of an Ansible plugin or module, where the arguments have specific meanings. For example, in Ansible, certain arguments control the behavior of the play (like `become`, `state`, etc.), while others are configuration values.

So, perhaps the function should identify arguments that are control flags (like `become`, `state`, `var`) and others as nested or custom.

But again, without knowing the exact definitions, it's hard to implement. Therefore, the function might need to use heuristics based on the argument types and names.

Alternatively, the function could be designed to accept a list of arguments and return the split based on the argument types, with the understanding that certain types are more likely to be control arguments.

In conclusion, without additional context or specific rules about what constitutes a control, nested, or custom argument, it's challenging to implement this function accurately. The initial code attempt was incorrect because it tried to split based on types without considering the intended purpose of each argument.

Therefore, the next step is to either define the rules clearly or gather more information about how the arguments are used in the Ansible context to accurately split them into the required categories.
