Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called is_fill_compute_el, and it's supposed to check if a given object's class has the fill and compute methods. 

First, I should think about how to approach this. The function takes an object as an argument. But wait, in Python, if someone passes an object, checking its class might be more reliable. So maybe the function should actually take the class as an argument instead of an instance. That way, we can directly check the class's methods without relying on instance attributes, which might not exist.

So, I'll modify the function to accept a class instead of an object. That makes sense because instances don't necessarily have these methods unless the class defines them. 

Next, I need to check if the class has both 'fill' and 'compute' methods. In Python, we can use the hasattr() function to check if a class has a method. But wait, sometimes methods can be inherited, so using hasattr might not be sufficient because it checks for the presence in the class or its parents. Alternatively, we can check if the method exists by trying to access it and catching exceptions, but that's more complicated. 

The user's tips suggest using a test-driven approach. So maybe I should write some unit tests first. But since I'm just generating the code, I'll proceed to write the function.

So, the function will be:

def is_fill_compute_el(cls):
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

Wait, but sometimes methods can be inherited. For example, if a base class has 'fill', and a subclass doesn't, hasattr will still return True. But the function is supposed to check if the obj class has these methods. Since we're passing the class, it should work.

But wait, in the initial code, the function was taking an object, not a class. So in the example, when they call is_fill_compute_el(SomeClass()), it's passing an instance. So in the code, I should probably change the function to take a class instead of an object. That way, it's more accurate.

So, the function should be modified to take 'cls' as the parameter, and then check if 'fill' and 'compute' are attributes of that class.

Therefore, the function becomes:

def is_fill_compute_el(cls):
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

But wait, what if the methods are not in the class but in a parent class? Then hasattr would still return True, but maybe the user wants to check if both methods exist in the class and its hierarchy. Hmm, but the function is named is_fill_compute_el, which suggests checking for the presence of these methods in the class.

Alternatively, maybe the function should check if the methods exist in the class's __dict__ or if they are defined in the class. But I think using hasattr is sufficient for the given purpose.

So, the final code is as above. But wait, in the initial example, the function was called with an object, but the code I wrote takes a class. So perhaps I should adjust that. But the function signature provided in the question is def is_fill_compute_el(obj):, so maybe the user expects to pass an object. But checking the class of the object might be more reliable. So perhaps the function should get the class from the object.

Wait, that's a good point. If someone passes an object, we can get its class using type(obj). So the function can be written as:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = type(obj)
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

But then, if the object is an instance of a class that doesn't have these methods, but the class does, it will correctly return True. However, if the class doesn't have them, it will return False.

Alternatively, if the function is intended to check if the object itself has these methods as instance attributes, then using hasattr(obj, 'fill') would be better. But that's less likely because instance attributes are not the same as class methods.

Given the function's purpose, it's more likely that the function is meant to check if the class has these methods, so using type(obj) makes sense.

But the initial code provided by the user is def is_fill_compute_el(obj):, so perhaps I should stick with that and adjust the function accordingly.

So, the function will get the class from the object and then check for the presence of 'fill' and 'compute' methods.

Putting it all together, the function is:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    cls = type(obj)
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'compute')

But wait, in the initial example, the user wrote:

print(is_fill_compute_el(SomeClass()))  # should return True

So, if SomeClass has fill and compute methods, it should return True. The function correctly returns that.

But what if the class doesn't have these methods? It returns False, which is correct.

So, I think this code should work as intended.
