Okay, I need to generate Python code for an LRU cache decorator based on the given function signature and docstring. The user mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should start by writing comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

First, I'll outline what the LRU_cache decorator does. It wraps a function, memoizing up to maxsize results, using the LRU algorithm. So, the decorator should return a callable that manages the cache.

I'll need to create a test class for the decorator. Let's call it TestLruCache. In this class, I'll write test cases to check various aspects of the decorator, like different maxsize values, typed caching, hit and miss scenarios, and idempotency.

For the test cases, I'll define simple functions to decorate. For example, a function that increments a counter each time it's called. Another function that depends on an argument, testing typed caching.

In each test, I'll decorate the function with lru_cache and check the number of calls, the cache size, and the behavior when the cache is full. I'll also test that decorating the same function multiple times doesn't change its behavior, ensuring idempotency.

After writing the tests, I'll implement the LRU_cache decorator. It should take maxsize and typed as parameters. The decorator will wrap the function, create a cache dictionary, and manage the cache entries based on LRU. If typed is True, it will use weakref to track the types of arguments.

In the actual decorator, I'll use an OrderedDict to maintain the insertion order and track the least recently used item. For each call, I'll update the order, check if the key exists, and handle misses by adding the item to the cache.

I'll make sure to handle cases where the function's arguments are not hashable, especially when typed is True. Using weakref.proxy will help track the types without breaking the hashing.

Finally, I'll ensure that the decorator correctly handles both cases when typed is True or False, and that it maintains the LRU property by evicting the least recently used item when the cache exceeds maxsize.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll structure the code, starting with the test cases, then the decorator implementation.
