Okay, I need to write a Python function called plus_or_dot that takes a parameter called pieces. The docstring says it should return "." if the closest tag of the pieces contains a "+", otherwise return "+". Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about what "closest-tag" refers to here. Is pieces a list of tags, and the closest tag is the first one? Or is it something else?

Let me think. The function is called plus_or_dot, and it's given pieces as the argument. The docstring is a bit unclear, but it says to return "." if the closest-tag contains "+". So maybe pieces is a list of strings, each representing a tag, and the closest tag is the last one in the list? Or perhaps the first one? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the function is meant to check the closest tag in the pieces, which could be the last element if pieces is a list. But without more context, it's hard to tell. For the sake of writing the code, I'll assume that the closest tag is the last element of the pieces list. So, I'll take the last element of pieces, check if it contains a "+", and return "." if it does, else return "+".

But wait, what if pieces is empty? That could cause an error. Oh, but the function signature doesn't mention handling errors, so maybe we can assume that pieces is always a non-empty list.

So, the steps are: get the last element of pieces, check if "+" is in that string. If yes, return ".", else return "+".

Let me draft the code. It would be something like:

def plus_or_dot(pieces):
    closest_tag = pieces[-1]
    if "+" in closest_tag:
        return "."
    else:
        return "+"

Wait, but the problem says to follow a test-driven development approach. So I should write unit tests first. What test cases can I think of?

Test case 1: pieces is ["dot"], so the closest tag is "dot", which doesn't have "+", so return "+".

Test case 2: pieces is ["plus"], returns ".".

Test case 3: pieces is ["tag1+tag2"], returns ".".

Test case 4: pieces is ["tag", "another+tag"], returns ".".

Test case 5: pieces is ["+"], returns ".".

Test case 6: pieces is ["", "+", "nothing"], returns "." because the last tag is "+".

Wait, but what if the last tag is an empty string? Hmm, perhaps the function should handle that, but the problem doesn't specify. So I'll proceed with the code as is.

Now, I'll write the unit tests. I'll need to import unittest and write a test class.

But the user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format, so I'll include the test code as well.

So, the function code and the test code will be provided.
