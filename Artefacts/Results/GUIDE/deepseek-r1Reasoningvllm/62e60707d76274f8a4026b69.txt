Okay, I need to write a Python function called point_type based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to dynamically generate a Point class. Hmm, how do I approach this?

First, I remember that dynamic class creation in Python can be done using the `type()` function. So I'll probably need to use that. The function takes three arguments: name, fields, and srid_map.

The docstring says it's for dynamically generating a Point class, so I think the generated class should have attributes based on the fields provided. Point classes usually have x and y coordinates, and maybe z if it's 3D. Also, SRID is important, so I should include that in the __init__ method.

Wait, the fields parameter is a list. I need to process each field to create the class attributes. For each field, I'll check if it's 'x', 'y', 'z', or 'srid'. Then, I'll set these as instance variables.

I should also include a __init__ method that initializes these attributes. If a field isn't one of these, maybe I'll raise a ValueError to indicate an invalid field name.

Now, about unit tests. The user mentioned using a test-driven approach, so I should think about writing tests before writing the code. The tests should check if the generated class has the correct attributes and __init__ method.

What test cases do I need? Well, I can test with valid fields like 'x', 'y', 'z', and 'srid'. Also, test with invalid fields to ensure they raise an error. Maybe check the SRID handling, ensuring it's an integer.

Wait, the srid_map is a parameter. How is that used? Oh, perhaps the srid_map is a dictionary that maps field names to their SRID values. So in the __init__, I'll get the srid from srid_map.get(field, None) and then assign it to self.srid. But I should check if srid is not None before setting it, maybe raise an error if it's missing.

Also, I should make sure that the __init__ method is correctly initialized with the default values, maybe all starting at 0.

Putting it all together, the function will create a new class with the given name, add attributes for each field, and define an __init__ method that sets these attributes.

For the tests, I'll import the generated class, assert it exists, check the attributes, and test the __init__ method with various field combinations, including valid and invalid ones.

I think I should structure the tests using pytest. I'll write a setup function to create the class, then use assert statements to check if the attributes are present and initialized correctly.

I also need to make sure that the generated class doesn't have any other attributes or methods unless specified. So in the __dict__ of the class, only the instance variables and __init__ should be present.

Wait, maybe I should use the inspect module to check the class's attributes after generating it. But for simplicity, perhaps just checking the __dict__ after creating the class is enough.

Another thing to consider is that the generated class should not have any other methods besides the instance variables and __init__. So in the tests, I'll check that len(cls.__dict__) is 2, but wait, no, because the __init__ is a method, so maybe the __dict__ will include '__init__' as a method. Hmm, perhaps I should check that the only attributes are the instance variables.

Wait, no, the __init__ is a method, not an attribute. So in the __dict__, I'll have '__init__', and the instance variables like 'x', 'y', etc. So the __dict__ will have '__init__' as a method, and the instance attributes as keys.

I think I should write the tests to check that the generated class has the correct attributes and that the __init__ method works as expected.

Putting it all together, I'll write the code for point_type, then the test function, and then run the tests.

Wait, but the user only asked for the code, so I should provide the code for point_type and the test code. But in the initial answer, I included both.

So, in summary, the point_type function uses type() to create a new class with the given name, adds attributes for each field, and defines an __init__ method that initializes these attributes. The test function checks that the class is created, attributes are set correctly, and handles invalid fields and SRID properly.
