Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _explore_folder, and it's supposed to group files in a given folder using _group_files_by_xml_filename. 

First, I'll start by understanding what the function needs to do. The docstring says it groups files by using _group_files_by_xml_filename, so I assume it's processing some kind of XML files within the folder. 

I'll need to import necessary modules. Since it's handling file paths, os is essential. Also, for file operations, I'll import open and Path from the built-in modules. Maybe I'll need to read XML files, so xml.etree.ElementTree might be useful, but it's not imported yet, so I'll add that.

Next, the function itself. It takes a folder path as input. I'll need to list all files in that folder. Using os.listdir(folder) should give me all the entries, but I have to filter out directories since they're not files. So I'll loop through each item and check if it's a file using os.path.isfile.

For each file, I need to determine if it's an XML file. I can check the extension or use ElementTree to parse it. Checking the extension is simpler, so I'll split the filename by '.' and see if the last part is 'xml'. If it is, proceed.

Then, I'll read the XML file. Using ElementTree, I'll parse it and extract the relevant information. The function _group_files_by_xml_filename probably returns a dictionary where the key is the filename and the value is some grouped data. I'll call this function and store the result in a variable, maybe data.

Now, I need to process each key-value pair in the data dictionary. For each key, which is the filename, I'll get the corresponding value from data. Then, I'll construct the full path to the XML file by joining the folder path with the filename. Finally, I'll write the filename into a text file at the constructed path using the 'w' mode to overwrite each time.

Wait, but the function is called _explore_folder, so maybe it's meant to process all XML files in the folder and write their filenames into separate text files. That makes sense. So for each XML file, create a text file with the same name.

I should also consider edge cases, like if the folder is empty or contains no XML files. The function should handle that gracefully, perhaps by doing nothing.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code step by step: import modules, define the function, loop through files, process XMLs, and write filenames into text files.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle each step properly.
