Okay, I need to write a Python function called _dictsum that takes a list of dictionaries and returns a new dictionary where the values with the same keys are summed. The example given is that when dict1 is {'a': 1, 'b': 2} and dict2 is {'a': 5, 'b': 0}, the result should be {'a': 6, 'b': 2}. 

First, I should think about how to approach this problem. I remember that dictionaries in Python can be iterated over key-value pairs, so maybe I can loop through each dictionary in the input list. For each dictionary, I'll loop through its key-value pairs and add the value to the corresponding key in a new result dictionary.

Wait, but how do I initialize this result dictionary? I think I can start with an empty dictionary and then iterate through each input dictionary. For each key in the current dictionary, I'll check if it already exists in the result. If it does, I'll add the value to the existing one. If not, I'll create a new entry with that key and the value.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Initialize an empty dictionary called result.
2. Loop through each dictionary in the input list (dicts).
3. For each dictionary, loop through its key-value pairs.
4. For each key, check if it's already in result:
   a. If yes, add the value to the existing value.
   b. If no, create a new entry with the key and the value.
5. After processing all dictionaries, return the result.

Now, considering edge cases. What if the input list is empty? The function should return an empty dictionary, which the code should handle naturally. What if a dictionary has duplicate keys? Since dictionaries can't have duplicate keys, each key in the input dictionaries is unique per dictionary, so no problem there.

Next, I should think about writing unit tests to cover different scenarios. The user mentioned that they prefer a test-driven development approach, so I'll need to write comprehensive tests before writing the actual code.

What test cases should I include?
- Test with one dictionary: if only one dict is given, the result should be the same as that dict.
- Test with multiple dictionaries, including overlapping and non-overlapping keys.
- Test with empty dictionaries in the list.
- Test with dictionaries that have all unique keys, resulting in a sum of all values.

I'll write these tests using Python's unittest framework. Each test will create an instance of _dictsum, pass the appropriate arguments, and assert that the output matches the expected result.

Now, let's think about how to implement the function. I'll use a loop over each dictionary in dicts. For each dict, loop over its items. Use get method on the result dictionary to safely access or create the key.

Wait, another approach is to use the update method. But since I'm adding values, perhaps a better way is to use a defaultdict from the collections module. But since the problem expects a regular dict, I can initialize each value as an integer and then sum.

Alternatively, I can use the get method, which returns None by default if the key doesn't exist. But since I'm adding values, initializing to 0 would be better. So, for each key, result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + value.

Putting it all together, the code would look something like this:

def _dictsum(dicts):
    result = {}
    for d in dicts:
        for key, value in d.items():
            result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + value
    return result

Wait, but in the example, the function is called with two dictionaries, but the function signature shows that it takes a list of dictionaries. So the function expects 'dicts' to be a list. So in the example, the function would be called as _dictsum([dict1, dict2]).

I should make sure that the function handles cases where 'dicts' is empty or contains empty dictionaries.

Testing this with the example: dicts = [{'a':1, 'b':2}, {'a':5, 'b':0}], the function should return {'a':6, 'b':2}.

Another test case: dicts = [], returns {}.

Another test: dicts = [{'a':3}, {'a':2}, {'b':5}], returns {'a':5, 'b':5}.

I think this should cover the necessary cases. Now, I'll write the unit tests to cover these scenarios.

So, the code I'll write includes the function and the tests. The tests will use the unittest module, creating test classes with methods that assert the expected results.

I should also consider if the input dictionaries have non-integer values, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume the values are integers.

Finally, I'll structure the code in Python markdown format as per the user's request, ensuring that the function is correctly written and the tests are included.
