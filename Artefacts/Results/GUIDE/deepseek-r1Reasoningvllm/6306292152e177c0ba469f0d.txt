Okay, I need to write a Python function called identify_request that checks if the request body contains events when loaded with JSON. The function should return True if it does and False otherwise. 

First, I should think about how to test this function. Since I don't have an actual backend, I'll create some test cases. I'll make a requests object that can return different JSON payloads. 

For a test where there are no events, I'll create a simple requests.Response with a JSON payload that's just an empty list or maybe no data. Wait, actually, if the body is an empty list, it's still a JSON object, so maybe I should have a payload that's not an event. Hmm, but according to the docstring, the function checks for events, so perhaps any non-event structure would return False. 

Wait, the function is supposed to check if the request body contains events. So, maybe the test cases should include scenarios where the JSON payload is an event and where it's not. But since I'm generating tests, I can create cases where the JSON is an event and where it's not, and see if the function behaves correctly.

So, for the test cases, I'll create a requests.Response with different JSON payloads. One test case will have a JSON payload that's a list of events, and another will have a simple number or something that's not an event.

Next, I'll write the test function. I'll use pytest, so I'll import pytest and create a test function called test_identify_request. Inside this function, I'll create the requests.Response objects for each test case.

Then, I'll call the identify_request function with each requests object and assert the expected result. For the first test case, where the JSON contains events, it should return True. For the second case, where it doesn't, it should return False.

Now, moving on to the actual implementation of identify_request. The function takes a RequestType, which I assume is a requests.Response object. Inside the function, I'll access the json attribute of the request object. If the json is None, it means there's no body, so return False.

If the json is not None, I'll check if it's a list. If it's a list, I'll loop through each item and see if any of them are instances of dict. If any item is a dictionary, it's likely an event, so return True. If none are dictionaries, return False.

Wait, but what if the JSON is a single event? Like a single dictionary. Then, the function should return True because there's an event. So, I should check if the JSON is a list or if it's a single dictionary.

Alternatively, maybe the function should check if the JSON is a list of dictionaries or a single dictionary. So, in the code, after getting the json, if it's a list, check each item. If it's a single item, check if it's a dict. If either case is true, return True; else, False.

Putting it all together, the function will first check if the request's json is None. If so, return False. Then, check if the json is a list. If yes, loop through each item and see if any are dicts. If not, return False. If it's a single item, check if it's a dict. If yes, return True; else, False.

Wait, but what if the JSON is a string? Because sometimes, people might send a string as the body. So, perhaps I should also check if the json is a string. If it is, return False because it's not an event.

So, in the function, after checking if json is None, I'll check if it's a string. If it is, return False. Then, check if it's a list. If it's a list, check each item for being a dict. If it's a single item, check if it's a dict. Otherwise, return False.

That should cover the cases where the body is None, a string, a list of items, or a single item.

Now, writing the code. The function starts by getting the json from the request. Then, checks if json is None or a string. If either, return False. If it's a list, loop through each item and check if any are dicts. If yes, return True. If not, after checking all, return False. If it's a single item, check if it's a dict and return accordingly.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
