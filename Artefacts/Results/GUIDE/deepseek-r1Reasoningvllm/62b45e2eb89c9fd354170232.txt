Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called next_version, and it takes a version string as input. The docstring says it's about generating the next version identifier following an existing pattern. 

First, I should think about what the versioning pattern could be. Usually, version strings increment in a certain way, like major.minor.patch or something similar. Maybe the input version is something like '1.2.3', and the next version should be '1.2.4'. Or if it's '1.2.3.4', it should go to '1.2.3.5'. But sometimes, when the last part increments and overflows, like '1.2.9' becomes '1.3.0'. So I need to handle that.

I should consider writing unit tests to cover different cases. For example, test cases where the version ends with a 9, where it's a minor version, and where it's a major version. 

So, the steps I should take are:

1. Split the version string into its components. Using split('.') should work.
2. Convert these components into integers so I can increment them properly.
3. Start from the last component and increment. If it overflows (e.g., goes from 9 to 10), carry over the increment to the next component.
4. Handle cases where the version might have only one part, like '5', which should become '6'.
5. After incrementing, join the components back into a string with dots.

Let me think about how to implement the incrementing logic. I can create a list of integers from the version string. Then, starting from the end, I'll add 1. If the result is greater than 9, set it to 1 and carry over to the next part. Repeat until there's no carry or all parts are processed.

Wait, but what if the version is something like '1.0.0'? The next version should be '1.0.1', right? So the carry should only happen if the current part is 9, and after incrementing, it becomes 10, which then needs to carry over.

Let me outline the code structure:

- Split the version into parts.
- Convert each part to an integer.
- Start from the last index, add 1.
- Loop through the parts from right to left:
   - If the current part is 10, set it to 1 and carry over 1 to the next part.
   - Else, break the loop.
- Convert the parts back to strings.
- Join with dots.

Now, considering edge cases:

- Version is '0' → becomes '1'.
- Version is '9' → becomes '10'.
- Version is '1.9' → becomes '2.0'.
- Version is '1.2.9' → becomes '1.2.10' → wait, no, because 10 is more than 9, so it should carry over. So '1.2.9' → '1.2.10'? Or should it become '1.3.0'? Hmm, that's a good question. 

Wait, in versioning, usually, each part increments, and if it's 9, it rolls over to 10, which then becomes 1 in the next higher part. So '1.2.9' would become '1.2.10', but that's not standard. More commonly, it would be '1.3.0' because each part is a digit, and 9 becomes 10, which is a two-digit number, causing a carry. So perhaps I need to handle multi-digit increments.

Wait, but the version string is given as a string, so each part is a string. So when I split it, each part is a string, but when converting to integers, I can handle the carry correctly. So, for '1.2.9', the last part is 9. Adding 1 makes it 10. Then, since 10 is greater than 9, set it to 1 and carry 1 to the next part. So the next part is 2 + 1 = 3, and the last part becomes 0. So the result is '1.3.0'.

Wait, but in the code I outlined earlier, it would handle that. Let me see:

version = '1.2.9'
parts = [1, 2, 9]
start from index 2, add 1 → 10. Since 10 > 9, set parts[2] = 1, carry = 1.
Move to index 1, add carry → 3. Now, 3 is <=9, so stop.
So parts are [1,3,1], which is '1.3.1'? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1.2.9 +1 should be 1.3.0, not 1.3.1.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the logic. Let me re-examine.

When adding 1 to the last part, if it's 9, it becomes 10. Then, we set it to 1 and carry 1 to the next part. So for '1.2.9', after adding 1 to 9, it becomes 10 → parts[2] = 1, carry = 1.

Then, we add carry to parts[1]: 2 + 1 = 3. Now, since 3 is <=9, we don't carry over. So parts[1] is 3, and parts[2] is 1. So the new version is '1.3.1', but that's incorrect because 1.2.9 should become 1.3.0.

Wait, so perhaps the logic is wrong. Because when you have parts[2] = 10, you set it to 1 and carry 1. Then, you add that carry to parts[1], which becomes 3. But now, parts[2] is 1, not 0. So the code as outlined would produce '1.3.1', which is incorrect.

Hmm, so the issue is that when a part becomes 10, it's not just setting it to 1, but also decrementing by 9, right? Because 10 is equivalent to 1 in the next higher part plus 9. So perhaps the correct approach is to handle each part as a number that can be more than 9, but then when building the final version, each part is treated as a single digit.

Wait, but in versioning, each part is a single digit. So perhaps the version string is treated as major.minor.patch, where each part is a single digit. So, '1.2.9' would become '1.2.10', but that's not a valid single digit. So perhaps the versioning system allows for multi-digit increments, but in the output, each part is a single digit. So '1.2.9' would become '1.2.10', but that's not a single digit. So perhaps the versioning system is such that each part can be any integer, not just single digits. So '1.2.9' becomes '1.2.10', which is allowed.

Wait, but that's a bit non-standard. Usually, versioning systems roll over when a part exceeds 9. So '1.2.9' becomes '1.2.10' which is not a single digit, but perhaps the function is designed to handle multi-digit increments.

Alternatively, perhaps the versioning is such that each part is a number, and the function increments the last part, carrying over as needed, without limiting to single digits. So '1.2.9' becomes '1.2.10', '1.2.99' becomes '1.2.100', etc.

But that's a different approach. So perhaps the function should handle each part as an integer, allowing them to be more than 9.

So, the code I outlined earlier would handle that. For '1.2.9', it would become '1.2.10', which is correct according to the function's design.

But perhaps the function is intended to handle each part as a single digit, so '1.2.9' should become '1.3.0'. So the carry should be handled such that if a part becomes 10, it rolls over to 1 and the next part increments by 1.

Wait, but in that case, '1.2.9' becomes '1.2.10' which is not a single digit. So perhaps the function is designed to allow parts to be any integer, and the output is a string with those integers separated by dots.

So, perhaps the function is designed to handle multi-digit version parts.

Therefore, the code as outlined earlier would correctly handle '1.2.9' → '1.2.10'.

But perhaps the test cases expect '1.2.9' → '1.3.0'. So I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the versioning is such that each part is a single digit, and the function should handle rolling over each part to 0 and carrying over.

So, for '1.2.9', adding 1 would make it '1.2.10', but since each part is a single digit, it should become '1.3.0'.

Wait, but that's not correct because 10 is more than 9. So perhaps the function is designed to handle each part as a single digit, and when a part exceeds 9, it rolls over to 0 and carries over 1 to the next higher part.

So, in that case, the code should handle each part as a single digit, and when a part becomes 10, it's set to 0, and carry 1 to the next part.

But that's conflicting with standard versioning practices. So perhaps the function is designed to handle each part as a single digit, and when a part becomes 10, it's treated as 0 and carry over.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the code to handle that.

Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the function is called next_version, which suggests that it's moving to the next version, implying that each part is a single digit. So, for example, '1.2.9' would become '1.2.10' which is not a single digit, but perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to handle each part as a single digit, and when a part overflows, it's set to 0 and carry over.

So, perhaps the code should handle that.

I think I need to proceed with the assumption that each part is a single digit, and when a part overflows (i.e., becomes 10), it's set to 0 and carry over 1 to the next part.

So, in that case, the code would need to handle that.

Let me think of an example:

version = '1.2.9' → next version is '1.2.10' → but since each part is a single digit, it should become '1.3.0'.

Wait, but that would require handling each part as a single digit, so when a part is 9 and you add 1, it becomes 10, which is two digits. So perhaps the function is designed to allow parts to be any integer, including multi-digit.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look for test cases.

In the problem statement, it says to follow a test-driven development approach, so perhaps I should think about what test cases would be appropriate.

Let me outline some test cases:

Test case 1:
Input: '1.2.3' → Output: '1.2.4'

Test case 2:
Input: '1.2.9' → Output: '1.2.10' or '1.3.0'?

Test case 3:
Input: '1.9' → Output: '2.0'

Test case 4:
Input: '0' → Output: '1'

Test case 5:
Input: '1.0.0' → Output: '1.0.1'

Test case 6:
Input: '1.0.9' → Output: '1.0.10' or '1.1.0'?

So, based on these, I think the function should handle each part as a single digit, and when a part overflows, it rolls over to 0 and carries over 1 to the next higher part.

So, for '1.2.9', the next version should be '1.3.0'.

Therefore, the code needs to handle each part as a single digit, and when a part becomes 10, it's set to 0 and carry over.

So, the code should:

- Split the version into parts.
- Convert each part to integer.
- Starting from the end, add 1.
- If the result is 10, set it to 0 and carry 1 to the next part.
- Repeat until no carry or all parts are processed.

So, let's adjust the code accordingly.

For example:

version = '1.2.9'
parts = [1, 2, 9]
carry = 1
start from index 2: 9 + 1 = 10 → set to 0, carry = 1.
move to index 1: 2 + 1 = 3 → since 3 <10, done.
so parts are [1,3,0] → '1.3.0'

Another example: '1.2.3' → [1,2,4] → '1.2.4'

Another example: '1.2.9' → '1.3.0'

Another example: '1.9' → [1,9] → add 1 to 9 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1. Then index 0: 1+1=2 → parts [2,0] → '2.0'

Another example: '9' → [9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1. Since no more parts, perhaps we need to add a new part. So [10] becomes [1,0] → '10' or '1.0'?

Wait, but according to the test cases, '0' → '1', so perhaps when adding a carry beyond the existing parts, we add a new part with the carry.

So, for '9', adding 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1. Since no more parts, add a new part with 1. So the version becomes '10' → but wait, that's two digits. But according to the earlier example, '1.2.9' becomes '1.3.0', which is three parts. So perhaps when adding a new part, it's allowed to have multiple digits.

Wait, no, in the example '1.2.9' → '1.3.0', which is three parts, but each part is a single digit. So perhaps when a carry is added beyond the existing parts, the new part is the carry value.

So, for '9' → [9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1 → add new part 1 → [1,0] → '1.0'.

But wait, that's two parts. So '9' becomes '10'?

But in the test case where input is '0', output is '1', which is one part. So perhaps when adding a carry beyond the existing parts, the new part is the carry value, and the previous parts are reset to 0.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because in '1.9' → becomes '2.0', which is two parts. So, the function is designed to allow the version to have as many parts as needed, but each part is a single digit.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

If each part is a single digit, then when you have a part that overflows, it's set to 0, and carry over to the next higher part. So, for '1.2.9' → '1.3.0'.

But for '9' → adding 1 makes it 10, which is two digits. So, do we set it to 0 and carry 1, making it '10' as a single part, or '1.0'?

Hmm, perhaps the version string can have multiple digits in a part. So, '10' is a valid part.

But that's conflicting with standard versioning, where each part is a single digit. So, perhaps the function is designed to allow parts to be any integer, including multi-digit.

In that case, '1.2.9' becomes '1.2.10', which is correct.

So, perhaps the initial code I wrote is correct, and the test cases expect that.

But the user provided the docstring as "Given next version identifier following existing pattern", which suggests that the function is about generating the next version, implying that each part is a single digit.

So, perhaps the function should handle each part as a single digit, rolling over to 0 when it exceeds 9.

In that case, the code needs to be adjusted to handle each part as a single digit.

So, to implement that:

- Split the version into parts.
- Convert each part to integer.
- Starting from the end, add 1.
- If the result is 10, set to 0, carry 1.
- Repeat until no carry or all parts processed.
- If after processing all parts there's a carry, add a new part with the carry.

So, let's adjust the code accordingly.

For example:

version = '1.2.3' → [1,2,3] → add 1 to 3 → 4 → no carry → '1.2.4'.

version = '1.2.9' → [1,2,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry 1 → next part 2+1=3 → no carry → [1,3,0] → '1.3.0'.

version = '1.9' → [1,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry 1 → next part 1+1=2 → [2,0] → '2.0'.

version = '9' → [9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry 1 → add new part 1 → [1,0] → '1.0'.

version = '0' → [0] → add 1 → 1 → no carry → '1'.

version = '1.0.0' → [1,0,0] → add 1 to last → 1 → [1,0,1] → '1.0.1'.

version = '1.0.9' → [1,0,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry 1 → next part 0+1=1 → [1,1,0] → '1.1.0'.

version = '1.0.0.9' → [1,0,0,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry 1 → next part 0+1=1 → [1,0,1,0] → '1.0.1.0'.

version = '1.0.9.9' → [1,0,9,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry 1 → next part 9+1=10 → set to 0, carry 1 → next part 0+1=1 → [1,1,0,0] → '1.1.0.0'.

version = '9.9.9' → [9,9,9] → add 1 to last → 10 → set to 0, carry 1 → next part 9+1=10 → set to 0, carry 1 → next part 9+1=10 → set to 0, carry 1 → add new part 1 → [1,0,0,0] → '1.0.0.0'.

So, the code should handle each part as a single digit, rolling over to 0 when it exceeds 9.

Therefore, the code should be adjusted to handle each part as a single digit, with carry over.

So, the code steps are:

1. Split the version string into parts.
2. Convert each part to integer.
3. Start from the end of the list.
4. Add 1 to the current part.
5. If the current part is now 10, set it to 0 and carry 1 to the next part.
6. Move to the next part to the left.
7. Repeat until no carry or all parts are processed.
8. If after processing all parts, there's still a carry, add a new part with the carry value.
9. Convert the parts back to strings.
10. Join with dots.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

First, split the version string:

version_parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))

Then, start from the last index:

carry = 1
i = len(version_parts) - 1

Loop while i >= 0 and carry > 0:

current = version_parts[i] + carry
if current >= 10:
    version_parts[i] = 0
    carry = 1
else:
    version_parts[i] = current
    carry = 0

If after the loop, carry is still 1, insert it at the beginning.

Then, convert each part back to string and join.

So, the code would look like this:

def next_version(version):
    version_parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))
    carry = 1
    i = len(version_parts) - 1
    while i >= 0 and carry:
        current = version_parts[i] + carry
        if current >= 10:
            version_parts[i] = 0
            carry = 1
        else:
            version_parts[i] = current
            carry = 0
        i -= 1
    if carry:
        version_parts.insert(0, carry)
    return '.'.join(map(str, version_parts))

Wait, but in the case where the version is '0', the code would split into [0], add 1 → [1], return '1' which is correct.

Another test case: '1.2.9' → [1,2,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1 → i becomes 1. Next, 2+1=3 → no carry. So version_parts is [1,3,0] → '1.3.0'.

Another test case: '1.9' → [1,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1 → i becomes 0. 1+1=2 → no carry. So [2,0] → '2.0'.

Another test case: '9' → [9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1 → i becomes -1. So insert 1 at beginning → [1,0] → '1.0'.

Another test case: '1.0.0.9' → [1,0,0,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1 → i=2. 0+1=1 → no carry. So [1,0,1,0] → '1.0.1.0'.

Another test case: '1.0.9' → [1,0,9] → add 1 → 10 → set to 0, carry=1 → i=1. 0+1=1 → no carry. So [1,1,0] → '1.1.0'.

So, this code seems to handle all these cases correctly.

I think this should work. Now, I should write the code as per the user's request, which is to output only the code in markdown format, so the code block would be as above.
