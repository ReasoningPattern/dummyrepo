Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called protocol_handlers and it takes two parameters: cls and protocol_version, which defaults to None. The docstring says it returns different forms of Bolt protocol handlers based on the protocol_version.

First, I should think about what this function is supposed to do. Since it's related to protocol handlers, I'm assuming it's part of a class that implements some kind of Bolt protocol handling. The function probably returns instances of handler classes that implement the Bolt protocol.

The user mentioned using a test-driven development approach. So I should start by writing unit tests before writing the actual code. But since the user is asking for the code generation, maybe I should outline the structure first.

Looking at the function, it's named protocol_handlers and returns a handler. So the handler is likely an instance of a class that has a __init__ method which takes the protocol_version. I'll need to create a class, maybe called BoltProtocolHandler, which takes protocol_version in the constructor.

Wait, the function is called with 'cls' as the first parameter. Oh, right, in Python, 'cls' is a keyword, so maybe it's a typo. Perhaps it's meant to be 'self' as the first parameter in a class method. But since this is a function, maybe 'cls' is used for some other purpose, like class-based handling. Hmm, perhaps it's a metaclass or something else.

Wait, looking back, the function is supposed to return handlers based on the protocol version. So maybe 'cls' is the class for which the handler is being created. So the function is part of a metaclass or a decorator that generates handlers for a given class.

So, the function protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None) is likely used to create handler instances for the given class, with the handler's behavior determined by the protocol version.

So, the handler class might have a way to determine which handler to use based on the protocol version. For example, if protocol_version is 1, it uses one handler, if it's 2, another, etc.

I should create a handler class that can handle different protocol versions. Maybe the handler has a method that dispatches based on the protocol version.

Wait, but the function is called protocol_handlers, so perhaps it's a factory function that returns an instance of a handler class, which itself knows how to handle different protocols.

So, the steps I should take are:

1. Define a handler class, say BoltProtocolHandler, which takes protocol_version in __init__.

2. The handler should have methods to handle messages according to the protocol version.

3. The protocol_handlers function will create an instance of this handler class with the given protocol_version.

But wait, the function's first parameter is 'cls', which is a bit confusing. Maybe 'cls' is a typo and it's supposed to be 'self', but in the context of a function, not a class method. Alternatively, perhaps 'cls' is the class for which the handler is being created, so the handler is specific to that class.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a metaclass. So when a class is defined, this function is called to generate handlers for that class. So 'cls' would be the class, and the handler is created based on the protocol version.

So, in that case, the handler would be a singleton for each class and protocol version.

So, the handler class would need to know which class it's handling. So maybe the handler has a reference to the class, or perhaps it's passed as an argument.

Alternatively, perhaps the handler is a generic class that can be used for any class, but the protocol version determines the behavior.

I think I'll proceed by creating a handler class that takes the protocol version in the constructor and has a method that handles messages accordingly.

Wait, but the function is called protocol_handlers, so perhaps it's more of a decorator or a factory that returns a handler instance. So the function would create a handler that can handle messages for a given protocol version.

So, the handler might have a __call__ method that determines the protocol version and then dispatches to the correct handler method.

Alternatively, the handler could be a class that, when instantiated, has a version attribute, and the message handling is based on that.

I think I'll create a handler class that takes the protocol version and has a method to handle messages. The protocol_handlers function will create an instance of this handler with the given protocol_version.

So, putting this together, the handler class might look like this:

class BoltProtocolHandler:
    def __init__(self, protocol_version):
        self.protocol_version = protocol_version

    def handle(self, message):
        # Implement message handling based on protocol version
        # For example, different message types for different versions
        pass

Then, the protocol_handlers function would create an instance of this handler:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is None:
        # Default handler, perhaps for the latest protocol
        return BoltProtocolHandler(None)
    else:
        return BoltProtocolHandler(protocol_version)

Wait, but the function is supposed to return different handlers based on the protocol_version. So if protocol_version is None, it uses a default handler, else it uses the specified version.

But I'm not sure what the default should be. Maybe it's version 2 or something. But without more context, I'll assume that the handler needs to know the protocol version and handle accordingly.

Now, considering that the function is part of a class or a module, I need to make sure that the handler can be properly initialized. Also, perhaps the handler needs to know about the class it's handling, but since 'cls' is passed as a parameter to the function, maybe the handler doesn't need that information.

Wait, but in the initial code, the function is called with 'cls' as the first parameter. So perhaps the handler is intended to be used in a context where 'cls' is known. So the handler might need to have access to 'cls' to perform certain operations.

Alternatively, perhaps the handler is a generic class that doesn't need the specific class, but just the protocol version.

I think I'll proceed with the handler class as described, taking the protocol version and handling messages based on that.

Now, considering unit tests, I should write tests to ensure that the handler behaves correctly for different protocol versions.

So, I'll write a test class that mocks the handler and checks that it responds appropriately.

But since the user is asking for the code generation, perhaps I should outline the code structure first.

So, the code would have:

1. Import necessary modules, like unittest for testing.

2. Define the handler class with __init__ and handle methods.

3. Implement the protocol_handlers function that returns an instance of the handler.

4. Write unit tests to verify that the handler correctly handles messages for different protocol versions.

Wait, but the user's initial request was to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should include the handler class and the function, along with tests.

But the user said to output only the code in Python markdown format, so perhaps just the function and the handler class.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a metaclass, so perhaps the handler is a classmethod or a static method.

Wait, perhaps the function is a factory that returns a handler instance, which can then be used to handle messages.

So, putting it all together, the code would look something like this:

class BoltProtocolHandler:
    def __init__(self, protocol_version):
        self.protocol_version = protocol_version

    def handle_message(self, message):
        if self.protocol_version == 1:
            # Handle version 1 messages
            pass
        elif self.protocol_version == 2:
            # Handle version 2 messages
            pass
        else:
            # Default handling
            pass

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is None:
        return BoltProtocolHandler(None)
    else:
        return BoltProtocolHandler(protocol_version)

But without knowing the exact message handling logic, I can't fill in the details. So perhaps I should leave the handle_message method as a placeholder.

Alternatively, maybe the handler uses the protocol version to determine how to process messages, perhaps by delegating to specific handlers.

Wait, perhaps the handler is part of a message middleware that dispatches messages based on the protocol version. So the handler might have a way to determine which message handler to call.

In that case, the handler could have a method that, given a message, looks up the appropriate handler based on the protocol version.

But again, without more context, it's hard to implement the exact message handling.

So, to sum up, I'll create a handler class that takes the protocol version and has a handle method that can process messages accordingly. The protocol_handlers function will create an instance of this handler based on the provided protocol version.

I'll also include unit tests to verify that the handler works correctly for different versions.

So, the final code will include the handler class, the protocol_handlers function, and the tests.
