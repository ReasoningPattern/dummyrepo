Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _update_context and it's part of a class, probably related to handling graph data. The docstring explains what this function does, so I should make sure the code reflects that.

First, I'll start by looking at the function signature. It's a method of a class, taking self and context as parameters. The context is a dictionary that gets updated with properties of the graph.

The docstring mentions that *context.error* is appended with indices of errors. For example, if there's an error in the x-coordinate, it might look like {"error": {"x_low": {"index": 2}}}. So I need to check if the error keys exist in the context and append the new index if they don't.

Also, the existing values in *context.value* and its subcontexts are not removed. That means I should update the error part without altering the existing data.

I should think about how to access the error properties. Since the errors are under 'x', 'y', and 'z', I'll loop through these keys. For each error key, I'll check if it exists in the context's error dictionary. If not, I'll create a new subdictionary with the coordinate name and the index.

Wait, the index starts at 2 in the example. I should make sure that each error's index is correctly incremented. Maybe I should track the current index, starting from 0 or 2? The example shows index 2, so perhaps it's incrementing from 2 onwards.

I also need to ensure that the existing structure is preserved. So, for each key in context.value, I should create a new key under 'value' if it doesn't exist. For example, if context.value has 'x_low', then in the new context, it should be under 'value', like 'value': {'x_low': ...}.

Putting it all together, the steps are:

1. Iterate over each error key ('x', 'y', 'z').
2. For each key, check if it exists in context.error.
3. If it doesn't, create a new entry with the key and the current index, then increment the index.
4. For all keys in context.value, create a new 'value' key with those entries.

I should also initialize the index variable. Since the example uses 2, I'll start it at 2.

Wait, but what if the errors are added multiple times? Each time, the index should increase. So, after each append, the index increments by 1.

I think I should create a copy of the context to avoid modifying it directly. Otherwise, changes might affect other parts of the code unintentionally.

So, the code will:

- Make a deep copy of the context to avoid modifying the original.
- Iterate through each error key.
- For each key, check if it's in the error dict. If not, add it with the current index and increment the index.
- Then, iterate through all keys in the copied context's value. For each, create a new 'value' key with the same data.

I should also import copy to handle the deep copy, but since it's a method inside a class, I'll need to import it at the top.

Wait, in Python, when you do a shallow copy with dict.copy(), it's sufficient if the values are simple. But to be safe, especially if the values are nested structures, a deep copy is better. So I'll use copy.deepcopy().

Putting it all together, the code will look like this:

- Import copy.
- Define the method.
- Create a deep copy of the context.
- Loop through 'x', 'y', 'z' for errors.
- Update the error part.
- Loop through each key in the copied context's value.
- Update the value part.

I should test this with the example given to ensure it works. For instance, if context is empty, the first error in 'x' should have index 2, and 'value' should include 'x_low'.

Also, if there are existing errors, they should be preserved, and new errors should append with the next index.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
