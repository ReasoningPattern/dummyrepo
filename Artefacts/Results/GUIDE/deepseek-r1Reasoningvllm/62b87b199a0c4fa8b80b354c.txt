Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _get_seq_with_type and it's supposed to return a (sequence, type) pair. The sequence should be derived from the input 'seq', or just be 'seq' if it's already a sequence type.

First, I should think about what counts as a sequence in Python. Typically, instances of collections.abc.Sequence are considered sequences. That includes things like lists, tuples, strings, and bytes. So I'll need to import Sequence from collections.abc.

The function's parameter 'seq' can be any type, but we need to check if it's already a sequence. If it is, we just return it as is. If not, we wrap it in a list. The return value is a tuple where the first element is the sequence and the second is its type.

Wait, but what if the input is not a sequence at all? Like a dictionary or some other object. In that case, wrapping it in a list makes sense so we can return a list and its type.

Now, considering unit tests. I should write tests to cover different cases. Test cases include when 'seq' is a list, a tuple, a string, something else like a dictionary, and maybe None. For each case, I'll check if the returned sequence and type are correct.

For example, if 'seq' is a list, the returned sequence should be the same list, and the type should be list. If 'seq' is a string, the returned sequence is the string itself, and the type is str. If 'seq' is a dictionary, the sequence would be a list containing the dictionary, and the type would be list.

I should also test edge cases, like when 'seq' is None. In that case, the function should wrap it in a list, so the sequence would be [None], and the type is list.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function with the necessary import, check if 'seq' is an instance of Sequence. If yes, return (seq, type(seq)). If not, return (list(seq), type(list(seq))).

Then, I'll write the unit tests using pytest. I'll create test cases for each scenario I thought of, using assert statements to verify the output.

I should make sure that the tests cover all possible input types and that the function behaves as expected in each case. Also, I'll structure the tests in a separate test file for better organization.

Finally, I'll run the tests to ensure everything works as intended. If any test fails, I'll need to debug the function and make necessary adjustments.
