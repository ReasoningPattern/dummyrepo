Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called merge_extra_vars and it takes two parameters: vars_dict and extra_vars, with a default value of None for extra_vars. The docstring explains that this function extends vars_dict with extra_vars.

First, I should think about what the function is supposed to do. It should take the existing dictionary vars_dict and update it with the key-value pairs from extra_vars. But wait, extra_vars is a list, right? So I need to iterate over each element in extra_vars and add those to the dictionary.

Wait, but what if extra_vars is None? The function sets it to None by default, so I need to handle that case. In Python, if the argument is None, trying to iterate over it would cause an error. So I should check if extra_vars is not None before proceeding.

So the steps are:

1. Check if extra_vars is None. If it is, return vars_dict as is.
2. If extra_vars is a list, loop through each item in the list.
3. For each item, add it to vars_dict. But wait, each item could be a key-value pair or just a single value? Hmm, the function signature suggests it's a list of extra-vars, so probably each is a key-value pair.

Wait, looking back at the function signature, extra_vars is a list. So each element in extra_vars is a key-value pair, like a dictionary.

So, for each key, value in extra_vars, I need to update vars_dict. But wait, in Python, dictionaries can't have duplicate keys, so if vars_dict already has a key, the new value will overwrite it.

So the function would look like this:

- If extra_vars is None, return vars_dict.
- Else, loop through each key-value pair in extra_vars and update vars_dict.

Wait, but in the initial code I wrote, I used a for loop with enumerate, which treats each element as a value. That would be a mistake because each element in extra_vars is a key-value pair. So I should correct that by using a for loop without enumerate, using both key and value.

Wait, no, if extra_vars is a list of tuples or lists where each has two elements, then enumerate is okay, but if each element is a dictionary, then I should use a for loop with unpacking.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the function is supposed to merge extra_vars into vars_dict. So if extra_vars is a list, each element is a key-value pair. So for example, extra_vars could be [{'a':1}, {'b':2}], but that's not a list of tuples. Alternatively, if each element is a tuple, like [('a',1), ('b',2)], then enumerate would work.

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to accept extra_vars as a list of dictionaries, each with a single key-value pair. Or perhaps each element is a tuple of two elements, the key and value.

In the initial code, I used enumerate, which treats each element as a value. So if extra_vars is a list of tuples, like [('a', 1), ('b', 2)], then using enumerate would make the key be the index and the value be the tuple, which is incorrect. So I need to correct that.

Wait, no, in Python, when you enumerate a list of tuples, each item is a tuple where the first element is the index and the second is the value. So if I have a list like [('a',1), ('b',2)], then enumerate would give me (0, 'a',1), which is wrong. So that's a mistake.

Therefore, I should change the code to loop through each element in extra_vars without using enumerate. So:

for item in extra_vars:
    vars_dict[item[0]] = item[1]

But wait, that assumes each item is a two-element iterable. Alternatively, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, each with one key-value pair, then I can do:

for item in extra_vars:
    vars_dict.update(item)

But that would require that each item in extra_vars is a dictionary with a single key-value pair. So I need to make sure that the code correctly handles the structure of extra_vars.

Wait, the function signature says extra_vars is a list of extra-vars, so perhaps each is a single key-value pair. So perhaps each item is a tuple or a dictionary.

But in the initial code, I used enumerate, which is incorrect if extra_vars is a list of tuples. So I should correct that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should handle both cases. But for now, to keep it simple, I'll assume that each item in extra_vars is a key-value pair, either as a tuple or a dictionary.

Wait, perhaps the initial code I wrote was incorrect. Let me think again.

If extra_vars is a list of tuples, like [('a', 1), ('b',2)], then to add these to vars_dict, I should do:

for i, item in enumerate(extra_vars):
    key = item[0]
    value = item[1]
    vars_dict[key] = value

But if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, like [{'a':1}, {'b':2}], then I can do:

for item in extra_vars:
    vars_dict.update(item)

Which would update the keys and values in vars_dict.

But which approach is correct? The function signature isn't very clear. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", so perhaps each element in extra_vars is a key-value pair. So perhaps each is a dictionary with one key.

But to be safe, perhaps the function should accept both cases. Alternatively, perhaps each item is a tuple of two elements, the key and value.

But in the initial code, I used enumerate, which is incorrect if extra_vars is a list of tuples. So I need to correct that.

So perhaps the correct approach is to loop through each item in extra_vars, and for each, extract the key and value.

So, in code:

if extra_vars is not None:
    for key, value in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[key] = value
else:
    return vars_dict

Wait, but if extra_vars is a list of tuples, then each item is (key, value). So the code would work.

Alternatively, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then each item is a dictionary with one key. So to extract the key and value, I can do item.popitem() or item.keys()[0], but that's more complicated.

Hmm, perhaps the function is intended to handle both cases, but for simplicity, perhaps the initial code assumes that each item is a tuple.

But to make it more robust, perhaps the function should handle both cases. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should accept extra_vars as a list of key-value pairs, where each pair is a tuple or a dictionary.

But perhaps the initial code I wrote was incorrect because I used enumerate, which is for iterating with index and item. So I need to fix that.

So, in the corrected code, I should loop through each item in extra_vars, and for each, extract the key and value.

Wait, but if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, each with one key-value pair, then perhaps I can do:

for item in extra_vars:
    vars_dict.update(item)

Which would add each key-value pair from the item dictionary into vars_dict.

But if extra_vars is a list of tuples, then I need to extract the key and value.

So perhaps the function should check the type of each item in extra_vars.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to handle both cases, but for now, perhaps the initial code should be adjusted to correctly handle the structure.

Wait, in the initial code I wrote, I used enumerate, which is incorrect if extra_vars is a list of tuples. So I need to change that.

So, the corrected code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        return vars_dict.copy()  # to avoid modifying the original
    for item in extra_vars:
        if isinstance(item, (list, tuple)):
            key, value = item[0], item[1]
            vars_dict[key] = value
        elif isinstance(item, dict) and len(item) == 1:
            key, value = next(iter(item.items()))
            vars_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # handle other cases if needed
            pass
    return vars_dict

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to iterate through each item and try to unpack it into key and value.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to handle a list of tuples, each with two elements. So the initial code should be adjusted to loop without enumerate.

So, the corrected code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        return vars_dict.copy()
    for item in extra_vars:
        key = item[0]
        value = item[1]
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

But wait, this assumes that each item is a two-element iterable. So if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, this would fail.

Hmm, perhaps the function should be more flexible. Alternatively, perhaps the initial code was incorrect, and the correct approach is to loop through each item and update the dictionary.

But given the initial code I wrote, perhaps I should correct the approach.

Wait, in the initial code, I used enumerate, which is wrong if extra_vars is a list of tuples. So I need to change that.

So, the corrected code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        return vars_dict.copy()
    for item in extra_vars:
        key, value = item[0], item[1]
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

But this assumes that each item is a two-element tuple. Alternatively, if each item is a dictionary, then:

key = next(iter(item.keys()))
value = item[key]

But perhaps the function is intended to handle both cases. So perhaps the code should check if each item is a tuple or a dictionary.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the function should accept a list of key-value pairs, each being a tuple or a dictionary.

But given the initial code, perhaps the function is intended to handle a list of tuples.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial code was incorrect, and the correct approach is to loop through each item in extra_vars and update the dictionary.

So, putting it all together, the function should:

- If extra_vars is None, return a copy of vars_dict.
- Else, loop through each item in extra_vars.
- For each item, extract the key and value and update vars_dict.

So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        return vars_dict.copy()
    for item in extra_vars:
        key, value = item[0], item[1]
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

But wait, this would fail if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries. So perhaps a better approach is to handle both cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to handle a list of key-value pairs, each being a tuple of two elements.

So, in conclusion, the function should check if extra_vars is None, and if not, loop through each item, extract key and value, and update the dictionary.
