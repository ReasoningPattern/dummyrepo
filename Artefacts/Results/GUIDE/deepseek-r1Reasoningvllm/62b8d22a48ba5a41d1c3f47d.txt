Okay, I need to write a Python method called pop in a class, based on the given function signature and docstring. The method should behave like a dictionary's pop method, but with a default value. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the method signature is given as def pop(self, key, default=__marker):. So it's an instance method, meaning it's part of a class, probably a dictionary-like class. The default is set to __marker, which I should define as a constant. Maybe using a class variable like __MARKER = object() would work since it's unhashable and can't be a key, which is good because if someone tries to use it as a key, it'll raise a KeyError, mimicking the standard behavior when the key isn't found and the default isn't provided.

Next, the docstring explains that if the key isn't found, it returns the default value instead of raising a KeyError. So the method needs to check if the key exists in the underlying data structure. If it does, remove it and return the value. If not, return the default value.

I should decide what data structure to use. Since the method needs to support key removal and lookups, a standard dictionary would suffice. So the class probably has a dictionary instance variable, like self.data.

Now, the steps for the method are:

1. Check if the key exists in self.data.
2. If it exists, remove it and return the value.
3. If it doesn't, return the default value provided.

Wait, but the default is passed as an argument, so the method should use that when the key isn't found.

I should also handle cases where the default is None. In the standard dict.pop method, if the key isn't found and no default is provided, it raises a KeyError. So in this case, if default is None and the key isn't found, the method should raise a KeyError. Otherwise, it returns the default value.

Let me outline the code structure:

def pop(self, key, default=__MARKER):
    if key in self.data:
        del self.data[key]
        return self.data[key]
    else:
        return default

But wait, what about the case when the default is __MARKER? Then, if the key isn't found, it should raise KeyError. So I need to handle that.

So, inside the else block, if default is __MARKER, raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

Wait, no. The default is passed as an argument, and the method's behavior is to return default if the key isn't found. So if the default is __MARKER, then when the key isn't found, the method should raise KeyError. Otherwise, it returns the default value.

So the code should be:

if key in self.data:
    del self.data[key]
    return self.data[key]
else:
    if default == __MARKER:
        raise KeyError
    else:
        return default

But wait, in Python, the standard dict.pop() raises KeyError if the key isn't found and no default is provided. So in this method, if default is __MARKER, then when the key isn't found, it should raise KeyError. Otherwise, it returns the default.

So the code should check if the key is present. If yes, remove and return. If no, check if default is __MARKER, then raise KeyError. Else, return the default.

Putting it all together, I'll define __MARKER as a class-level constant, probably using a class variable like __MARKER = object().

Wait, but in Python, using object() as a default might not be the best idea because it's a singleton. But in this case, it's acceptable because if someone tries to use it as a key, it'll raise a TypeError, which is the desired behavior.

So, the class should have a __MARKER class variable. The pop method will use this.

Let me structure the class. I'll need to create a class, say, MyDict, which has a data attribute as a dictionary. Then, the pop method is an instance method that modifies self.data.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the method is part of a class, so I need to write the class and the method. But the user only asked for the code, so I think they expect the method code, but perhaps as part of a class. Hmm, the initial prompt says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, the user provided a function signature, so perhaps the code is just the method, but in the context of a class. So I need to write the method inside a class, but the user didn't specify the class name. So perhaps the code should include the class definition with the method.

Alternatively, maybe the code is just the method, but in Python, methods are part of classes, so perhaps the code should be within a class.

But the user's example in the tips says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the method code as a standalone function, but since it's part of a class, maybe the code is part of a class.

Wait, perhaps the code is just the method, but in Python, it's part of a class. So the code would be:

class MyClass:
    __MARKER = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__MARKER):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default == MyClass.__MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

But wait, the user didn't specify the class name, so perhaps the code should be written as a function inside a class. But since the user only provided the function signature, perhaps the code is just the method, assuming that the class has a data attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be written as a method within a class, but the user didn't specify the class, so perhaps it's better to assume that the class is named something like 'Dictionary' or similar, but without knowing, perhaps the code is just the method.

Wait, but in the initial problem, the user provided a function signature, so perhaps the code is just the method, but in Python, it's part of a class. So perhaps the code should be written within a class.

But the user's example in the tips shows that the code is in Python markdown, so perhaps the code is just the method, but in a class context.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class, but the class name isn't specified, so perhaps the code is just the method.

Wait, perhaps the code is part of a class, so I'll write the class and the method.

But the user's initial prompt was to generate code based on the function signature, so perhaps the code is just the method, but in Python, it's part of a class. So perhaps the code should be:

class MyClass:
    def pop(self, key, default=None):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is None:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

But wait, the default is set to __marker, which is a specific object. So perhaps the default should be a class-level constant.

So, perhaps:

class MyClass:
    __MARKER = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__MARKER):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default == MyClass.__MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

But in the initial function signature, the default is set to __marker, which is a specific object. So perhaps using a class-level constant is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the method can be written as a function without a class, but since it's supposed to be part of a class, perhaps it's better to include the class.

But the user's initial prompt didn't specify the class name, so perhaps the code is just the method, but in the context of a class.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written as a function inside a class, but without knowing the class name, perhaps the code is just the method.

Wait, perhaps the user expects the code to be written as a function, not necessarily part of a class, but given that the function signature is for an instance method, it's part of a class.

So, perhaps the code should be written within a class, so the code would be:

class Dictionary:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=None):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is None:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

But wait, the default is supposed to be __marker, which is a specific object. So perhaps the method should have default as a parameter, but in the method, if the default is __marker, raise KeyError.

So, perhaps the code is:

class Dictionary:
    __MARKER = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=None):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is None:
                raise KeyError
            elif default is Dictionary.__MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

Wait, but in the function signature, default is __marker, which is a specific object. So perhaps the default parameter is set to __marker.

So, in the method, if the default is __marker, then when the key isn't found, raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

So, the code would be:

class Dictionary:
    __MARKER = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=None):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is None:
                raise KeyError
            elif default is Dictionary.__MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

Wait, but the default parameter in the function signature is __marker, which is a specific object. So perhaps the method should check if default is __marker, then raise KeyError, else return it.

Alternatively, perhaps the default parameter is optional, and if not provided, uses __marker.

Wait, the function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, so default is optional and defaults to __marker.

So, in the method, if default is __marker and the key isn't found, raise KeyError. Else, return default.

So, the code inside the else block would be:

if default == self.__MARKER:
    raise KeyError
else:
    return default

But wait, in Python, comparing objects with '==' checks identity, but __MARKER is an object(), so each instance is a different object. So, if the default is set to a specific instance, then checking if default is __MARKER would only catch if the passed default is exactly that instance.

But in the function signature, default is set to __marker, which is a specific object. So, perhaps in the method, if the default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

So, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.data:
        del self.data[key]
        return self.data[key]
    else:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError
        else:
            return default

But wait, the default parameter is set to __marker, which is an object. So, if someone passes another object as default, it should be returned when the key isn't found.

So, the code should check if default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Otherwise, return default.

But in the code, default is a parameter, so in the method, it's received as an argument. So, inside the else block, it's checking if default is the same as __marker.

Wait, but __marker is a class-level constant. So, in the method, self.__MARKER refers to the class's constant. So, perhaps the code should use self.__MARKER instead of __marker to avoid confusion.

Wait, in the function signature, the default is __marker, which is a local variable in the function. So, in the method, default is the argument passed, which could be any value. So, in the else block, if default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Else, return default.

So, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.data:
        del self.data[key]
        return self.data[key]
    else:
        if default == __marker:
            raise KeyError
        else:
            return default

But wait, comparing objects with '==' checks for identity, not equality. So if __marker is an object, and the default is another object, even if they are the same, it would work. But in this case, since the default is set to __marker, which is a specific object, perhaps it's better to use is to check for identity.

Wait, but in Python, object() creates a new instance each time. So, if __marker is defined as object(), then in the function signature, default is set to that specific instance. So, in the method, if default is exactly that instance, then raise KeyError.

So, perhaps the code should be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.data:
        del self.data[key]
        return self.data[key]
    else:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError
        else:
            return default

But wait, in the method, default is the argument, which could be any value. So, if someone passes a different object, it's returned. If they pass None, it's returned. Only if they pass __marker, it raises KeyError.

So, the code is correct.

Now, considering unit tests. The user suggested a test-driven approach, so I should think about what test cases would cover this method.

Test cases would include:

1. Test that when the key exists, it's removed and returned.
2. Test that when the key doesn't exist and default is provided, it returns the default.
3. Test that when the key doesn't exist and default is __marker, it raises KeyError.
4. Test that the underlying data is modified correctly.

So, the test cases would be:

def test_pop(self):
    # Test case 1: Key exists
    d = Dictionary()
    d.pop(1, 5)
    assert d.data == {}

    # Test case 2: Key doesn't exist, return default
    d = Dictionary()
    assert d.pop(1) == __marker

    # Test case 3: Key doesn't exist, default is None
    d = Dictionary()
    assert d.pop(1, None) is None

    # Test case 4: Key doesn't exist, default is another value
    d = Dictionary()
    assert d.pop(1, 10) == 10

    # Test case 5: Key exists, return value and remove from data
    d = Dictionary()
    d.pop(1, 5)
    assert 1 not in d.data

Wait, but in the method, if the key exists, it removes it and returns the value. So in test case 1, after pop(1,5), d.data should be empty.

Another test case: when the key is present multiple times, but since it's a dictionary, each key is unique, so that's not necessary.

Another test case: when the default is the same as __marker, it should raise KeyError.

Wait, but in the method, if default is __marker and the key isn't found, it raises KeyError. So, in the test case, when default is __marker, it should raise KeyError.

So, test case 3 could be:

d = Dictionary()
try:
    d.pop(1, __marker)
except KeyError:
    assert True
else:
    assert False, "No KeyError raised"

But in the code, the method would raise KeyError only when default is __marker. So, this test case would pass.

Now, considering all these, the code should be written with these considerations.

So, putting it all together, the code would be a class with an __MARKER constant, and a pop method that behaves as described.

Wait, but the user's function signature is just the method, not the class. So perhaps the code is just the method, but in the context of a class. So, the code would be:

class Dictionary:
    __MARKER = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=None):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is None:
                raise KeyError
            elif default is Dictionary.__MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

Wait, but in the function signature, default is set to __marker, which is an object. So, perhaps the method should use self.__MARKER to avoid confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the default parameter is optional and defaults to None, but the function signature in the problem is __marker. So, perhaps the code should use the function signature as given.

Wait, the function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, so the default is __marker. So, in the method, if the default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

So, the code inside the else block is:

if default == __marker:
    raise KeyError
else:
    return default

But wait, comparing objects with '==' checks for identity, not equality. So, if someone passes another object that's the same as __marker, it would work, but since __marker is a specific instance, it's better to use is to check for identity.

Wait, no, because in Python, object() creates a new instance each time. So, if __marker is defined as object(), then in the function signature, default is set to that specific instance. So, in the method, if default is exactly that instance, then it raises KeyError. Otherwise, it returns the default.

So, perhaps the code should be:

if default is __marker:
    raise KeyError
else:
    return default

But wait, in the function signature, default is __marker, which is an object. So, in the method, if the default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

So, the code is correct.

Now, considering all this, the final code would be:

class Dictionary:
    __MARKER = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=None):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is None:
                raise KeyError
            elif default is Dictionary.__MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

Wait, but in the function signature, default is set to __marker, which is an object. So, in the method, default is the argument passed. So, in the else block, if default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Else, return default.

But in the code above, the default parameter is set to None in the method, but in the function signature, it's __marker. So, perhaps the code should have default as the parameter, and inside the method, check if default is __marker.

Wait, perhaps I should write the code as:

class Dictionary:
    __MARKER = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=None):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is None:
                raise KeyError
            elif default is Dictionary.__MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

But wait, the function signature in the problem is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, which means that the default parameter is __marker. So, in the method, the default is passed as an argument, which could be any value. So, in the else block, if the default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

So, the code should be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.data:
        del self.data[key]
        return self.data[key]
    else:
        if default == __marker:
            raise KeyError
        else:
            return default

But wait, the default parameter is optional, so in the method, it's received as an argument. So, in the else block, if default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Else, return default.

But comparing objects with '==' checks for identity, not equality. So, if someone passes another object that's the same as __marker, it would work, but since __marker is a specific instance, it's better to use is to check for identity.

Wait, but in Python, __marker is an instance of object, and each instance is unique. So, if someone passes another object that's the same as __marker, it's the same instance. So, using 'is' would be more appropriate.

So, the code should be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.data:
        del self.data[key]
        return self.data[key]
    else:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError
        else:
            return default

But wait, in the function signature, default is __marker, which is an object. So, in the method, if the default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Else, return default.

So, the code is correct.

Now, considering all this, the code is as follows:

class Dictionary:
    __MARKER = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=None):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is None:
                raise KeyError
            elif default is Dictionary.__MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

Wait, but in the function signature, default is set to __marker, which is an object. So, in the method, default is the argument passed. So, in the else block, if default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Else, return default.

But in the code above, the method has default=None as the parameter, which conflicts with the function signature. So, perhaps the code should not have default=None, but use the function signature's default.

So, the correct code would be:

class Dictionary:
    __MARKER = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is __marker:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

Yes, that makes sense. So, the method uses the function signature's default value, which is __marker.

Now, considering unit tests, I should write tests that cover all cases.

Test case 1: Key exists, return value and remove from data.

Test case 2: Key doesn't exist, default is __marker, raise KeyError.

Test case 3: Key doesn't exist, default is None, return None.

Test case 4: Key doesn't exist, default is 5, return 5.

Test case 5: Key exists, return value and remove from data.

So, the test cases would be:

def test_pop(self):
    d = Dictionary()
    # Test case 1: Key exists
    d.pop(1, 5)
    assert d.data == {}

    # Test case 2: Key doesn't exist, default is __marker
    d = Dictionary()
    try:
        d.pop(1, __marker)
    except KeyError:
        assert True
    else:
        assert False, "Should have raised KeyError"

    # Test case 3: Key doesn't exist, default is None
    d = Dictionary()
    assert d.pop(1, None) is None

    # Test case 4: Key doesn't exist, default is 5
    d = Dictionary()
    assert d.pop(1, 5) == 5

    # Test case 5: Key exists
    d = Dictionary()
    d.pop(1, 5)
    assert 1 not in d.data

So, these tests would cover the functionality.

Now, putting it all together, the code is:

class Dictionary:
    __MARKER = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__MARKER):
        if key in self.data:
            del self.data[key]
            return self.data[key]
        else:
            if default is __MARKER:
                raise KeyError
            else:
                return default

And the test cases as above.

But the user asked to output only the code, so perhaps the code is just the method, but within a class. So, the final answer is the code as written above, but perhaps within a class.

Wait, but the user's initial prompt was to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code is the method, but in the context of a class.

So, the final code is the class with the pop method as defined.
