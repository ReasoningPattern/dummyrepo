Okay, I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that takes a list of nodes and merges any duplicate keys, keeping the last value. The nodes can be any type, not just dictionaries, so I have to handle that. 

First, I should think about how to approach this. The function needs to iterate through each node in the list. For each node, I need to check if there's already a key in a dictionary. If there is, I should compare the current node's value with the existing one. If they are both Mappings (like dictionaries), I need to recursively merge them. Otherwise, just keep the last value.

Wait, but how do I handle different data types? For example, if a node is a list, string, or another non-mapping type. So, the logic should be: if the existing value is a MappingNode, then merge, else just overwrite.

I should probably create a helper function to check if something is a MappingNode. Let's name it is_mapping_node. It will check if the object is an instance of a Mapping, like dict or maybe other subscriptable types, but maybe just checking for dict is enough. Hmm, but the problem says nodes can have values that are Mappings, so perhaps the function should check if the value is a Mapping.

Wait, looking back at the docstring, it says "node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So each node is a value, and if those values are Mappings, they should be merged. So, the function needs to handle nested Mappings.

So, the plan is:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the merged nodes.
2. Iterate over each node in the input list.
3. For each node, get its value.
4. Check if the key already exists in the dictionary.
   a. If it does, check if the existing value is a Mapping.
      i. If yes, recursively merge the current node's value into the existing one.
      ii. If no, just overwrite the existing value.
   b. If it doesn't, add the key and value to the dictionary.
5. Return the merged dictionary.

But wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, so it's supposed to handle nested structures. So, when merging, if both values are Mappings, we need to recursively process them.

So, the helper function is_mapping_node could be something like:

def is_mapping_node(obj):
    return isinstance(obj, dict)

But maybe it's better to check if the object is subscriptable, but for simplicity, checking for dict might be sufficient, especially since the problem mentions Mappings.

Wait, the problem says "non-MappingNode values", so perhaps the function should only attempt to merge if both values are Mappings. Otherwise, just take the last one.

So, in the code, when a key is found, check if the existing value is a Mapping. If yes, then check if the current node's value is also a Mapping. If both are, then recursively merge. If only the existing is a Mapping, then take the existing. If neither are Mappings, take the current value.

Wait, but the problem says if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, if one is a Mapping and the other is not, the last one is kept. So, in code:

current_value = nodes[i]
if key in merged:
    existing_value = merged[key]
    if isinstance(existing_value, dict) and isinstance(current_value, dict):
        # both are dicts, merge them
        merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes(current_value, merged[key])
    else:
        # only one is a dict, take the last value
        merged[key] = current_value
else:
    merged[key] = current_value

Wait, but how to handle the deep_merge_nodes function. Oh, wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes and takes nodes as an argument. But in this case, when both are dicts, we need to merge them. So, perhaps the function should take a key and the two values and merge them.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can take the current merged dict and the new value, and handle the merging.

Wait, maybe the initial approach is to have the function process each node, and for each key, check if it's already present. If it is, and both values are Mappings, merge them. Otherwise, take the last value.

So, the code outline would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node  # Wait, node is the value, right? Or is each node a dictionary with a key?
        # Wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the parameter is nodes. So perhaps each node is a dictionary with a key-value pair, where the key is the identifier, and the value is the node to be merged.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-read the function signature and docstring.

The function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the parameter is nodes. The docstring says it merges any node values corresponding to duplicate keys, keeping the last value. So, each node is a value, and the keys are determined by something else? Or perhaps each node is a dictionary with a single key-value pair, where the key is the identifier, and the value is the node.

Wait, perhaps the nodes are a list of dictionaries, each with a single key-value pair. So, for example, nodes could be [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'a': {'b': 3}}]. Then, the function should merge these, so that the key 'a' would have a value that is the result of merging 1, 2, and {'b':3}.

So, in this case, each node is a dictionary with a single key. So, the key is the same as the key in the merged dictionary.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, so perhaps the nodes are not just dictionaries but could be any type, including lists, etc. So, the function needs to handle cases where each node's value is a complex structure.

So, the function should iterate through each node, and for each node, extract its value. Then, for that value, if the key is already in the merged dictionary, check if the existing value is a Mapping. If yes, then recursively merge the current value into the existing one. Otherwise, just overwrite.

So, the code would look something like this:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node  # Wait, no, each node is a value. So perhaps each node is a dictionary with a single key, like {'key': value}
        # So, the key is the same as the key in the merged dictionary
        # So, perhaps each node is a dictionary with one key, and the function is merging based on that key
        # So, key = next(iter(node.keys()))  # get the key from the node
        key = next(iter(node.keys())) if node else None
        current_value = node[key]
        if key in merged:
            existing_value = merged[key]
            if isinstance(existing_value, dict) and isinstance(current_value, dict):
                # Both are dicts, merge them
                merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes({existing_value, current_value})
            else:
                # Only one is a dict, take the last value
                merged[key] = current_value
        else:
            merged[key] = current_value
    return merged

Wait, but this approach has a problem. The function is supposed to take a list of nodes, each of which is a dictionary with a single key-value pair. So, for each node in nodes, we extract the value, and then merge based on the key.

But in the code above, when merging, it's using deep_merge_nodes again, which is the same function. That might cause issues because the function expects a list of nodes, but here it's passing a dictionary. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should rethink the approach. Perhaps each node is a value, and the function is supposed to create a dictionary where keys are determined by something else, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is meant to process a list of nodes, each of which is a single value, and for each key in those nodes, merge the values. But that's not clear either.

Wait, perhaps the function is designed to take a list of nodes, where each node is a value that could be a non-dict or a dict. So, for example, nodes could be [1, 2, {'a': {'b': 3}}]. Then, the function would create a dictionary where the keys are determined by the nodes, but that doesn't make sense because 1, 2, and the dict are all different types. So, perhaps each node is a dictionary with a single key, and the function is merging based on that key.

Wait, perhaps the function is designed to process a list of nodes, each of which is a single dictionary with a single key-value pair. So, for example, nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'a': {'b': 3}}]. Then, the function should create a dictionary where the key 'a' has the value resulting from merging 1, 2, and {'b':3}.

In that case, the function can iterate through each node, extract the value, and merge them into a single dictionary.

So, the code would be something like:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        # Each node is a dictionary with a single key
        key = next(iter(node.keys()))
        current_value = node[key]
        if key in merged:
            existing_value = merged[key]
            if isinstance(existing_value, dict) and isinstance(current_value, dict):
                # Both are dicts, merge them
                merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes({existing_value, current_value})
            else:
                # Only one is a dict, take the last value
                merged[key] = current_value
        else:
            merged[key] = current_value
    return merged

Wait, but in the case where the current_value is a list or another non-dict, the function would just overwrite the merged value, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Testing this logic with the example:

nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'a': {'b':3}}]

First iteration: key 'a', current_value 1. merged is empty, so add {'a':1}.

Second iteration: key 'a', current_value 2. Now, existing_value is 1 (not a dict), so set merged['a'] = 2.

Third iteration: key 'a', current_value is {'b':3}. Now, existing_value is 2 (not a dict), so set merged['a'] = {'b':3}.

So, the final merged is {'a': {'b':3}}.

Another test case: nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2}}, {'a': {'b': {'c':3}}}].

First iteration: key 'a', current_value {'b':1}. merged is empty, so add {'a': {'b':1}}.

Second iteration: key 'a', current_value {'b':2}. existing is {'b':1}, which is a dict. current is also a dict. So, merge them. deep_merge_nodes({ {'b':1}, {'b':2} }) would create {'b':2}.

So, merged['a'] becomes {'b':2}.

Third iteration: key 'a', current_value {'b': {'c':3}}. existing is {'b':2}, which is a dict. current is a dict. So, merge them. deep_merge_nodes({ {'b':2}, {'b': {'c':3}} }) would create a new dict where 'b' is the result of merging 2 and {'c':3}.

Wait, but in the function, when we call deep_merge_nodes({existing_value, current_value}), it's passing a dictionary with two keys, both 'a' but with different values. Wait, no, in this case, existing_value is {'b':2}, and current_value is {'b': {'c':3}}. So, when we pass {existing_value, current_value}, it's a dictionary with two entries, both under the same key 'a'. So, the function would process this and merge the values.

So, the function would create a new dict for 'a' where the value is the result of deep_merge_nodes({'b':2}, {'b': {'c':3}}). Which would then check if 'b' is a key in both, and since both are dicts, merge them. So, 'b' would be the result of merging 2 and {'c':3}, which would be {'c':3}.

So, the final merged dict would be {'a': {'b': {'c':3}}}.

Wait, but in the function, when we call deep_merge_nodes({existing_value, current_value}), we are passing a dictionary with two entries, both with the same key. So, the function would process that and merge the values for that key.

So, the code seems to handle that correctly.

Another test case: nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 1}, {'a': {'b': 2}}]. The merged should be {'a': {'b':2}}.

Yes, because the first two entries set 'a' to 1, then the third sets 'a' to {'b':2}.

Another case: nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': 2}, {'a': {'b': {'c':3}}}].

The first node sets 'a' to {'b':1}, the second node sets 'a' to 2 (since existing is a dict, current is not, so take 2), then the third node sets 'a' to {'b': {'c':3}}.

So, the final merged is {'a': {'b': {'c':3}}}.

This seems to handle the cases correctly.

Now, considering edge cases:

- Nodes is empty: return empty dict.
- Nodes have duplicate keys with non-dict values: last one remains.
- Nodes have duplicate keys with mixed dicts and non-dicts: last non-dict remains.
- Nodes have nested dicts with same keys: they are merged recursively.

So, the code seems to handle these cases.

But wait, in the code, when we have a key that's not a dict, we just overwrite. So, for example, if a node's value is a list, it's treated as a non-dict, so the last occurrence is kept.

Another point: in the code, when we have two dicts, we pass {existing_value, current_value} to deep_merge_nodes, which is a dictionary with the same key, so the function will process that key and merge the values.

Wait, but in the function, when we call deep_merge_nodes({existing_value, current_value}), it's passing a dictionary where both values are under the same key. So, the function will process that key and merge the two values.

Yes, that's correct.

Another thing: the function is supposed to return a dictionary. So, the code is correct in that aspect.

I think this should work. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
