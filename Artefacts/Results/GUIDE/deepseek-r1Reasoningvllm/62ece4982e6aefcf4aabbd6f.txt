Okay, I need to write a Python function called get_repo_archive based on the provided docstring and function signature. The function takes a URL and a destination path, and it's supposed to retrieve and extract a .tar.gz archive. Each package in the archive has a 'desc' file, and the function returns the path where the archive is extracted.

First, I should think about the steps involved. The function needs to download the archive from the URL, handle the download, then extract it to the destination path.

I remember that in Python, to download a file, I can use the requests library. So I'll need to import requests. Also, for handling the extraction, I'll probably need tarfile or maybe the built-in tarfile module.

Wait, the function returns a Path object, so I should make sure that the destination_path is a Path instance. Maybe I should import Path from pathlib.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Use requests.get to download the URL. I need to handle the response, maybe with a check for success. If the download fails, I should raise an error.

2. Once downloaded, I need to extract the contents. The file is a .tar.gz, so I can use tarfile.open with mode ':r|*gz' to handle both .tar and .tar.gz files.

3. Extract the tar.gz archive to the destination_path. Since the function should create the directory if it doesn't exist, I'll use Path.mkdir with parents=True and exist_ok=True.

4. Return the extracted path as a Path object.

I should also add error handling. What if the download fails? Maybe check if the response is OK. If not, raise a ValueError or some custom exception.

I should also consider the encoding. The requests library handles that by default, but sometimes it's better to specify, especially for non-ASCII files.

Now, thinking about unit tests. The user mentioned using a test-driven approach, so I should write tests for normal cases, edge cases like invalid URLs, and ensure the function behaves correctly.

For example, a test that checks if the function correctly downloads and extracts when the URL is valid. Another test that checks if it raises an error when the URL is invalid.

I should also test that the extracted files are in the correct location and that the destination_path is created properly.

Wait, in the function signature, destination_path is a Path, so I should make sure that the function handles cases where the path doesn't exist by creating it.

Putting it all together, the function will:

- Use requests to download the URL, with a check for the response status.
- Extract the .tar.gz file using tarfile.
- Ensure the destination directory exists.
- Return the extracted path.

I should also handle exceptions, like if the download fails, or if the tar.gz extraction fails. Maybe raise a RuntimeError with a message.

So, in code:

Import requests and Path.

Define the function with the given signature.

In the function, try to download the URL. Check if the response is OK.

Then, open the downloaded file as a tar.gz file.

Extract it to the destination_path.

Make sure to handle any exceptions, perhaps by wrapping the extraction in a try-except block.

Wait, but extracting might also fail, so I should handle that as well.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code, making sure to include the necessary imports and error handling.
