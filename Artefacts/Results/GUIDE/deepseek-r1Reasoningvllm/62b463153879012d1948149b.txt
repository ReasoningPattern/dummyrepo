Okay, I need to write a Python function called match_file_by_prefix. The function takes two arguments: prefix and file_path. The docstring says that the function should return True if the basename of the file_path starts with prefix plus "-" or prefix plus ".". 

First, I should think about how to get the basename of the file. In Python, the os module has a path function that can extract the basename. So I'll need to import os.

Wait, but what if the file_path is a directory? The function is called with a filepath, but I'm not sure if it's guaranteed to be a file. The problem statement says 'given a filepath', so maybe I should assume it's a file. But maybe I should handle the case where it's a directory. Hmm, but the function's purpose is to check the basename, so if it's a directory, the basename would be the name of the directory, which might not be relevant. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that file_path is a file.

So, I'll use os.path.basename(file_path) to get the filename.

Next, I need to check if this filename starts with either prefix + "-" or prefix + ".". So I'll construct two possible strings: prefix + "-" and prefix + ".". Then, I'll check if the filename starts with either of these.

But wait, what if the prefix is empty? Or if adding "-" or "." would make the string longer than the filename? The function should handle those cases gracefully, returning False if necessary.

So, the steps are:

1. Import os module.
2. Define the function match_file_by_prefix with parameters prefix and file_path.
3. Get the basename using os.path.basename(file_path).
4. Check if the basename starts with either prefix + "-" or prefix + ".".
5. Return True if either condition is met, else False.

I should also consider cases where the prefix ends with a character, but I think the function is designed to just concatenate the prefix with "-" or "." regardless of what the prefix is.

Now, thinking about unit tests. Since the user mentioned following a test-driven development approach, I should write comprehensive tests before writing the code.

What test cases should I consider?

- Test case 1: File exists, basename matches exactly prefix + "-" or ".".
- Test case 2: File exists, basename doesn't match either prefix.
- Test case 3: File doesn't exist (but function still returns False).
- Test case 4: Prefix is empty string, check if it returns True if basename starts with "-" or ".".
- Test case 5: Prefix has special characters, like spaces or symbols.
- Test case 6: File path has different extensions but same prefix.

Wait, the function's condition is based on the basename starting with prefix + "-" or prefix + ".", not considering extensions. So if the prefix is "myfile", and the filename is "myfile.txt", it would match if the prefix is "myfile." or "myfile-".

Wait no, the function checks if the basename starts with either prefix + "-" or prefix + ".", so if the prefix is "myfile", then the function checks if the basename starts with "myfile-" or "myfile.". So if the filename is "myfile.txt", it would match "myfile.".

Wait, no, because "myfile.txt" starts with "myfile.", so yes, it would return True.

Wait, but the function's docstring says "the basename of the filepath is startswith the given prefix plus "-" or the given prefix plus "."". So it's either prefix + "-" or prefix + ".".

So, for example, if prefix is "app", then it's checking if the filename starts with "app-" or "app.".

So, in the function, I should create two possible prefixes: prefix + "-" and prefix + ".". Then, check if the filename starts with either.

So, in code:

import os

def match_file_by_prefix(prefix, file_path):
    basename = os.path.basename(file_path)
    target1 = prefix + "-"
    target2 = prefix + "."
    return basename.startswith(target1) or basename.startswith(target2)

Wait, but what if the prefix is empty? For example, prefix is "", then target1 is "-" and target2 is ".", so it's checking if the basename starts with "-" or ".", which is probably not intended. But according to the problem statement, that's how it should work.

I should also handle cases where the prefix plus "-" or "." is longer than the filename. For example, prefix is "longprefix", and the filename is "file". Then, both target1 and target2 would be longer than "file", so the function would return False.

Now, for the test cases.

Test case 1: prefix is "file", file_path is "file.txt" → should return True because "file.txt" starts with "file.".
Test case 2: prefix is "file", file_path is "file123.txt" → starts with "file.", so True.
Test case 3: prefix is "file", file_path is "myfile.txt" → starts with "file" but not "file." or "file-", so False.
Test case 4: prefix is "", file_path is ".txt" → target1 is "-", target2 is ".", so " .txt" starts with ".", so returns True.
Test case 5: prefix is "a", file_path is "a-b.txt" → target1 is "a-", which matches, so True.
Test case 6: file doesn't exist → returns False regardless of prefix.

I think these test cases cover the basic scenarios. Now, I should write these as unit tests using pytest.

So, the test code would import the function, then use pytest to run the tests.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

Import os and the function.

Then, write the test cases.

Wait, but the user only asked for the function code, but they also mentioned to include the test code in the answer. Oh, wait, the initial instructions said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format, but then the tips mention using test-driven development. So perhaps the final answer should include both the function and the test code.

Wait, the user's instructions are a bit conflicting. They say to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, output only the code in Python markdown. But then in the tips, they mention writing comprehensive unit tests before writing the code. So perhaps the final answer should include both the function and the test code.

But the initial answer provided only the function code. So perhaps the user wants the function code, but the assistant's thought process included the test code. So in the final answer, the assistant should provide the function code, but in the markdown, include the test code as well.

Wait, looking back, the user's instructions say: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps the function code in markdown, but the assistant's thought process included the test code, which should be part of the answer.

Hmm, perhaps the user wants the function code, but the assistant's thought process includes the test code, which should be included in the final answer as well.

So, in the final answer, the assistant should provide both the function code and the test code in markdown format.

Therefore, the final answer would have the function code and the test code, each in a code block.

So, the function code is as written, and the test code uses pytest to run the tests.

But since the user didn't specify whether to include the test code in the answer, but the initial answer only included the function, perhaps the user expects only the function code. However, following the tips, the assistant should include the test code as part of the answer.

Therefore, the final answer includes both the function and the test code in markdown.
