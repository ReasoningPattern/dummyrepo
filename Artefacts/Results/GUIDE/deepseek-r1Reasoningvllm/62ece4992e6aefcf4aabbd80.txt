Okay, I need to write a Python function called remove_ending_os_sep that takes an input_list and returns a list with the trailing OS separators removed from each string. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function should handle the case where input_list is None. In that case, it should return an empty list. So I'll start by checking if input_list is None and returning [] right away.

Next, for each string in the input_list, I need to check if it ends with an OS-specific separator. On Windows, that's usually '\', and on Unix systems, it's '/'. So I can't just check for a single character; I need to determine which separator is relevant based on the OS.

I should import the sys module to get the current OS information. Using sys.platform will give me a string that indicates the OS. Then, I can check if it's 'win32' for Windows or 'linux' for Unix-like systems. Mac is a bit tricky, but maybe I can handle it as a special case or just include it in the Unix check, though I'm not sure if that's standard.

Once I know the separator, I'll loop through each string in the input_list. For each string, if its length is greater than 1 and it ends with the separator, I'll remove that last character. Otherwise, I'll leave it as is.

Wait, the docstring says to iterate over a string list and remove trailing OS separators. So for each string, if it's longer than one character and ends with the separator, remove it. So, for example, 'file.txt' stays, but 'folder\\' becomes 'folder', and 'dir//' becomes 'dir'.

I should create a new list to collect the processed strings to avoid modifying the original list while iterating over it. So I'll initialize an empty list, let's call it result.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Check if input_list is None. If yes, return [].
2. Determine the OS type using sys.platform.
3. Identify the appropriate separator based on the OS.
4. Iterate over each string in input_list:
   a. If the string length is <=1, add it to result.
   b. Else, check if the last character is the separator.
   c. If yes, slice the string to remove the last character and add to result.
   d. If no, add the string as is to result.
5. Return the result list.

Wait, but for Mac, the separator is '/', right? So I should handle that as well. Let me see: on macOS, the separator is '/', so I should check for that too.

Putting it all together, I'll import sys, handle each case, and build the result list.

Now, let me think about some test cases. For example:

Test case 1:
input_list = ['file.txt', 'folder/', 'dir\\', 'subdir//', '']
Expected output: ['file.txt', 'folder', 'dir', 'subdir', '']

Test case 2:
input_list = ['test', 'test/', '/test', '//test', 'test\\']
Expected output: ['test', 'test', 'test', 'test', 'test']

Wait, no. For 'test/', since it ends with '/', it becomes 'test'. Similarly, '/test' would become '/test' because it's longer than one character, but the last character is not a separator if the string is just '/'? Wait, no, if the string is '/', its length is 1, so it's not removed. So in the case of '/test', the last character is 't', so it's not removed. Wait, no: the string is '/test', so the last character is 't', which is not a separator. So it's not removed. So the output would be the same as input for '/test'.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The condition is: if the string's length is greater than one and the last character is the separator. So for 'test/', it's length 5, last character is '/', so it's removed. For '/test', length is 6, last character is 't', so it's not removed. For '//test', last character is 't', so it's not removed. So the output for '//test' is '//test' because the last character is 't', not the separator.

Wait, no. '//test' ends with 't', so it's not the separator. So it's not removed. Only if the last character is the separator and the string is longer than one character.

Another test case: ['a/b/', 'c\\d\\', 'e', 'f//']
Expected output: ['a/b', 'c\\d', 'e', 'f']

Wait, no. For 'a/b/', it becomes 'a/b'. For 'c\\d\\', it becomes 'c\\d'. For 'e', it's length 1, so stays. For 'f//', the last character is '/', so it's removed, making 'f/'? Wait, no. Wait, 'f//' ends with two '/'. So the last character is '/', so we remove it, making 'f/'? Or do we remove all trailing separators?

Wait, the function is supposed to remove the trailing OS separator. So for 'f//', it's 'f/' because it ends with one '/' (assuming Unix). But according to the problem statement, it's to remove the trailing separator. So perhaps we only remove the last character if it's the separator, regardless of how many there are.

Wait, the problem says: "each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname seperator." So only the last character is considered. So for 'f//', the last character is '/', so it's removed, making 'f/'.

But wait, the problem says "remove trailing OS seperator characters." So perhaps it's intended to remove all trailing separators. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous.

Looking back at the problem statement: "each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname seperator." So it's only checking the last character. So only the last character is removed if it's the separator.

So for 'f//', the last character is '/', so it's removed, resulting in 'f/'. But if the string was 'f//a', then the last character is 'a', so no change.

Wait, but the problem says "remove trailing os seperator characters," which could imply removing all trailing separators. For example, 'folder//' becomes 'folder' instead of 'folder/'.

Hmm, that's a point of confusion. The wording is a bit ambiguous. The docstring says: "each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname seperator." So according to that, only the last character is checked. So if the last character is the separator, it's removed. So 'folder//' would become 'folder/'.

But maybe the intended behavior is to remove all trailing separators. For example, 'folder//' becomes 'folder', 'file.txt/' becomes 'file.txt', etc.

This is a crucial point. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname seperator." So it's only checking the last character. Therefore, only the last character is removed if it's a separator.

So in the case of 'folder//', the last character is '/', so it's removed, resulting in 'folder/'.

But that's different from what I thought earlier. So the function should only remove the last character if it's a separator, regardless of how many there are.

So, for example:

Input: ['a/b/', 'c\\d\\', 'e', 'f//']
Processing:
- 'a/b/' → ends with '/', so becomes 'a/b'
- 'c\\d\\' → ends with '\', so becomes 'c\\d'
- 'e' → length 1, remains
- 'f//' → ends with '/', becomes 'f/'

So the output would be ['a/b', 'c\\d', 'e', 'f/']

Wait, but the problem says "remove trailing OS separators." So perhaps the intended behavior is to remove all trailing separators, not just the last character. That would make more sense, especially since in Unix, trailing slashes are often considered part of the path.

So perhaps the function should remove all trailing occurrences of the separator, not just the last character.

In that case, the approach would be to find the index of the last non-separator character and slice up to that index.

For example, for 'folder//', find the last index where the character is not the separator, which is at index 5 (assuming the string is 'folder//' and '/' is at index 5 and 6). Wait, no. 'folder//' is 8 characters: 'f','o','l','d','e','r','/', '/'. So the last non-separator is at index 5 (the 'r'), so we slice up to index 5+1=6, giving 'folder'.

Wait, no. Let me see: 'folder//' is 'f','o','l','d','e','r','/', '/'. The last character is '/', which is the separator. So we need to find the first occurrence from the end where the character is not the separator. So starting from the end, we move left until we find a character that is not the separator.

So in 'folder//', the last non-separator is 'r' at index 5. So the string becomes 'folder'.

Similarly, 'file.txt/' → 'file.txt'

'file//' → 'file'

So the approach would be:

For each string, if length > 0, find the last index where the character is not the separator. If such an index exists, take the substring up to that index +1. Else, return an empty string.

But wait, if the string is just the separator, like '/', then it's length 1, so it remains.

So the steps for each string:

1. If the string is empty or length 1, add to result.
2. Else, iterate from the end towards the beginning to find the first character that is not the separator.
3. If found, slice the string up to that index +1.
4. If all characters are separators (e.g., '////'), then the result is an empty string.

This approach ensures that all trailing separators are removed.

So, how to implement this in Python.

First, determine the separator based on the OS.

Then, for each string in input_list:

- if len(s) <=1: add to result
- else:
   - iterate from the end, find the first index where s[i] != separator
   - if found, take s[:i+1]
   - else, take empty string

This would handle cases where multiple separators are at the end.

So, for 'folder//', it becomes 'folder'

For 'folder/', it becomes 'folder'

For 'folder', it remains 'folder'

For '//test', it remains '//test' because the last character is 't', which is not a separator.

Wait, no. '//test' ends with 't', so it's not a separator. So the string remains as is.

Another example: 'test//', becomes 'test'

So, the function should process each string to remove all trailing separators.

This changes the approach. So I need to adjust the code accordingly.

So, the function will:

- import sys
- handle None case
- determine separator based on OS
- for each string, process as per above

Now, let me think about how to implement this in code.

In Python, for each string s:

if len(s) <= 1:
    result.append(s)
else:
    # find the first index from the end where s[i] != separator
    i = len(s) -1
    while i >=0 and s[i] == separator:
        i -=1
    if i >=0:
        result.append(s[:i+1])
    else:
        result.append('')

Wait, but what if the separator is '/' and the string is 'a//b//'? The code would find 'b' and slice to 'a//b'.

Yes, that's correct.

So, now, putting it all together.

First, handle the None case.

Then, determine the separator.

Then, loop through each string and process.

Now, let's write the code.

Import sys.

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    # determine separator
    if sys.platform == 'win32':
        separator = '\\'
    elif sys.platform == 'linux' or sys.platform == 'darwin':
        separator = '/'
    else:
        # handle other cases, but for now, default to '/'
        separator = '/'
    result = []
    for s in input_list:
        if len(s) <=1:
            result.append(s)
        else:
            # find the last non-separator character
            i = len(s) -1
            while i >=0 and s[i] == separator:
                i -=1
            if i >=0:
                result.append(s[:i+1])
            else:
                result.append('')
    return result

Wait, but what about the case where the separator is '/' and the string is 'a/b/c//'? The code would find 'c' and slice to 'a/b/c', which is correct.

Testing the function with the test case I thought earlier:

Test case 1:
input_list = ['file.txt', 'folder/', 'dir\\', 'subdir//', '']
Expected output: ['file.txt', 'folder', 'dir', 'subdir', '']

Let's see:

- 'file.txt' → len>1, last char is 't' → no change
- 'folder/' → len>1, last char '/', so i would be 5 (assuming 'folder' is 6 letters, index 5 is 'r', then '/' at 6. So i starts at 6, s[6] is '/', so i becomes 5. s[5] is 'r' → append 'folder'
- 'dir\\' → len>1, last char '\', so i becomes 2 (since 'dir\\' is 'd','i','r','\', so i starts at 3, which is '\', so i becomes 2. s[2] is 'r' → append 'dir'
- 'subdir//' → len>1, last char '/', so i starts at 6 (assuming 'subdir' is 7 letters, index 6 is 'r', then two '/', so i becomes 6, then check s[6] is 'r' → append 'subdir'
- '' → added as is

So the output is as expected.

Another test case: ['a/b/', 'c\\d\\', 'e', 'f//']
Expected output: ['a/b', 'c\\d', 'e', 'f']

Wait, no. Because in the code, for 'f//', the last char is '/', so i becomes 2 (since 'f//' is 'f','/','/', so i starts at 2, which is '/', so i becomes 1, which is '/', then i becomes 0. s[0] is 'f', which is not '/', so append 'f'

Wait, no. Let's see:

s = 'f//'
len(s) is 3
i starts at 2, s[2] is '/', so i becomes 1
s[1] is '/', i becomes 0
s[0] is 'f' which is not '/', so append s[:1] → 'f'

Yes, so 'f//' becomes 'f'

But earlier, I thought that the code would remove all trailing separators, but in this case, it only removes the last character if it's a separator. Wait, no, in this case, the code removes all trailing separators because it's looping from the end until it finds a non-separator.

Wait, no. Let's take 'f//':

i starts at 2, which is '/', so i becomes 1
i=1, s[1] is '/', so i becomes 0
s[0] is 'f', which is not '/', so the loop stops. So the result is s[:1], which is 'f'

So the code removes all trailing separators, not just the last one.

Wait, no. Because in the code, it's checking each character from the end until it finds a non-separator. So for 'f//', the code would slice up to index 0+1=1, which is 'f', thus removing both '/'s.

Wait, but in the code, for 'f//', i starts at 2, which is '/', so i becomes 1, which is '/', i becomes 0, which is 'f' → loop stops. So the substring is s[:1], which is 'f'.

So yes, the code correctly removes all trailing separators.

Wait, but in the code, the while loop continues as long as s[i] == separator. So for 'f//', it goes from 2 to 1 to 0, and then stops because s[0] is 'f' which is not '/'. So the substring is from 0 to i+1, which is 0 to 1, so 'f'.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code seems to handle that correctly.

Another test case: 'test/abc' → the last character is 'c', so no change.

So, the code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, what about empty strings or None? The function handles None by returning an empty list. For empty strings, they are added as is.

I think this should cover the cases.

So, the final code is as written above.
