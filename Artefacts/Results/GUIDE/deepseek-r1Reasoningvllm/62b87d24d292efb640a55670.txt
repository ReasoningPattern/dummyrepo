Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_versions(), and it's supposed to obtain version information. If it can't get the version info, it returns the default value. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should create unit tests first before writing the actual code.

First, I'll think about what the function needs to do. It should retrieve version info, which usually includes major, minor, micro, and maybe other parts like release candidates or serial numbers. But since the specifics aren't provided, I'll design it to return a tuple with major, minor, and micro versions, and a string for the release level.

I'll start by outlining the function. It should return a tuple like (major, minor, micro, releaselevel) or a default if it can't get the info. The default could be (0, 0, 0, 'alpha') as a placeholder.

Next, I'll consider how to obtain the version information. A common method is using the __version__ attribute of the module or class the function is called on. So, I'll have the function return self.__versions or the default if it doesn't exist.

Now, for the unit tests. I'll need to test different scenarios: when the version exists, when it doesn't, when the version is None, and when it's an empty string. Each test case should assert that the function returns the expected default or the correct version info.

I'll structure the tests using the unittest framework. I'll create a TestGetVersions class with methods for each test case. Each test will mock the __versions__ attribute to simulate different scenarios.

Wait, but in the code example provided, the function doesn't import unittest. So I should include that in the imports at the top. Also, the tests should be written using the @classmethod decorator to avoid setup issues.

Putting it all together, I'll write the imports, the get_versions function, and then the unit tests. I'll make sure the tests cover all possible cases and that each test is properly annotated.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll translate this into code, making sure to follow the structure and include all necessary parts.
