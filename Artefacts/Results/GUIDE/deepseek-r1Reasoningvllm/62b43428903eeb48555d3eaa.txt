Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called formatmany and it's part of a class, so it's a method. The method takes two arguments: sql, which is a string, and many_params, which is an iterable of either dictionaries or sequences. The function returns a tuple containing a formatted SQL string and a list of dictionaries or sequences.

The docstring says that this method converts sql using self._converter.convert_many. So I'm guessing that the _converter has a method called convert_many that handles the conversion logic. The function needs to apply this converter to each element in many_params.

First, I'll think about the parameters. The many_params can be a list of dictionaries or a list of lists or tuples. So the function needs to handle both cases. I'll probably have to check the type of each element in many_params to determine how to process it.

Next, I need to process each parameter. For each item in many_params, if it's a dictionary, I'll convert it using the converter. If it's a sequence, I'll convert each element. Wait, no, the converter probably handles the conversion of the entire sequence. So maybe I should pass each sequence as a single argument to the converter.

Wait, looking back, the function signature shows that many_params is an Iterable of either Dicts or Sequences. So each element in many_params is either a dict or a sequence. The converter's convert_many method probably expects a list of parameters, each of which can be a dict or a sequence. So perhaps I can directly pass each item in many_params to the converter.

So the steps are: for each param in many_params, convert it using self._converter.convert_many, then collect all the converted params. Then, return the formatted sql string and the list of converted params.

Wait, but the converter's convert_many might take multiple arguments, not just a list. Or maybe it's designed to handle each param as a single argument. So perhaps the function should pass each param as a separate argument to the converter.

Wait, no, the function is called formatmany, and the docstring says it uses self._converter.convert_many. So perhaps the converter's method is designed to take multiple parameters, maybe as *args, and then returns the converted SQL and the converted parameters.

So in that case, the formatmany function would call self._converter.convert_many with the sql and the many_params as *args.

Wait, but the function signature shows that many_params is an Iterable, so it's a single argument. So when calling self._converter.convert_many, it would be passed as many_params. But I'm not sure about the method's signature. Maybe the converter's convert_many takes sql and then an iterable of params.

Alternatively, perhaps the converter's method expects the params as *args. So the formatmany function would need to unpack many_params into the converter.

But without knowing the exact implementation of the converter, it's a bit tricky. However, based on the function's return type, it's returning a tuple of the formatted sql and the converted params. So the function is likely doing something like:

formatted_sql, converted_params = self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But wait, the converter's method might take the sql as the first argument and then the params. So in that case, the function would directly pass sql and many_params to the converter.

So putting it all together, the function would look like this: it takes sql and many_params, then calls the converter's convert_many method, which returns the formatted sql and the converted params. Then, it returns them as a tuple.

I should also consider edge cases, like if many_params is empty or contains None, but the function seems to expect that the converter handles those cases.

So the code would be straightforward: call the converter's method and return the result.
