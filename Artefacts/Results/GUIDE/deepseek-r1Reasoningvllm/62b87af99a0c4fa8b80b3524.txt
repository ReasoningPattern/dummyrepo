Okay, so I need to write a Python function called is_run_el that checks whether a given object's class has the run method. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it checks if the obj's class has the run method. So, the function takes an object as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the run method exists in the object's class.

Wait, but in Python, sometimes people use classes and sometimes objects. So, if someone passes a class instead of an object, does the run method exist? Well, the function should probably work regardless of whether obj is a class or an instance.

But how do I check if a method exists in a class? Oh right, I can use the hasattr() function. So, I can get the class of the object using type(obj), and then check if 'run' is in the attributes of that class.

Wait, but what if the object is not an instance of a class that has run? Or maybe the run method is in a superclass? Hmm, the problem says to check whether the obj class has the run method. So, I think it's a straightforward check: does the class of obj have a method named run.

So, the steps are: get the class of obj, then check if 'run' is an attribute of that class.

Let me think about possible test cases. For example, if obj is an instance of a class that has a run method, it should return True. If it's an instance of a class that doesn't have run, return False. Also, if obj is a class itself, like type, then hasattr(type, 'run') would check if the class type has a run method, which it doesn't, so it would return False.

Wait, but in the case where obj is a class, type(obj) would be type, and checking if type has a run method would be False. But if someone passes a class that has a run method, like a subclass of type, then it would return True.

So, the function should work whether obj is an instance or a class.

Putting it all together, the function can be written as:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(type(obj), 'run')

But wait, maybe I should also consider if the method is inherited from a superclass. For example, if the class doesn't have run, but a superclass does. Does hasattr() check all inherited attributes? No, because by default, hasattr() only checks the direct attributes, not the ones inherited from superclasses. So, if a class inherits run from a superclass, hasattr() would return False because it's not directly defined in the class.

But the problem statement says to check whether the obj class has the run method. So, if run is inherited, should it return True or False? The problem isn't clear on that. The initial approach just checks for the presence of the method in the class, not considering inheritance.

Alternatively, maybe the function should check if run exists in any of the class's base classes, including those from the hierarchy. To do that, we might need to traverse the MRO and check each class.

But that might complicate things. The problem says "check whether the obj class has the run method," which I think refers to whether the class directly has the method, not whether it's inherited. So, the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but in the test-driven approach, maybe I should write tests for both cases. For example, one test where the class has run, another where it's inherited.

But the function as written would return False for the inherited case. So, if the problem expects it to return True when run is inherited, then the function needs to be adjusted.

But given the problem statement, I think the intended functionality is to check if the class has the run method, regardless of whether it's inherited or not. Wait, no, the function is supposed to check if the class has the run method. So, if the run method is in a superclass, the class itself doesn't have it, so the function would return False.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the function is about the class, not the instance. So, if a class inherits run from a superclass, then the class does not have its own run method, so the function should return False.

But maybe the intended use is that the run method is part of the class's methods, not necessarily the instance's. So, the initial code is correct.

So, the function is as simple as using hasattr(type(obj), 'run').

Wait, but what if the obj is not a class? Like, if obj is an integer or some other type. Then type(obj) would be int, and checking if int has run would be False, which is correct because integers don't have run methods.

So, the function should handle all cases correctly.

Therefore, the code is:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(type(obj), 'run')

I think that's the solution. Now, considering test cases:

Test case 1: obj is an instance of a class that has run method.
- e.g., class MyClass: def run(self): pass
- is_run_el(MyClass()) should return True.

Test case 2: obj is an instance of a class without run method.
- e.g., class MyOtherClass: pass
- is_run_el(MyOtherClass()) should return False.

Test case 3: obj is a class itself.
- e.g., MyClass is a class, so type(MyClass) is MyClass.
- is_run_el(MyClass) should return True if MyClass has run.

Test case 4: obj is a built-in type, like int.
- is_run_el(int) should return False.

This covers the cases. So, the function is correct.
