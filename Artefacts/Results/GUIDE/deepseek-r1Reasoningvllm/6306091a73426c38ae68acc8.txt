Okay, I need to write a Python function called list_of_file_names that takes two arguments: settings_dirs and spec_option. The function is supposed to create and return a new IniType complex type using cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

First, I should figure out what IniType is. From what I remember, it's a Python library used for parsing configuration files, especially INI files. The function cli.ListOfFileNames() probably generates a list of file names, which IniType can then parse.

I think I need to import both IniType and cli. So I'll start by importing those.

Next, I need to create an instance of IniType. Looking at the cli.ListOfFileNames() function, it might take parameters like a directory and a list of filenames. So I should pass the settings_dirs and spec_option to it.

Wait, I should check how cli.ListOfFileNames() is structured. Maybe it's something like ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, filenames=spec_option). I'll structure it that way.

So putting it together, I'll import IniType and cli. Then, create a new IniType instance by calling ListOfFileNames with the given arguments.

I should also consider any necessary imports, like from .IniType import IniType and from cli import ListOfFileNames.

Putting it all together, the function should return the newly created IniType instance.

I think that's the main logic. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
