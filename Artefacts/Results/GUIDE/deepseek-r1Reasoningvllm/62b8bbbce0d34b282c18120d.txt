Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_file_exist that checks if a given file_name exists. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider what it means for a file to exist. It could mean the file exists in the current directory, or in any directory relative to the script. So, I should use os.path.exists, which checks for the file in the correct location.

Wait, but sometimes people might pass a relative path, and I want to make sure it's checked relative to where the script is running. Using os.path.exists should handle that correctly because it resolves the path relative to the current working directory.

Next, I should think about the function's return value. It should return True if the file exists and False otherwise. So, the function is straightforward.

Now, considering unit tests. I should write comprehensive tests to cover different scenarios. Let me list possible test cases:

1. Test with a non-existent file name.
2. Test with a file that exists in the current directory.
3. Test with a file that exists in a subdirectory.
4. Test with a file that exists but is a directory (since os.path.exists returns True for directories).
5. Test with a symbolic link to a file.
6. Test with a relative path.
7. Test with a special directory like '.' or '..'.

Wait, for test case 4, if the file is a directory, does the function consider it as existing? The user's docstring says it's checking for a file, so perhaps we should exclude directories. Hmm, the current function using os.path.exists would return True for directories, which might not be what the user expects. The user's function is named is_file_exist, so maybe it should return False for directories.

But the user didn't specify, so maybe the function should just check if the file exists, regardless of whether it's a file or directory. So, I'll proceed with using os.path.exists as is.

Now, writing the test cases. I'll need to import os and unittest. Then, create a test class with methods for each test case.

Wait, but in the code, I should only output the function and the test code. So, I'll structure it with the function and then the test class.

Wait, the user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So, I'll write the function, then the test cases.

Let me draft the function first:

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.exists(file_name)

That's simple. Now, the test cases. I'll create a TestFileExist class.

In the test cases, I'll use a setup method to create some files and directories temporarily. Then, for each test case, I'll call the function and assert the expected result.

For example:

def test_is_file_exist_with_non_existent_file():
    assert is_file_exist("nonexistent.txt") is False

And similar for other cases.

Wait, but for test case 4, if the function returns True for a directory, but the user expects it to return False, then the function would be incorrect. So, perhaps the function should check if it's a file, not just exists. But the user's docstring says it's checking for a file, so maybe the function should return False for directories.

Hmm, that complicates things. So, maybe I should modify the function to check if the file exists and is a file, not a directory or link.

So, the function would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.exists(file_name) and os.path.isfile(file_name)

Wait, but os.path.isfile returns False for symlinks, so if the user's intention is to consider symlinks as existing files, this might not be desired. But since the user's function is called is_file_exist, it's probably better to check if it's a file, not just exists.

So, I'll adjust the function to use os.path.isfile.

But then, the test cases need to reflect that. For example, a directory should return False.

So, I'll write test cases for that.

Putting it all together, the function and tests would look like that.
