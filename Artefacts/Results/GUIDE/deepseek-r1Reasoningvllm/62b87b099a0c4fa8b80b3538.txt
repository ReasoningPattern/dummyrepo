Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_request_el based on the given docstring and function signature. The docstring says it checks whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes. 

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. It should verify if the object has both 'fill' and 'request' attributes. Wait, but in Python, checking for attributes can be tricky because it depends on whether the object is an instance or the class. The function name is a bit confusing because it's named 'is_fill_request_el', which might imply a boolean result, but the docstring says it checks for the presence of attributes. Hmm, maybe the function is intended to check if the object has those attributes, and returns a boolean accordingly.

So, the function should take an object as an argument and return True if both 'fill' and 'request' attributes are present on the object's class or instance. Otherwise, it returns False.

To do this, I can use the hasattr() function in Python. hasattr(obj, 'fill') checks if 'fill' exists in the object's attributes. Similarly, hasattr(obj, 'request') does the same for 'request'. The function should return True only if both conditions are met.

I should also consider cases where the attributes are present but are None. For example, if 'fill' exists but is None, should the function return False? The problem statement doesn't specify, so I think the safest approach is to check for the presence of the attributes, regardless of their value.

Next, I need to write unit tests to cover different scenarios. The user mentioned a test-driven development approach, so I should create comprehensive tests. 

Let's outline the test cases:

1. Object with both fill and request attributes: should return True.
2. Object with only fill, not request: should return False.
3. Object with only request, not fill: should return False.
4. Object without any of the attributes: should return False.
5. Object where either fill or request is None: should return False.

Wait, but in case 5, if an attribute is present but None, should it be considered as present? For example, if 'fill' is None, is it considered as having the attribute? I think the function should return False in such cases because the attribute doesn't exist. But perhaps the user expects that if the attribute exists, regardless of its value, it's considered. So, in that case, if 'fill' is None, it's still True because the attribute exists.

But the function's purpose is to check if the attributes are present, not their values. So, the function should return True if both attributes exist, regardless of their values.

Wait, but in the test cases, if an attribute is None, the function should return True because the attribute exists. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify.

The function is_fill_request_el is supposed to check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes. So, if the attribute exists, regardless of its value, the function returns True. Only if both are missing does it return False.

So, in the test case where an attribute is None, the function should still return True.

Wait, but looking back at the initial problem statement: the docstring says it checks whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes. So, the function is checking for the presence of the attributes, not their values.

So, in the test case where either is None, the function should return True because the attributes exist.

But the initial assistant response I saw earlier returned False in such cases, which might be incorrect. Let me think again.

If the function is supposed to check if the attributes exist, regardless of their value, then the function should return True even if they are None.

So, the correct test cases would be:

1. Both attributes exist: return True.
2. Only fill exists: return False.
3. Only request exists: return False.
4. Neither exists: return False.
5. Either attribute is None: return True (since the attribute exists).

Wait, but in the initial response, the function returned False when either was None, which might not be correct. I think the function should return True as long as both attributes are present, regardless of their values.

So, in the code, the function should return True if both hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request') are True, regardless of the values of fill and request.

Therefore, the code would be:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request')

And the unit tests would be:

- Test case 1: obj has both fill and request → True.
- Test case 2: obj has only fill → False.
- Test case 3: obj has only request → False.
- Test case 4: obj has neither → False.
- Test case 5: obj has fill=None → True.

Wait, but the initial code in the assistant's response returned False in cases where either was None, which is incorrect. So, I think the correct code should return True if both attributes exist, regardless of their values.

So, the code should be as I wrote above, and the unit tests should reflect that.

I think that's the correct approach. I'll proceed to write the code accordingly.
