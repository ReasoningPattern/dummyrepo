Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _parse_image_ref, and it takes an image_href as a string and returns a tuple of three elements: image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. It also raises a ValueError if something goes wrong.

First, I should think about what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions parsing an image href, so I'm assuming it's dealing with an HTTP or HTTPS URL. The function needs to extract the image ID, the network location (netloc), and determine if SSL is being used.

I remember that urllib has functions for parsing URLs. Maybe I can use urllib.parse to break down the URL. Specifically, urlparse might be useful here. Let me check how that works. The urlparse function returns a named tuple with attributes like scheme, netloc, path, etc.

So, the first step is to import urlparse from urllib.parse. Wait, in Python 3, it's actually from urllib.parse import urlparse. I'll make sure to import that.

Next, I'll define the function. The parameter is image_href, a string. The function will try to parse this string. I'll assign the result of urlparse to a variable, maybe called parsed_url.

Now, I need to extract the components. The netloc should be straightforward; it's parsed_url.netloc. The scheme can be used to determine if SSL is used. The scheme is either 'http' or 'https'. If it's 'http', then use_ssl should be False; if it's 'https', then it should be True. If the scheme isn't http or https, maybe we should raise a ValueError.

The image_id is a bit trickier. I think the path part of the URL might not always have the image ID. Maybe the query parameters do. So perhaps I need to look into the query part of the URL. Using parsed_url.query, I can parse the query string to find the image_id.

Wait, but what if the image_href doesn't have a query string? Then parsed_url.query would be None or an empty string. In that case, maybe the image_id isn't present, but according to the function's return type, it should be a string. Hmm, perhaps the function expects the image_id to be present, or maybe it's optional. The docstring doesn't specify, so I'll assume that the image_id is always present.

So, I'll parse the query string. Using urlparse's parse_qs function, I can get a dictionary of query parameters. Then, I can look for a key 'image_id' in that dictionary. If it exists, take its value; if not, maybe raise a ValueError or return an empty string. But since the function returns a tuple of three elements, perhaps the image_id is mandatory.

Putting it all together, the steps are:

1. Parse the image_href using urlparse.
2. Extract netloc and scheme.
3. Determine use_ssl based on the scheme.
4. Extract image_id from the query parameters.

I should also handle cases where parsing fails, like if image_href is invalid. That's where the ValueError comes in.

Now, writing the code:

- Import urlparse.
- Define the function.
- Try to parse the URL.
- Check if the scheme is http or https to set use_ssl.
- Extract image_id from the query parameters.
- Handle exceptions and raise ValueError if something goes wrong.

Wait, but what if the query string is empty or the image_id isn't present? I should probably raise a ValueError in those cases to indicate an invalid image reference.

So, in the code, after extracting image_id, I'll check if it's present. If not, raise ValueError.

Also, I should make sure that the function returns the correct types. image_id should be a string, netloc should be a string, and use_ssl should be a boolean.

Testing the function with some examples would help. For instance:

- "http://example.com/image.jpg" should return ('image.jpg', 'example.com', False)
- "https://example.com/image.png" should return ('image.png', 'example.com', True)

If the image_href is something like "ftp://example.com/image.png", then the scheme is ftp, so use_ssl should be False, but maybe that's not intended. Perhaps the function should only handle http and https. So, if the scheme is neither, raise ValueError.

Another case: "http://example.com?param=1&image_id=abc" should return ('abc', 'example.com', False).

If the query string doesn't have image_id, like "http://example.com?param=1", then image_id would be None, which isn't a string, so we raise ValueError.

I think that covers the main cases. Now, writing the code accordingly.
