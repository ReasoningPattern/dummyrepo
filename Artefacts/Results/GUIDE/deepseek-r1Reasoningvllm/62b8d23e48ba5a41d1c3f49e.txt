Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and is part of a class. The docstring says it should find, remove, and return a random (key, value) pair using __choice in the class.

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. It needs to select a random item from the underlying data structure, remove it, and return the key-value pair. The class probably has a structure like a dictionary or something similar, so I'll assume it has keys and values accessible via self.keys() and self.values().

Wait, but in Python, if I try to iterate over a dictionary while modifying it, I can get into trouble. So I need to make sure that when I call popitem, it's done in a way that doesn't cause issues. Maybe using a list to collect the items first would help, so that I can iterate over a copy and then handle the removal safely.

So the steps I need to take are:
1. Collect all the key-value pairs into a list.
2. Use random.choice to pick one pair.
3. Remove that pair from the data structure.
4. Return the selected pair.

I'll start by importing the random module. Then, I'll write the function. Inside the function, I'll create a list comprehension that zips self.keys() and self.values(), which gives me a list of tuples. Then, I'll use random.choice to get one of these tuples.

Next, I need to remove that specific key-value pair from the class. Since the data structure might be a dictionary, I can just delete the key using the key from the tuple. So I'll extract the key and call self.pop with that key.

Finally, I'll return the selected value and key as a tuple.

Wait, but what if the data structure isn't a dictionary? Maybe I should make sure that the keys and values can be iterated and that popping by key is safe. But since the function is part of a class and the user is using it, I'll assume that the underlying data allows for this.

Now, considering unit tests: I should write tests to ensure that popitem behaves correctly. I'll test that after calling popitem, the returned key is present in the original data, the value is correct, and that the key is removed. Also, I'll test that if the data is empty, it doesn't raise an error.

I'll structure the tests using the unittest framework. I'll create a test class with setup and teardown methods. The setup will create an instance of the class with some initial data. The teardown will clean up the instance.

In each test case, I'll call popitem, check that the key and value are correct, and that the key is no longer in the data. I'll also handle exceptions to catch any errors when the data is empty.

Putting it all together, I'll write the code with the import, the function, and the unit tests. I'll make sure the code is properly indented and follows Python conventions.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
