Okay, I need to write a Python function called int_to_string that converts a number into a string using a given alphabet. The function takes three parameters: number, alphabet, and padding, which is optional. The docstring explains that this function converts a number into a string similar to a short UUID, with the most significant digit first. 

First, I should think about what a UUID is. A UUID typically has 128 bits, but since this function is called with a padding parameter, it might handle different lengths. The padding parameter probably determines how many leading characters to add if the number doesn't fill up the entire length when converted to the alphabet.

I need to generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the code. So, I'll outline test cases to ensure the function works correctly. 

Let's start with the simplest case: when the number is zero. The output should just be the first character of the alphabet. Then, for a small number, like 1, it should return the second character. 

Next, I'll consider the case where padding is specified. For example, if padding is 2, the output should have two characters, possibly adding a leading character if necessary. 

I should also test when the number is larger than the maximum value that can be represented by the alphabet and padding. This would require more characters, so the function should handle that by extending the string.

Another important case is when the number is exactly the maximum value for the given alphabet and padding. The function should return a string of the correct length without any padding.

I'll also test invalid inputs, such as a negative number or an alphabet that's empty. The function should handle these gracefully, perhaps by returning an empty string or raising an error.

Once the tests are written, I can proceed to implement the function. The steps I'll take in the code are:

1. Check if the alphabet is empty. If it is, return an empty string.
2. Determine the maximum value the alphabet can represent. This is typically 36^len(alphabet) - 1, but if padding is provided, it might be different.
3. If padding is provided, calculate the required length of the string. If the number's required length exceeds padding, pad with the first character of the alphabet.
4. Convert the number into the string using the alphabet, ensuring that the most significant digit comes first.
5. Handle edge cases like when the number is zero or when padding is larger than needed.

I'll make sure to include error handling for invalid inputs and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios. Finally, I'll write the code and then the unit tests to verify everything works as intended.
