Okay, I need to write a Python function called hist_to_graph based on the provided docstring and tips. The function is supposed to convert a histogram into a graph, using various parameters to customize the output.

First, I'll start by understanding the parameters. The function takes a hist, which is a histogram object, and several optional parameters: make_value, get_coordinate, field_names, and scale.

The docstring explains that make_value is a function that sets the value of a graph's point. By default, it's bin content. So, if make_value is None, it uses the bin content. But if it's provided, it should process the bin data into something suitable for the graph, like error bars.

Next, get_coordinate determines where the point's coordinate is taken from. It can be "left", "right", or "middle". This affects how the bin's position is calculated, which is important for histograms with variable bin widths.

Field_names are the names of the fields in the graph's data. The number of fields must match the dimension of the result. For example, if the graph is 2D, field_names should have two elements. This is useful when the make_value returns a tuple of values.

Scale is optional and defaults to None. If it's True, it uses the histogram's scale. Otherwise, it uses the default. The scale might affect how the values are normalized or transformed in the graph.

Now, I'll outline the steps the function needs to perform:

1. Determine the coordinate for each bin. This depends on get_coordinate. For "left", the coordinate is the lower edge of the bin. For "right", it's the upper edge. For "middle", it's the center.

2. Calculate the position of each bin. If the bins are contiguous, the position is straightforward. If they're not, the position is the lower edge plus half the width, which is typical for variable-width histograms.

3. For each bin, apply make_value to get the graph data. If make_value is None, it just takes the bin content. Otherwise, it processes the bin's data (which might have context like errors) into the desired fields.

4. Determine the scale. If scale is True, it uses the histogram's scale. Otherwise, it uses the default scale provided by the plotting library.

5. Create the graph data by combining the coordinates and the processed values. The graph should have a shape that matches the number of bins and the field_names.

6. Finally, construct the graph using the created data and the determined scale.

I'll need to handle different cases, especially when the histogram has variable-width bins. Calculating the position correctly is crucial for accurate visualization.

I should also consider edge cases, like when the histogram has no bins or only one bin. The function should handle these gracefully without errors.

Testing is important. The tips suggest using a test-driven development approach, so I'll need to write comprehensive unit tests. Each test case will cover different scenarios, such as different get_coordinate values, various make_value functions, and different scale settings.

In terms of code structure, I'll start by importing necessary modules, like numpy for handling numeric operations and unittest for testing. Then, I'll define the function, making sure to handle each parameter correctly.

For the coordinate calculation, I'll use the lower edge for "left", upper edge for "right", and the center for "middle". If the bins are variable width, I'll adjust the position accordingly.

When applying make_value, I'll ensure it's called with the correct context. If make_value expects a single value without context, it should still work because the hist's bins are numeric without context.

Handling the scale properly is another key point. If scale is True, I'll apply the histogram's scale to the data. Otherwise, I'll use the default scale, which might be logarithmic or linear based on the plotting library's defaults.

Putting it all together, the function will process each bin, compute the necessary values, and construct the graph data structure that can be used by the plotting library.

I should also think about error handling. What if the hist has bins with non-numeric data? The function should either handle it or raise an appropriate error. Since the docstring says hist must contain only numeric bins or make_value must handle context, I'll assume that the hist is valid.

Finally, I'll write the code, making sure to include comments and docstrings for clarity. The tests will help ensure that each part works as expected.
