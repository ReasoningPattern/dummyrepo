Alright, I need to write a Python function called files_list_from_zipfile that takes a zip_path as an argument and returns the files in that zip. The user mentioned using a test-driven approach, so I should first think about what test cases I should write before coding.

First, I'll consider the simplest case. If the zip_path is an empty string, the function should return an empty list. That makes sense because there are no files to extract.

Next, I'll think about a normal zip file. I'll create a test where the zip contains some files, like 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt', and 'anotherfile.txt'. The function should return a list containing these filenames.

Another important case is when the zip_path doesn't exist. In this scenario, the function should return None. So I'll include a test where the zip_path is a non-existent file, and assert that the result is None.

Now, considering how to actually extract the files from the zip. I remember that the zipfile module in Python can be used for this. I'll need to open the zip file in read mode and then extract all the entries. Using openzip opener is a good practice because it handles the closing properly.

I should also handle exceptions, but since the function is supposed to return the list of files, maybe I can let it raise exceptions naturally when the zip is invalid or doesn't exist.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code with these test cases in mind. I'll define the function, then write the test cases using pytest syntax. I'll make sure to import the necessary modules like io, zipfile, and unittest.mock for mocking if needed.

Wait, but the user didn't specify using pytest, so maybe I should just write the function with the test cases embedded. Alternatively, perhaps using the unittest framework. Hmm, but the main task is to generate the function code based on the signature and docstring, so maybe the test cases are just for my own understanding.

In any case, the function will use ZipFile from zipfile, open the file, and extract all the entries, returning their names as a list. I'll also include error handling, like catching exceptions to return None if something goes wrong, but perhaps that's beyond the scope. The user just wants the function to return the files, so I'll proceed.

So, the function will open the zip, extract all entries, and return the list. I'll make sure to close the file properly. Also, if the zip is empty, it should return an empty list.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
