Alright, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called oneline, and it takes a script and a separator which defaults to " && ". The docstring explains that it converts a script into a one-line command using the given separator. 

First, I should think about what the function needs to do. It should take the script, which is a string, and split it into parts. Then, it should join those parts using the separator. But wait, how is the script structured? Is it a list of commands or a string with newlines separating them? The example given in the initial response suggests that script is a list, so I'll assume that.

So, the function needs to handle cases where script is a list. If script is empty, maybe it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it joins the elements with the separator. But I should also consider edge cases. For example, if the separator is just a space, the output should be the commands joined with a single space. 

Next, I should think about the unit tests. The user mentioned using a test-driven approach, so I'll create tests to cover different scenarios. I'll test an empty script, a script with one command, multiple commands, and different separators. Also, I'll check if the function handles cases where the separator is not " && ".

Wait, the function's default separator is " && ", so in tests, I should include that case. Also, what if the separator is an empty string? The function should probably handle that by joining without any separators, but maybe that's beyond the initial scope. For now, I'll focus on the given default and empty script cases.

Now, writing the code. The function will take script and separator as arguments. It will check if script is empty or None. If so, return an empty string. Otherwise, join the script elements with the separator. 

Testing this logic: if script is ["ls", "git", "rm"], with default separator, it should return "ls && git && rm". If the separator is " || ", it should be "ls || git || rm". If script is empty, return "".

I should also handle cases where script is not a list. But according to the function signature, script is a str, so maybe it's expected to be a string. Wait, no, the initial example shows script as a list. Hmm, maybe the function is intended to take a list of commands. So, the code should assume that script is a list. Therefore, in the function, if script is None or an empty list, return empty string.

Putting it all together, the function will be:

def oneline(script, separator=" && "):
    if not script:
        return ""
    return separator.join(script)

For the unit tests, I'll write test cases using pytest. The tests will cover various scenarios: empty script, script with one command, multiple commands, different separators, and even an empty separator. Also, I'll test if the function returns an empty string when script is None or an empty list.

Wait, in the initial code, the function was returning an empty string when script is None. But in the function definition, script is a str, so maybe it's better to handle cases where script is None by treating it as an empty list. Alternatively, perhaps the function should handle script being None by returning None or an empty string. But according to the initial code, it returns an empty string if script is None, so I'll follow that.

So, the test cases will include script being None, which should return empty string. Also, script being an empty list should return empty string. Testing with different separators, including an empty string, to see how the function behaves.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code and the test cases accordingly.
