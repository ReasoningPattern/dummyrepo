Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called protocol_handlers, and it takes a class and an optional protocol_version. The docstring says it returns a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers keyed by version tuples. If protocol_version is provided, it returns either zero or one item, depending on support. If not provided, all versions are returned.

First, I should think about what this function needs to do. It seems like it's part of a larger system, probably dealing with protocol handling, maybe for some kind of messaging system or data transfer.

The function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are version tuples and the values are handler classes. So, I need to manage different versions of handlers.

I remember that in Python, when you have multiple versions, you often use a version tuple, sometimes with a major version fixed and a minor version varying, like (3, 0) for major version 3, minor 0.

So, the function needs to check against these version tuples. But how? I think I need a way to determine which versions are supported. Maybe a version tuple like (3, 5, 0) would be the major version, and then the minor could be 5, and so on.

Wait, but the function is called with a class, so perhaps the class has information about the protocol version it supports. Or maybe the function needs to have predefined versions.

Hmm, the user mentioned that if protocol_version is provided, it returns zero or one item. So, if the provided version is in the supported versions, it returns that handler; else, nothing. If no version is provided, it returns all supported versions.

So, first, I need to determine which versions are supported. Maybe I should have a list of all possible protocol versions that the function knows about. But how? Because the function doesn't know all possible versions unless it's told.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a package that has a way to list all supported versions. Perhaps it's using a module-level list or a class attribute. But in the given code, it's not present. So, perhaps I need to generate all possible versions up to a certain major version.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate all versions starting from a certain point. For example, (3, 0) and above. But without knowing the exact versions, it's hard to list them.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a library that has a _get_supported_versions method or something. But in the given code, it's not included. So, maybe I need to assume that the function has a way to get the list of supported versions.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to generate all versions up to a certain point. For example, from (3, 0) to (3, 10). But that's speculative.

Wait, looking back at the problem, the user provided a function signature and a docstring, and they want me to generate the code. So, perhaps I should structure the code to handle this.

First, I need to collect all supported versions. Maybe the function has a class-level attribute or a module-level list. But in the given code, it's not present. So, perhaps I should create a list of versions that the function supports.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to generate all versions up to a certain point. For example, from (3, 0) to (3, 10). But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a library that's supposed to support all versions up to a certain point, so perhaps it's better to generate all possible versions from (3, 0) up to (3, 10). That would make sense for a protocol.

So, I can create a list of versions like [(3, 0), (3, 1), ..., (3, 10)]. Then, the function can check which of these are supported.

But wait, how do I know which versions are actually supported? Because the function is given a class, perhaps each handler class knows its own protocol version. So, maybe each handler class has a version attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return all handlers that are compatible with the given protocol_version. So, if protocol_version is None, it returns all, else returns the one that matches.

Wait, but the function is called protocol_handlers, which takes a cls parameter. So, perhaps the function is part of a class that has multiple handlers for different versions.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a Bolt protocol handler manager, which has multiple handlers for different versions. So, when the function is called with a class, it returns the handlers for that class's supported versions.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. The function needs to return a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes.
2. If protocol_version is provided, return handlers for that version if supported.
3. If not, return all supported versions.

But how does the function know which versions are supported? It must have some way of knowing which versions are available. Perhaps it's using a module-level list or a class attribute.

Wait, in the given code, the function is defined as def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):. So, the function takes a class and a protocol_version. But in the docstring, the function is supposed to return handlers for all versions if none are provided, or just the specified version if provided.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class that has multiple handler instances for different versions. So, when the function is called, it collects all handler classes that are registered for the supported versions.

But without knowing how the handlers are registered, it's hard to proceed. Maybe the function is supposed to create handler classes on the fly for each version, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check against a list of known versions. For example, if the function is part of a library that supports versions from (3, 0) to (3, 10), then the function can generate that list.

But the problem is that the function is given a class as the first argument. So, perhaps the class has a method or attribute that indicates which versions it supports. For example, the class might have a _get_supported_versions() method that returns a list of version tuples.

But since the given code doesn't have that, I have to make an assumption. Maybe the function is supposed to create handler classes for each version in a predefined list.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each version is a key, and the value is a handler class that's registered for that version.

Wait, but the function is called with a class as the first argument. So, perhaps the class is a base class, and the function is supposed to create handler classes for each version.

But that seems a bit unclear. Maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are version tuples, and the values are the handler classes that are registered for those versions.

But how does the function know which versions are registered? It must have some way of knowing that. Perhaps the function is part of a larger system where the versions are predefined.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to generate all possible versions up to a certain point, like (3, 10), and return handlers for each.

But without knowing, I have to make an assumption. Let's say that the function is supposed to support versions from (3, 0) up to (3, 10). So, I can create a list of versions like [(3, 0), (3, 1), ..., (3, 10)].

Then, for each version in this list, I can create a handler class. But how? Because the function is supposed to return the handler classes, but without knowing how to generate them, perhaps I should create dummy handler classes for each version.

But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each version is mapped to a placeholder handler class.

Wait, but the function's return type is a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. So, I need to create handler classes for each version.

But since the function is just a stub, perhaps the handler classes are already defined elsewhere, and the function is supposed to collect them.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each version is mapped to a handler class that's already defined.

But without knowing, I have to proceed with what I have.

So, perhaps the function can generate all versions starting from (3, 0) up to (3, 10). Then, for each version, create a handler class.

But how to create handler classes programmatically? Well, I can create a class for each version with a specific name, like BoltHandler3_0, BoltHandler3_1, etc.

But that might not be the best approach, but for the sake of generating code, perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the function can return a dictionary where each version is mapped to a base handler class, which can be extended or customized.

But again, without knowing, I have to make an assumption.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary of handler classes, each corresponding to a specific version. So, the function needs to collect all handler classes that are registered for the supported versions.

But since the function is given a class as the first argument, perhaps the class has a way to list its supported versions and handlers.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where the handlers are stored in a module-level dictionary, and the function is supposed to return that dictionary or a subset based on the protocol_version.

But again, without more information, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are version tuples, and the values are the handler classes for those versions. So, the function needs to collect all handler classes that are registered for the supported versions.

But how? Maybe the function is supposed to use a decorator or a metaclass to automatically collect handlers for each version.

But that's probably beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary that's predefined, with all the handler classes for each version.

But again, without knowing, I have to make an assumption.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class that has multiple handler methods, each corresponding to a version. So, when the function is called, it collects all handler classes that are present.

But without knowing the internal structure, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary of all handler classes, each keyed by their version.

But since the function is called with a class as the first argument, perhaps the class is the base class for all handlers, and each handler has a version attribute.

So, perhaps the function can iterate over all instances of the class and collect their versions, then group them by version.

But that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class that uses a metaclass to automatically collect handlers for each version. So, the function can return the dictionary of handlers based on the metaclass's state.

But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each version is a key, and the value is a placeholder handler class, like a base class that can be extended.

But that might be the way to go.

So, perhaps the function can generate handler classes for each version, each with a specific name, like BoltHandler3_0, BoltHandler3_1, etc.

But how to create these classes programmatically.

In Python, you can create a class dynamically using type(). So, for each version in the supported_versions list, I can create a new class with a name that includes the version tuple.

But wait, the version tuple is like (3, 5), so perhaps the class name can be something like 'BoltHandler_3_5'.

But the function's return type is a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. So, each handler class needs to be a proper class that can handle that version.

But without knowing what the handler classes are, perhaps I can create dummy classes for each version.

So, the plan is:

1. Determine the list of supported versions. For the sake of this example, let's assume versions from (3, 0) to (3, 10).

2. For each version in this list, create a handler class. Each handler class will have a version attribute that matches the version tuple.

3. Collect these handler classes into a dictionary, with the version tuple as the key.

4. If protocol_version is provided, check if it's in the supported versions. If yes, return the corresponding handler class. If not, return None. If protocol_version is None, return all the handler classes.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a dictionary, not a single class. So, when protocol_version is provided, it should return a dictionary with that version as the key and the handler class as the value. If multiple versions are supported, it should return all.

Wait, but the function's docstring says that if protocol_version is provided, it returns either zero or one item, depending on whether that version is supported. So, the function should return a dictionary with that version as the key and the handler class as the value, or an empty dictionary if the version is not supported.

Wait, no. Looking back, the docstring says: "if an explicit protocol version is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items, depending on whether that version is supported." So, the function returns a dictionary, which may have zero or one items.

Wait, but earlier, the function is supposed to return a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. So, if protocol_version is provided, it returns a dictionary with that version as the key and the handler class as the value, but only if that version is supported. Otherwise, it returns an empty dictionary.

Wait, but the function's return type is a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. So, when protocol_version is provided, the function returns a dictionary with possibly one entry. When it's not provided, it returns all supported versions.

So, the steps are:

- If protocol_version is not None:
   - Check if it's in the supported_versions.
   - If yes, return {protocol_version: HandlerClass}.
   - Else, return {}.
- Else:
   - Return a dictionary with all supported_versions as keys and their handler classes as values.

But how to get the supported_versions? Since the function is given a class, perhaps the class has a method to get the supported versions. But in the given code, there's no such method.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to generate all possible versions up to a certain point. For example, from (3, 0) to (3, 10).

So, perhaps I can generate these versions.

Let me think about how to generate all versions from (3, 0) to (3, 10).

I can write a helper function to generate all tuples starting with 3, followed by numbers from 0 to 10.

So, versions = [(3, v) for v in range(0, 11)]

That gives us 11 versions.

Then, for each version, create a handler class.

But how to create the handler classes? Each handler class needs to have a version attribute that matches the version.

So, for each version in versions, create a class with a version attribute set to that version.

For example:

class BoltHandler3_0:
    version = (3, 0)

class BoltHandler3_1:
    version = (3, 1)

and so on.

But writing all these classes manually is tedious. So, perhaps I can create them programmatically.

Using a loop, for each version in versions, create a class dynamically.

So, in code:

versions = [(3, v) for v in range(11)]
handler_dict = {}
for version in versions:
    # Create a handler class for this version
    handler_name = f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}"
    # Define the class with the version attribute
    class BoltHandler:
        version = version
    # Assign the class to the handler_dict with the version as key
    handler_dict[version] = BoltHandler

Wait, but this will create a single BoltHandler class for all versions, which is not correct. Because each version needs its own class.

So, I need to create a new class for each version.

So, perhaps:

handler_dict = {}
for version in versions:
    # Create a unique class name for each version
    class_name = f"BoltHandler_{version[0]}_{version[1]}"
    # Define the class inside a function to avoid NameError
    def create_handler_class(cls_name, version):
        class _BoltHandler:
            version = version
        return type(cls_name, (), {'_BoltHandler': _BoltHandler})
    handler_dict[version] = create_handler_class(class_name, version)()

Wait, that might work. But perhaps a better way is to use a closure to capture the version.

Alternatively, perhaps using a function that returns the class.

But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to use a metaclass or a factory function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create each class with a unique name and set the version attribute.

So, in code:

handler_dict = {}
for version in versions:
    # Generate a unique class name
    class_name = f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}"
    # Create the class
    class BoltHandler:
        version = version
    # Assign to the dictionary
    handler_dict[version] = BoltHandler

Wait, but this will create the same class for all versions, which is not correct. Because each version's handler class should be distinct.

Wait, no. Because each time the class is defined inside the loop, it's a new class. But the name will be the same each time, so it will overwrite the previous one. That's a problem.

So, I need to create a new class each time with a unique name.

So, perhaps using a closure or a function that returns a new class each time.

Alternatively, perhaps using a function that generates the class with the correct version.

Wait, perhaps I can use a function that returns a class with the version set.

So, here's an approach:

def create_handler_class(version):
    return type(f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}",
                (), {'version': version})

versions = [(3, v) for v in range(11)]
handler_dict = {}
for version in versions:
    handler_dict[version] = create_handler_class(version)()

Wait, but each time create_handler_class is called, it returns a new class with the version attribute set. So, this should create a new class for each version.

But in Python, when you create a class inside a loop, it's a new class each time. So, this should work.

But when I assign handler_dict[version] = create_handler_class(version)(), it's assigning the class object to the dictionary. So, each version has its own class.

Yes, that should work.

So, putting it all together:

First, generate the list of versions.

Then, for each version, create a handler class and add it to the dictionary.

Then, in the function, check if protocol_version is provided. If yes, check if it's in the supported_versions. If yes, return a dictionary with that version as the key and the handler class as the value. Else, return an empty dictionary. If protocol_version is None, return the handler_dict.

Wait, but the function's docstring says that if protocol_version is provided, it returns a dictionary with that version as the key and the handler class as the value, but only if that version is supported. Else, returns an empty dictionary.

So, the function can be structured as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    # Generate list of supported versions
    supported_versions = [(3, v) for v in range(11)]
    handler_dict = {}
    for version in supported_versions:
        # Create handler class for each version
        handler_name = f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}"
        class BoltHandler:
            version = version
        handler_dict[version] = BoltHandler
    # Now, check protocol_version
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if protocol_version in supported_versions:
            return {protocol_version: handler_dict[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        return handler_dict

Wait, but this code will create the same BoltHandler class for all versions, which is incorrect because each version should have its own class. So, the code above is wrong because it's redefining the same class each time.

Wait, no. Because each time the class is defined inside the loop, it's a new class. So, handler_dict will have for each version a different class. So, perhaps it's okay.

Wait, no. Because in the code above, the handler_dict is being populated with the same class object each time. Because the class is defined once, and then assigned to multiple keys.

Wait, no. Because each time the loop runs, it defines a new class with the same name, but each time it's assigned to a different key in handler_dict. So, handler_dict will have multiple classes with the same name but different versions.

Wait, no, because the class name is f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}", which is unique for each version.

Wait, no. Because in the code above, inside the loop, for each version, a new class is created with a name like "BoltHandler3_0", "BoltHandler3_1", etc. So, each time, the class is defined with a new name, and added to the handler_dict with that name as the key.

Wait, but the class is created inside the loop, so each iteration creates a new class. So, the code should create a new class for each version.

But when you create a class inside a loop, it's a new class each time, so the handler_dict should have each version mapped to its own class.

Yes, that should work.

But in the code I wrote earlier, the class is defined inside the loop, but the class name is set as f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}". So, each iteration creates a class with a unique name.

So, the code should work.

But wait, in the code, the class is defined inside the loop, but the function is called with a class as the first argument. So, the function is not using the class parameter. That's a problem.

Because the function is supposed to collect handler classes based on the supported versions, but the class parameter is not used in the code. So, perhaps the function is supposed to use the class's attributes to determine the supported versions.

But without knowing, perhaps the function is supposed to generate handler classes regardless of the input class.

So, perhaps the code I wrote is correct, but in reality, the function should use the input class to determine the supported versions.

But since the function is given a class as the first argument, perhaps the class has a method to get the supported versions.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to generate all possible versions, ignoring the input class.

But without more information, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary of handler classes, each corresponding to a version, and the handler classes are already defined elsewhere.

But in the given code, the function is empty, so I have to create the handler classes.

So, perhaps the code I wrote is acceptable.

But wait, in the code, the class is defined inside the loop, but the class name is "BoltHandler3_0", etc. So, when the function returns handler_dict, it's a dictionary mapping each version to a class with that version.

So, when the function is called with a class, it returns this dictionary.

But the function's docstring says that if protocol_version is provided, it returns either zero or one item, depending on whether that version is supported.

So, the function can be written as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    supported_versions = [(3, v) for v in range(11)]
    handler_dict = {}
    for version in supported_versions:
        # Create a unique handler class for each version
        class_name = f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}"
        # Define the class with the version attribute
        class BoltHandler:
            version = version
        handler_dict[version] = BoltHandler
    # Check if protocol_version is provided
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if protocol_version in supported_versions:
            return {protocol_version: handler_dict[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        return handler_dict

But wait, this code will create a new class for each version, each time with the same code inside. So, each class will have the same version attribute, but that's okay.

But when you create a class inside a loop, each iteration creates a new class with the same code. So, the class is defined each time, but the code inside is the same.

So, this should work.

But in Python, when you define a class inside a loop, it's redefined each time, so the handler_dict will have each version mapped to its own class.

Yes, that should be correct.

But when you run this code, each time the loop runs, a new class is created with the same code. So, the handler_dict will have multiple classes, each with the same code, but each with a unique class name.

So, this should work.

But wait, when you assign handler_dict[version] = BoltHandler, you're assigning the class object to the dictionary. So, each version has its own class.

Yes.

So, this code should generate a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes.

Then, when protocol_version is provided, it returns a dictionary with that version as the key and the handler class as the value, if supported. Else, returns an empty dictionary.

But wait, in the code above, the supported_versions is a fixed list. So, if the function is supposed to support versions beyond that, it won't. So, perhaps the function should generate versions up to a certain point, like (3, 10), or (3, 20).

But in the code, it's set to (3, v) for v in range(11), so versions from 0 to 10.

But perhaps the function is supposed to support versions up to (3, 10), which is reasonable.

So, the code seems correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me test it.

Suppose protocol_version is (3, 5). Then, the function should return a dictionary with key (3,5) and value the BoltHandler5 class.

If protocol_version is (3, 11), which is not in supported_versions, it returns empty.

If protocol_version is None, returns the full handler_dict.

Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, in the code, the function is using a fixed list of versions. But in reality, the supported versions might be determined by the class passed as the first argument.

But since the function is given a class, perhaps the class has a method to get the supported versions.

But in the given code, the function is empty, so perhaps the function is supposed to generate all possible versions, ignoring the class.

So, the code I wrote is correct.

But perhaps the function should use the class's attributes to determine the supported versions.

But without knowing, I can't proceed.

So, the code I wrote should be the solution.

But wait, in the code, the class is defined inside the loop, but the class name is f"BoltHandler{version[0]}_{version[1]}", which is unique for each version. So, each iteration creates a new class with that name.

So, the handler_dict will have each version mapped to its own class.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the code should work.

But perhaps the function can be written more cleanly.

Alternatively, perhaps using a closure to generate the classes.

But the code as written should work.

So, the final code is as above.
