Okay, I need to write a Python function called ttl_cache that acts as a decorator. It's supposed to memoize a function, but with a twist: each cached result has a time-to-live (TTL), and the least recently used items are evicted first. Also, the function is a decorator, so it should wrap the original function and return a callable.

First, I should think about the parameters. The function signature given is def ttl_cache(maxsize=128, ttl=600, timer=time(monotonic), typed=False). So, I need to handle all these parameters.

I remember that the standard library has a decorator called @functools.lru_cache, which uses an LRU strategy. But this is different because each item has its own TTL. So I can't just use that; I need to implement my own caching mechanism.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Initialize the cache**: I'll probably need a dictionary to store the results. Each key will be the argument tuple, and the value will be the result along with some metadata like the timestamp and TTL.

2. **Timestamp tracking**: The timer function is used to get the current time. By default, it's time.monotonic, which is good because it's always increasing. So I'll call timer() to get the current time when a function is called.

3. **Setting TTL**: For each cached result, I'll need to record when it was set and until when it expires. So each entry in the cache will be a tuple containing (args, result, set_time, ttl). The ttl parameter determines how long each entry stays.

4. **Evicting the LRU item**: When the cache exceeds maxsize, I need to remove the item that's been least recently used. That means I should find the entry with the oldest last access time.

5. **Memoization**: When the function is called, I check if the args are already in the cache. If they are, I update their last access time. If not, I add them, making sure not to exceed maxsize.

6. **Handling typed=False**: When typed is True, the decorator expects the function to return a specific type, and the cache uses the argument types to determine uniqueness. But since the user didn't specify handling that in detail, maybe I'll just focus on the basic case for now and handle it if needed later.

Now, considering unit tests, I should write tests to cover various scenarios:

- Test with maxsize 0 to ensure it raises an error.
- Test with ttl=0 to see if it evicts immediately.
- Test caching with different ttl values.
- Test the decorator with and without the typed parameter.
- Test when the function is called multiple times, ensuring only the maxsize items are kept.

I should also consider edge cases, like when the function is called with None as an argument or when the timer function returns None. But since the timer is supposed to return a monotonic value, I'll assume it's always a number.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the function as follows:

- Import functools for the wrapper.
- Create a cache dictionary inside the decorator function.
- In the wrapper, check if the arguments are in the cache.
- If present, update the timestamp and TTL.
- If not, add to the cache, removing the oldest entry if maxsize is reached.
- Return the cached result.

I should also make sure that the function is wrapped correctly and that the decorator can handle any arguments passed to the function.

Wait, I think I should use a helper class or a data structure that can efficiently manage the cache. But for simplicity, maybe a dictionary with tuples as keys will suffice, even though it's not the most efficient.

In the __init__ method of the decorator, I'll initialize the cache, maxsize, ttl, and timer. The __call__ method will handle the actual caching logic.

I should also consider that the timer function might not be time.monotonic, but the function should still work as intended, using whatever monotonic function is provided.

Another point is that the cache should be thread-safe if multiple threads call the function, but since decorators are single-threaded in this context, maybe it's not necessary unless specified.

I think I've covered the main points. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to include the necessary imports and handle all parameters correctly.
