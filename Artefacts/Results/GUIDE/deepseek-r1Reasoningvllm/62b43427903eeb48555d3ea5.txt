Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called format, and it's part of a class. The function takes two arguments: self, which is typical for a method, sql which is of type AnyStr, and params which is either a dictionary of Union[str, int] to Any or a Sequence[Any]. The function returns a tuple of AnyStr and the same type as the input params.

The docstring says that the function converts the sql using self._converter.convert. So I need to implement this logic.

First, I'll think about what this function needs to do. It should take the sql string, apply the _converter.convert method, and then return the modified sql string along with the processed parameters.

Wait, but how are the parameters processed? The params can be a dictionary or a sequence. If it's a dictionary, I need to convert the keys and values. If it's a sequence, maybe each element is processed similarly.

I should probably write some unit tests to cover different cases. For example, test with a dictionary where keys are strings and values are integers, and another where params is a list of tuples.

In the code, I'll first check if params is a dictionary. If so, I'll loop through each key-value pair, convert the key and value using the converter, and collect them into a new dictionary. If params is a sequence, I'll iterate over each element, convert it, and collect them into a new list.

Wait, but each element in the sequence could be a tuple, like (str, int), so I'll need to convert each element appropriately. Maybe I should write a helper function to process the parameters, taking into account whether it's a dict or a sequence.

So, the steps are:

1. Use self._converter.convert on the sql string to get the converted sql.
2. Process the params:
   a. If params is a dictionary, convert each key and value.
   b. If params is a sequence, convert each element.
3. Return a tuple of the converted sql and the processed params.

I should also handle cases where params is None. But looking at the function signature, params is Union[Dict[...], Sequence[Any]], so it can't be None. So I don't need to handle that.

Now, writing the code:

First, process the sql:
converted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql)

Then, process the params. I'll create a new dictionary or list based on the type of params.

If isinstance(params, dict):
   new_params = {self._converter.convert(key): self._converter.convert(value) for key, value in params.items()}
else:
   new_params = [self._converter.convert(elem) for elem in params]

Then, return (converted_sql, new_params)

Wait, but what if the converter's convert method returns different types for keys and values in a dictionary? I think the converter handles that, so I don't need to worry.

Now, for the unit tests. I'll write tests that cover the cases where params is a dictionary and a list. Also, test with an empty params.

Testing is crucial to ensure that the function behaves as expected in all cases.

So, the code should handle all these scenarios correctly.
