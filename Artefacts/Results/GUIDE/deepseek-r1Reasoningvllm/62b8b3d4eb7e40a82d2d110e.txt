Okay, I need to write a Python function based on the given docstring. The function is called _c_optimizations_ignored and it's supposed to return True if the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable is not None and not 0. Otherwise, it returns False.

First, I should think about how to access environment variables in Python. I remember that the os module is used for that. So I'll need to import os.

Next, I need to check if the "PURE_PYTHON" variable exists and isn't None. If it does, I should check its value. But wait, the docstring says it's not 0. Hmm, does that mean if the value is 0, we return False? Or does it mean if the variable is 0, we return False? The wording is a bit unclear, but I think it means if the variable exists and its value is not None and not 0, then return True.

So the steps are: import os, get the value of os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON"), check if it's not None and not 0. If both conditions are true, return True; else, return False.

Wait, but what if the environment variable doesn't exist at all? Then os.environ.get would return None, so the condition would be False. That makes sense.

Putting it all together, the function will import os, retrieve the variable, and apply the conditions.

I should also write some unit tests to cover different scenarios. For example, when the variable is None, 0, a string, etc. But the user mentioned that I should generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the code, so maybe I should mention that in the answer.

So the code will import os, define the function, and return the result of the condition.

I think that's it. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
