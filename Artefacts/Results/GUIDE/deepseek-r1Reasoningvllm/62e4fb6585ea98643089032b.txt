Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_version that takes a string and returns a tuple of integers. The string is a version number where each part is separated by dots. So, for example, "1.2.3" should become (1, 2, 3).

First, I should think about the requirements. The function needs to handle any version string, regardless of how many parts it has. Each part must be converted to an integer.

I remember that splitting the string by dots is the first step. So, I'll use the split method with '.' as the delimiter. That will give me a list of strings, each representing a version part.

Once I have the list, I need to convert each element to an integer. I can loop through each part and use int() to convert it. Alternatively, I can use a list comprehension for a more concise approach.

Wait, but what if the input string is empty? Or has leading/trailing dots? Hmm, the problem statement says it's a version string, so maybe those cases won't occur, but perhaps I should handle them gracefully. For example, an empty string should return an empty tuple, and a string with just dots should also return an empty tuple.

So, I'll handle those edge cases. If the split result is empty, return an empty tuple. Otherwise, convert each part.

Putting it together, the function will split the string, check if the resulting list is empty, and if so, return an empty tuple. Otherwise, convert each string in the list to an integer and return as a tuple.

Now, for the code. I'll start by splitting the string:

parts = s.split('.')

Then, check if parts is empty:

if not parts:
    return ()

Else, convert each part:

integers = tuple(int(part) for part in parts)

Return that tuple.

Wait, but what about invalid parts? Like non-integer strings. The problem statement probably assumes that the input is a valid version string, so I don't need to handle that unless specified.

So, the function is straightforward.

Testing it with some examples:

parse_version("1.2.3") should return (1,2,3)
parse_version("2") returns (2,)
parse_version("") returns ()

I think that's all. So the code is simple and should handle all cases as per the problem statement.
