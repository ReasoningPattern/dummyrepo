Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _create_converter and it returns an instance of _converting._Converter. The docstring says it's creating a parameter style converter.

First, I should think about what this converter does. It probably converts parameters into a specific style, maybe for formatting or validation. Since it's part of a class, I'll need to define a class method within the class that creates an instance of Converter.

I remember that in Python, classes can have class methods, which are defined using the @classmethod decorator. So I'll create a class method called _create_converter. This method will instantiate and return a new Converter instance.

Looking at the return type, it's _converting._Converter. I'm not sure if that's a nested class or a separate class in the same module. For now, I'll assume it's a class in the same module, so I'll reference it as _Converter.

I should also add a docstring to the class method explaining what it does. The docstring should mention that it creates the parameter style converter, returning an instance of the Converter class.

Putting it all together, I'll write the class method. I'll make sure to use the correct syntax for class methods and include the docstring. The code should be concise and clear, so anyone reading it can understand the purpose immediately.

I think that's all. I'll write the code as described.
