Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _get_resource_name_regex() and it's supposed to return regular expressions used to validate resource names for Krake. 

First, I should think about what Krake resources might look like. Kraken, being a cryptocurrency, probably uses addresses, maybe mnemonic phrases, or other identifiers. So the regex needs to cover possible valid resource names.

I remember that in blockchain transactions, addresses are usually alphanumeric with some specific patterns. They might start with a letter and have a mix of letters and numbers, possibly with certain lengths. So I should include a regex that matches these address-like patterns.

Also, sometimes resources might be represented by mnemonic phrases, which are strings of words derived from a cryptographic key. These are usually lowercase, separated by spaces, and each word is between 3 and 11 letters. So another regex for that would be good.

Additionally, maybe there are other types of resources, like maybe alphanumeric strings without any specific constraints, just to cover any other possibilities. So a third regex for general alphanumeric strings would be useful.

Now, considering unit testing, the user mentioned following a test-driven approach. So I should think about writing tests for each regex. That means I'll need to create test cases for valid and invalid inputs for each regex.

For the address regex, tests should include valid addresses and invalid ones like too short, starting with a number, too long, and special characters.

For the mnemonic regex, tests should check correct mnemonics, invalid ones with wrong word lengths, and strings with non-word characters.

For the general alphanumeric regex, tests should cover valid alphanumeric strings, those with special characters, empty strings, and strings with no letters or numbers.

I should structure the code to return a tuple of these regex patterns along with their names. Then, write separate test functions that assert whether the regex matches the expected strings and doesn't match others.

Putting it all together, I'll write the regex patterns as raw strings in the function. Then, create helper functions for testing, like does_match, which takes a regex and a string and returns True if it matches.

I also need to make sure the code is clean and well-commented, especially for the tests. The tests should be organized in a test module, perhaps, and each regex's tests should be clear.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll draft the code accordingly.
