Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_playbook and it's supposed to wrap the 'ansible-playbook' CLI. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes several parameters: ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args. The docstring explains each parameter, so I need to make sure the code reflects that.

The function is supposed to wrap the CLI, which means it should execute the ansible-playbook command with the given arguments and then return the result. So, I'll need to import subprocess for running the command and maybe other modules like shlex for handling arguments correctly.

Wait, the user mentioned a test-driven development approach, so I should think about writing unit tests first. But the code generation part is separate. So, I'll focus on writing the function.

I'll start by importing subprocess and shlex. Then, I'll define the function. The function should handle the arguments, pass them to subprocess.run, and capture the output and exit code.

Let me consider each parameter:

- ir_workspace and ir_plugin are objects, so they should be passed as is.
- playbook_path is a string, so I'll use shlex.quote to handle any special shell characters.
- verbose can be converted to an integer, maybe using os.get verbosity level or handling None as 0.
- extra_vars is a dictionary, which subprocess can take as the stderr parameter.
- ansible_args is another dictionary, which should be passed to the shell check parameter to preserve shell commands.

I should also handle the case where verbose is None by defaulting to 0. For ansible_args, if it's None, I'll set it to an empty dictionary to avoid errors.

In the subprocess.run call, I'll set check=False so that it doesn't raise an error if the command fails. Then, I'll capture the result, return_code, and output.

Finally, I'll return a tuple containing the result, return code, and output. This way, the caller can inspect the result, which might be needed for error handling.

I think that's the main structure. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle all parameters correctly and use shlex for safe shell argument handling.
