Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_spec_defaults, and it's supposed to resolve arguments' values from a spec and other sources, using self._get_defaults(). 

First, I should think about what this function does. It's part of a class, probably something like a data parser or argument handler. The docstring says it resolves arguments' values from the spec and other sources with self._get_defaults(). So, it's likely that the function takes some arguments, tries to get their values from the spec (like a schema or configuration), and if not found, uses defaults from self._get_defaults().

I should start by defining the function with the correct parameters. Since it's a method, it should have 'self' as the first parameter. The parameters will probably include things like spec, which could be a dictionary or a string, and maybe other arguments like default_values or required. 

Next, I'll need to structure the function body. The function will first try to get the value from the spec. If the value exists there, it returns it. If not, it falls back to using the defaults from self._get_defaults(). 

I should consider how to implement this. Maybe using a try-except block or a simple if-else statement. Since the spec might have specific keys, I can check if the value is present. If it is, return it; otherwise, retrieve the default.

I should also think about unit tests. The user mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I need to write comprehensive tests. The tests should cover cases where the spec has the value, doesn't have it, and when defaults are used. 

For example, a test where the spec provides a value, another where it doesn't, and another where the default is used. Each test should assert that the function returns the expected value.

I'll structure the code with the function, then write the tests using pytest syntax. The tests will create instances of the class (assuming this is part of a class), call the function with different parameters, and check the outputs.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function, then the test cases, making sure each scenario is covered. This way, when the function is implemented, the tests will validate that it behaves as expected.
