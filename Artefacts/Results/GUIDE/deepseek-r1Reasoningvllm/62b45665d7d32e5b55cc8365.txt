Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called parse_arguments and it takes *unparsed_arguments. The docstring says it parses parameters and returns them as dict maps. 

First, I should think about what this function is supposed to do. The name suggests it parses command-line arguments, but the function takes *unparsed_arguments, which makes me think it's more about parsing arguments that are already parsed, maybe like a list of strings. 

Since the function is supposed to return a dictionary of maps, perhaps it's creating a dictionary where each key is a parameter name and the value is another dictionary with related parameters. But without more context, it's hard to be precise. 

I should consider writing unit tests first, as the tips suggest a test-driven development approach. I'll need to mock the function and check if it returns the expected dictionary. 

Looking at the code structure, the function will probably use keyword arguments to capture the parsed parameters. So, I'll need to use *unparsed_arguments to gather all the positional arguments into a list. 

Wait, but in Python, *args captures positional arguments into a tuple. So, in the function, I can iterate over each argument in unparsed_arguments and process them. 

If the function is supposed to create a dictionary where each key is a parameter name, maybe each argument is a tuple of (name, value). So, I'll loop through each arg, split it into name and value, and add them to the result dictionary. 

But I should handle cases where the argument doesn't have a name, maybe defaulting to the argument itself. 

Also, I need to make sure that if the same parameter name appears multiple times, it's handled correctly. Maybe it's just overwriting, or perhaps it should append, but the problem statement isn't clear. 

For the unit tests, I'll need to cover different cases: when no arguments are passed, when one argument is passed, when multiple arguments are passed, and when arguments have the same name. 

I'll write tests using the unittest framework, creating mocks for the function and checking if the returned dictionary matches the expected structure. 

Putting it all together, the function will process each argument, split into name and value, and build the dictionary accordingly. The tests will ensure that all cases are handled properly.
