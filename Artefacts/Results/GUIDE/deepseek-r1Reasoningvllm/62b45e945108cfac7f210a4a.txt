Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_hierarchy, and it's part of a class, as indicated by the self parameter. The function's parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings, all of which are boolean and default to True, I think, because they're not explicitly stated. The return type is a tuple with two integers: num_objects and good_objects.

First, I should think about what this function is supposed to do. The name suggests it's validating the storage hierarchy, so maybe it's checking if the objects are correctly nested or structured. The parameters suggest that it can control whether to validate objects, check their digests, and whether to show warnings.

Since the user mentioned using a test-driven development approach, I should consider writing unit tests first. But since the code needs to be generated, I'll focus on the function implementation.

I'll start by initializing counters for the number of objects checked and the number of valid ones. Maybe using instance variables like self.num_objects_checked and self.num_valid_objects.

Next, I'll loop through each object in the storage hierarchy. Perhaps using a recursive approach to check each node, including nested structures. For each object, if validate_objects is True, I'll increment the counters. If check_digests is True, I'll compare the object's digest to the expected one. If they match, I'll increment the good_objects count.

I need to handle cases where an object's digest might not exist or the expected digest might be None. So, I'll check if both are None before comparing. Also, if validate_objects is False, I shouldn't check the digest or count the object.

After processing all objects, the function returns the counts as a tuple.

I should also consider edge cases, like empty storage or objects without digests, but the code should handle those gracefully.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function with the given signature, include the necessary loops and conditionals, and ensure it returns the correct counts.
