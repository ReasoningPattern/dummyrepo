Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function verify_relayable_signature based on the given signature and docstring. The function takes a public key, a doc, and a signature, and it's supposed to verify the signed XML elements to ensure the author generated the message.

First, I'll start by importing necessary modules. Since the function deals with cryptographic signatures, I'll need to import hashlib for the HMAC function and possibly the publickey module if dealing with RSA.

Next, I'll define the function. The function will create a hash of the concatenation of the public key and the doc. I'll convert both to bytes, add the public key bytes and doc bytes, then compute the SHA256 digest.

Then, I'll create a signature object using the HMAC class with the public key bytes and the hash digest as the key. I'll update the signature with the message bytes (doc again) and compute the digest to get the public key bytes of the signature.

I'll convert the public key bytes back to a string and compare it with the provided public_key parameter. If they match, return True; otherwise, return False.

I should also add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.

Additionally, I'll write unit tests using pytest. The tests will cover cases where the public key matches and doesn't match the provided one, ensuring the function behaves correctly in both scenarios.

I'll structure the tests with fixtures for the public key and doc, and mock the signature object to isolate the function's behavior.

Finally, I'll suggest potential improvements like handling different key sizes, adding hashing algorithms, and error handling for completeness.

Putting it all together, I'll write the code, making sure it's clean and well-commented, and include the tests to validate the implementation.
