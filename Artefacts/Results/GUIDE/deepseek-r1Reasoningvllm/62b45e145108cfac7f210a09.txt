Okay, I need to write a Python function called check_digests_present_and_used based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, so I'll probably need to use super() to call the parent class's method. 

First, I should think about what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it checks that all digests in the manifest are present and used. If they're not, it should return error(). So I need to compare the digests in the manifest with the available digests in the current context.

I'll start by getting the list of available digests from the current context. Using self.digests_available makes sense here. Then, I'll extract the digests from the manifest_files. I'll loop through each file in manifest_files and collect all the digests, maybe using a set to avoid duplicates.

Next, I need to check if every digest in the manifest is present in the available ones. For each digest in the manifest set, I'll check if it's in the available set. If any are missing, I'll collect them and then call error() with those missing digests.

I should also handle cases where the manifest has more digests than available. In that case, the missing ones will be reported as errors.

I should structure the code with these steps: get available digests, extract manifest digests, check presence, collect missing, and call error().

I need to make sure I use super() to call the parent's check method. Maybe the parent has a check() method that I can use to assert that all digests are present.

Wait, in the initial code, I called self.check() and passed the missing digests. That makes sense because the parent method would handle the assertion and error reporting.

I should also consider that the manifest_files might be empty, but I think the function should handle that gracefully, perhaps by not checking anything in that case.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function, extract the digests, check each one, collect missing, and then call super() to handle the error reporting.
