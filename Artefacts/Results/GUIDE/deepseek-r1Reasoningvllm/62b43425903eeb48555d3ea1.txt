Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _create_in_regex and it returns a re.Pattern. The docstring says it's creating an in-style parameter regular expression. 

First, I should think about what an in-style regular expression is. In Python, when you have keyword arguments in a function call, you can specify them in the form key=in_value. The regex should match such usages correctly.

I remember that the regex module in Python has a re module, and for parsing keyword arguments, the _create_in_regex function probably needs to generate a pattern that matches the in-style syntax. So, the regex should capture the key and the value.

Wait, the function is part of a class, probably a formatters class. So maybe it's used for formatting strings, like in f-strings or string formatting. So the regex is used to match the in-style parameters in the formatted string.

So, the regex needs to match something like {key}=in{value}. But wait, in Python, the in keyword is used inside the string, so it's more like {param}=in{value}. For example, {param}=in{value} would be something like {param}=in{value}.

Wait, no. The in-style is when you have a parameter like keyword=in_value. So the regex should match the pattern where a keyword is followed by =in and then the value.

So the regex should capture the key before =in and the value after. So the pattern would be something like {key}=in{value}.

But how to represent this as a regex? The key is a word, so [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*, and the value is also a word, possibly including letters, numbers, underscores, and maybe quotes if values can be complex.

So the regex pattern would be r'({key})=in({value})'. But wait, in regex, I need to escape the parentheses. So in the pattern string, it would be r'(\w+)=in(\w+)'.

But wait, the function returns a Pattern object, which is from the re module. So I need to compile this pattern.

So the function would create a regex pattern that matches the in-style syntax. So the code would be something like:

import re

def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
    pattern = r'(\w+)=in(\w+)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

But wait, I should consider if the key or value can have more than just word characters. For example, if the value is a number, it might include underscores. Or if the value is a quoted string, it might include spaces or other characters. Hmm, but in the in-style, the value is usually a single token, so maybe \w+ is sufficient.

Alternatively, if the value can include quotes or other delimiters, the regex might need to account for that. But since the function is part of a formatters class, perhaps it's designed to handle basic cases.

So, putting it all together, the function would compile the pattern r'(\w+)=in(\w+)'.

Wait, but the function is called _create_in_regex, so maybe it's part of a larger class, perhaps a Formatters class. So the code would be:

import re

class Formatters:
    def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
        pattern = r'(\w+)=in(\w+)'
        return re.compile(pattern)

But the user just wants the function, so perhaps the class isn't needed, but the function is part of a class, so in the code, I should include the function within the class.

Alternatively, if the function is standalone, but given the context, it's likely part of a class.

So, the code would be:

import re

class Formatters:
    def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
        """
        Create the in-style parameter regular expression.

        Returns the in-style parameter regular expression (:class:`re.Pattern`).
        """
        pattern = r'(\w+)=in(\w+)'
        return re.compile(pattern)

Wait, but the user only wants the code generated, so perhaps just the function. But considering that it's part of a class, including the class and the function makes sense.

But the user's example shows the function as a standalone, so maybe the class is not needed, but the function is part of a class, so perhaps it's better to include the class structure.

Alternatively, if the function is part of a larger module, perhaps it's better to just have the function.

But the user's example includes the function signature and the docstring, so perhaps the code should be just the function.

Wait, the user's example shows the function as part of a class, with the docstring explaining what it does. So, the code should include the class and the function.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

import re

class Formatters:
    def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
        """
        Create the in-style parameter regular expression.

        Returns the in-style parameter regular expression (:class:`re.Pattern`).
        """
        pattern = r'(\w+)=in(\w+)'
        return re.compile(pattern)

Yes, that makes sense. So the function returns a compiled regex pattern that matches the in-style parameter syntax.
