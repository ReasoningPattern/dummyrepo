Okay, I need to write a Python function called size_to_bytes that converts a human-readable file size string into bytes. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the input is a string like '500K' or '2.5M'. The function should parse this and return the corresponding bytes. The challenge is to handle different units like K, M, G, T, etc., and also possible decimal points.

Let me consider the possible units. Common ones are K (kilo), M (mega), G (giga), T (tera). Each represents 1024 bytes. Wait, but sometimes people use decimal units (like 1KB = 1000 bytes), but in computing, it's usually 1024. The problem statement probably expects the binary multiples here. For example, '1K' is 1024 bytes, '1M' is 1024^2, etc.

So the steps are: parse the string into a numerical value and a unit. Then multiply the value by the corresponding factor.

First, I need to split the string into the number part and the unit part. The unit is the last character, but what if the number has a decimal point? Like '2.5M' — the unit is 'M', and the number is 2.5.

So, the plan is to check the last character of the string to determine the unit. But what if the string is something like '500KB'? Wait, the problem says the input is a human-readable size, like '500K'. So perhaps the unit is a single character, and the rest is the number.

But how to handle cases where the unit is more than one character? For example, 'MB' vs 'M'. The problem's example uses '500K', so maybe the unit is a single letter. However, maybe the function should handle cases where the unit is like 'KB', but that's unclear. The original problem's example uses '500K', so perhaps the unit is a single letter.

So, the approach would be to check the last character of the string as the unit. Then, the rest of the string is the number part. But need to handle cases where the number might have a decimal point.

So, for example, '500K' → number is 500, unit is K. '2.5M' → number is 2.5, unit is M.

So, the code can split the string into the numeric part and the unit. Let's think about how to do that. The unit is the last character, so we can take the last character as the unit, and the rest as the number.

But what if the string is like '1024' (no unit)? Then, the default unit is bytes. So, if the string has no unit, return the number as is. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input is a human-readable size. So perhaps the input will always have a unit, but maybe the function should handle cases where there's no unit by assuming bytes.

But the function's docstring says the example is '500K', so maybe the input will always have a unit. However, to be safe, the code should handle cases where there's no unit, returning the number as bytes.

So, the steps:

1. Check if the input string is empty. Probably not, but need to handle that.

2. Check the last character to determine the unit. If the string is just a number (no unit), then return it as bytes.

Wait, but how to determine if the string has a unit. For example, if the string is '5', then it's 5 bytes. If it's '5K', then 5 * 1024.

So, the code can check if the last character is a letter (case-insensitive?), and if so, process it as a unit. Otherwise, treat the entire string as bytes.

But how to handle cases where the unit is more than one character? For example, 'MB' — but according to the problem's example, it's probably single letters. So perhaps the code will check the last character as the unit.

So, let's proceed with that approach.

Now, the code can be structured as follows:

- Take the input string.

- Check if the last character is a letter (A-Z or a-z). If yes, then the unit is that character, and the number is the part before it. Else, the entire string is the number of bytes.

But how to split the string into the numeric part and the unit. For example, '2.5M' → split into '2.5' and 'M'.

So, the code can take the last character as the unit, then the rest as the numeric part.

But what if the unit is uppercase? Like 'K' vs 'k'? Probably, the function should handle both cases, converting to uppercase.

So, code steps:

- Check if the string is empty → raise error? Or return 0? Probably, the function should handle valid inputs, but perhaps the code should handle invalid inputs gracefully. However, the problem statement doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps assume that the input is valid.

But for the purposes of the code, perhaps we can assume that the input is a valid string with a unit.

So, code:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:

    # Check if the string is empty
    if not size:
        return 0  # or raise ValueError?

    # Determine the unit
    unit_char = size[-1].upper()
    if unit_char in ['K', 'M', 'G', 'T']:
        # The unit is the last character, and the rest is the number
        num_str = size[:-1]
    else:
        # No unit, the entire string is the number of bytes
        num_str = size

    # Convert num_str to float
    try:
        num = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        # Invalid number format
        return 0  # or raise?

    # Determine the multiplier based on the unit
    if unit_char == 'K':
        multiplier = 1024
    elif unit_char == 'M':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 2
    elif unit_char == 'G':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 3
    elif unit_char == 'T':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 4
    else:
        # No unit, multiplier is 1
        multiplier = 1

    return int(num * multiplier)

Wait, but what if the unit is something else, like 'B'? For example, '100B' would be 100 bytes. But according to the problem's example, maybe the function is supposed to handle 'B' as well. However, the problem's example uses '500K', but the docstring says the input is a human-readable size. So perhaps the function should handle 'B' as well.

But the original code's docstring doesn't specify that. So perhaps the code should handle 'B' as well. Let me think.

The function's docstring says that the input is a human-readable file size. So, for example, '500K' is 500 * 1024 bytes. But if the input is '500B', then it's 500 bytes. So, the code should handle that.

But in the code above, if the unit_char is 'B', then the code would treat it as a unit. However, in the code above, the code checks if unit_char is in ['K', 'M', 'G', 'T'], and if not, then it treats the entire string as bytes. Wait, no. Let me recheck:

In the code above, unit_char is the last character. Then, if unit_char is in ['K', 'M', 'G', 'T'], then process as unit. Else, treat the entire string as bytes. So, if the unit is 'B', then the code would treat the entire string as bytes. For example, '500B' would have unit_char 'B', which is not in the list, so num_str is '500B', which would be converted to float, which would throw an error. So that's a problem.

Ah, right. So the code as written would fail for '500B', because when unit_char is 'B', the code would take num_str as '500B', which can't be converted to a float. So that's a bug.

So the code needs to handle the case where the unit is 'B' (or other letters), but the code currently doesn't.

So perhaps the code should check if the unit is a letter, and if so, process it. But how to handle cases where the unit is 'B'?

Alternatively, perhaps the function should consider that the unit is the last character, and if it's a letter (regardless of what it is), then process it. But then, for unknown units, how to handle?

But according to the problem statement, the input is a human-readable size. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle units like K, M, G, T, and B (for bytes). So, the code should handle 'B' as a unit, which is 1 byte.

So, modifying the code:

The code should check if the last character is a letter (uppercase or lowercase), and then process it as a unit. For example, '500B' → unit is B, and the number is 500. Then, the multiplier for B is 1.

So, the code needs to handle that. So, the code can be modified as follows:

In the code, after extracting the unit_char (uppercase), check if it is in ['B', 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T'].

So, modifying the code:

    unit_char = size[-1].upper()
    if unit_char in ['B', 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T']:
        num_str = size[:-1]
    else:
        num_str = size

Then, in the multiplier section:

    if unit_char == 'B':
        multiplier = 1
    elif unit_char == 'K':
        multiplier = 1024
    elif unit_char == 'M':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 2
    elif unit_char == 'G':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 3
    elif unit_char == 'T':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 4
    else:
        # This shouldn't happen since we checked earlier
        multiplier = 1

But wait, the code checks if the unit_char is in ['B', 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T'], so the else case here would not be triggered. But perhaps the code can have a default.

But this would handle 'B' as a unit. So, '500B' would be 500 * 1 = 500 bytes.

But what about if the input is '500'? Then, the code would take unit_char as '0' (since the last character is '0'), which is not in the list, so num_str is '500', which is converted to 500, and multiplier is 1. So that's correct.

Another example: '1.5K' → 1.5 * 1024 = 1536 bytes.

But what if the input is '1024'? Then, the code would treat it as 1024 bytes.

So, this seems correct.

Now, what about cases where the unit is not a single character? For example, '500KB' — but according to the problem's example, perhaps such cases are not considered. However, the code as written would take the last character as 'B', and the num_str is '500K', which would be parsed as 500K. But that's incorrect. However, the problem says the input is a human-readable size, which probably uses single-letter units. So perhaps the code is correct as per the problem's requirements.

Now, handling the case where the input is '500K' → correct.

Another case: '2.5M' → 2.5 * 1024^2.

But what about if the input is '100' → returns 100.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Now, testing for some edge cases:

Test case 1: '500K' → 500 * 1024 = 512000.

Test case 2: '1M' → 1 * 1024^2 = 1048576.

Test case 3: '1G' → 1073741824.

Test case 4: '1024B' → 1024 * 1 = 1024.

Test case 5: '100' → 100.

Test case 6: '2.5M' → 2.5 * 1048576 = 2621440.

Now, code-wise, the code uses float(num_str) * multiplier, then converts to int. But for numbers with decimal points, like 2.5, that's okay. However, when converting to int, it truncates. For example, 2.5 * 1024 = 2560.0 → int is 2560. But if the input is '2.5K', that's correct.

But what if the input is something like '1.5K'? 1.5 * 1024 = 1536.0 → correct.

So the code returns an int, which is correct.

Now, what about if the input is invalid? For example, 'abcK' — then, num_str is 'abc', which can't be converted to a float. The code would throw a ValueError. But the problem says that the input is a valid string. However, the code should handle that? The problem's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps the code can assume that the input is valid. However, in practice, it's better to handle exceptions. But the problem's example doesn't mention that, so perhaps the code can proceed as written.

Now, writing the code with these considerations.

Now, the code:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert human readable file size to bytes

    Args:
        size: str, a string representing a human readable file size (eg: '500K')
    Returns:
        int: file size in bytes
    """
    if not size:
        return 0

    unit_char = size[-1].upper()
    if unit_char in ['B', 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T']:
        num_str = size[:-1]
    else:
        num_str = size

    try:
        num = float(num_str)
    except ValueError:
        return 0  # Or raise an exception?

    if unit_char == 'B':
        multiplier = 1
    elif unit_char == 'K':
        multiplier = 1024
    elif unit_char == 'M':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 2
    elif unit_char == 'G':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 3
    elif unit_char == 'T':
        multiplier = 1024 ** 4
    else:
        multiplier = 1  # Should not happen if unit_char is checked

    return int(num * multiplier)

But wait, what if the num_str is something like '1000K'? Then, the code would parse '1000' as the number, multiply by 1024. Which is correct.

Now, test case for '1000K' → 1000 * 1024 = 1024000.

Another test case: '1.5G' → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1966080.

Now, what about if the input is '500KB'? The code would take the last character as 'B', and the num_str is '500K'. Then, trying to convert '500K' to float would fail, returning 0. But that's an invalid input. However, the problem says the input is a human-readable size, so perhaps the code is correct.

Now, the code as written would return 0 for invalid inputs, but perhaps it's better to raise a ValueError. However, the problem's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps the code can proceed as written.

Now, the user wants the code generated, and the code should be in Python markdown format. But the user also mentioned that they want to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code generated in Python markdown format. But the initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips suggest to first generate tests. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the user expects the code for the function, not the tests.

Wait, the user says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. The tips mention test-driven development, but the user's main instruction is to generate the code.

So the code for the function is as written above.

But perhaps there are some issues. For example, if the input is '1024', the code returns 1024. If the input is '1K', returns 1024. That's correct.

Another edge case: '0K' → returns 0.

What about if the input is '1000.5M'? Then, the code would parse 1000.5 * 1024^2 = 1000.5 * 1048576 = 1049614336.0 → int is 1049614336.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Another possible issue: if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. For example, ' 500K ' → the code would take the last character as ' ', which is not in the unit list, so num_str is ' 500K ', which would throw a ValueError when converting to float. But the problem says the input is a valid string. So perhaps the code should handle trimming whitespace. However, the problem's example doesn't mention that. So perhaps the code can assume that the input is properly formatted.

So, the code as written is correct according to the problem's description.
