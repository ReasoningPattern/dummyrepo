Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _validate_labels function based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to check that the keys and values in the labels are validated using validate_key() and validate_value(). 

First, I should figure out what the parameters are. The function takes 'labels' as input. I assume labels is a dictionary, since keys and values are mentioned. So, the function needs to iterate over each key-value pair in the labels dictionary.

The docstring says to use validate_key() and validate_value(). But wait, those functions aren't defined here. Oh right, maybe they are helper functions that the user is expected to have, or perhaps they are part of the same module. Since the user hasn't provided their implementations, I'll just use them as they are, assuming they exist.

So the steps for _validate_labels would be:

1. Iterate through each key in the labels dictionary and validate it with validate_key().
2. Iterate through each value in the labels dictionary and validate it with validate_value().
3. If any validation fails, raise an appropriate exception. But the docstring doesn't mention what exception to raise. Maybe it's up to the implementation. Common practice is to raise ValueError or a custom exception. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with ValueError.

Wait, but the function's name is _validate_labels, which suggests it's a helper function. So perhaps it's expected to raise exceptions if any validation fails. So for each key and value, we need to check them.

So the code structure would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key in labels:
        validate_key(key)
    for value in labels.values():
        validate_value(value)
    return True  # Or maybe it's void? But the function is supposed to check, so perhaps it raises exceptions on failure.

Wait, the original function's docstring says "Check that keys and values...". So maybe the function doesn't return anything but raises an error if any validation fails. So the code would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    """
    Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
    """
    for key in labels:
        validate_key(key)
    for value in labels.values():
        validate_value(value)

But then, what if validate_key or validate_value raise exceptions? The function would propagate them. That makes sense. So the function's job is to run those validations on all keys and values. If any of them fail, the exception is raised.

But wait, maybe the user expects that the function itself raises a ValueError if any validation fails. But without knowing what validate_key and validate_value do, it's hard to say. However, the function's responsibility is to validate each key and value using those functions. So the code is as above.

Now, the user mentioned to use test-driven development, so first generate unit tests. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. However, the initial tips mention to first generate tests. But the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. Wait, the original question says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the tip says to follow TDD, generating tests first. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the function code, not the tests. Therefore, proceed to write the function.

But maybe the user expects that the code includes the tests as well? The initial problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring" which implies the function itself. The tip is just a suggestion for the approach, but the actual output is the code for the function.

Therefore, the code for _validate_labels would be as follows:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    """
    Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
    """
    for key in labels:
        validate_key(key)
    for value in labels.values():
        validate_value(value)

But wait, what if labels is not a dictionary? The function may need to handle that. However, the docstring doesn't mention it, so perhaps it's assumed that labels is a dictionary. If not, the code may raise a TypeError when iterating. But that's beyond the scope of this function's responsibility. The function's job is to validate the keys and values, assuming that labels is a dictionary.

Another thing: the function's name is _validate_labels, which suggests it's a private function, perhaps part of a class or module. But the code is written as a standalone function.

So the code seems correct. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, so using triple backticks and the python tag.

But the user also mentioned in the tips to generate tests first. However, the main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. Unless the user wants both. But the original instruction says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring" which refers to the function code. The tip is just a suggestion for the approach, but the output is only the code generated.

So the final answer is the code for the _validate_labels function as written above.
