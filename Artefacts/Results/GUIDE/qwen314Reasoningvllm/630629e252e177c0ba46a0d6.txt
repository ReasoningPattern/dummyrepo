Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function retrieve_diaspora_host_meta based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what this function does. The docstring says it retrieves a remote Diaspora host-meta document and returns an XRD instance. 

First, I should think about how to fetch the host-meta document. Since it's a remote document, I'll probably need to use a HTTP request. The host parameter is the host to retrieve from, so maybe the URL is something like https://host/.well-known/host-meta. But I should check if that's the standard format for Diaspora.

Next, the function needs to return an XRD instance. XRD is an XML-based format, so perhaps there's a library to parse it. The python-xrd library might be useful here. I'll need to install that, but since the user didn't mention dependencies, maybe I should include a note or assume it's available.

Now, for the code structure. The function will take the host as an argument. I need to construct the URL. Let me think: Diaspora's host-meta is usually at https://example.com/.well-known/host-meta. So the URL should be f"https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta".

Then, I need to fetch this URL. Using requests.get seems appropriate. But I should handle exceptions, like if the host is unreachable or the response isn't 200. However, the original function signature doesn't mention any error handling, so maybe the function is expected to raise exceptions as per the underlying libraries.

Once the response is received, I need to parse the XRD. Using the xrd library's parse function. So, from xrd import parse, and then return parse(response.text).

Wait, but the user might not have the xrd library installed. Should I include a try-except block or a note? The problem says to generate code based on the function signature, so perhaps it's assumed that the necessary libraries are present.

Putting it all together:

Import requests and xrd. Then, construct the URL, make the GET request, parse the response, and return the XRD instance.

But what about SSL verification? The default for requests is to verify SSL, which is good. However, if the host uses a self-signed certificate, this might fail. But again, the function's responsibility is to retrieve the document, not handle SSL issues, so perhaps that's beyond the scope here.

Now, the user mentioned test-driven development. So first, write unit tests. Let me think about possible test cases. For example, testing with a valid host, handling exceptions, checking the return type.

But the user wants the code generated, not the tests first. Wait, the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips suggest TDD, generating tests first. However, the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So maybe the user wants the actual function code, not the tests. But the tips are just suggestions, and the main task is to generate the code for the function.

So, proceeding with the code:

The function retrieve_diaspora_host_meta takes host as an argument. So:

import requests
from xrd import parse

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f"https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta"
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an exception for HTTP errors
    return parse(response.text)

Wait, but the original docstring says it returns an XRD instance. The parse function from xrd library probably returns that. So that's correct.

But what if the host is invalid? Like, if the host is 'example.com', but the URL is constructed as https://example.com/.well-known/host-meta. That seems right.

However, the function may need to handle cases where the host doesn't have the host-meta file. But according to the problem statement, the function's responsibility is to retrieve it, and any errors would be propagated via exceptions.

So the code seems straightforward. Now, the user might expect the code to be in Python markdown format. So the answer should be wrapped in triple backticks with python specified.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check if the xrd library's parse function is used correctly. Also, the requests library is needed. So the code would need to import those modules.

But the user didn't mention any specific error handling, so the code as written would raise exceptions if the request fails, which is acceptable.

So the final code would be:

import requests
from xrd import parse

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    """
    Retrieve a remote Diaspora host-meta document.

    :arg host: Host to retrieve from
    :returns: ``XRD`` instance
    """
    url = f"https://{host}/.well-known/host-meta"
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return parse(response.text)

But wait, the xrd library's parse function might require the XML content. The response.text should be the XML string. So that's correct.

I think this should work. Now, present this code in Python markdown format.
