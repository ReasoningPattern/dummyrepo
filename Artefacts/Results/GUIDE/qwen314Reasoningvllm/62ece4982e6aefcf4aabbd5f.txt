Okay, I need to generate Python code for the paging function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The function takes a response list and a max_results integer. It should return a generator that splits the response into pages, each with up to max_results items.

So, the key here is to create a generator that yields chunks of the list. For example, if the response has 10 items and max_results is 3, the generator should yield [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8,9]. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the function says "Return every response with the length of max_results". Hmm, maybe it's supposed to split the response into pages where each page has at most max_results elements. So, the generator will yield slices of the list in chunks of size max_results.

So the standard way to do this in Python is to loop over the response in steps of max_results. For example, using a for loop with range(0, len(response), max_results), and then taking a slice from i to i+max_results each time.

But since the function is supposed to return a generator, I can use a generator function with yield statements. Let me think about the code structure.

The function is called paging, and it takes response and max_results. So inside the function, I need to iterate over the response list in chunks. Let me check for edge cases. What if max_results is zero? Well, the docstring says max_results is an int, but probably it's expected to be a positive integer. But maybe the function should handle cases where max_results is zero by returning nothing? Or maybe the function expects that max_results is at least 1. The docstring doesn't specify, but perhaps we can assume that max_results is a positive integer. However, to be safe, maybe we should handle cases where max_results is zero by not yielding anything, or raising an error. But the problem statement doesn't mention that, so perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that max_results is a positive integer.

So the code would be something like:

def paging(response, max_results):
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i+max_results]

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me test this logic with an example. Suppose response is [1,2,3,4,5], max_results is 2. Then the slices would be [1,2], [3,4], [5]. So the generator would yield those three lists. That seems correct.

But what if the response is empty? Then the loop doesn't run, and the generator is empty, which is correct.

So the code seems simple. But the user mentioned that they want test-driven development, so perhaps I should first write the tests. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown format. But the user also provided tips to follow TDD, generating tests first. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. Wait, the original question says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the user wants the code for the paging function, not the tests. But the tips suggest that I should first generate tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer is just the code for the paging function.

But maybe the user wants the code including the tests? Wait, the original problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So the code is the function itself, not the tests. The tips are just suggestions for the approach, but the actual output should be the code for the function.

So the code for the paging function would be as I thought: a generator that yields slices of the response list in chunks of max_results. So the code would be:

def paging(response, max_results):
    """
    Return every response with the length of max_results
    Args:
    response (list): WAPI response.
    max_results (int): Maximum number of objects to be returned in one page.
    Returns:
        Generator object with WAPI response split page by page.
    """
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i+max_results]

Wait, but what if max_results is zero? Then the range would be 0 to len(response) with step 0, which would cause an error. So perhaps we need to handle that. However, the docstring says that max_results is an int, but it's unclear if it's supposed to be positive. The function's responsibility is to split into pages, so it's likely that max_results is a positive integer. However, to avoid errors, perhaps we should check that max_results is at least 1. But the problem statement doesn't mention that, so maybe it's up to the caller to ensure that. However, in practice, we should handle that. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code as written is acceptable.

Another thing: the function is supposed to return a generator object. The code as written does that, because the function uses yield, so it's a generator function. So when called, it returns a generator.

So I think that's the correct code. Let me write that in Python markdown format.
