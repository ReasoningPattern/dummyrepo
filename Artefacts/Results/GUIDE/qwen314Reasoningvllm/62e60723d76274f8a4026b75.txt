Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function round_half_to_even(n). The docstring says it's supposed to round a floating-point number. Hmm, the name suggests that when the number is exactly halfway between two integers, it rounds to the nearest even number. That's the "bankers rounding" method, right?

Wait, Python's built-in round function already does that. For example, round(2.5) is 2, and round(3.5) is 4. So maybe the task is to implement that behavior. But wait, the function is named round_half_to_even, which is exactly what the built-in round does. So perhaps the user wants me to write a function that mimics the built-in round function?

But maybe there's a catch. Let me think. The problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is very minimal, just saying "Round a floating-point number". But the function's name gives more info. So the actual implementation should be equivalent to Python's round function.

But why would someone need to write this function if it's already available? Maybe the user wants a custom implementation without using the built-in round? Or maybe they just want to use the built-in function.

Wait, the user hasn't specified any constraints on using built-in functions. So the simplest solution is to return round(n). But maybe the user expects handling of certain edge cases or different behavior?

Wait, let me check the problem again. The user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is minimal, but the function's name suggests the specific rounding method. However, the built-in round in Python already does that. So the correct code would be to return round(n). But maybe the user wants to implement it manually?

But the user hasn't specified that. The tips mention test-driven development, so maybe I should first write tests that check the rounding behavior, then implement the function.

But the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the answer is simply to use the built-in round function. However, maybe the user wants to avoid using the built-in round and implement it manually. But without more information, it's safer to assume that using the built-in is acceptable.

Wait, but the function's name is round_half_to_even, which is exactly what round() does in Python. So the code would be as simple as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me test some examples. For example:

round_half_to_even(2.5) should return 2.0? Or 2? Wait, the return type. The built-in round returns an integer if the input is a float that's exactly halfway. Wait, no, round(2.5) returns 2, which is an integer. But if the input is a float, like 2.5, then round(2.5) is 2. But if the input is, say, 3.5, it rounds to 4. So the function would return an integer. However, the function's parameter is n, which is a float. But the return type isn't specified. However, the problem says that the function is to round a floating-point number, so perhaps returning an integer is acceptable.

But the original function's return type isn't specified. The user's code has the function defined as def round_half_to_even(n):, with no return annotation. So the code would return the same as the built-in round.

But maybe the user expects the function to return a float? For example, round(2.5) returns 2 as an integer. But if the input is a float, maybe the function should return a float. Wait, in Python, round(2.5) returns 2 as an integer. But if you pass a float, like 2.5, then round returns an integer. However, if you pass a float that's not exactly halfway, like 2.3, it returns 2 as an integer. Wait, no, wait: round(2.3) returns 2 as an integer? Wait, no, in Python, round(2.3) returns 2 as an integer? Let me check in Python.

Wait, no. Let me think. In Python, round(2.3) returns 2 as an integer? Or as a float? Let me test:

>>> round(2.3)
2
>>> type(round(2.3))
<class 'int'>
>>> round(2.5)
2
>>> type(round(2.5))
<class 'int'>
>>> round(3.5)
4
>>> type(round(3.5))
<class 'int'>

So the built-in round function returns an integer. However, if the input is a float, but the rounded result is an integer, then the return is an integer. But maybe the function is expected to return a float? For example, if the input is 2.0, then round(2.0) returns 2 as an integer. But perhaps the function should return a float, like 2.0?

But the original problem's docstring doesn't specify. The function's name is round_half_to_even, which is the same as the built-in round. So perhaps the correct code is to use the built-in round function.

But the user might have intended for the function to return a float. For example, if the input is 2.5, returning 2.0 instead of 2. But the built-in round returns an integer. So perhaps the function should return a float. How to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to implement the rounding manually. For example, check if the decimal part is exactly 0.5, then round to even. Otherwise, round normally.

But that's more complex. Let me think. If the user's function is supposed to return a float, then perhaps the code should return a float. For example, round_half_to_even(2.5) would return 2.0, and round_half_to_even(3.5) returns 4.0.

But how to do that? Well, the built-in round returns an integer, but if you pass a float, perhaps you can cast it back to float. Wait, for example:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return float(round(n))

But then, for example, round(2.5) is 2, and converting to float gives 2.0. That would make the return type a float. However, for numbers that round to an integer, this would return a float. For example, 2.3 would round to 2.0, which is a float. But maybe that's what the user expects.

But the original function's docstring doesn't specify the return type. However, the function's name suggests that it's a rounding function, which could return either an integer or a float. But in Python, the built-in round returns an integer when possible. However, if the input is a float, maybe the function should return a float. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants to use the built-in round function. But given that the function is named round_half_to_even, which is the same as the built-in round's behavior, perhaps that's the case.

But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring is very minimal. So perhaps the correct code is to return round(n). However, the user's tips mention test-driven development, so perhaps I should first write tests that check for the correct rounding behavior.

But the user hasn't provided any tests. The user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But maybe the user expects that the function returns a float. For example, if the input is 2.5, the built-in round returns 2 (integer), but perhaps the function should return 2.0. In that case, the code would be:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return float(round(n))

But this is speculative. Without more information, it's hard to tell. However, given that the function's name is round_half_to_even, which matches the behavior of Python's round function, and the docstring says "Round a floating-point number", the most straightforward implementation is to use the built-in round function. Therefore, the code would be as simple as returning round(n).

But perhaps the user wants to avoid using the built-in round function and implement the rounding manually. However, without explicit instructions, that's an assumption. Given that, the answer is to use the built-in round function.

So the generated code would be:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But then, the user's tips say to use test-driven development. However, the user hasn't asked for tests, just the code. So the code is as above.

But maybe there's a mistake here. For example, if the input is a string, but the function expects a float. However, the function's parameter is n, and the docstring says it's for a floating-point number, so the function assumes that n is a float. Therefore, the code is correct.

So the final code is as above.
