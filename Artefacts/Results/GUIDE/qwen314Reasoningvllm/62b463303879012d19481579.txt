Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the function _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. The docstring says it returns possible values of number and sup from the issue element's contents. Hmm, the function name suggests that it's extracting a number and a supplement (maybe like a suffix or additional info) from some issue element. 

First, I should figure out what the 'issue' parameter is. Since the function is named with an underscore, maybe it's part of a larger class or module. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume 'issue' is a string or some element that contains text.

The function needs to parse this 'issue' content to extract the number and supplement. For example, if the issue is something like "Issue 123-Supplement A", the number would be 123 and the supplement would be "Supplement A". But I need to think about different possible formats. Maybe the number is a numeric part, and the supplement is any text following it, possibly with a hyphen or other separator.

Wait, the function returns "possible values", which might imply that there could be multiple possibilities, but maybe it's just extracting the first occurrence or handling different formats. However, the docstring is a bit vague. Without more examples, I need to make assumptions.

Let me think of possible scenarios. The issue could be a string like "Issue 45", "45-Sup", "Vol 5 Issue 6", etc. The function needs to extract the number and supplement. Maybe the number is the first numeric part, and the supplement is any text after that, possibly after a hyphen or other delimiter.

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is a specific part, like a letter after a hyphen. For example, "123-S" could be number 123 and supplement "S".

But how to handle cases where there's no supplement? Then the supplement would be None or an empty string.

So, the function should return a tuple (number, supplement), where number is an integer (or maybe a string if there's no numeric part?), and supplement is a string.

But the function's return type isn't specified. The docstring says "possible values", which might mean that there could be multiple valid pairs, but perhaps the function is designed to return the first possible match or all possible matches. However, given the function name, it's more likely to return a single pair.

Wait, the function is named _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. The underscore suggests it's a helper function, perhaps part of a larger processing pipeline. So maybe it's intended to parse the issue element's text into a number and a supplement part.

Let me think of possible parsing steps:

1. Split the issue string into parts. Maybe split on non-numeric characters to find the number part.
2. The supplement could be any text following the number, possibly after a hyphen or other separator.

For example, if the issue is "Issue 123-Supplement A", the number is 123, and the supplement is "Supplement A".

Another example: "123-S" would be number 123, supplement "S".

Another case: "Vol 5 Issue 6" might extract number 6, supplement empty? Or maybe the number is 5 and 6? Not sure. But perhaps the function is looking for the first numeric part as the number, and anything after that as supplement.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is structured with the number followed by a supplement, like "123-Sup" where "Sup" is the supplement.

So, perhaps the approach is:

- Find the first sequence of digits in the string as the number.
- Then, check if there's a hyphen or other delimiter after the number, and take the rest as the supplement.

But how to handle cases where there are multiple numbers? For example, "Issue 123-456" would have number 123 and supplement "456"?

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is a specific part, like a letter after a hyphen. For example, "123-A" would have supplement "A".

But without more examples, it's challenging. However, given that the function is named to extract number and supplement, perhaps the supplement is an optional part that comes after the number, possibly separated by a hyphen.

Let me think of writing code that splits the string into parts. For example, using regular expressions.

A possible regex pattern could be something like (\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))? which would capture the number and the supplement (if present). For example:

- "123-Sup" would match group 1 as "123", group 2 as "Sup".
- "456" would match group 1 as "456", group 2 as None.
- "Issue 789-ABC" would have group 1 as "789", group 2 as "ABC".

But how to handle cases where the number isn't at the start? Like "Vol 5 Issue 123-Sup". Maybe the function is supposed to find the first occurrence of a number followed by an optional supplement.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a specific element, like an XML element, and the text content is parsed. But the function's parameter is 'issue', which could be a string.

Assuming that the 'issue' is a string, I can proceed with the regex approach.

So, the code would use re.match to find the first occurrence of a number followed by an optional supplement.

But the function returns "possible values", which might imply that there could be multiple matches. However, the function name suggests it's returning a single pair. Maybe the function is designed to return the first possible match, and if there are multiple, it returns the first one.

So, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    match = re.match(r'(\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))?', issue)
    if match:
        number = match.group(1)
        supplement = match.group(2)
        return (number, supplement)
    else:
        return (None, None)

Wait, but the number is a string here. However, the docstring says "possible values of number", which might expect an integer. But maybe the number is stored as a string if it's part of a larger text. For example, if the issue is "Issue 123", then the number is "123" as a string. But perhaps the function should return the number as an integer. However, the function's return type isn't specified. The original code's function returns (number, supplement), but the types are unclear.

Alternatively, the function could return (number as int, supplement as str or None). But if the number can't be parsed as an integer, perhaps it returns None.

But again, without more info, it's hard to say. However, given the function name, it's likely that the number is numeric, so converting to integer makes sense.

So modifying the code:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    match = re.match(r'(\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))?', issue)
    if match:
        number_str = match.group(1)
        try:
            number = int(number_str)
        except ValueError:
            number = None
        supplement = match.group(2)
        return (number, supplement)
    else:
        return (None, None)

But what if the issue has leading text before the number? Like "Vol 5 Issue 123-Sup". The regex would not match because it starts with 'Vol'. So the regex would not find a match. But maybe the function is intended to look for the number anywhere in the string, not necessarily at the beginning.

In that case, the regex should search the entire string, not just from the start. So using re.search instead of re.match.

But then, how to handle multiple possible matches? For example, if the string has multiple numbers, which one to pick?

The function's docstring says "possible values", which might imply that there could be multiple possibilities, but the function's name suggests it returns a single pair. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to extract all possible number-supplement pairs. But the return type would then be a list of tuples. However, the original function's return is not specified, so this is unclear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is intended to find the first occurrence of a number followed by an optional supplement, regardless of position in the string. So using re.search.

But then, how to capture the number and supplement. For example, in the string "This is issue 123-Sup and 456", the first match would be 123-Sup.

So modifying the regex to search the entire string:

match = re.search(r'(\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))?', issue)

But then, the regex would find the first occurrence of a number followed by optional supplement. However, the regex as written would match the first number and any following non-space characters as the supplement. For example, in "123-Sup", the supplement is "Sup". In "123", the supplement is None. In "123-ABC 456", the supplement is "ABC".

But what if the supplement has spaces? Like "123-ABC Def"? The current regex would capture "ABC" as the supplement, leaving "Def" as part of the string. But maybe the supplement is supposed to be everything after the hyphen until the end of the string or until a space. However, the regex [^\s]+ would capture until the first whitespace.

But perhaps the supplement is allowed to have spaces, but the hyphen is the separator. For example, "123-Supplement A" would have supplement "Supplement A".

In that case, the regex should capture everything after the hyphen until the end of the string. So the regex would be (\d+)(?:-([^\s]*))? but that might not capture correctly. Alternatively, using a non-greedy approach.

Wait, the current regex is (\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))? which captures after the hyphen any non-whitespace characters. So in "123-Supplement A", the supplement would be "Supplement" (since the first whitespace is after 'Supplement'). But the user might want the entire part after the hyphen. So perhaps the regex should be (\d+)(?:-([^\s]*))? but that would include any characters except whitespace, including hyphens. But maybe the supplement can contain hyphens or other characters.

Alternatively, perhaps the supplement is everything after the hyphen until the end of the string. So the regex would be (\d+)(?:-([^\s]*))? but that would include any characters except whitespace. However, if the supplement is allowed to have spaces, then this approach is not correct.

This is getting complicated. Without more examples, it's hard to know. But given that the function is named to extract number and supplement, perhaps the supplement is the part after the hyphen, regardless of spaces.

So maybe the regex should be (\d+)(?:-([^\s]*))? but that would capture up to the first whitespace. Alternatively, maybe the supplement is everything after the hyphen, even if there are spaces. In that case, the regex would be (\d+)(?:-([^)]*))? but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the supplement is any text after the number, possibly separated by a hyphen. So the regex could be (\d+)(?:-([^\s]*))? which would capture the first part as the number and the second part as the supplement (if present).

But again, without more examples, it's hard to proceed. However, the initial code may need to be written with this approach.

So, putting it all together, the function would use a regex to find the first occurrence of a number followed by an optional supplement (after a hyphen), return them as a tuple (number as int, supplement as str or None).

But what about cases where the number is not at the start? Like "Some text 123-Sup". The regex would find it.

Now, considering the test cases. Since the user mentioned test-driven development, I should first write unit tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips say to generate tests first. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, but the assistant is supposed to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips mention to follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the user might not want the tests, but the actual code. But the initial problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the user wants the implementation of the function, not the tests.

But the user's initial message says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the code is the function _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element.

So, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))?', issue)
    if match:
        number_str = match.group(1)
        try:
            number = int(number_str)
        except ValueError:
            number = None
        supplement = match.group(2)
        return (number, supplement)
    else:
        return (None, None)

But wait, the regex uses re.search, which searches the entire string. However, the original code may have used re.match, which matches from the start. But without knowing the exact requirements, it's hard to say. However, the function's docstring says it's extracting from the contents of the issue element. If the issue element's content is a string that may have the number and supplement anywhere, then re.search is appropriate.

But perhaps the function is supposed to look for the number and supplement at the beginning of the string. For example, if the issue element's text is "123-Supplement", then re.match would work. But if the text is "Some text 123-Supplement", then re.match would not find a match, but re.search would.

But again, without examples, it's hard to tell. However, given that the function is named to extract from the issue element's contents, it's possible that the number and supplement are at the beginning.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue element is an XML element, and the text content is something like "<issue>123-Sup</issue>", so the text is "123-Sup", and the regex would match.

In that case, re.match would be appropriate.

So, perhaps the code should use re.match(r'^(\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))?', issue) to match from the start.

But the original code may not have the ^ anchor. However, without knowing, it's a bit ambiguous.

But given that the function's name is _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element, perhaps it's part of a parser that expects the number and supplement to be at the beginning of the string.

So, adjusting the regex to start at the beginning:

match = re.match(r'^(\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))?', issue)

But then, if the issue string starts with non-numeric characters, it would not match. However, that's acceptable if the function is designed to parse such strings.

In that case, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    match = re.match(r'^(\d+)(?:-([^\s]+))?', issue)
    if match:
        number_str = match.group(1)
        try:
            number = int(number_str)
        except ValueError:
            number = None
        supplement = match.group(2)
        return (number, supplement)
    else:
        return (None, None)

But what if the issue is empty? Then it returns (None, None), which is correct.

Another case: issue is "123", returns (123, None).

If the issue is "123-Sup", returns (123, "Sup").

If the issue is "123-Sup with spaces", then the supplement is "Sup" (since [^\s]+ stops at the first whitespace). But maybe the supplement should be "Sup with spaces". In that case, the regex should be adjusted to capture everything after the hyphen until the end of the string. So the regex would be r'^(\d+)(?:-([^\s]*))?' but that would include any characters except whitespace. However, if the supplement can contain spaces, then this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, the regex could be r'^(\d+)(?:-([^)]*))?' but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, capture everything after the hyphen until the end of the string. So the regex would be r'^(\d+)(?:-([^)]*))?' but that's not correct. Maybe using r'^(\d+)(?:-([^\s]*))?'. But again, this depends on the exact format.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the initial approach, using [^\s]+ to capture non-whitespace characters after the hyphen as the supplement.

Thus, the code would be as above.

Now, considering the function's return type. The docstring says "possible values", which might imply that there could be multiple possibilities, but the function returns a single tuple. However, the function's name suggests it's returning the first possible match.

In any case, the code as written would return the first match found at the beginning of the string.

So, the final code would be as above.
