Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function strip_root based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to remove the root from a path, and if it fails, throw an exception. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should consider what the parameters are. The path and root are probably strings. The goal is to remove the root part from the path. For example, if the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home', then the result should be 'user/file.txt'. But how do I handle cases where the root isn't a prefix of the path?

The docstring says that if it fails, an exception should be thrown. So, if the root isn't a prefix of the path, the function should raise an error. So the first step is to check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception.

Wait, but maybe the root could have a trailing slash? Like, if the root is '/home/', and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', should that still work? Or do I need to handle that? The problem statement isn't clear. But the function's responsibility is to remove the root from the path. So perhaps the root is a prefix of the path. So, the function would check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then it returns the path with the root stripped. Otherwise, raise an error.

So, the steps for the function:

1. Check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception.
2. If it does, return the path with the root removed.

But how to handle cases where the root is an empty string? Well, the problem says that if it fails, throw an exception. If the root is empty, then the path would start with it, but stripping it would leave the path as is. But maybe the function is designed to have root as a non-empty string. However, the function's parameters don't specify that. So, perhaps the function should handle that.

Wait, but the function's docstring says that if it fails, throw an exception. So, maybe the root is expected to be a valid prefix. So, for example, if the root is empty, then the path starts with it, so it's allowed. But stripping the root would leave the path as is. But maybe that's acceptable.

But perhaps the function is intended to work with file paths, so the root is something like a directory path. So, let's proceed with the logic.

Implementing in Python:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

Wait, but what if the root is longer than the path? Like, path is 'file.txt' and root is '/home'? Then path.startswith(root) would be False, so it raises an error. Which is correct.

But what if the root is exactly the path? Like path is '/home' and root is '/home'? Then the result is an empty string. Is that acceptable? The function returns a path without the root, which in this case is empty. But maybe that's acceptable.

But the problem says to throw an exception if it fails. So, the function will only return a stripped path if the root is a prefix. Otherwise, it raises an error.

Now, for the tests. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so first write the tests.

Let me think of test cases:

Test case 1: Normal case where root is a prefix. For example, path is '/home/user/file.txt', root is '/home' → returns 'user/file.txt'.

Test case 2: Root is exactly the path. path is '/home', root is '/home' → returns ''.

Test case 3: Root is not a prefix. path is '/home/user/file.txt', root is '/usr' → raises ValueError.

Test case 4: Root is empty string. path is 'file.txt', root is '' → returns 'file.txt'.

Test case 5: Root is longer than path. path is 'file.txt', root is '/home' → raises error.

Test case 6: Root has trailing slash. path is '/home/user/file.txt', root is '/home/' → returns 'user/file.txt'.

Wait, in that case, the path starts with '/home/', so the code would work. But if the root is '/home/' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', then path.startswith(root) is True, so it would return the substring starting at len(root), which is 5 (assuming root is '/home/' which is 6 characters? Wait, '/home/' is 6 characters: '/', 'h', 'o', 'm', 'e', '/'. So len(root) is 6. So the path '/home/user/file.txt' starts with '/home/', so the stripped path would be 'user/file.txt'.

But if the root is '/home' (without the trailing slash), then the path '/home/user/file.txt' starts with '/home', so the stripped path is 'user/file.txt'.

So the code handles that.

But what if the root is a substring somewhere in the path, but not the prefix? Like path is '/usr/home/user/file.txt', root is '/home' → starts with? No. So it raises an error.

So the code seems to handle that.

Now, writing the tests. Using the unittest framework.

But the user said to generate the code, but first the tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated in Python markdown. But the tips mention to do test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

But the user's original request is to generate the Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The tips are just suggestions. However, the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format.

Wait, but the user's initial message says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So perhaps the user wants the implementation code, not the tests. But the tips suggest to do TDD, but maybe the user wants the actual function code. However, the initial problem says that the user is a Python software engineer, and the task is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is the function itself, not the tests.

But the user's tip says to first generate tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the actual function code, not the tests. But maybe the user wants both? But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is the function, not the tests.

But the initial problem's example shows that the user provided a function signature and docstring, and the assistant is to generate the code. So the answer is the function code.

So, proceeding with writing the function.

But the function needs to raise an exception if it fails. So, the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is empty? Then path.startswith(root) is True, and returns path[len(root):], which is path[0:], which is the entire path. So that's correct.

But what about if the root is empty string and the path is empty? Then returns empty string. Which is acceptable.

But perhaps there are other edge cases. For example, if the path is None or root is None. But the function's parameters are not specified to handle that. So assuming that path and root are strings.

But the function's parameters are not annotated. So perhaps the function should check that path and root are strings. However, the original problem's function signature doesn't include type hints, so perhaps the code doesn't need to handle that. The function is supposed to throw an exception if it fails, but perhaps the failure here is when the root is not a prefix. The function's responsibility is to remove the root, and if it can't, throw an error.

So the code as written would handle that.

But perhaps the function should check that the root is not empty? For example, if the root is empty, then stripping it would leave the path as is. But according to the problem statement, that's acceptable. The function's docstring says that if it fails, throw an exception. So if the root is empty, then it's a valid case, and the function returns the path as is.

So the code is correct.

Now, the user might want the code with tests. But the original instruction says to output only the code generated. However, the tips mention to do TDD. But perhaps the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the initial problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the function itself.

So the answer is the function code as written above.

But perhaps the exception message should be more specific. For example, the error message could be "Root not found in path" as in the code.

Thus, the final code is as written.
