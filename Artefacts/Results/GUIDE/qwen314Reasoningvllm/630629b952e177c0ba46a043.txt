Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document based on the given signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary with information like url and document_path. 

First, I should think about the parameters. The function takes a url and an optional document_path. The default for document_path is None. So the function probably constructs a dictionary that includes these values. But what's the exact structure of the dictionary? The docstring isn't very specific, so maybe I need to make some assumptions here.

Wait, the user mentioned that they want test-driven development. So maybe I should first write the unit tests before the actual code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. However, the tips suggest starting with tests. But the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. Hmm, maybe the user wants the code, but following TDD, so perhaps I should first write the tests and then the code. But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the user expects the code first, but the tip is just a suggestion. Let me focus on the code.

The function's purpose is to return a formatted dictionary. Let's think about possible keys. The url is provided, and document_path is optional. Maybe the dictionary includes 'url' and 'document_path' keys. If document_path is None, maybe it's omitted or set to a default value. Or perhaps the function is supposed to fetch some data from the URL and document_path, but the docstring doesn't mention that. The current docstring is very vague. 

Wait, the function name is get_nodeinfo_well_known_document. That makes me think of the Well-Known URI scheme, which is used for discovering services. For example, .well-known/ directory. So maybe this function is related to fetching node information from a well-known endpoint. But the parameters are a URL and a document path. Maybe the URL is the base, and the document_path is the path under .well-known. For example, if the URL is 'https://example.com', and document_path is 'nodeinfo', then the full URL would be 'https://example.com/.well-known/nodeinfo'.

But the function's current docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary including url and document_path. So maybe the function constructs a dictionary with those keys. For example, if the URL is 'https://example.com' and document_path is 'nodeinfo', then the dictionary would have 'url': 'https://example.com', 'document_path': 'nodeinfo'. But if document_path is None, maybe it's omitted or set to a default like '/.well-known/nodeinfo'? Or maybe the function is supposed to construct the full URL by combining the base URL with the document_path, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to retrieve the well-known document from the given URL and document path, but the docstring doesn't mention that. The current docstring is very minimal. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I have to make assumptions.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to create a dictionary that includes the provided url and document_path as keys. If document_path is None, maybe it's excluded from the dictionary. Or perhaps the function is supposed to construct the full path by appending the document_path to the URL's path. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Let me look at the function signature again. The parameters are url and document_path, which is optional. The return is a formatted dictionary. So perhaps the function is simply packaging the url and document_path into a dictionary. For example:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But that seems too simple. However, the docstring says "formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path." So maybe that's all it does. But why would the function be named get_nodeinfo_well_known_document? Maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the function is supposed to fetch the document from the URL and document_path, then return information about it. But the docstring doesn't mention that. 

Alternatively, maybe the document_path is the path to the well-known document, like '/.well-known/nodeinfo', and the function constructs the full URL by combining the base URL with the document_path. For example, if the URL is 'https://example.com' and document_path is '/.well-known/nodeinfo', then the full URL is 'https://example.com/.well-known/nodeinfo'. But again, the docstring doesn't mention this.

Given the ambiguity, I think the user expects a simple function that returns a dictionary with the given parameters. So the code would be as simple as returning a dict with 'url' and 'document_path' keys. However, if document_path is None, maybe it's omitted. Or maybe it's included as None. Let's check the parameters: document_path is optional, defaulting to None. So the function could return a dictionary that includes both keys, even if document_path is None.

Another possibility is that the function is part of a larger system where the document_path is used to construct the full URL. But without more context, I can't be sure. 

Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the simplest implementation that matches the given function signature and docstring. So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But maybe the document_path is supposed to be a path under the well-known directory. For example, if the URL is the base, then the full path is url + '/.well-known/' + document_path. But again, without more info, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the well-known document's URL by combining the base URL with the document_path. For example, if the URL is 'https://example.com' and document_path is 'nodeinfo', then the full URL is 'https://example.com/.well-known/nodeinfo'. But the function's name suggests that it's getting the node info from the well-known document, which might involve fetching it. However, the current docstring doesn't mention fetching, just returning a dictionary with the url and document_path.

In that case, the function might just be constructing the full URL. So if the document_path is provided, it's combined with the base URL to form the full URL. But again, this is speculative.

But given the lack of information, the safest bet is to return a dictionary with the given parameters. Therefore, the code would be as simple as that. However, perhaps the document_path is optional, and if it's None, the function uses a default path, like '/.well-known/nodeinfo'. But again, this is an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the well-known document's URL by appending the document_path to the base URL. For example:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    full_url = url + document_path
    return {
        'url': full_url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But this is making assumptions about the default document path and combining the URL and path. However, the original function's docstring doesn't mention this, so I'm not sure.

Since the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps the correct approach is to stick to the minimal implementation that matches the given function signature and docstring. Therefore, the code would be as simple as returning a dictionary with the parameters. So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But maybe the document_path is supposed to be a path relative to the well-known directory. For example, if the URL is the base, then the full path is url + '/.well-known/' + document_path. But again, this is not specified.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the well-known document's URL by combining the base URL with the document_path, assuming that the document_path is the path under the well-known directory. For example, if the URL is 'https://example.com' and document_path is 'nodeinfo', then the full URL is 'https://example.com/.well-known/nodeinfo'.

In that case, the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    """
    Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path.
    """
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    full_url = f"{url}{document_path}"
    return {
        'url': full_url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But again, this is making assumptions not present in the original docstring. The original docstring says the function returns a dictionary including url and document_path, but doesn't specify combining them. So perhaps the first version is correct.

But given the function name, which includes 'well-known', it's likely that the document_path is intended to be under the well-known directory. So maybe the function is supposed to construct the full URL by appending '/.well-known/' + document_path to the base URL. However, without explicit instructions, this is speculative.

In the absence of more information, I think the best approach is to implement the function as per the minimal interpretation of the docstring: returning a dictionary with the provided url and document_path. Therefore, the code would be as follows.
