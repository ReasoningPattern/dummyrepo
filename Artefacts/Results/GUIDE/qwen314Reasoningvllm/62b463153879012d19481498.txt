Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function files_list that returns the files in a given path. Let me start by thinking about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to list files in a specified directory. So, I'll need to use Python's os or pathlib modules. Maybe os.listdir, but that returns all entries, including directories. The problem says "files," so I should filter out directories. Wait, but the docstring says "files in given path"—does that mean only regular files, excluding directories? The original function might not have that detail, but the user's docstring says "files," so perhaps it's intended to return only files, not directories.

So, the steps would be: list all items in the path, check each if it's a file, and collect those. Using os.path.isfile might be a way. Alternatively, with pathlib, Path(path).iterdir() and filter for files.

But first, I need to handle possible exceptions. What if the path doesn't exist? Or isn't a directory? The function's current docstring doesn't mention error handling, but maybe it's better to handle such cases. However, the original function as given doesn't have any error handling, so maybe the user expects it to raise exceptions as per standard library functions.

So, the function could be implemented as:

def files_list(path):
    return [f for f in os.listdir(path) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, f))]

But wait, os.listdir returns the names, and then we need to check if each is a file. But using os.path.isfile requires joining the path with the filename again. Alternatively, using pathlib might be cleaner.

Another approach with pathlib:

from pathlib import Path

def files_list(path):
    return [str(f) for f in Path(path).iterdir() if f.is_file()]

But then, if the path is not a directory, Path(path).iterdir() would raise a NotADirectoryError. Similarly, if the path doesn't exist, it would raise a FileNotFoundError. So, the function as written would propagate those exceptions. But the original function's docstring doesn't mention handling these, so perhaps it's acceptable.

But the user's initial code has the function signature and docstring, but no error handling. So, the code should be written as per that.

Now, the user mentioned to use test-driven development. So first, write the unit tests, then the code.

But the question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code, but the tips suggest first generating tests. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. But the initial problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So perhaps the user expects the code for the function, not the tests. However, the tips suggest TDD, but maybe the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. Let me recheck the original question.

Original instruction: Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format.

So the answer should be the code for the function, not the tests. But the tips mention that I should first generate tests. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code, so perhaps the code is the function implementation. But maybe the user expects the code to include the tests as well? Or maybe the code is just the function.

But looking at the example given in the problem, the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the assistant is supposed to generate the code. So the code would be the function's implementation.

So, the function files_list needs to return the list of files in the given path. Let me proceed to write that.

But I need to make sure that it's handling the path correctly. Let me think about possible edge cases. For example, if the path is a file itself, not a directory. But the function is supposed to return files in the path, so if the path is a file, then the list would be empty? Or maybe the function expects the path to be a directory. But the original function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's up to the implementation.

In Python, if you call os.listdir on a file, it raises a NotADirectoryError. Similarly for Path(path).iterdir(). So, the function as written would raise that error if the path is not a directory. But maybe the function should handle that? However, the original function's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps it's acceptable to let the exceptions propagate.

So, implementing the function with pathlib:

import os
from pathlib import Path

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    return [str(file) for file in Path(path).iterdir() if file.is_file()]

Alternatively, using os:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    return [f for f in os.listdir(path) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, f))]

Both approaches are valid. Which one is better? Pathlib is more modern and object-oriented. However, the os approach is more traditional.

But the function's docstring says "given path"—so the path can be a string. Both approaches accept a string path.

Another consideration: the returned list's elements are the filenames. In the pathlib approach, the files are returned as strings (since str(file) converts the Path object to a string). In the os approach, the list contains the filenames as strings.

So both approaches are correct. Which one to choose? Well, the user hasn't specified any particular preference, so I can choose either.

But perhaps the pathlib approach is more readable. Let's go with that.

So the code would be:

from pathlib import Path

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    return [str(file) for file in Path(path).iterdir() if file.is_file()]

But wait, what if the path is a file? Then Path(path).iterdir() would raise a NotADirectoryError. So the function would raise that exception. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that. So it's up to the caller to handle it.

But maybe the function should return an empty list if the path is a file. However, that's an assumption. The original function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's better to let the exception propagate.

Therefore, the code as written is correct.

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format. So the answer should be enclosed in triple backticks with the python tag.

But the user also mentioned to output only the code generated. So the final answer is the code for the function.
