Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _dump_string function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it serializes a Python object into a YAML stream. So the function probably uses a YAML dumper to convert the object to a YAML string.

First, I should check the parameters. The function takes 'obj' and an optional 'dumper' parameter. The default for dumper is None. If the dumper is not provided, maybe the function uses a default YAML dumper, like from PyYAML's yaml module.

Wait, PyYAML's dump function can take a Dumper class. So maybe the 'dumper' argument here is meant to be a Dumper subclass, like SafeDumper or something else. But the function's docstring doesn't mention that. Hmm.

The function's return is a YAML stream. So perhaps it's returning the YAML string representation of the object. So the code would use yaml.dump(obj, ...), but with the dumper parameter if provided.

But wait, the standard yaml.dump function in PyYAML doesn't take a 'dumper' parameter. Wait, no, actually, the dump function has a 'Dumper' parameter. For example, yaml.dump(data, Dumper=MyDumper). So maybe the 'dumper' argument here is meant to be passed as the Dumper class.

But the function's parameter is called 'dumper', which might be a bit confusing. Let me think. The function's docstring says that the dumper is optional. So perhaps the code would look like:

import yaml

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    """
    Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream

    Args:
        obj: python object

    Returns:
        YAML stream
    """
    if dumper is None:
        return yaml.dump(obj)
    else:
        return yaml.dump(obj, Dumper=dumper)

Wait, but the 'dumper' parameter in the function is named 'dumper', but in the yaml.dump function, the parameter is called 'Dumper' (with a capital D). So maybe the function is intended to pass the dumper argument as the Dumper parameter to yaml.dump. So the code would use the dumper argument as the Dumper class.

But then, what if the user passes a dumper that's not a class? Well, the function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's assumed that the dumper is a valid Dumper class.

But the original function's docstring doesn't mention the 'dumper' parameter. Wait, looking back at the original problem: the function signature includes 'dumper=None' as an argument, but the docstring's Args section only mentions 'obj'. That's a discrepancy. The docstring might be incomplete. But the user provided the function signature and docstring as given, so I have to follow that.

So the function has a 'dumper' argument, but the docstring's Args section doesn't mention it. That's probably a mistake in the docstring, but I have to generate code based on the given signature. So the code should include the 'dumper' parameter, even if the docstring doesn't mention it. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the docstring is incomplete, but I have to proceed.

So, the code would use the 'dumper' parameter as the Dumper class for yaml.dump. So the code would be:

import yaml

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    """
    Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream

    Args:
        obj: python object

    Returns:
        YAML stream
    """
    return yaml.dump(obj, Dumper=dumper)

Wait, but if dumper is None, then yaml.dump would use the default Dumper. So that's correct. But in PyYAML, the default is to use the standard Dumper. However, sometimes people use SafeDumper. But the function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the code is intended to use the default.

But then, why have the 'dumper' parameter? Maybe the function allows the user to specify a different dumper, like SafeDumper, to control the serialization.

But the problem is that the original docstring doesn't mention the 'dumper' argument. However, the function signature includes it, so the code must include it. Therefore, the code would be as above.

But wait, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring's Args section only mentions 'obj', but the function has 'dumper' as an argument. So perhaps the docstring is incomplete. But as a code generator, I need to follow the function signature. So the code will have the 'dumper' parameter, even if the docstring doesn't mention it. However, maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring. But since the user provided that, I have to proceed.

Now, the user also mentioned that I should follow a test-driven development approach, generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown format. However, the initial problem says to generate the code, but the tips suggest writing tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, not the tests. Wait, the original problem says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the tip says to do TDD, first generate tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the actual implementation code, not the tests.

Therefore, the code for the _dump_string function is as I thought: using yaml.dump with the Dumper parameter set to the provided dumper.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me think about possible issues. For example, if the dumper is not a subclass of yaml.Dumper, then it might raise an error. But the function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's up to the caller to provide a valid dumper.

Another thing: the return value is a YAML stream. The yaml.dump function returns a string, which is the YAML representation. So that's correct.

So the code would be:

import yaml

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    """
    Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream

    Args:
        obj: python object

    Returns:
        YAML stream
    """
    return yaml.dump(obj, Dumper=dumper)

But wait, the original function's docstring says that the dumper is an argument, but the Args section doesn't mention it. So maybe the docstring is wrong. However, the user provided that, so perhaps it's a mistake, but I have to follow the function signature. Therefore, the code includes the dumper parameter, even if the docstring doesn't mention it.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must have the 'dumper' parameter, but the docstring's Args section is missing it. Should I correct the docstring? The user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the docstring is incomplete, but I should not modify it. Therefore, the code will have the parameter, but the docstring remains as given.

So the code is as above.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. For example, in PyYAML, the dump function's Dumper parameter is a class, not an instance. So if someone passes an instance, it would be incorrect. But the function's docstring doesn't specify, so it's up to the user.

So the final code is as written.
