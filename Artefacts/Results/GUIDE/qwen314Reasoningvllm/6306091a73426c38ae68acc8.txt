Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called list_of_file_names, which takes settings_dirs and spec_option as parameters. The docstring says it should create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

Wait, first, I need to figure out what the actual implementation should do. The docstring mentions using cli.ListOfFileNames(), but I don't see any imports or context about what 'cli' is. Maybe that's part of the code I need to write? Or perhaps it's an existing module?

Hmm, the user didn't provide any existing code, so I have to assume that cli is a module that has a ListOfFileNames class or function. But the function signature is supposed to return an IniType complex type. Maybe IniType is a class from some other module?

Wait, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The current code is just a stub. The user might want me to implement the function. However, without knowing the exact details of cli.ListOfFileNames and IniType, it's a bit tricky. But maybe the task is to generate the code that uses cli.ListOfFileNames to create an IniType instance.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that the function list_of_file_names is supposed to generate a list of file names based on settings_dirs and spec_option, and then create an IniType object from that. But the docstring is a bit unclear.

Wait, the docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes some parameters and returns an IniType. But how do settings_dirs and spec_option factor into this?

Alternatively, maybe the function list_of_file_names is supposed to generate a list of file names, and then pass that to some other function to create the IniType. But the current function's parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option, which might be used to determine which files to include.

But without more context, it's hard to know. However, the user is asking for code generation based on the given signature and docstring, so perhaps the actual code is just a placeholder that uses cli.ListOfFileNames with some parameters derived from settings_dirs and spec_option.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with some arguments, and return the result. For example, perhaps settings_dirs is a list of directories to search, and spec_option is some option that affects the file selection. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names from the settings_dirs and spec_option, then pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames to create the IniType.

But since the user hasn't provided any existing code or more details, I need to make assumptions here. Let's think about the test-driven approach. The user mentioned that I should first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

So, first, I need to write the unit tests. Let's think about what the function is supposed to do. The function list_of_file_names takes settings_dirs (probably a list of directories) and spec_option (maybe a string or some parameter). It returns an IniType object created via cli.ListOfFileNames.

But for the tests, I need to mock cli.ListOfFileNames, perhaps. Let's imagine that cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes a list of file names and returns an IniType instance. So the list_of_file_names function would generate the list of file names based on settings_dirs and spec_option, then pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames.

But how to generate the list of file names? Maybe the spec_option determines the pattern or the type of files to include. For example, if spec_option is 'config', it might look for .ini files in the directories.

But without knowing the exact logic, it's hard to code. However, the user might just want a placeholder implementation that uses the parameters and calls cli.ListOfFileNames with some constructed list.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the result of cli.ListOfFileNames(), passing settings_dirs and spec_option as arguments. But the original function's parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option, so maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes those parameters.

But the original docstring says that the function creates and returns a new IniType via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So perhaps the code is:

return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But then, what is IniType? Maybe cli.ListOfFileNames returns an instance of IniType.

But the user hasn't provided any code for cli or IniType, so perhaps the actual code is just a wrapper around that function.

But the user's initial code is a function stub. So the task is to implement that function.

But since the user wants test-driven development, first write the tests. Let's think of possible test cases.

For example, test that when settings_dirs is a list of directories and spec_option is a certain value, the function returns an IniType instance. Also, maybe check that cli.ListOfFileNames is called with the correct arguments.

But since the actual implementation depends on cli, which is not provided, perhaps the tests would mock cli.ListOfFileNames.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the code is as simple as:

import cli

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But that's assuming that cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes those parameters and returns an IniType.

Alternatively, maybe cli.ListOfFileNames is a class, and we need to instantiate it. For example:

from cli import ListOfFileNames

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But again, without knowing the actual parameters, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names from the settings_dirs and spec_option, then pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames.

But how to generate the list? For example, if spec_option is a pattern, then search each directory in settings_dirs for files matching that pattern.

But without knowing the exact logic, perhaps the user expects that the code is just a placeholder that uses the parameters and calls cli.ListOfFileNames with them.

So, the actual code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But then, the user would need to import cli.

But the original code didn't have any imports, so maybe that's part of the code to add.

But the user's initial code only shows the function definition. So perhaps the generated code includes the import and the function.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be the function with the implementation.

But the user also mentioned test-driven development, so first write the tests.

So, the answer should first present the unit tests, then the actual code.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, the user's original instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So they want the code that implements the function, not the tests. But the tips mention to use test-driven development, first generating tests. However, the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer is the implementation of the function.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the function as per the docstring, assuming that cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes the parameters and returns the IniType.

So the code would be:

import cli

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But maybe the parameters are different. For example, maybe cli.ListOfFileNames expects a list of file names, which the function needs to generate from settings_dirs and spec_option.

But without more information, it's impossible to know. However, given the docstring, the function's purpose is to call cli.ListOfFileNames and return the result. Therefore, the code would be as above.

But the user might expect that the function list_of_file_names is generating the list of file names, and then passing that to cli.ListOfFileNames. For example, maybe:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    # generate list of file names based on settings_dirs and spec_option
    file_names = [...] 
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(file_names)

But again, without knowing how to generate the file names, it's impossible to code. So perhaps the original function is a wrapper that just passes the parameters to cli.ListOfFileNames.

In conclusion, the generated code would be the function that calls cli.ListOfFileNames with the given parameters.
