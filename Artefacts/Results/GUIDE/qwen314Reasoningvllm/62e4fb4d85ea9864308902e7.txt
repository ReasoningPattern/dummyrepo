Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to generate Python code for the function normalize_cmd, which takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a tuple of strings. The docstring says it's supposed to complement the full path to an executable and return it in its original form. Hmm, I need to figure out what that means exactly.

First, I need to understand what "complement the full path to exe" entails. Maybe the function is supposed to take a command that might be a relative path or just the executable name and convert it into an absolute path. But the return value should be in its original form. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the original form refers to the way the command is presented, like preserving any arguments or options?

Wait, the function's input is a tuple of strings. For example, if the input is ('python', 'script.py'), maybe the function should resolve 'python' to its full path, but leave the rest as is. So the output would be something like ('/usr/bin/python', 'script.py').

But how do I determine the full path of the executable? That would involve checking the system's PATH environment variable. So, the function needs to take the first element of the tuple (assuming it's the executable) and find its full path using something like shutil.which or os.path which.

Wait, the function's name is normalize_cmd. Maybe it's intended to handle cases where the command is given as a relative path or just the name, and convert it to the absolute path. But the original form part is unclear. Maybe the original form refers to the original command structure, like keeping the same arguments but with the executable path resolved.

So, the plan is: take the first element of the cmd tuple, find its full path using the system's PATH, then replace that first element with the full path, and return the modified tuple.

But how to implement that? Let's think about using shutil.which. For example, shutil.which('python') returns the full path if it exists. However, if the first element is already an absolute path, we should leave it as is. Also, if the command is not found, maybe we should return it as is? Or raise an error? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the function assumes that the command exists and returns the full path if possible.

So the steps for the function:

1. Check if the cmd tuple is not empty.
2. Take the first element as the executable name.
3. Use shutil.which to find the full path of the executable.
4. If found, replace the first element with the full path.
5. Return the modified tuple.

But wait, what if the executable is already an absolute path? For example, if the input is ('/usr/bin/python', 'arg1'), then we should leave it as is. So the function should check if the first element is an absolute path. If it is, don't change it. Otherwise, resolve it using shutil.which.

So the code would look something like:

import shutil
import os

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(executable):
        return cmd
    full_path = shutil.which(executable)
    if full_path:
        return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    else:
        # What to do if not found? The docstring doesn't say. Maybe return original?
        return cmd

But the docstring says "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Maybe the original form refers to the original command structure, but with the executable path resolved. So if the executable is not found, perhaps it returns the original command? Or maybe it's expected that the executable exists.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. Since the docstring is not very detailed, perhaps the function is intended to resolve the executable path if it's not absolute. So the code above would be a possible implementation.

Now, for the unit tests. Since the user mentioned test-driven development, I should write tests first.

Test cases:

1. Test when the command is already absolute. Input: ('/usr/bin/python', 'arg1'), output same as input.

2. Test when the command is a relative path or just the name. For example, if 'python' is in PATH, then input ('python', 'arg1') becomes (full_path, 'arg1').

3. Test when the command is not found. For example, if 'nonexistent' is not in PATH, then return the original tuple.

But how to test this? The tests would need to check these scenarios.

But how to handle the case where the executable is not found? The current code returns the original cmd. But maybe the function is supposed to raise an error? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the code as written is acceptable.

Now, writing the unit tests using pytest.

But the user wants the code generated, so the code should include the function and the tests.

But the user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the answer should be the code, including the tests.

But the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD, so first generate tests, then code.

So the code would have the tests first, then the function.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the answer would be:

```python
import shutil
import os
import pytest

def test_normalize_cmd_absolute_path():
    cmd = ('/usr/bin/python', 'arg1')
    assert normalize_cmd(cmd) == cmd

def test_normalize_cmd_relative_path():
    # Assuming 'python' is in the PATH
    original_cmd = ('python', 'arg1')
    normalized = normalize_cmd(original_cmd)
    assert os.path.isabs(normalized[0])

def test_normalize_cmd_not_found():
    cmd = ('nonexistent', 'arg1')
    assert normalize_cmd(cmd) == cmd

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    executable = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(executable):
        return cmd
    full_path = shutil.which(executable)
    if full_path:
        return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    else:
        return cmd
```

Wait, but in the test_normalize_cmd_relative_path, how do we know that 'python' is in the PATH? Well, in most environments, it is. But for the test to pass, the code must find it. However, in some testing environments, maybe the PATH is different. But for the purpose of this example, it's acceptable.

But the code for the function is as discussed.

But the user said to output only the code generated. So the code includes the tests and the function.

But the user might expect that the code is written with the tests first, then the function. However, in practice, the tests would be in a separate file, but for the purpose of this exercise, including them in the same code block is acceptable.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The initial code provided by the user only has the function signature and docstring. So the code generated should include the function and the tests.

So the final code would be as above. However, the tests may not be comprehensive, but they cover the main cases.

Another possible test case: empty tuple. But the function returns it as is.

Another case: cmd with multiple elements, like ('ls', '-l', '/tmp'). The function would resolve 'ls' to its full path.

So the code seems to handle that.

So the generated code would be as written above.
