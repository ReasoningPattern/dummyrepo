Okay, I need to generate Python code for the make_parsers function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, the argparse module is commonly used for parsing command-line arguments. So the function is likely creating an ArgumentParser object and adding subparsers to it. The standard way to do this is to create the main parser, then add_subparsers() to get the subparsers object. Then, each subparser can be added as a subcommand.

But the function's docstring says it returns a tuple of the parser and its subparsers. Wait, maybe the subparsers are added as a group under the main parser. So the main parser is the top-level one, and the subparsers are the ones added via add_subparsers(). So the function would return (parser, subparsers).

Let me outline the steps:

1. Import argparse.
2. Create the main parser using argparse.ArgumentParser().
3. Add subparsers to the main parser using add_subparsers(). This returns a SubParsersAction object, which is used to add subcommands.
4. Return a tuple containing the main parser and the subparsers object.

Wait, but the subparsers object is part of the main parser. So maybe the function is intended to set up the structure where subcommands can be added. However, the function as described doesn't add any specific subcommands; it just sets up the parser and subparsers.

So the code would look something like:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    return parser, subparsers

But I need to make sure that the subparsers are properly configured. The dest parameter in add_subparsers is important because it determines which attribute of the parsed arguments will hold the subcommand name. Without setting dest, the subcommand name might not be accessible.

Alternatively, maybe the subparsers are added with a default value or other parameters. But the function as described doesn't have any specific parameters, so the code should be as simple as creating the parser and subparsers.

But wait, the user mentioned that they want to follow test-driven development, generating unit tests first. However, the user's current request is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not the tests. The initial instruction says to generate the code, not the tests. The tips mention that the assistant should follow TDD, but the user's question is to generate the code, not the tests. So maybe the user wants the code for the function, not the tests.

So the code for make_parsers would be as I outlined. But let me check if there's any other details I'm missing. The function returns a tuple of the parser and subparsers. The subparsers are added via add_subparsers(), which returns the SubParsersAction object. So that's correct.

Therefore, the code would be:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return parser, subparsers

Wait, but when you call add_subparsers(), you might want to set some parameters. For example, the dest parameter. If you don't set it, the subcommand name isn't stored in the parsed arguments. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention any specific configuration, so maybe it's left as default. But in practice, it's common to set dest to 'command' or similar. However, since the function's responsibility is just to create the parser and subparsers, not to configure them further, perhaps the code is correct as is.

Alternatively, maybe the subparsers need to have a help message or other settings. But without more information, the minimal code is to create the parser and add subparsers, returning them as a tuple.

So the generated code would be as above. Now, I need to present this in Python markdown format, as per the user's request. The user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the answer should be:

```python
import argparse

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return parser, subparsers
```

But wait, the user's tips said to use test-driven development, generating tests first. However, the user's question is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The initial problem is to generate the code, not the tests. The tips are for the assistant's own process, but the user's instruction is to generate the code. So perhaps the tests are not part of the current request. The user's instruction says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Therefore, the answer is the code for the make_parsers function as described.
