Okay, I need to generate Python code for the pop method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method does. The docstring says that it removes a specified key and returns the corresponding value. If the key isn't found, it returns the default value if provided, otherwise raises KeyError.

First, I should consider the context. The method is part of a class, probably a custom dictionary-like class since it's implementing pop. The self parameter suggests that it's a method of a class that has a dictionary or some structure to store key-value pairs.

The default parameter has a __marker, which I think is a placeholder to indicate that the default isn't provided. In Python's built-in dict.pop, the default is optional. So, in the code, I need to check if the default is the marker, and if so, raise KeyError when the key isn't found. Otherwise, return the default.

So, the steps for the pop method would be:

1. Check if the key exists in the structure.
2. If it does, remove it and return its value.
3. If it doesn't, check if a default is provided.
4. If default is provided, return it.
5. If not, raise KeyError.

Now, the actual implementation depends on how the class stores its data. Let's assume that the class has a dictionary instance variable, say self.data. So, the code would look something like:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.data:
        return self.data.pop(key)
    elif default is not __marker:
        return default
    else:
        raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but the __marker is probably a sentinel value. In Python's source code, they use objects like this. So, the __marker is likely a private variable defined in the class. But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I need to assume that __marker is a predefined value, maybe a special object.

But in the code, the default parameter is set to __marker. So, when the user calls pop without a default, it's set to this marker. Then, in the code, if the key isn't found, we check if default is not the marker. If it's not, return it. Otherwise, raise KeyError.

So, the code would need to have access to this __marker. But how is it defined? Maybe the class has a __marker attribute. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code is part of a class that already has this __marker defined.

But for the purpose of writing this method, I'll proceed under the assumption that __marker is a predefined value in the class's scope.

Now, considering the test-driven approach. The user mentioned to generate unit tests first. But the question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. However, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips mention TDD, generating tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. Wait, the original problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, perhaps the user wants the actual implementation of the pop method. But the function signature is part of a class. So, the code would be part of a class, perhaps a custom dictionary.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition. So, maybe the code is for a class that has a data structure, like a dictionary, and the pop method is implemented as per the docstring.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self.data:
            return self.data.pop(key)
        elif default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

But wait, what is __marker? In Python's standard dict, the default is optional. So, perhaps in the class, __marker is a special object, like an instance of a private class or something. However, since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code is intended to be part of a class that already has that __marker defined.

Alternatively, maybe the __marker is a placeholder, and in practice, the code uses a default value. But in Python, the default for pop is None if not provided. Wait, no: the default is not provided, and if the key is not found, KeyError is raised. So, in the code, the default is optional. So, the code should check if the default is provided.

But in the function signature, the default is set to __marker, which is probably a sentinel value. So, in the code, when the user calls pop with a default, that value is used. Otherwise, KeyError is raised.

But how to handle __marker? If the class doesn't have it, this code would not work. So, perhaps the __marker is a private variable in the class. For example:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        ...
        if default is not self.__marker:
            ...

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code is supposed to assume that __marker is defined elsewhere. However, in practice, the code would need to have that __marker defined.

But given that the user provided the function signature with default=__marker, perhaps the code is part of a class where __marker is a predefined value. Therefore, the code for the pop method would be as I outlined earlier.

But the user wants the code generated. So, the code would be the method inside a class. However, the user might not have provided the class, but the function signature is part of a class. Therefore, the generated code would be the method, assuming that the class has the necessary data structure (like self.data) and the __marker is defined.

But perhaps the user expects that the code is for a class that's similar to a dictionary. Therefore, the code would be:

class CustomDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self.data:
            return self.data.pop(key)
        elif default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

But again, the __marker needs to be defined. So, perhaps the class also defines __marker as a private object.

So, adding that:

class CustomDict:
    __marker = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self.data:
            return self.data.pop(key)
        elif default is not self.__marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

This way, the __marker is a unique object, and when the default is not provided, it's set to this marker. Then, in the code, if the default is not the marker, it's returned. Otherwise, KeyError is raised.

This seems correct. So, the generated code would be this class with the pop method.

But the user's original function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, which suggests that the __marker is defined in the class's scope. Therefore, the code should include that.

So, the final code would be the class with __marker defined, __init__ method, and the pop method as described.
