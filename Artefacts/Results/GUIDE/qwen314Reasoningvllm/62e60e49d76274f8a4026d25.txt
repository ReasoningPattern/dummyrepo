Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the unit_of_work function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to return a decorator that has metadata and timeout attributes. Hmm.

First, the function takes metadata and timeout as parameters. The decorator should probably be a class or a function that can hold these attributes. Wait, decorators in Python can be implemented as functions or classes. Since the docstring says the decorator has attributes, maybe using a class would be better because functions can't hold state as easily.

Wait, but the unit_of_work function returns a decorator. So maybe the decorator is a class that can be used as a decorator. Let me think. When you use a class as a decorator, you typically call it with the function being decorated, and then the class instance is used. But how do you add attributes to the decorator?

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a function that wraps another function, and the metadata and timeout are stored as attributes of that function. But functions can have attributes, right? So perhaps the unit_of_work function returns a decorator function that has those attributes set.

Wait, the docstring says the decorator has metadata and timeout attributes. So when someone uses @unit_of_work(...), the decorator itself should have those attributes. Let me think about how to structure this.

Let me outline the steps. The unit_of_work function is a factory that creates a decorator. The decorator needs to have metadata and timeout as attributes. So when you call unit_of_work(metadata='something', timeout=5), it returns a decorator that has those attributes.

So, the unit_of_work function could return a function that is the decorator. But how to attach the metadata and timeout to that decorator function. Oh right, in Python, functions can have attributes. So maybe the unit_of_work function creates a decorator function, sets its metadata and timeout attributes, and returns it.

Wait, but how does the decorator function work? The decorator needs to take a function and return a wrapped version. So maybe the unit_of_work function returns a decorator function that, when applied, wraps the target function and possibly uses the metadata and timeout.

But the problem here is that the user's function signature is just the unit_of_work function, which returns a decorator. The actual implementation details of the decorator's behavior (like what it does when applied to a function) aren't specified. The docstring just says it returns a decorator with those attributes.

So maybe the main task here is to create a decorator that has those attributes, regardless of what the decorator does. So the code for the unit_of_work function would create a decorator (maybe a function or a class) that has the metadata and timeout attributes set.

Let me think of an example. Suppose I have:

@unit_of_work(metadata={'source': 'db'}, timeout=10)
def my_function():
    pass

Then, the decorator applied to my_function should have metadata and timeout attributes. So, perhaps the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that, when applied, has those attributes.

So, the unit_of_work function could create a decorator function that has those attributes. Let's try to code that.

The unit_of_work function could be written as:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # wrap the function if needed
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        # attach metadata and timeout to the wrapper?
        # Or to the decorator?
        # Wait, the decorator is the function that is returned by unit_of_work.
        # Wait, no. The unit_of_work returns the decorator, which is the function that is applied to the target function.

        # So, the decorator function (the one returned by unit_of_work) needs to have the metadata and timeout as attributes.

        # So perhaps, the decorator function itself (the one that is returned by unit_of_work) has those attributes.

        # Let me think. The unit_of_work function returns a decorator, which is a function that takes a function and returns a wrapped function.

        # So, the unit_of_work function creates a decorator function, which is the one that will be applied to the target function. That decorator function needs to have the metadata and timeout attributes.

        # So, the code could be:

        # Create the decorator function, and set its attributes.

        # Wait, but the decorator function is the one that is returned by unit_of_work. So, in the code:

        def decorator(func):
            # ... some code ...
            return wrapper

        # Then, the unit_of_work function returns this decorator, and we need to set metadata and timeout on it.

        # So, perhaps:

        decorator.metadata = metadata
        decorator.timeout = timeout
        return decorator

    return decorator

Wait, but in this case, the unit_of_work function returns the decorator function, which has the metadata and timeout attributes. So when someone uses @unit_of_work(...), the decorator function (which is the one that gets applied to the target function) has those attributes.

But then, when the decorator is applied, the metadata and timeout are attached to the decorator function itself, not to the wrapper. But the user's docstring says that the decorator has those attributes. So this approach would work.

But wait, in this case, the decorator function (the one that is returned by unit_of_work) has the metadata and timeout attributes. So when you do @unit_of_work(...), the decorator is the function that is applied, and that function has the attributes.

So, the code for the unit_of_work function would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator

Wait, but in this case, the decorator function (the one that is returned by unit_of_work) is the one that has the attributes. But when you apply the decorator, the decorator function is called with the target function, and returns the wrapper. But the attributes are on the decorator function, not on the wrapper. So if someone wants to access the metadata on the wrapped function, they would have to get it from the decorator, not from the wrapper.

But the docstring says that the decorator has those attributes, which would be the case here. So this seems to fit.

But perhaps the user expects that the decorator's attributes are available on the wrapped function. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. The docstring just says the decorator has those attributes.

So this approach would work. However, there's a problem here: when the unit_of_work function is called, it returns the decorator function, which has the metadata and timeout attributes. But when the decorator is applied to a function, the decorator function is called with the target function, and returns the wrapper. So the attributes are on the decorator function, not on the wrapper.

But the user's docstring says that the decorator (the one returned by unit_of_work) has those attributes. So this is correct.

So the code for the unit_of_work function would be as above.

But wait, what if the user wants to have the metadata and timeout on the wrapper function? That's not clear from the docstring. But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes, so the decorator function (the one returned by unit_of_work) should have them.

So the code seems correct.

But perhaps the user expects that the decorator is a class, but the function signature shows that unit_of_work returns a decorator, which can be a function or a class.

But given the information, the code above should work.

Now, the user also mentioned that I should follow test-driven development, generating unit tests first. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated in Python markdown format. However, the initial part of the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention TDD, but the user now says to output only the code generated.

Wait, the user's original instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So perhaps the user wants the code for the unit_of_work function, not the tests. But the tips mention generating tests first. However, the user says to output only the code generated. So maybe the code for the unit_of_work function is what is needed.

But perhaps the user expects that the code includes the unit tests as well. But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated. However, the tips mention TDD, but the user's instruction says to output the code generated, not the tests.

So perhaps the code for the unit_of_work function is what is needed.

So, the code for the unit_of_work function would be as I outlined earlier. Let me write that.

Wait, but in the code above, the unit_of_work function returns a decorator function that has metadata and timeout attributes. Let me test this with an example.

For example:

@unit_of_work(metadata={'test': 1}, timeout=5)
def my_func():
    pass

print(my_func.__wrapped__.metadata)  # Wait, no. The decorator function is the one that has the attributes. The wrapper is the function returned by the decorator.

Wait, in the code above, the decorator function (the one returned by unit_of_work) is the one that has the metadata and timeout attributes. The wrapper is the function that is returned when the decorator is applied to my_func.

So, if I have:

decorator = unit_of_work(metadata='test', timeout=10)
@decorator
def my_func():
    pass

Then, decorator.metadata would be 'test', and decorator.timeout would be 10. But the my_func's wrapper would not have those attributes. So, if someone wants to access the metadata, they would have to get it from the decorator function, not from the wrapped function.

But the docstring says that the decorator has those attributes, which is correct.

So the code for the unit_of_work function would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator

But wait, in this code, the decorator function is the one that is returned by unit_of_work. When you apply @unit_of_work(...), the decorator is called with the function, and returns the wrapper. But the attributes are on the decorator function, not on the wrapper.

So, if someone wants to access the metadata, they have to get it from the decorator function. For example:

@unit_of_work(metadata='test', timeout=5)
def my_func():
    pass

print(my_func.__wrapped__.__decorator__.metadata)  # Not sure if that's possible.

But in reality, the decorator is the function that was returned by unit_of_work. So, if you have:

decorator = unit_of_work(metadata='test', timeout=5)
@decorator
def my_func():
    pass

Then, decorator.metadata is 'test'.

But when using the @unit_of_work(...) syntax, the decorator is the function returned by unit_of_work, which has the metadata and timeout attributes. So, the code seems correct.

But perhaps the user expects that the decorator is a class, but the function signature shows that it's a function. So the code above should be correct.

Another approach: maybe the decorator is a class that has the metadata and timeout as attributes, and the __call__ method applies the decoration.

But again, the problem doesn't specify the behavior of the decorator, only that it has those attributes.

So the code I wrote earlier should be acceptable.

Now, I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me think about possible edge cases.

If metadata is None, then the decorator's metadata attribute is None. Similarly for timeout.

Yes.

So the code seems to handle that.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

```python
def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator
```

But wait, the decorator function is the one that is returned by unit_of_work. When you apply the decorator to a function, the decorator is called with the function, and returns the wrapper. The attributes are on the decorator function, not on the wrapper. So, if someone wants to access the metadata, they need to get it from the decorator function, not from the wrapped function.

But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes, which is correct.

So this should be the correct code.
