Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _convert_non_cli_args based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it casts arguments to correct types by modifying the values_dict. All values are strings by default, so the function's job is to convert them to the appropriate types based on the parser_name.

First, I should figure out how the parser_name relates to the argument types. For example, if the parser is 'main', maybe some arguments are integers or booleans. But the problem is, the function doesn't have any information about what arguments are expected except for the parser name. So perhaps there's a predefined mapping of parser names to their argument types.

Wait, the function is part of a class, but the code isn't provided. So maybe the function is part of a class that has some configuration or mappings. But since the user hasn't provided that, I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to look up the expected types based on the parser_name. For example, if parser_name is 'virsh', certain arguments might be integers, while others are booleans. But without knowing the specific mappings, I can't code that directly. However, the user probably expects a generic implementation that can be extended.

Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to check for certain keys in the values_dict and convert them based on the parser. For example, if the parser is 'main', maybe there's an 'timeout' argument that should be an integer. But without knowing the actual parameters, this is tricky.

Wait, the user mentioned test-driven development. So perhaps I should first write tests that cover different scenarios. Let me think about possible test cases.

For example, if parser_name is 'main', and values_dict has a key 'timeout' with value '30', the function should convert it to 30 as an integer. Similarly, a boolean like 'True' should be converted to True. But how does the function know which keys to convert? Maybe there's a configuration or a predefined set of rules for each parser.

Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the function is supposed to be a placeholder that can be extended. But the user wants the code generated. So perhaps the function is supposed to have some logic based on the parser_name. Let me think of a possible approach.

Maybe the function uses a dictionary that maps parser names to a list of argument names and their target types. For example:

CONVERSION_RULES = {
    'main': {
        'timeout': int,
        'verbose': bool,
    },
    'virsh': {
        'domain_id': int,
    },
    # etc.
}

Then, for each parser_name, the function would check the conversion rules and apply the type conversion to the corresponding keys in values_dict.

But since the user hasn't provided this data, perhaps the function is supposed to be a skeleton that can be filled in later. However, the user wants the code generated, so I need to make an assumption here.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle common types. For example, if a value is 'True' or 'False', convert to boolean. If it's a number, convert to int or float. But that's more of a general approach.

But the docstring says that the function modifies values_dict in place. So the function should iterate over the keys in values_dict and convert them based on the parser_name.

Wait, but without knowing which keys to convert, how can the function proceed? Maybe the function is supposed to be extended with specific rules. For example, the function could check if the parser_name is known and apply specific conversions.

So, perhaps the code would look like this:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    if parser_name == 'main':
        # Convert specific args for main parser
        if 'timeout' in values_dict:
            values_dict['timeout'] = int(values_dict['timeout'])
        if 'verbose' in values_dict:
            values_dict['verbose'] = values_dict['verbose'].lower() in ['true', 'yes']
    elif parser_name == 'virsh':
        # Convert specific args for virsh parser
        if 'domain_id' in values_dict:
            values_dict['domain_id'] = int(values_dict['domain_id'])
    # Add more elif cases for other parsers as needed
    # ...
    return values_dict

But this is just an example. However, the user might expect that the code is more dynamic, perhaps using a configuration that's part of the class.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use some predefined mappings stored in the class. For example, the class might have a dictionary that maps parser names to conversion rules. But since the code isn't provided, I can't know that.

But the user wants the code generated. So perhaps the best approach is to write a function that can be extended with conversion rules for different parsers, using a dictionary that's part of the class.

So, the code might look like this:

class SomeClass:
    CONVERSION_RULES = {
        'main': {
            'timeout': int,
            'verbose': lambda x: x.lower() in ['true', 'yes'],
        },
        'virsh': {
            'domain_id': int,
        },
        # other parsers...
    }

    def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
        """
        Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

        By default all the values are strings.

        :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
        :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
        """
        rules = self.CONVERSION_RULES.get(parser_name, {})
        for key, converter in rules.items():
            if key in values_dict:
                try:
                    values_dict[key] = converter(values_dict[key])
                except (ValueError, TypeError):
                    # Handle conversion errors if needed
                    pass
        return values_dict

But again, this is making assumptions about the class structure. However, since the user hasn't provided that, this might be the best approach.

Alternatively, if the function is supposed to be standalone and not part of a class with such a CONVERSION_RULES, then perhaps the code would be different. But given that the function is a method (self is the first parameter), it's likely part of a class.

So, putting it all together, the code would involve checking the parser_name, applying conversion rules for each parser, and modifying the values_dict in place.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual conversion rules, the code would need to be a template that can be extended. Therefore, the generated code would include a method that uses a class-level dictionary for conversion rules and applies them based on the parser name.

So, the final code would look like the example I wrote above, with the CONVERSION_RULES as a class attribute and the method applying the conversions.
