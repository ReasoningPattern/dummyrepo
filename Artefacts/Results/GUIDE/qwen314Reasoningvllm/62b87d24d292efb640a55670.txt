Okay, I need to generate Python code for the get_versions function based on the given signature and docstring. The function should obtain version information and return a default if it can't. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the docstring says that if the version can't be obtained, return a default. So I need to handle cases where fetching the version might fail. Maybe using a try-except block?

What's the typical way to get version info in Python? Often, packages use importlib.metadata or setuptools to get the version from setup.py or a version file. But since the user hasn't specified, I should make an example that's generic.

Maybe the function tries to import a module or read a file. Let's assume that the version is stored in a file called version.txt, or perhaps it's in the package's metadata. Let me think of a common approach.

Alternatively, maybe using importlib.metadata to get the distribution version. For example, importing importlib.metadata and then getting the version of the current package. But the function's name is get_versions, plural. Maybe it's supposed to return multiple versions? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be get_version. But the user provided the function name as get_versions, so I have to stick with that.

Wait, the function's docstring says "version information" which could be a single string or a list. But the default is not specified. The default could be None, or an empty list, or a string. The docstring doesn't say, so I need to make an assumption.

Let me think of a possible implementation. Suppose the function tries to read the version from a file, and if that fails, returns a default. For example:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('version.txt') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except Exception:
        return 'default_version'

But the user might expect something more robust. Alternatively, using importlib.metadata:

import importlib.metadata

def get_versions():
    try:
        return importlib.metadata.version('my_package')
    except importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError:
        return 'default_version'

But the package name would need to be specified. However, the function's name is get_versions, which might imply getting multiple versions, but that's unclear. Maybe the function is supposed to return a list of versions, but the docstring isn't clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger project where version info is stored in a specific way. Since the user hasn't provided details, I need to make a reasonable assumption.

Another approach: the function could check for environment variables. For example, if the VERSION env var is set, return that, else default.

But without more context, I need to create a sample implementation that fits the docstring. The key points are: try to get version info, return default if not possible.

So, perhaps the code would look like:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        # Some code to get version
        version = "1.0.0"  # Placeholder, actual code would replace this
        return version
    except Exception:
        return "default_version"

But that's too simplistic. The actual code to get the version depends on the project setup. Since the user hasn't provided specifics, maybe the answer should use a try-except block with a placeholder for the actual version retrieval logic.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the Python version, but that's not indicated in the docstring.

Wait, the user also mentioned to use test-driven development, generating unit tests first. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not to write tests first. However, the initial instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. But the user's tips mention TDD, but the actual task is to generate the code.

So, perhaps the answer should be the function implementation. Let me proceed with writing the function with a try-except block that attempts to get the version, and returns a default if it fails.

For example, using importlib.metadata to get the version of the current package. Let's assume the package name is 'my_package'.

But since the function is called get_versions, maybe it's supposed to return a list of versions, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be get_version. However, the user provided the function name as is.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the version of the current package, and the name is a typo. But without more info, I'll proceed with a simple example.

So here's a possible implementation:

import importlib.metadata

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return importlib.metadata.version('my_package')
    except importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError:
        return 'default_version'

But the package name 'my_package' is arbitrary. Alternatively, if the function is part of a package, it might use __import__ or other methods. However, without knowing the actual setup, this is a guess.

Alternatively, if the version is stored in a file, like __version__.py:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        import my_package.__version__ as version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return 'default_version'

But again, this depends on the project structure.

Since the user hasn't provided specifics, I think the best approach is to write a function that tries to get the version using importlib.metadata, and returns a default if it can't. The default could be a string like 'unknown' or 'default_version'.

So the code would be:

import importlib.metadata

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return importlib.metadata.version('my_package')
    except importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError:
        return 'default_version'

But the package name 'my_package' is a placeholder. However, the user might expect that the function is part of a package and uses the current package's name. To get the current package's name, you can use __name__.

But in that case, maybe:

import importlib.metadata
import os

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        package_name = os.path.basename(os.path.abspath('.'))
        return importlib.metadata.version(package_name)
    except importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError:
        return 'default_version'

But this is getting complicated and might not work correctly. Alternatively, the function could use the __name__ of the module, but that depends on how it's called.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the Python version. But that's not indicated in the docstring.

In the absence of specific information, I think the best approach is to provide a function that attempts to retrieve the version using importlib.metadata, catches the exception, and returns a default. The package name would need to be specified, but since it's not given, perhaps the example uses a placeholder.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

import importlib.metadata

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return importlib.metadata.version('my_package')
    except importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError:
        return 'default_version'

But the user might expect that the default is None or an empty string. The docstring says "the default value is returned", but doesn't specify what that value is. So perhaps the default is an empty string or None. However, the example returns 'default_version' as a string.

Alternatively, maybe the default is an empty list, but that's unclear. Since the docstring doesn't specify, the code can return any default value, but it's better to choose a common one like 'unknown' or '0.0.0'.

Another approach: if the version cannot be obtained, return None. So:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        # Some code to get version
        version = "1.0.0"
        return version
    except Exception:
        return None

But again, the actual code to get the version is missing. Since the user hasn't provided specifics, perhaps the code should include a try-except block with a placeholder for the actual version retrieval logic.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. Without more details, the code is somewhat generic. However, the user might expect that the code uses a standard method to get the version, like reading from a file or using importlib.metadata.

Considering that, I'll proceed with the importlib.metadata approach, assuming that the package name is known. The code would be as follows.
