Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Python function called parse_frequency that takes a frequency string and returns a datetime.timedelta instance. The function needs to handle cases where the input is None or "always" by returning None. Otherwise, it should parse the string into a timedelta. If it can't parse, it raises a ValueError.

First, I need to think about the steps required. The input is a string like "3 days" or "1 hour". The function needs to split this into a number and a unit. Then, map that unit to the corresponding argument for timedelta. For example, "days" maps to days=3, "hours" to hours=1, etc.

Wait, the example given in the docstring says that "3 timeunit" returns a timedelta with timeunit=3. But the actual parameters for timedelta are like days, seconds, etc. So maybe the function is supposed to map the unit to the correct parameter name. For example, "day" becomes days=3, "hour" becomes hours=3, etc.

But the example in the docstring uses "timeunit" as a placeholder. So perhaps the actual code needs to map the unit string to the corresponding keyword argument for timedelta. Let me check the possible units. The allowed units for timedelta are days, seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours, weeks. So the input string's unit part must be one of these, possibly in plural or singular form?

Wait, the problem says the input is a string like "number timeunit". So the unit part is a single word, like "day", "days", "hour", etc. But how to handle different forms? For example, "day" vs "days". The function should probably accept both, but maybe the code should normalize them. For example, if the unit is "day", it's treated as days. Similarly for "hour" as hours.

So the first step is to split the input string into two parts: the number and the unit. Then, convert the unit to the correct parameter name for timedelta. Then, create a timedelta with that parameter set to the number.

But how to split the string? The input is a string like "3 days". So splitting on whitespace, but what if the number has a decimal point? The problem says "number", which could be an integer or a float. However, the example uses "3 timeunit", implying an integer. But the function should handle any number, I suppose.

So, split the string into parts. The first part is the number, the second is the unit. But what if the string has more than one space? Like " 3   days "? Probably, the code should split on whitespace and take the first non-empty part as the number, and the rest as the unit. But maybe the function expects exactly one space between the number and the unit. The problem says the input is "number timeunit", so maybe it's safe to split on the first space.

Wait, for example, if the input is "30seconds", that would be invalid. But the function should raise ValueError in that case. So the code needs to split the string into two parts: the number part and the unit part. So perhaps using split() with maxsplit=1. For example, "3 days" would split into ["3", "days"], "1.5 hours" into ["1.5", "hours"], etc.

Once the parts are split, the number part needs to be converted to a float or integer. Then, the unit part needs to be mapped to the corresponding parameter for timedelta.

So, for the unit mapping:

- "day" or "days" → days
- "hour" or "hours" → hours
- "minute" or "minutes" → minutes
- "second" or "seconds" → seconds
- "millisecond" or "milliseconds" → milliseconds
- "microsecond" or "microseconds" → microseconds
- "week" or "weeks" → weeks

But how to handle the pluralization? The code can check if the unit is plural and then take the singular form. For example, if the unit is "days", we can take "day" as the key. But perhaps the code can normalize the unit to the singular form. Alternatively, check for both singular and plural forms.

So, create a dictionary that maps both singular and plural forms to the correct parameter name. For example:

unit_map = {
    'day': 'days',
    'days': 'days',
    'hour': 'hours',
    'hours': 'hours',
    'minute': 'minutes',
    'minutes': 'minutes',
    'second': 'seconds',
    'seconds': 'seconds',
    'millisecond': 'milliseconds',
    'milliseconds': 'milliseconds',
    'microsecond': 'microseconds',
    'microseconds': 'microseconds',
    'week': 'weeks',
    'weeks': 'weeks'
}

Wait, but the parameter names for timedelta are days, seconds, etc. So for example, if the unit is 'day', the parameter is 'days', so the code would need to use that. So the mapping is from the input unit string to the parameter name.

So, once the unit is normalized, we can get the parameter name. Then, create a timedelta with that parameter set to the number.

But what if the unit is not in the unit_map? Then, raise ValueError.

So the steps for the code are:

1. Check if frequency is None or "always": return None.

2. Else, split the frequency into number_part and unit_part.

3. Convert number_part to a float (or int, but float can handle both).

4. Check if unit_part is in the unit_map. If not, raise ValueError.

5. Get the parameter name from the unit_map.

6. Create a timedelta with that parameter set to the number.

But wait, the timedelta constructor takes keyword arguments. So for example, if the parameter is 'days', then we do timedelta(days=3). But how to handle that in code? The code can create a dictionary with the parameter name as the key and the number as the value, then pass that to timedelta.

So, for example:

params = {unit_map[unit_part]: number}

Then, return datetime.timedelta(**params)

But need to make sure that the unit_part is in the unit_map.

Now, handling the splitting of the frequency string. Let's think about possible edge cases. For example, "30" (no unit) would split into ["30", ""], which would be invalid. Or "3 days hour" would split into ["3", "days hour"], which is invalid. So the code should check that after splitting, there are exactly two parts, and the unit part is not empty.

So, the code could split the frequency into parts using split() with maxsplit=1. Then check that len(parts) == 2. If not, raise ValueError.

So, code steps:

def parse_frequency(frequency):
    if frequency is None or frequency == "always":
        return None
    parts = frequency.split(maxsplit=1)
    if len(parts) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid frequency format")
    number_str, unit_str = parts
    try:
        number = float(number_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number in frequency")
    # Now process unit_str
    # Check if unit_str is in unit_map
    unit_map = {
        'day': 'days',
        'days': 'days',
        'hour': 'hours',
        'hours': 'hours',
        'minute': 'minutes',
        'minutes': 'minutes',
        'second': 'seconds',
        'seconds': 'seconds',
        'millisecond': 'milliseconds',
        'milliseconds': 'milliseconds',
        'microsecond': 'microseconds',
        'microseconds': 'microseconds',
        'week': 'weeks',
        'weeks': 'weeks'
    }
    if unit_str not in unit_map:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit_str}")
    param_name = unit_map[unit_str]
    # Now create the timedelta
    return datetime.timedelta(**{param_name: number})

Wait, but the example in the docstring says that given "3 timeunit", return datetime.timedelta(timeunit=3). But that's not possible because the timedelta constructor doesn't have a 'timeunit' parameter. So maybe the example is a placeholder, and the actual code should map to the correct parameters. So the example is illustrative, but the actual code uses the correct parameters.

So the code above would handle that.

But what about cases where the unit is misspelled, like "dats"? Then, the code raises ValueError.

Now, testing this code. Let's think about possible test cases.

Test case 1: frequency is None → returns None.

Test case 2: frequency is "always" → returns None.

Test case 3: "3 days" → returns timedelta(days=3).

Test case 4: "1.5 hours" → returns timedelta(hours=1.5).

Test case 5: "2 weeks" → returns timedelta(weeks=2).

Test case 6: "5 seconds" → returns timedelta(seconds=5).

Test case 7: "invalid" → split into ["invalid"], len(parts) is 1 → ValueError.

Test case 8: "3 day" → unit_str is "day" → mapped to 'days' → timedelta(days=3).

Test case 9: "3 days" → same as test case 3.

Test case 10: "3 week" → unit_str is "week" → mapped to 'weeks' → timedelta(weeks=3).

Test case 11: "3 weekss" → unit_str is "weekss" → not in unit_map → ValueError.

Now, the code seems to handle these cases.

But what about units that are not in the unit_map? For example, "3 months" → raises ValueError.

Now, the code uses the unit_map as defined. So that's correct.

Now, the function returns a datetime.timedelta instance. The docstring says that the return is a str, but that's a mistake. Wait, looking back at the original problem:

The docstring says:

@return str, the corresponding datetime

But that's incorrect. The function is supposed to return a datetime.timedelta instance. So that's a typo in the docstring. The user probably made a mistake. So the code should return a timedelta, not a string.

So, the code is correct as written, but the docstring's return type is wrong. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the user intended the return to be a timedelta, and the docstring's @return is a mistake. So the code should return a timedelta.

So, the code as written would be correct.

Now, implementing the code.

But need to import datetime.

So, the code would need to import datetime.

But the function is supposed to return a datetime.timedelta instance.

Now, the code:

import datetime

def parse_frequency(frequency):
    if frequency is None or frequency == "always":
        return None
    parts = frequency.split(maxsplit=1)
    if len(parts) != 2:
        raise ValueError("Invalid frequency format")
    number_str, unit_str = parts
    try:
        number = float(number_str)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number in frequency")
    unit_map = {
        'day': 'days',
        'days': 'days',
        'hour': 'hours',
        'hours': 'hours',
        'minute': 'minutes',
        'minutes': 'minutes',
        'second': 'seconds',
        'seconds': 'seconds',
        'millisecond': 'milliseconds',
        'milliseconds': 'milliseconds',
        'microsecond': 'microseconds',
        'microseconds': 'microseconds',
        'week': 'weeks',
        'weeks': 'weeks'
    }
    if unit_str not in unit_map:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit_str}")
    param_name = unit_map[unit_str]
    return datetime.timedelta(**{param_name: number})

But wait, the example in the docstring says that given "3 timeunit", return datetime.timedelta(timeunit=3). But according to this code, it would raise ValueError because 'timeunit' is not in the unit_map. So the example is illustrative, but the actual code would require the unit to be one of the allowed ones.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the user also mentioned that the code should follow test-driven development, generating unit tests first. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown format. But the initial instruction says to generate code, but the tips mention TDD. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. So perhaps the code is sufficient as written.

But the user might have made a mistake in the docstring's return type. The function returns a datetime.timedelta, not a string. So the docstring's @return line is incorrect. But the code is correct.

So, the code is as above.
