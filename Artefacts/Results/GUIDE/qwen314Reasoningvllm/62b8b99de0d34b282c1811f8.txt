Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _reset_logging class method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so I should start by writing comprehensive unit tests before implementing the actual code.

First, let me think about what the _reset_logging method does. The docstring says it's supposed to reset the logging system. In Python, the logging module has a basicConfig method that can be used to set up the root logger. To reset logging, maybe the method should call basicConfig with default parameters to reset any previous configurations.

But how to test this? I need to write tests that check if the logging is properly reset. Maybe I can check the root logger's handlers and their levels before and after calling _reset_logging. Also, perhaps check if the logging level is set to the default (like WARNING) after reset.

Wait, but the method is a class method, so it's part of a class. The user didn't provide the class name, but the method is called _reset_logging, which is a common naming convention for internal methods. However, the tests need to be written in a way that can be run independently.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create a test class for testing the _reset_logging method.
2. In the test, set up some logging configuration, then call the method and check if it resets to default.
3. For the actual implementation, the _reset_logging method should reset the logging configuration.

But since the user hasn't provided the class that this method belongs to, I need to assume that the method is part of a class, maybe a utility class. However, for testing purposes, I can create a dummy class with this method and test it.

Wait, but the user's code is supposed to generate the code for the _reset_logging method. So the tests would be written first, then the implementation.

So, the unit tests would be in a test file, perhaps using the unittest framework. Let me think about writing those tests.

In the test, I can do the following:

- Import logging and the class that contains _reset_logging.
- Set up a test case where logging is configured with some handlers and levels.
- Call the _reset_logging method.
- Check that the root logger's handlers are reset, and the level is default.

But how to handle the class? Let's assume that the method is part of a class called LoggerUtils or similar. However, since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the tests can be written in a way that doesn't depend on the specific class, but rather on the method's behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the method is a static method or a class method that doesn't require instance variables. So, for testing, I can create a dummy class with this method and test it.

Let me draft the test code:

import logging
import unittest
from mymodule import LoggerUtils  # Assuming the class is in a module

class TestResetLogging(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_reset_logging(self):
        # Set up initial logging configuration
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
        self.assertEqual(logging.getLogger().level, logging.DEBUG)
        
        # Call the reset method
        LoggerUtils._reset_logging()
        
        # Check if the logging level is reset to default (WARNING)
        self.assertEqual(logging.getLogger().level, logging.WARNING)
        # Check if handlers are reset, maybe check the number of handlers
        self.assertEqual(len(logging.getLogger().handlers), 1)  # Assuming default handler

But wait, the default basicConfig adds a StreamHandler. So after reset, the root logger should have that.

But how to ensure that the _reset_logging method is doing that? The actual implementation would need to call logging.basicConfig() with default arguments, which would reset the logging configuration.

So the implementation of _reset_logging would be:

@classmethod
def _reset_logging(cls):
    logging.basicConfig()

But wait, the basicConfig method is called without any arguments, which uses the default settings: level=WARNING, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', etc.

So, the method would simply call logging.basicConfig().

But in the test, when I call basicConfig with level=logging.DEBUG, then call _reset_logging, which calls basicConfig again, which would reset it to the default. So the test would pass.

But I need to make sure that the test is properly structured.

Now, the user wants the code generated. The user's initial request is to generate the Python code based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD. So the answer should first show the unit tests, then the implementation.

But the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the answer should include both the test code and the implementation code.

Wait, the user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the answer should include both the tests and the implementation.

So the code generated would be two parts: the unit tests and the actual method.

But how to structure that? Let me think.

The user's function signature is for a class method, so the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def _reset_logging(cls):
        """
        Reset the logging system
        """
        logging.basicConfig()

But the tests would be in a separate test file.

So the generated code would include the test cases and the implementation.

But the user wants the code generated, so the answer would have the test code first, then the implementation code.

Putting it all together:

First, the test code using unittest:

import logging
import unittest

class TestResetLogging(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_reset_logging(self):
        # Initial configuration
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
        self.assertEqual(logging.getLogger().level, logging.DEBUG)
        
        # Reset logging
        SomeClass._reset_logging()
        
        # Check if reset to default
        self.assertEqual(logging.getLogger().level, logging.WARNING)
        self.assertEqual(len(logging.getLogger().handlers), 1)

But wait, the SomeClass is the class that contains the _reset_logging method. However, in the test, we need to have that class defined.

So the actual code would be:

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def _reset_logging(cls):
        """
        Reset the logging system
        """
        logging.basicConfig()

But the test would need to import SomeClass.

But the user's code may not have the class defined yet. However, the test is written assuming that the class exists.

But in the generated code, the user would have to have both the test and the implementation.

But the user's initial prompt is to generate the code for the _reset_logging function. However, the TDD approach requires writing tests first. Therefore, the generated code should include the tests and then the implementation.

So, the final answer would be:

First, the test code:

```python
import logging
import unittest

class TestResetLogging(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_reset_logging(self):
        # Setup initial logging configuration
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
        self.assertEqual(logging.getLogger().level, logging.DEBUG)
        
        # Call the reset method
        SomeClass._reset_logging()
        
        # Verify that logging is reset to default
        self.assertEqual(logging.getLogger().level, logging.WARNING)
        self.assertEqual(len(logging.getLogger().handlers), 1)
```

Then, the implementation code:

```python
import logging

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def _reset_logging(cls):
        """
        Reset the logging system
        """
        logging.basicConfig()
```

But the user's original function signature is def _reset_logging(cls):, which is a class method. So the implementation uses @classmethod.

But the test code references SomeClass._reset_logging(), which is correct.

However, in the test code, the SomeClass must be defined. So the test code and the implementation code need to be in the same module or properly imported.

But for the purpose of this exercise, the generated code would include both the test and the implementation.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is part of the class, so the code would be the class method and the tests.

So the final answer would be the code blocks for the tests and the implementation.
