Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function directlyProvidedBy(object) that returns the interfaces directly provided by the given object as an IDeclaration. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Zope Interface, objects can provide interfaces directly or through adapters. The function should return the interfaces that the object itself directly provides, not those inherited or adapted.

So, the key is to check the object's own provided interfaces. In Zope Interface, there's a way to get the provided interfaces using the providedBy function. Wait, but the question is about directly provided, not all provided. Hmm.

Wait, the IDeclaration is a declaration of interfaces. Maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly declared on the object. For example, if the object has an __provided__ attribute or something similar.

Wait, in Zope Interface, the providedBy() function returns all interfaces provided by an object, including those from adapters. But how to get only the directly provided ones?

I think that the directly provided interfaces are those that are declared on the class of the object. So maybe we need to check the class's __provided__ attribute. Or perhaps using the zope.interface.declarations directlyProvidedBy method.

Wait, looking up Zope Interface's documentation, there's a function called directlyProvidedBy in the declarations module. Oh right! The function directlyProvidedBy(obj) returns the interfaces directly provided by the object. So the code would be using that function.

So the implementation would be importing directlyProvidedBy from zope.interface.declarations and returning that.

Wait, but the function signature here is def directlyProvidedBy(object):, which is the same name as the function in the module. So maybe the code is just a wrapper around that function.

But the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. The directlyProvidedBy function from zope.interface returns an IInterface, but maybe in the context of the problem, it's considered as IDeclaration. Or perhaps the user wants to return the interfaces directly provided, which would be the result of that function.

So the code would be:

from zope.interface.declarations import directlyProvidedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return directlyProvidedBy(object)

But wait, that's just a wrapper. However, maybe the user expects that the function is implemented without relying on the existing directlyProvidedBy function. But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, so perhaps it's acceptable to use the existing function.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to implement it from scratch. But that's unlikely, since that function is part of Zope Interface.

So the code would be as simple as importing and returning.

But the user might have a different setup. Let me check the docstring again. The returned value is an IDeclaration. Wait, in Zope Interface, IDeclaration is an interface that represents a declaration of interfaces. The directlyProvidedBy function returns an IInterface, but perhaps in this context, it's considered as IDeclaration. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object directly provides, which are declared in the class. So, for example, if the object's class has a __provided__ attribute that's a list of interfaces.

But in Zope Interface, the standard way to get directly provided interfaces is via the directlyProvidedBy function. So I think the correct approach is to use that function.

So the code would be:

import zope.interface.declarations

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return zope.interface.declarations.directlyProvidedBy(object)

But the user might have a different setup, but given the information, this seems correct.

Now, for the test-driven development approach, the user wants unit tests first. Let me think about possible tests.

Test cases could include:

1. An object that provides no interfaces directly. The result should be an empty IDeclaration.

2. An object that provides one interface directly. The result should include that interface.

3. An object that provides multiple interfaces directly. The result should include all of them.

But how to create such objects in tests?

For example, using zope.interface.Interface and classes that implement them.

So, in the test, we can define an interface, create a class that implements it, and check that directlyProvidedBy returns that interface.

But to write the tests, we need to import the necessary modules and set up the interfaces.

So the test code would look something like:

import unittest
from zope.interface import Interface, implementer
from mymodule import directlyProvidedBy  # assuming the function is in mymodule

class IMyInterface(Interface):
    pass

@implementer(IMyInterface)
class MyClass:
    pass

class TestDirectlyProvidedBy(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_interfaces(self):
        obj = object()
        result = directlyProvidedBy(obj)
        self.assertEqual(list(result), [])

    def test_one_interface(self):
        obj = MyClass()
        result = directlyProvidedBy(obj)
        self.assertEqual(list(result), [IMyInterface])

    def test_multiple_interfaces(self):
        class IAnother(Interface):
            pass

        @implementer(IMyInterface, IAnother)
        class AnotherClass:
            pass

        obj = AnotherClass()
        result = directlyProvidedBy(obj)
        self.assertEqual(set(result), {IMyInterface, IAnother})

But the user's code may not have the function in a module, but the code is to be generated. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown format.

But the user's tip says to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the answer should first present the tests, then the implementation.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. However, the user's tip says to use TDD, so perhaps the answer should include both the tests and the code.

But the user's initial instruction says to output ONLY the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the user expects the code for the function, not the tests. But the tip says to generate tests first.

Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. The original problem says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The tip says to follow TDD, first generating tests. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the code includes both the tests and the implementation.

But the original problem's example shows the function signature and docstring, and the user wants the code for that function. However, the tip suggests that the assistant should first generate tests, then the code. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. Maybe the user is expecting the actual implementation code, not the tests. But the tip is just a suggestion for the assistant's process, not part of the output.

In any case, the user's main request is to generate the code for the function directlyProvidedBy based on the given signature and docstring. Given that, the correct code would be importing the directlyProvidedBy function from zope.interface.declarations and returning it.

So the Python code would be:

import zope.interface.declarations

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return zope.interface.declarations.directlyProvidedBy(object)

But perhaps the user expects that the code is written without relying on the existing function, but that seems unlikely. The function's docstring matches the existing zope.interface.declarations.directlyProvidedBy function.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
