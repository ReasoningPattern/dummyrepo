Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the function make_find_paths based on the given signature and docstring. The function takes a sequence of paths and transforms them into glob patterns, but leaves existing patterns untouched. Hmm, what does that mean exactly?

So, the goal is to process each path in the input sequence. If a path is already a glob pattern (like containing wildcards such as * or ?), we leave it as is. Otherwise, we convert it into a glob pattern. Wait, but how? Maybe by adding a wildcard at the end? Like turning 'file' into 'file/*'? Or maybe enclosing it in wildcards? Or perhaps the function is meant to convert regular paths into glob patterns that match exactly that path, which would be the path itself with a trailing slash and asterisk? Or maybe it's about converting paths into patterns that match files in that directory, like adding '/*'?

Wait, the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns". So perhaps the function is intended to take a list of paths and convert them into glob patterns that would match those paths. For example, if the input is 'src/', maybe it becomes 'src/*' to match all files in that directory. But how to determine if a path is already a glob pattern? Because if it contains * or ?, then it's considered a pattern and left as is.

So the steps for each path in find_paths:

1. Check if the path is already a glob pattern (contains * or ?). If yes, leave it.
2. If not, convert it into a glob pattern. How? Maybe by appending '/*' to match files in that directory? Or maybe by adding a trailing '*' to match the entire path as a single file?

Wait, the problem statement isn't very clear on the exact transformation. But given that the function is named make_find_paths, perhaps it's related to the find command in Unix, which uses glob patterns. For example, if you have a path like 'src/', converting it to 'src/*' would find all files in that directory. But if the path is 'src/file.txt', converting it to 'src/file.txt' (no change) would match that exact file. However, if the path is not a glob, maybe we need to turn it into a pattern that matches that exact path. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a directory, so adding '/*' to the end. But how to determine if the path is already a pattern?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to take paths and turn them into glob patterns that would match files in those paths. For example, if the input is 'logs/', then the glob pattern would be 'logs/*', but if the input is 'logs/error.log', then the pattern is 'logs/error.log' (since it's an exact file). However, if the input is 'logs/*.log', then it's already a glob pattern and left as is.

But how to implement this? The key is to check if the path contains any glob characters. So, perhaps the function checks if the path contains * or ? (or other glob characters like [ or ]). If it does, it's considered a pattern and left as is. Otherwise, we need to convert it into a pattern. But how?

Wait, the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So maybe the transformation is to turn a path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a file. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', then the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. But that's the same as the original. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's adding a trailing '*' to make it a pattern that matches any files in that directory? Or perhaps the function is intended to convert a path into a pattern that matches the directory, like adding '/*'?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where paths are converted into glob patterns for searching, and existing patterns (those with wildcards) are left as is. For example, if the input is a list of directories, the function converts them into glob patterns that match files within those directories. So, for a path 'src/', the transformed pattern would be 'src/*', whereas for a path 'src/*.py', it's left as is.

But without more context, I need to make an assumption here. Let's think of a possible way to implement this. Let's assume that any path that doesn't contain a glob character (like * or ?) is converted into a glob pattern that matches that exact path. But how? For example, the path 'file.txt' would become 'file.txt', which is the same. But that doesn't change anything. Alternatively, maybe it's converted into a pattern that matches the entire path, like adding a trailing '*' to match any files in that directory. Wait, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a directory. So, for example, if the path is 'src/', then the glob pattern is 'src/*', which would match all files in the src directory. If the path is 'src/file.txt', then the glob pattern would be 'src/file.txt' (exact match). But how to determine if the path is a directory or a file? That's not possible from the path string alone.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to add a trailing '*' to any path that doesn't already have a glob pattern. For example, 'src' becomes 'src*', but that's not standard glob syntax. Or perhaps adding '/*' to the end. For example, 'src' becomes 'src/*', which would match all files in the src directory.

But how to decide? Well, given that the function's name is make_find_paths, which might be related to the find command, which uses patterns. For example, if you want to find all files in a directory, you'd use 'dir/*'. So maybe the function is intended to convert paths into such patterns.

So the approach would be: for each path in find_paths, check if it contains any glob characters (like *, ?, [ etc.). If not, then append '/*' to it to make it a glob pattern that matches all files in that directory. But wait, if the path is 'file.txt', then appending '/*' would make it 'file.txt/*', which would match directories inside 'file.txt', which doesn't make sense. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that exact path. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', then the glob is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'dir/', then the glob is 'dir/*' to match files in that directory. But how to differentiate between a directory and a file? Again, without knowing the actual filesystem, it's impossible. So perhaps the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a file. So, if the path ends with a slash, maybe it's considered a directory, and we add '/*'? But that's making assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that would match that path as a file. For example, if the path is 'src/', then it's converted to 'src' (but that's not a glob pattern). Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path exactly, but with the addition of a trailing '*' to allow for matching files with that name. Wait, but that's not standard. For example, 'file.txt*' would match files like 'file.txt', 'file.txt1', etc. But that's not the same as matching exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a directory. For example, 'src/' becomes 'src/*', which would match all files in that directory. But then, if the path is 'src/file.txt', then it's considered a file, and the glob is 'src/file.txt' (exact match). But how to determine whether the path is a directory or a file? Again, without knowing the actual filesystem, we can't tell.

This is a problem. The original function's docstring is not very clear on what the transformation is. However, given that the function is called make_find_paths, perhaps it's related to generating glob patterns for the find command. In that case, perhaps the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches all files in that path. For example, if the path is a directory, then it's converted into a pattern that matches all files in that directory. If the path is a file, then it's converted into a pattern that matches that exact file.

But how to determine if the path is a directory or a file? Well, perhaps the function assumes that paths ending with a slash are directories, and others are files. So for example:

- 'src/' → 'src/*' (to match all files in the src directory)
- 'src/file.txt' → 'src/file.txt' (exact match)
- 'src/*.py' → left as is (since it's a glob pattern)

But how to check if a path is already a glob pattern? The function needs to check if the path contains any glob characters. So, for example, if the path has a *, ?, or [ (assuming that's part of the glob syntax), then it's considered a glob pattern and left as is.

So the steps would be:

For each path in find_paths:

1. Check if it contains any glob characters (like *, ?, [ etc.). If yes, leave it as is.
2. If not, then convert it into a glob pattern. How? If the path ends with a slash, append '/*' to it. Otherwise, leave it as is? Or maybe append '*' to the end?

But that's making assumptions. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert each non-pattern path into a pattern that matches that exact path. So, for example, 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt', which is the same. But that doesn't change anything. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a directory. So, for example, 'src' becomes 'src/*', and 'src/' becomes 'src/*' as well. But then, how to handle paths that are not directories?

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to add a trailing '*' to any path that doesn't already contain a glob character. For example:

- 'src' → 'src*'
- 'src/' → 'src/*'
- 'src/file.txt' → 'src/file.txt*'

But this might not be standard glob syntax. For example, 'src*' would match 'src', 'src1', etc., which may not be what is intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that exact path. In that case, the path is left as is. But that would mean that the function does nothing, which contradicts the docstring.

This is a bit of a problem. Without more context, it's challenging to know exactly what the transformation is. However, given that the function returns a tuple of transformed paths, perhaps the transformation is to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a file. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where paths are converted into glob patterns for searching, and the transformation is to add a trailing '*' if it's not already a pattern. For example, 'src' becomes 'src*', which would match 'src' and any files that start with 'src'.

But again, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path exactly. In that case, the function would return the same paths, but that seems unlikely. The docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns", implying that some transformation is done.

Another angle: the function is called make_find_paths. Maybe it's related to the find command's -path option. For example, in find, you can use patterns to match paths. So perhaps the function is converting each path into a glob pattern that would match that exact path. For example, 'src/file.txt' becomes 'src/file.txt', which is already a glob pattern (since it doesn't contain any wildcards). But that doesn't change anything. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that would match that path as a directory. For example, 'src/' becomes 'src/*', which would match all files in the src directory. But how to handle paths that are not directories? Like 'src/file.txt' would become 'src/file.txt/*', which is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a directory, but only if it ends with a slash. For example:

- 'src/' → 'src/*'
- 'src' → 'src' (no change, but that's not a glob pattern)
- 'src/file.txt' → 'src/file.txt' (exact match)

But again, how to determine if it's a directory?

This is really tricky. Given that the problem statement is vague, perhaps the correct approach is to look for common practices or examples. For example, in Python's glob module, a pattern like 'src/*.py' matches all .py files in the src directory. So if the input path is 'src', converting it to 'src/*' would be a common transformation.

So, assuming that the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches all files in that directory, then:

- For each path in find_paths:
   - If it contains any glob characters (like *, ?, [ etc.), leave it as is.
   - Else, append '/*' to it.

But wait, what if the path is 'src/file.txt'? Appending '/*' would make it 'src/file.txt/*', which would match directories inside 'src/file.txt', which is not correct. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that exact path. For example, if the path is 'src', then the glob is 'src', which matches exactly. But that's not a glob pattern. However, in some contexts, a simple path is considered a glob pattern that matches exactly.

In that case, the function would do nothing, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a directory. So, if the path is 'src', then it's converted to 'src/*', and if the path is 'src/', it's also converted to 'src/*'. But then, how to handle paths that are not directories? Well, perhaps that's beyond the scope of this function.

But given that the problem statement says "transform all path into glob patterns", and the function's purpose is to generate these patterns, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that any path that doesn't contain a glob character is converted into a pattern that matches that exact path. But since that's already the case, perhaps the function is intended to add a trailing '*' to make it a glob pattern that matches that exact path. For example, 'src' becomes 'src*', which would match 'src' and any files starting with 'src'.

But again, this is speculative.

Given that the problem is to generate code, perhaps the best approach is to look for existing examples or to make a reasonable assumption.

Let me think of possible test cases. For example:

Test case 1: find_paths is ['src', 'logs/*.log', 'data/']

Expected output: ('src/*', 'logs/*.log', 'data/*')

Assuming that paths without glob characters are converted by appending '/*'.

Test case 2: find_paths is ['*.py', 'src/']

Expected output: ('*.py', 'src/*')

Test case 3: find_paths is ['file.txt']

Expected output: ('file.txt',) — but wait, that's not a glob pattern. Or perhaps it's converted to 'file.txt*'?

But again, this depends on the intended transformation.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path as a file. So, for example, 'src' becomes 'src' (exact match), but that's not a glob pattern. But in glob syntax, a simple string is a glob pattern that matches exactly that string. So, perhaps the function is intended to leave such paths as is, and only modify those that are not glob patterns. Wait, but the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So perhaps the function is intended to ensure that all paths are glob patterns, but if they already are, they are left as is. But how to transform non-pattern paths into glob patterns.

For example, a path like 'src' is not a glob pattern. So, how to transform it into a glob pattern. One possible way is to add a '*' at the end, making it 'src*', which would match 'src' and any files starting with 'src'. But that's a common practice in some glob implementations.

Alternatively, adding '/*' to the end of the path, making it 'src/*' which matches all files in the src directory.

But again, without more context, it's hard to know. However, given that the function returns a tuple of transformed paths, and the name is make_find_paths, perhaps the intended transformation is to convert each path into a glob pattern that would match files in that directory. Hence, appending '/*' to non-pattern paths.

So, the plan is:

For each path in find_paths:

Check if it contains any of the glob characters (like *, ?, [ etc.). If it does, leave it as is. Otherwise, append '/*' to it.

But how to check for glob characters? Let's think: in Python's glob module, the patterns include *, ?, [ and ] (for character ranges). So, perhaps we can check if any of these characters are present in the path.

So, the code would look something like this:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if any(c in path for c in '*?[]'):
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            transformed.append(path + '/*')
    return tuple(transformed)

But wait, this would append '/*' to any path that doesn't contain any of those characters. However, what about paths that end with a slash? For example, 'src/' would become 'src/*/'. But that's probably not desired. Alternatively, perhaps we should check if the path ends with a slash and handle it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check if the path is already a glob pattern. For example, if it contains any of the glob characters, then it's considered a pattern. Otherwise, it's converted by appending '/*'.

But this is a possible approach. Let's proceed with that.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think of some test cases.

Test case 1: paths with existing glob patterns should be passed through.

Input: ['*.py', 'src/*']
Expected output: ('*.py', 'src/*')

Test case 2: paths without glob patterns should have '/*' appended.

Input: ['src', 'data']
Expected output: ('src/*', 'data/*')

Test case 3: path ends with a slash, but no glob characters.

Input: ['src/']
Expected output: 'src/*'

Test case 4: path has a glob character in the middle.

Input: ['src/*.txt']
Expected output: 'src/*.txt'

Test case 5: path has a question mark.

Input: ['file?']
Expected output: 'file?'

Test case 6: path has a bracket.

Input: ['file[0-9].txt']
Expected output: 'file[0-9].txt'

Test case 7: path has no glob characters and ends with a slash.

Input: ['logs/']
Expected output: 'logs/*'

So, with these test cases, the code should be tested.

Now, implementing the code:

The function will loop through each path in find_paths, check if it contains any of the glob characters (*, ?, [, ]). If yes, append as is. Else, append '/*'.

But wait, the check for glob characters is case-sensitive? Probably, but the glob syntax is case-sensitive in most systems.

So, the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if any(c in path for c in '*?[]'):
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            transformed.append(path + '/*')
    return tuple(transformed)

But wait, what about paths that end with a slash? For example, 'src/' would become 'src/*', which is correct. But what if the path is 'src/' and the user wants to match the directory itself? Well, that's a different use case, but according to the current logic, it would be transformed into 'src/*'.

But perhaps this is the intended behavior.

Now, the unit tests.

Using Python's unittest framework, the tests would be:

import unittest

class TestMakeFindPaths(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_existing_patterns_unchanged(self):
        self.assertEqual(make_find_paths(['*.py', 'src/*']), ('*.py', 'src/*'))
    
    def test_non_pattern_paths_get_slash(self):
        self.assertEqual(make_find_paths(['src', 'data']), ('src/*', 'data/*'))
    
    def test_path_with_slash(self):
        self.assertEqual(make_find_paths(['logs/']), ('logs/*',))
    
    def test_path_with_question_mark(self):
        self.assertEqual(make_find_paths(['file?']), ('file?',))
    
    def test_path_with_bracket(self):
        self.assertEqual(make_find_paths(['file[0-9].txt']), ('file[0-9].txt',))
    
    def test_mixed_paths(self):
        self.assertEqual(make_find_paths(['src', 'logs/*.log', 'data/']), ('src/*', 'logs/*.log', 'data/*'))

But wait, the function returns a tuple, so the tests should check for tuples.

But the code as written returns a tuple of the transformed paths.

So, the code seems to handle these cases.

But what about paths that have other characters, like [ or ]? For example, 'file[0-9].txt' is considered a glob pattern and left as is.

Yes.

Now, the code seems to handle that.

But what about a path like 'file*' — it contains a *, so it's left as is.

Yes.

So, this seems to cover the cases.

Thus, the code is written as above.
