Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the function is_none_string, which checks if a string represents the None value. The function should return True if the input is a string and its lowercase is 'none', else False.

First, I should think about the tests. Using test-driven development, I need to write unit tests before the actual code. Let's consider different cases.

Test cases:
1. val is 'None' → should return True.
2. val is 'NONE' → lowercase is 'none', so True.
3. val is 'nOne' → lowercase is 'none', True.
4. val is 'none' → True.
5. val is a string but not 'none' like 'null' → False.
6. val is not a string, like an integer or None → return False.
7. val is an empty string → False.
8. val is a string with leading/trailing spaces, like ' none ' → after stripping, is it 'none'? Wait, the function's docstring says the lowercase of val should be 'none'. So if the string is ' none ', its lowercase is ' none ', which isn't equal to 'none'. So that should return False. Unless the function is supposed to ignore whitespace? But the docstring doesn't mention that. So the function as per the description just checks if the lowercase of the string is exactly 'none'.

So for the tests, the function should check type(val) is str, and then val.lower() == 'none'.

Now, writing the tests using pytest. Let's create a test file, maybe test_is_none_string.py.

But the user wants the code generated, so I need to write the tests first, then the function.

Wait, the user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the answer should be the code, which includes the tests and the function.

So the code would have the tests first, then the function.

But how to structure it. Let me think.

The user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, but following TDD, first generate tests.

So the code would be:

First, the test cases using pytest.

Then, the implementation of the function.

So the code would look like:

import pytest

def test_is_none_string():
    assert is_none_string('None') == True
    assert is_none_string('NONE') == True
    assert is_none_string('nOne') == True
    assert is_none_string('none') == True
    assert is_none_string('null') == False
    assert is_none_string(123) == False
    assert is_none_string(None) == False
    assert is_none_string('') == False
    assert is_none_string(' none ') == False
    assert is_none_string('Nonee') == False

But wait, the function is supposed to check if the type is string. So for example, if val is an integer, it returns False. So the tests for non-strings are covered.

Then, the function:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a string represents a None value.
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of val is string and the lowercase of val is equal to 'none', otherwise return False
    """
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

Wait, but in Python, the 'isinstance' check for str includes subclasses. But the function's docstring says "the type of val is string". Wait, the docstring says "if the type of val is string", but in Python, we usually check with isinstance. However, if the docstring says "type is string", maybe they mean exactly type(str), not subclasses. But that's unusual. However, the function's docstring says "the type of val is string", so perhaps they want to check if type(val) is str, not using isinstance. But that's a bit ambiguous. However, the standard way in Python is to use isinstance for checking types, as it's more flexible. However, the docstring says "type of val is string", which could be interpreted as checking type(val) is str. But that's a bit strict. For example, if someone subclasses str, then isinstance would return True, but type(val) is not str. However, in practice, it's more common to use isinstance. But the docstring says "type of val is string", which might be a mistake, and they actually want to check if it's an instance of str. But given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to use isinstance(val, str). Because if the function is supposed to return True for any string-like object, including subclasses, then isinstance is correct. However, if the docstring is literal, then type(val) is str. But that's a bit strange.

But looking at the example, for instance, if val is 'None', which is a str instance, then type(val) is str. So perhaps the docstring is correct, and the function should check if the type is exactly str. But in Python, the standard way is to use isinstance. However, the docstring says "the type of val is string", which might mean that the function should check if the type is str. But that's not the usual approach. However, perhaps the user intended that. But given that the function's docstring says "the type of val is string", perhaps the code should check type(val) is str. However, that would not consider subclasses. For example, if someone has a subclass of str, then isinstance would return True, but type(val) is not str. But maybe the user wants to check for the exact type. However, in practice, this is not common. But given the docstring, perhaps the code should use type(val) is str. However, that's a bit odd.

But let's think again. The function's docstring says "the type of val is string". So, for example, if val is an instance of a subclass of str, then the type is not str, but the isinstance would be True. So the docstring's wording might be incorrect, but the intended logic is to check if it's a string instance. So perhaps the code should use isinstance(val, str). Because that's the standard way to check if something is a string. For example, in Python, the type of a string is str, and isinstance returns True. So perhaps the docstring's wording is just a bit off, and the actual code should use isinstance.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to follow the docstring's wording. However, the user's function signature says val: any, so it can be any type. So the function should check if the type is exactly str. But that's not the usual way. However, the docstring says "the type of val is string", so perhaps the code should check type(val) is str. But that would not consider subclasses. However, in practice, this is not common. But perhaps the user intended that.

But given that, let's proceed. Let's assume that the function should check if the type is exactly str. So the code would be:

return type(val) is str and val.lower() == 'none'

But in that case, for example, if someone passes a subclass of str, it would return False. But that's probably not intended. However, the docstring says "the type of val is string", which could be interpreted as checking the exact type.

But perhaps the user intended to check if it's an instance of str, not the exact type. Because in Python, checking type(val) is str is not the usual way. So perhaps the docstring is wrong, and the correct code is to use isinstance.

But given that the user provided the docstring, perhaps I should follow it. However, the docstring says "the type of val is string", which is a bit ambiguous. But in Python, the type() function returns the exact class of the instance. So, for example, if you have a subclass of str, type(val) would be the subclass, not str. So, if the function is supposed to return True only for instances of str (not subclasses), then type(val) is str. But that's not common. Usually, you use isinstance.

But given that the user's docstring says "the type of val is string", perhaps the code should check type(val) is str. However, that's a bit strange. But perhaps the user intended that.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant to say "is an instance of a string".

But given that, perhaps the code should use isinstance(val, str). Because that's the standard way to check for string types. Let me think about the test cases. For example, if someone passes a subclass of str, like:

class MyStr(str):
    pass

s = MyStr('None')

Then, isinstance(s, str) is True, but type(s) is MyStr. So, if the function uses isinstance, then it would return True. But if the function uses type(val) is str, it would return False.

But according to the docstring, the function should return True if the type is string. But in this case, the type is not str. However, the user may have intended to check if it's a string instance, regardless of subclassing.

But since the user's docstring says "the type of val is string", perhaps the code should check type(val) is str. However, that's not the standard approach. But perhaps the user intended that.

But given that, perhaps the code should use isinstance(val, str). Because that's the correct way to check if it's a string. For example, in Python, the standard way to check if something is a string is to use isinstance. So, perhaps the docstring's wording is incorrect, and the code should use isinstance.

In that case, the code would be:

return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

Which would handle all string instances, including subclasses.

But given that, let's proceed with that code.

So the function is:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a string represents a None value.
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of val is string and the lowercase of val is equal to 'none', otherwise return False
    """
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

But the docstring says "the type of val is string", which would be checked with type(val) is str, but the code uses isinstance. However, perhaps the user intended to check if it's a string, regardless of subclassing, so using isinstance is correct.

Now, the test cases. Let's think about the test cases again.

For example, if val is 'None', it's a str, so returns True.

If val is an instance of a subclass of str, like MyStr('None'), then isinstance returns True, so the function returns True. But according to the docstring, if the type is string (i.e., type is str), then it would return False. But the docstring may have a mistake here.

But given that, perhaps the user intended to check if it's a string, and the docstring's wording is just a bit off. So the code uses isinstance.

So the test cases would include:

- 'None' → True
- 'NONE' → True
- 'nOne' → True
- 'none' → True
- 'null' → False
- 123 → False
- None → False
- '' → False
- ' none ' → False
- 'Nonee' → False

So the test function would have these assertions.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import pytest

def test_is_none_string():
    assert is_none_string('None') is True
    assert is_none_string('NONE') is True
    assert is_none_string('nOne') is True
    assert is_none_string('none') is True
    assert is_none_string('null') is False
    assert is_none_string(123) is False
    assert is_none_string(None) is False
    assert is_none_string('') is False
    assert is_none_string(' none ') is False
    assert is_none_string('Nonee') is False

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a string represents a None value.
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of val is string and the lowercase of val is equal to 'none', otherwise return False
    """
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

But wait, the user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the answer should be the code, which includes the tests and the function.

But the user's initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD. So the code should include the tests first, then the function.

But the user's example shows that the function is to be written, but the tests are generated first. So the code would be the tests and the function.

But in the code, the tests are written as a function, but in practice, with pytest, the test function would be in a separate file. However, the user may want the code to be self-contained, so the tests are written as a function with assert statements.

But in Python, to run the tests, you would need to use pytest, but for the purpose of this exercise, the code would have the test function and the actual function.

So the final code is as written above.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. For example, in the test cases, the function is called is_none_string, which is defined after the test function. But in Python, that would cause an error because the test function is called before the function is defined. So the code as written would have the test function first, then the function definition. But in Python, that would work because the test function is defined first, but when it's called, the function is already defined. Wait, no. The code as written has the test function and then the function definition. But when the code is run, the test function is defined, but not called. Unless there's a call to it. However, in the code as written, the test function is not called. So the code would not run the tests unless explicitly called.

But the user may not care about that, as they just want the code generated. However, in practice, the tests would need to be run with pytest. But for the purpose of this exercise, the code includes the test function and the actual function.

So the final code would be:

import pytest

def test_is_none_string():
    assert is_none_string('None') is True
    assert is_none_string('NONE') is True
    assert is_none_string('nOne') is True
    assert is_none_string('none') is True
    assert is_none_string('null') is False
    assert is_none_string(123) is False
    assert is_none_string(None) is False
    assert is_none_string('') is False
    assert is_none_string(' none ') is False
    assert is_none_string('Nonee') is False

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a string represents a None value.
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of val is string and the lowercase of val is equal to 'none', otherwise return False
    """
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

But wait, the test function is defined but not called. So when this code is run, the tests are not executed. However, in a real scenario, you would run pytest on the file. But for the purpose of this exercise, the code is written as such.

So the answer is this code in Python markdown format.
