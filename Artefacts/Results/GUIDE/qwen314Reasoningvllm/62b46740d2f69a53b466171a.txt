Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'pretty' and it's a method of some class. The docstring mentions returning a pretty formatted representation of 'self'. The code inside the docstring seems to be a mix of comments and actual code. Let me parse that.

The docstring has a line: obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj). Then it returns a string that starts with indent spaces, followed by the class name, and then some debug_details and obj. But the debug_details part isn't defined in the given code. Hmm, maybe that's part of the code that needs to be implemented.

Wait, the user provided the function signature and the docstring, but the actual code inside the function isn't complete. The docstring's code seems to be a mix of comments and code. Let me check again.

The original code in the docstring is:

"""
Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
"""

Wait, that looks like the docstring is actually containing some code comments. Maybe the user intended that the code inside the docstring is part of the function's implementation. But the way it's written is a bit confusing. Let me think: the docstring starts with a description, then has a line that seems like code. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the docstring.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the function 'pretty' should format the object with indentation and debug details. The code in the docstring is probably the intended implementation but written as part of the docstring by mistake. So the task is to generate the actual code for the 'pretty' method based on that.

So, the function needs to:

1. Check if self.obj is a string. If so, enclose it in single quotes. Otherwise, use repr.
2. Construct a string that starts with indent spaces, then the class name, followed by debug_details and the obj.

But what is debug_details? The original code in the docstring has debug_details in the return statement. That variable isn't defined here. Maybe it's a part of the code that needs to be handled. Perhaps when debug is True, some additional details are added. For example, maybe debug_details is something like f", debug={debug}" or similar.

Wait, looking at the return statement in the docstring: f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})". So the debug_details is a variable that's being concatenated with obj. But in the code provided, debug_details isn't defined. That's probably an error. So maybe the user intended that when debug is True, some debug information is added. For example, maybe debug_details is a string that's generated based on the debug flag.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant to have debug_details as part of the parameters. But without more context, it's a bit unclear. However, the user's task is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code in the docstring is the intended code, but with some syntax issues.

Wait, the original code in the docstring is written as:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But debug_details is not defined. So maybe that's a placeholder. Perhaps the user intended that debug_details is a string that depends on the debug flag. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details could be something like ", debug=True", otherwise an empty string.

So putting this together, the function 'pretty' should generate a string representation of the object with indentation, using the class name, and including debug information if the debug flag is set.

So, the steps to implement:

1. Check if self.obj is a string. If yes, format it with single quotes, else use repr.
2. Determine debug_details based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, add ", debug=True" to the string.
3. Construct the return string with the indent, class name, debug_details, and obj.

But how to handle debug_details? Let's think. The original code in the docstring has debug_details in the return statement. So maybe the code is supposed to have something like:

debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""

Then, the return statement would be:

f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So combining all that, the function would look like:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But wait, the original code in the docstring has the return statement as:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Which suggests that debug_details is a variable that's defined before. So in the code, we need to define debug_details.

So that's probably the correct approach.

Now, considering that the user mentioned to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. However, the user also provided tips to first generate unit tests. But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the user expects the actual implementation code, not the tests.

But the original problem says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The function's docstring seems to have some code comments. However, the user's example code in the docstring may have some syntax issues. So the task is to write the code for the 'pretty' method based on the given docstring.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    """
    Return a pretty formatted representation of self.
    """
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But wait, in the original docstring, the code line is written as part of the docstring. However, the user's function signature and docstring may have had some formatting issues. For example, the original docstring may have had the code as part of the description. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code inside the docstring is the intended code, but with some syntax issues. However, the user's example code in the docstring is written as:

Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Which seems like a mix of text and code. So perhaps the user intended that the code inside the docstring is the actual code for the function. However, the code is not properly formatted. For example, the line starting with 'obj =' is part of the docstring, but it's not a comment. So the user may have made a mistake in formatting the docstring.

In any case, the task is to generate the code for the 'pretty' method. Based on the given information, the code should handle the obj as a string or other type, and include debug details.

Another thing to consider: the function is a method of a class, so 'self' has an 'obj' attribute. So the code assumes that self has an 'obj' attribute.

So the final code would be as I outlined earlier.

Now, considering the user's tip about test-driven development, but the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. Therefore, the answer should be the Python code for the 'pretty' method, in markdown format.
