Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function find_tags based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The goal is to find tags in a text, but ignore those inside code blocks. Also, there's an optional replacer function that can replace the tag words.

First, I need to figure out how to identify tags. Tags are probably words that are enclosed in certain delimiters, like maybe surrounded by non-word characters. But the exact definition isn't specified. Wait, the problem says "tags" but doesn't specify the format. Hmm, maybe it's similar to markdown tags, like words in square brackets? Or maybe it's any word that's a tag, like in HTML? The docstring says "tries to ignore tags inside code blocks," which suggests that code blocks are regions where tags shouldn't be considered. For example, in markdown, code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks.

So the first step is to split the text into regions that are inside code blocks and those that are not. Then, process only the non-code regions for finding tags.

But how to detect code blocks? Let's assume that code blocks are enclosed by triple backticks. So any text between ``` and ``` is a code block. However, there might be multiple code blocks, and the function needs to process the text outside of them.

So the plan is:

1. Split the text into parts that are inside code blocks and those that are not.
2. For the non-code parts, find all the tags.
3. Apply the replacer function to each tag if provided.
4. Return the set of tags and the modified text (with tags replaced if replacer is given).

But how to split the text into code and non-code parts? Maybe using regular expressions. For example, find all occurrences of code blocks and mark the regions. Then, process the text outside of those regions.

Alternatively, we can split the text into segments, some of which are code blocks and others are regular text. Then process the regular text parts.

Another thing to consider: the replacer function. If it's provided, each tag found should be replaced with the result of replacer(tag). So, for example, if the tag is 'python' and replacer returns 'Python', then 'python' is replaced with 'Python' in the text.

Now, the function returns a set of tags and the modified text. The set is of the original tags, not the replaced ones? Or the replaced ones? The docstring says "the original or replaced text". So the set is the original tags, but the text is modified if replacer is used.

Wait, the docstring says: "Returns a set of tags and the original or replaced text." So the set is the original tags found, and the text is the original text with tags replaced if replacer is provided.

So, the steps:

- Identify all tags in the text outside code blocks.
- Collect these tags into a set.
- If replacer is provided, replace each occurrence of the tag in the text with replacer(tag).
- Return the set and the modified text.

But how to find the tags? The problem doesn't specify the exact pattern for tags. Maybe tags are words that are surrounded by non-word characters, or perhaps they are words that are in a certain format. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that tags are words that are in the text, and we need to find all unique words that are considered tags. However, without a clear definition, this is ambiguous.

Wait, maybe the tags are similar to markdown tags, like words in square brackets. For example, [tag], but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe it's any word that is a tag, like in HTML. But without more information, perhaps the function is intended to find all words that are considered tags, perhaps using a regex that matches words, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the tags are any words that are surrounded by whitespace or punctuation. For example, using a regex like \b\w+\b to find words. But this is just a guess. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the function is supposed to find all words that are considered tags, and the exact method is left to the implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are any occurrences of words that are in the text, but not inside code blocks. But again, without a clear definition, this is challenging.

Wait, perhaps the original problem is inspired by some existing code, but since it's not provided, I need to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the following approach:

Assume that tags are any words in the text, and that a word is defined as a sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores, separated by word boundaries. So using regex \b\w+\b to find words. However, this might not be accurate, but given the lack of specific information, it's a starting point.

But then, how to handle code blocks. For example, in code blocks, even if there are words that match the tag pattern, they should be ignored.

So the plan is:

1. Split the text into parts that are inside code blocks and those that are not.
2. For the non-code parts, find all words (using regex) and collect them into a set.
3. For the text, replace each occurrence of these words with the result of the replacer function if provided.
4. Return the set of tags and the modified text.

But how to split the text into code and non-code parts. Let's think about using regular expressions to find code blocks. For example, code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks. The regex pattern could be something like ```.*?``` with the DOTALL flag, but that's not perfect because it might not handle multiline code blocks correctly. Alternatively, using a regex that matches the code blocks and captures the text outside.

Alternatively, process the text in a way that skips over code blocks. For example, iterate through the text, and whenever a code block is encountered, skip processing that part.

But implementing that could be complex. Alternatively, split the text into regions, using a regex that captures code blocks and the non-code parts.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the text is:

This is a sample text. ```code here``` Another part with [tag].

The code block is between ``` and ```. The non-code parts are "This is a sample text. " and " Another part with [tag].".

So, the approach would be to split the text into non-code parts and code parts. Then, process only the non-code parts for finding tags.

So, using a regex to split the text into code and non-code parts. For example, using re.split with a pattern that captures code blocks. But how?

Alternatively, using re.finditer to find all code blocks and then process the text between them.

Another approach is to use a state machine. We can iterate through the text, and when we encounter a code block start (```, we switch to code mode, and when we encounter the end (```), we switch back. Then, during non-code mode, we process the text for tags.

But how to implement that in Python.

Alternatively, split the text into a list of code blocks and non-code blocks. For example, using a regex that matches code blocks and captures the non-code parts. But this might be complex.

Alternatively, using a regex that splits the text into parts, where each part is either a code block or non-code. For example, using re.split with a pattern that matches code blocks, but also captures them. However, this can be tricky.

Alternatively, using re.sub with a callback function. For example, find all code blocks, and for each, replace them with a placeholder, then process the text, then replace the placeholders back. But this approach would require handling the code blocks as separate entities.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the re module to find all the code blocks and then process the text outside of them.

Let me think of code:

import re

def find_tags(text, replacer=None):
    # Split the text into code blocks and non-code parts
    code_blocks = re.findall(r'```.*?```', text, re.DOTALL)
    # But this might not capture all code blocks if they are not properly closed, but assuming well-formed text.
    # Then, split the text into parts between code blocks.
    # However, this approach may not work as the split would leave the code blocks out.
    # Alternative approach: iterate through the text, keeping track of whether we are inside a code block.

    # Let's try using a regex to split the text into non-code parts and code parts.
    # The pattern would be something like (```.*?```)|([^```]*)
    # But this is not perfect. Let's try using a regex that captures code blocks and non-code parts.

    # Using a regex that matches either a code block or non-code text.
    # The regex pattern could be: (```.*?```) | ([^`]+)
    # But this would split the text into code blocks and non-code parts. However, this might not capture all cases, especially if there are backticks in the non-code parts.

    # Alternatively, using a more sophisticated approach. For example, using a regex that finds all code blocks and then processes the text between them.

    # Let's proceed with the following approach:
    # 1. Find all the code blocks in the text.
    # 2. Split the text into segments between code blocks.
    # 3. For each segment, process it for tags.

    # To split the text into non-code parts, we can use re.split with a pattern that captures code blocks.
    # However, re.split does not capture the split parts. So perhaps using re.finditer to find all the code blocks and the non-code parts.

    # Let's use re.finditer to find all matches of code blocks and non-code parts.

    # The pattern would be something like (```.*?```)|([^```]*)
    # But this may not work perfectly. Let me think.

    # Another idea: use a regex that matches either a code block or non-code text. The pattern would be (```.*?```) | ([^`]+)
    # But this would split the text into code blocks and non-code parts, but it's not perfect because the non-code parts may include backticks that are not part of code blocks.

    # However, for the sake of this problem, let's proceed with this approach.

    # So, using re.findall with the pattern (```.*?```) | ([^`]+), re.DOTALL.

    # Wait, but the pattern would capture either a code block or a non-code part. However, the non-code part would be any text that is not a backtick. But this would split the text into parts that are either code blocks or non-code parts (but non-code parts can't contain backticks). That's not correct.

    # This approach is not working. Let me think of another way.

    # Maybe using a regex to find all the positions where code blocks start and end, and then process the text in between.

    # Alternatively, using a state machine approach. Let's try that.

    # Initialize variables:
    # current_text = []
    # in_code_block = False
    # code_blocks = []
    # Then, iterate through the text, and whenever we encounter ``` we toggle in_code_block.

    # But how to split the text into parts. Let's try:

    parts = []
    in_code = False
    current_part = []
    for line in text.splitlines():
        if not in_code:
            if line.startswith('```'):
                # Start of code block
                in_code = True
                # Add the current_part up to this line (without the ``` part)
                # But need to check if the line starts with ``` and capture the rest
                # For example, if the line is '```python', then the code block starts here.
                # So, the current_part is added as is, then the code block starts.
                parts.append(''.join(current_part))
                current_part = []
                in_code = True
            else:
                current_part.append(line)
        else:
            if line.startswith('```'):
                # End of code block
                in_code = False
                # Add the code block to code_blocks
                code_blocks.append(''.join(current_part) + line)
                current_part = []
            else:
                current_part.append(line)
    # After loop, add any remaining current_part
    if not in_code:
        parts.append(''.join(current_part))
    else:
        # If the text ends with a code block, then current_part is part of the code block
        code_blocks.append(''.join(current_part))
    # Now, parts contains the non-code parts, and code_blocks contains the code blocks.

    # Wait, but this approach splits the text line by line, which may not handle multi-line code blocks properly. Also, the code_blocks are stored, but we need to process the non-code parts.

    # However, this approach may not be perfect. For example, if a code block starts in the middle of a line, but assuming that code blocks start at the beginning of a line.

    # Given the time constraints, perhaps this approach is acceptable for the problem.

    # Once we have the non-code parts (parts), we can process each part for tags.

    # Now, for each part in parts, find all tags.

    # How to find tags in each part. Let's assume that tags are words, using regex \b\w+\b.

    # But again, the exact definition is unclear. However, for the purpose of this function, let's proceed with that.

    # So, for each non-code part, find all words and collect them into a set.

    # Then, for the text, replace each occurrence of the tags with the replacer function's result.

    # However, the text may include code blocks. So, we need to reconstruct the text with the non-code parts modified and code blocks left as-is.

    # So, the steps would be:

    # 1. Split the text into non-code parts and code blocks.
    # 2. For each non-code part, find tags and collect them into a set.
    # 3. For each non-code part, replace the tags with the replacer result if provided.
    # 4. Reconstruct the text by combining the modified non-code parts and the code blocks.

    # But how to track which parts are non-code and which are code blocks. The previous approach splits the text into parts (non-code) and code_blocks. However, the original text may have code blocks interspersed with non-code parts. So, during processing, we need to process the non-code parts and leave the code blocks as-is.

    # Let me think of an example. Suppose the original text is:

    # "Hello world ```code``` Goodbye world"

    # Split into parts: ["Hello world ", " Goodbye world"], code_blocks: ["```code```"]

    # Then, process the non-code parts. For each part, find tags. Let's say tags are 'Hello', 'world', 'Goodbye', 'world'.

    # Then, the set would be {'Hello', 'world', 'Goodbye'}.

    # Then, if replacer is provided, replace each occurrence of these tags in the non-code parts.

    # So, the modified non-code parts would be "ReplacedHello Replacedworld " and " ReplacedGoodbye Replacedworld".

    # Then, the reconstructed text would be "ReplacedHello Replacedworld ```code``` ReplacedGoodbye Replacedworld".

    # But how to track the original positions of the non-code parts and code blocks. The previous approach splits the text into parts and code_blocks, but the order may not be preserved correctly.

    # Alternatively, during the splitting process, we can keep track of whether each part is code or not, and then process accordingly.

    # Let me adjust the approach. Instead of splitting into parts and code_blocks, we can split the text into a list of elements, each being either a code block or a non-code string. For example:

    elements = []
    in_code = False
    current = []

    for line in text.splitlines():
        if not in_code:
            if line.startswith('```'):
                # Start of code block
                elements.append(('non-code', ''.join(current)))
                current = []
                in_code = True
            else:
                current.append(line)
        else:
            if line.startswith('```'):
                # End of code block
                elements.append(('code', ''.join(current) + line))
                current = []
                in_code = False
            else:
                current.append(line)
    # After loop, if there's remaining current content
    if current:
        if in_code:
            elements.append(('code', ''.join(current)))
        else:
            elements.append(('non-code', ''.join(current)))

    # Now, elements is a list of tuples, each with a type ('code' or 'non-code') and the content.

    # Then, process each element:

    tags = set()
    modified_elements = []

    for element_type, content in elements:
        if element_type == 'non-code':
            # Find tags in content
            # Using regex to find words
            # Assuming tags are words, using \b\w+\b
            found_tags = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', content)
            tags.update(found_tags)
            # Now, replace the tags in content if replacer is provided
            if replacer:
                # For each tag in found_tags, replace occurrences in content
                # But how to do this without replacing the same word multiple times?
                # For example, if the content is "hello world hello", and replacer is lambda x: x.upper(), then replace each 'hello' with 'HELLO'.
                # However, using a regex substitution with a function.
                # So, we can use re.sub with a function that calls replacer.

                # But we need to make sure that we only replace the tags that were found. However, this approach may replace any occurrence of the word, even if it's part of a larger word. For example, 'hello' in 'hellothere' would be replaced if the regex is \b\w+\b, but that's not correct. Wait, no: \b\w+\b matches whole words. So 'hello' in 'hellothere' would not be matched because it's not a word boundary.

                # So, using re.sub with a regex that matches the tags, and for each match, apply the replacer.

                # However, the problem is that the same word can appear multiple times, and we need to replace each occurrence.

                # So, the approach is to use re.sub with a function that checks if the matched word is in the found_tags set. But that's not efficient, but for the sake of this problem, let's proceed.

                # Alternatively, since found_tags is a set of all tags in this content, we can create a regex pattern that matches any of these tags, and replace them.

                # However, creating a regex pattern that matches any of the tags. For example, if the tags are ['hello', 'world'], then the regex is r'\b(hello|world)\b'.

                # But this can be done with re.sub using a compiled regex.

                # So, create a regex pattern that matches any of the found_tags, and replace them with the result of replacer.

                # However, this requires that we have the list of tags for this content. But since found_tags is a list of all tags in this content, we can generate a regex pattern that matches any of them.

                # However, this approach may not be efficient for large numbers of tags, but for the scope of this problem, it's acceptable.

                # So, generate a regex pattern that matches any of the found_tags, using word boundaries.

                # But if there are no tags, then no replacement is needed.

                if found_tags:
                    # Create a regex pattern that matches any of the tags as whole words.
                    pattern = r'\b(' + '|'.join(re.escape(tag) for tag in found_tags) + r')\b'
                    # Use re.sub with a lambda function that applies replacer to the matched group.
                    # However, since replacer is a function that takes the tag word, we can use a lambda that captures the group.
                    # But in Python, using a lambda inside re.sub may not work as expected. So, perhaps using a function that takes the match object and returns replacer(match.group(1)).

                    def replace_match(match):
                        return replacer(match.group(1))

                    # Apply the substitution
                    modified_content = re.sub(pattern, replace_match, content)
                else:
                    modified_content = content
            else:
                modified_content = content
            modified_elements.append(('non-code', modified_content))
        else:
            # code block, leave as-is
            modified_elements.append(('code', content))

    # Now, reconstruct the text from the modified_elements.

    reconstructed_text = ''
    for element_type, content in modified_elements:
        reconstructed_text += content

    return tags, reconstructed_text

Wait, but there's a problem here. The code that splits the text into elements by line may not handle multi-line code blocks correctly. For example, if a code block starts in the middle of a line, but according to the problem statement, code blocks are likely to start at the beginning of a line. However, this may not be the case. But given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.

Another issue is that the regex for finding tags may not be accurate. For example, if the text has hyphenated words or other characters. But again, without more information, this is a best guess.

Now, considering the function's return value: a set of tags and the modified text. The set is of the original tags found, not the replaced ones. The text is modified if replacer is provided.

Now, the code for the function would be as outlined above.

But also, the function needs to return a Tuple[Set, str]. So, in Python, the import statements would be needed, like from typing import Tuple, Set.

But the user's code may not have the import statements. However, the generated code should include them.

Now, the code needs to be written in Python, with proper syntax.

But there's a problem with the code I outlined. For example, the splitting into elements by line may not capture the entire text correctly. Also, the code that processes the non-code parts may not handle multi-line content properly.

Another possible approach is to split the entire text into non-code and code parts, regardless of line breaks. For example, using a regex that matches code blocks and captures the non-code parts between them.

But how to do that? Let's think of using re.split with a pattern that captures code blocks. For example, using re.split with a pattern that matches code blocks and returns the non-code parts.

But re.split does not capture the split parts. However, using re.findall with a pattern that matches either code blocks or non-code parts.

For example, the pattern could be (```.*?```) | ([^`]+), but this would split the text into code blocks and non-code parts. However, this approach may not be accurate because the non-code parts may contain backticks that are not part of code blocks.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, this is acceptable.

Let me try writing code that uses this approach.

import re
from typing import Tuple, Set

def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set, str]:
    # Split the text into code blocks and non-code parts
    # Using regex to find all matches of either code blocks or non-code parts
    # The pattern is (```.*?```) | ([^`]+)
    # But this may not work perfectly, but let's proceed.
    parts = re.findall(r'```.*?```|[^`]+', text, re.DOTALL)
    # Now, parts contains a list of strings, alternating between code blocks and non-code parts.
    # However, this approach may not correctly separate code blocks and non-code parts, because the regex matches either a code block or non-code parts (which are sequences of non-backtick characters). This would split the text into code blocks and non-code parts, but the non-code parts may include backticks that are not part of code blocks. However, this is a simplification.

    # Now, process each part:
    tags = set()
    modified_parts = []

    for part in parts:
        # Check if the part is a code block (starts with ``` and ends with ```
        if part.startswith('```') and part.endswith('```'):
            # It's a code block, leave as-is
            modified_parts.append(part)
        else:
            # It's a non-code part, process for tags
            # Find all tags (words) in this part
            found_tags = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', part)
            tags.update(found_tags)
            # Apply replacer if provided
            if replacer:
                # Create a regex pattern that matches any of the found tags as whole words
                if found_tags:
                    pattern = r'\b(' + '|'.join(re.escape(tag) for tag in found_tags) + r')\b'
                    # Use re.sub with a function to replace each tag
                    def replace_match(match):
                        return replacer(match.group(1))
                    modified_part = re.sub(pattern, replace_match, part)
                else:
                    modified_part = part
            else:
                modified_part = part
            modified_parts.append(modified_part)

    # Reconstruct the text from modified_parts
    reconstructed_text = ''.join(modified_parts)
    return tags, reconstructed_text

But this approach has several issues. For example, the regex to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts may not work correctly. For example, if there's a backtick in the non-code part, it would be split into a separate part. Also, the code blocks may not be properly identified. For example, if a code block starts with ``` and ends with ``` but there are other backticks in between.

But given the time constraints and the lack of specific information about the tag format, this may be the best approach.

Another problem is that the regex for finding tags uses \b\w+\b, which may not capture all possible tags. However, without more information, this is a reasonable assumption.

Now, considering the unit tests. The user mentioned that the code should be generated with test-driven development, so first write comprehensive unit tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in markdown. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips mention to first generate unit tests. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated, not the tests. So perhaps the user wants the function code, not the tests. But the original problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the tests are not needed here. However, the user may have expected the code to be written with tests first, but the final output is the code.

But given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to write the function code as per the above approach, with the regex-based splitting and processing.

But there's another issue: the regex for splitting may not capture the entire text correctly. For example, if the text starts with a code block, or ends with one. Also, the code block may have backticks inside, but the regex would split them as non-code parts.

But given the time, I'll proceed with the code as written.

Now, the code needs to import re and from typing import Tuple, Set.

So the final code would be:

import re
from typing import Tuple, Set

def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set, str]:
    """
    Find tags in text.

    Tries to ignore tags inside code blocks.

    Optionally, if passed a "replacer", will also replace the tag word with the result
    of the replacer function called with the tag word.

    Returns a set of tags and the original or replaced text.
    """
    parts = re.findall(r'```.*?```|[^`]+', text, re.DOTALL)
    tags = set()
    modified_parts = []

    for part in parts:
        if part.startswith('```') and part.endswith('```'):
            modified_parts.append(part)
        else:
            found_tags = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', part)
            tags.update(found_tags)
            if replacer:
                if found_tags:
                    pattern = r'\b(' + '|'.join(re.escape(tag) for tag in found_tags) + r')\b'
                    def replace_match(match):
                        return replacer(match.group(1))
                    modified_part = re.sub(pattern, replace_match, part)
                else:
                    modified_part = part
            else:
                modified_part = part
            modified_parts.append(modified_part)

    reconstructed_text = ''.join(modified_parts)
    return tags, reconstructed_text

But there's a problem with the replace_match function inside the loop. The function is defined inside the loop, which may cause issues with closures. Also, using a lambda inside the re.sub may not be the best approach. However, in Python, defining a function inside a loop is allowed, but it may have unexpected behavior if the function captures variables from the loop.

Alternatively, using a lambda that captures the replacer function.

Wait, the replace_match function uses the replacer function passed to find_tags. So, inside the loop, for each part, the replace_match function is defined, which uses the replacer function. But since replacer is a parameter of find_tags, it should be accessible.

However, defining a function inside a loop may not be efficient, but for the scope of this problem, it's acceptable.

Another issue is that the regex pattern for replacing may not work correctly if there are overlapping tags or if the same tag appears multiple times. However, the re.sub function should handle that.

Testing this code with some examples:

Example 1:

text = "Hello world ```code``` Goodbye world"
replacer = lambda x: x.upper()

tags, text = find_tags(text, replacer)
Expected tags: {'Hello', 'world', 'Goodbye'}
Expected text: "HELLO WORLD ```code``` GOODBYE WORLD"

But according to the code:

parts = re.findall(r'```.*?```|[^`]+', text, re.DOTALL)
The text is split into ['Hello world ', '```code```', ' Goodbye world'].

Processing each part:

First part: 'Hello world ' → found_tags = ['Hello', 'world'] → tags added. replacer is applied. The pattern is \b(Hello|world)\b → replaced with uppercase. So the modified part is "HELLO WORLD ".

Second part is code block → left as-is.

Third part: ' Goodbye world' → found_tags = ['Goodbye', 'world'] → tags added. replacer applied → " GOODBYE WORLD".

Reconstructed text: "HELLO WORLD ```code``` GOODBYE WORLD".

Which matches the expected result.

Another example: text inside code block should not be processed.

text = "This is a test ```code with tags``` and more text."
replacer = lambda x: x.upper()

tags should be {'This', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'and', 'more', 'text'}.

The code block part is 'code with tags' → not processed. So the tags are from the non-code parts.

Another edge case: text with no code blocks. The code should process all text.

Another edge case: text with multiple code blocks.

But the code may have issues with code blocks that contain backticks, but according to the regex, the code blocks are captured as ```...```, and the rest are non-code parts.

However, the regex for splitting may not work if the code block contains backticks. For example, a code block like ```print('hello')``` would be captured as a code block, and the rest of the text is processed.

Overall, this code should handle the basic cases, but there may be edge cases where it doesn't work perfectly. However, given the information provided, this is a reasonable implementation.
