Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _shuffled that takes a sequence of strings and returns a shuffled list. The docstring mentions using a FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. So first, I should figure out how to set a fixed seed for reproducibility.

Wait, the user mentioned test-driven development. So maybe I should start by writing the tests first. But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the user wants the actual implementation now. But the initial instruction says to follow TDD, so maybe I should first write the tests and then the code. However, the user's main request is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring, not necessarily the tests. But the tips say to do TDD, so maybe I need to include both?

Wait, the user says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the main task is to write the code for the function. However, the tips suggest that I should first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user might expect the code for the function, not the tests. But maybe the user wants both? Let me check the original question again.

The original question says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code they want is the implementation of the _shuffled function. However, the tips mention TDD, so perhaps the user expects that the code includes the tests as well. But the problem says to output only the code generated, which is the function. But maybe the user wants the tests and the function? Hmm, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The tip is just a suggestion, but the user might want the actual code for the function.

So, focusing on the function. The function needs to shuffle a sequence with a fixed random seed. So the approach is to use the random module, set a seed, then shuffle the sequence. But since the seed is fixed, the same sequence will be shuffled the same way every time.

But wait, the function is named _shuffled, which suggests it's a helper function, perhaps with an underscore prefix. So the code would need to import random, set the seed, then shuffle the input sequence.

But the input is a Sequence[str], which could be a list, tuple, etc. The function returns a list of strings.

So the steps are:

1. Import necessary modules: random and maybe typing.Sequence.

Wait, the function signature uses Sequence from typing, so the code should import that.

So the code would start with:

from typing import Sequence
import random

Then, set the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. But where is this seed defined? The docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", but the function doesn't take that as a parameter. So perhaps the seed is a constant defined outside the function. But the function's code would need to use that seed.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". But the function doesn't have a parameter for the seed. That suggests that the seed is a fixed value defined somewhere, perhaps as a module-level constant.

So, the code would have something like:

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # or whatever the fixed seed is

Then, in the function, we set random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED), then shuffle the sequence.

But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the value of the fixed seed. So maybe the code should have a comment indicating that the seed is fixed, but the actual value is to be determined. However, the function's code would need to have that seed set.

But since the user hasn't specified the seed value, perhaps the code should use a placeholder, like 42, or maybe the seed is defined elsewhere. However, the function's code must include the seed setting.

So, putting it all together, the function would be:

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    import random
    random.seed(42)  # Assuming FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is 42
    shuffled_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_list)
    return shuffled_list

Wait, but the seed should be a fixed value. However, the user's docstring says "the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", which suggests that the seed is provided somewhere. But the function doesn't take it as an argument. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the seed is a module-level constant. So the code would have:

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 123  # Example value

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    import random
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    shuffled_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_list)
    return shuffled_list

But the problem is that the user hasn't specified what the fixed seed is. However, the function's code must use a fixed seed. So perhaps the code should have a comment indicating that the seed is fixed, but the actual value is up to the developer. But the user's docstring says "the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", which might imply that the seed is defined elsewhere, perhaps as a constant in the same module.

But since the user hasn't provided that, the code would need to include that constant. However, the function's code is supposed to be generated based on the given signature and docstring. The user hasn't provided the seed value, so perhaps the code uses a placeholder, like 42, and the comment says that it's the fixed seed.

Alternatively, maybe the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a global variable that's set elsewhere. But the function's code would need to reference it.

But given that the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should define it as a constant inside the function, but that's not typical. Alternatively, the code could have a note that the seed is fixed, but the actual value is to be determined.

But in any case, the code needs to shuffle the sequence using a fixed seed. So the code would set the seed, then shuffle.

Now, considering the test-driven approach. If I were to write tests first, I would have tests that check that the same input sequence is shuffled the same way every time. For example, if the input is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then after shuffling with the fixed seed, it should return a specific order, like ['c', 'a', 'b'].

But the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. However, the tips suggest that I should do TDD, but the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should include the function code, and maybe the tests as well. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, which is the function. However, the tips are just suggestions, and the user might want the function code.

So, the code for the function would be as follows:

Import the necessary modules, set the seed, shuffle the sequence.

But the function's code must be in Python, and the imports should be handled properly. Also, the function is supposed to return a list of strings.

Another point: the function is named _shuffled, which is a private function, so perhaps it's intended to be used within a module.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

from typing import Sequence
import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # Example fixed seed value

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    shuffled_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_list)
    return shuffled_list

But the problem is that the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is not defined in the function's parameters. However, the docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", which might imply that the seed is provided by the caller. But in the current code, it's a module-level constant. That might be a discrepancy. However, given the information, this is the best approach.

Alternatively, if the seed is supposed to be passed as a parameter, but the function signature doesn't include it, that would be a problem. But according to the given function signature, the function only takes 'seq' as an argument. Therefore, the seed must be a fixed value defined elsewhere.

Thus, the code as above is correct.
