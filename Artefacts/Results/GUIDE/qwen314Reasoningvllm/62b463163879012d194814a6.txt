Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function files_list_from_zipfile that returns the list of files in a given zip path. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to extract the list of files from a zipfile. So, I should use Python's built-in zipfile module. The steps would be: open the zip file, read the contents, and return the list of file names.

Wait, the function's docstring says it returns the files in the given zip path. So, the function should take a zip_path as input, which is the path to the zip file. Then, using zipfile.ZipFile, I can open it and get the namelist.

But I need to make sure that the zip file exists and is accessible. However, the function's current signature doesn't handle exceptions. But maybe the user expects it to return the list, and if there's an error, it might raise an exception. But the problem statement doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps the code should just proceed under the assumption that the zip file is valid.

So the code would be:

import zipfile

def files_list_from_zipfile(zip_path):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
        return zip_ref.namelist()

Wait, but the 'with' statement will handle closing the zip file. That's good. The namelist() method returns a list of all the files in the zip. That seems right.

But wait, what if the zip file is password protected? Well, the function doesn't handle passwords, so that's beyond the scope here. The user probably expects it to work with standard zip files.

Now, the user mentioned test-driven development. So I should first write tests. But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. But the user's initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips suggest to first generate tests. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. Wait, the original question says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So perhaps the user wants the actual implementation of the function, not the tests. But the tips mention TDD, but maybe that's just a suggestion for the thought process. So the answer should be the code for the function.

But let me double-check. The user provided a function signature and docstring, and wants the code generated. So the code would be the implementation of that function. So the code would be as I outlined before.

But maybe I should include the import statement. The function uses zipfile, so the code should import zipfile.

So the code would be:

import zipfile

def files_list_from_zipfile(zip_path):
    """
    Return the files in the given zip path.
    """
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
        return zip_ref.namelist()

Wait, but what if the zip file is not found? The function would raise a FileNotFoundError, which is correct. The docstring doesn't mention error handling, so the function is expected to propagate errors.

That seems correct. So this should be the code. Let me make sure that namelist() returns the list of files. Yes, according to the zipfile documentation, ZipFile.namelist() returns a list of all the members in the archive.

So that's the correct approach. Therefore, the generated code is as above.
