Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _run_playbook function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it runs Ansible CLI with a vars_dict, and the parameters include cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. The return is ansible results.

First, I should think about how Ansible is typically run in Python. The ansible module might be used here. But since the function is part of an Infrared plugin, maybe there's a specific way they integrate with Ansible. The parameters include an ir_workspace and ir_plugin, which are objects from Infrared. I'm not entirely familiar with Infrared's internals, but perhaps the function needs to use these objects to get necessary paths or configurations.

The cli_args is a list of command line arguments. These might be the playbook name, inventory, etc. The vars_dict is passed as extra-vars. So the function probably constructs an Ansible command with these arguments and variables.

Wait, but how is Ansible being invoked? Using the ansible CLI directly, or via the Python API? If it's via the CLI, then maybe the function is executing a subprocess. But using the Python API would be more integrated. However, the function's name suggests it's running a playbook, which could be done with ansible-playbook.

But the function is called _run_playbook, which might be a helper function. Let me think about possible dependencies. The user might need to import ansible modules, but maybe Infrared has its own way of handling this. Since the parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, maybe those objects have methods to get the playbook path, inventory, etc.

Alternatively, the cli_args could contain the necessary parameters like the playbook name, inventory, etc. So the function might be responsible for parsing those args and passing them to Ansible.

But the challenge is that the actual implementation details aren't provided. Since I need to generate code, I'll have to make some assumptions.

Let me outline steps:

1. Use the cli_args to determine the playbook, inventory, etc. But cli_args is a list of command line arguments. Maybe it's something like ['playbook.yml', '--extra-vars', 'key=value'].

But the vars_dict is already provided as a parameter, so perhaps the cli_args are the other arguments, and the vars_dict is added as extra-vars.

2. The function needs to run Ansible with these arguments and variables. So perhaps using the ansible CLI via subprocess.

But using subprocess would require constructing the command line. For example:

ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory --extra-vars @vars.yml

But how to pass the vars_dict? Maybe by writing the vars_dict to a temporary YAML file and passing the path with --extra-vars.

Alternatively, if using the Ansible Python API, there's a way to pass variables directly. But that would require more setup.

But given that the function is part of Infrared, which is a tool for Ansible, perhaps they have their own way of handling this. However, without knowing the exact implementation, I have to proceed with standard methods.

Assuming that the function needs to run ansible-playbook with the given cli_args and vars_dict, here's a possible approach:

- Parse cli_args to get the playbook name, inventory, etc. But maybe cli_args is already the arguments to pass to ansible-playbook. For example, if cli_args is ['playbook.yml', '-i', 'inventory'], then we can construct the command.

But then, the vars_dict needs to be passed as extra-vars. So the function would need to add --extra-vars to the command line, perhaps by converting the vars_dict into a JSON or YAML file, or by using the @ notation to reference a file.

Alternatively, using the Ansible CLI's ability to take variables via the command line, but that's more complex. For example, --extra-vars "key1=value1 key2=value2".

But if vars_dict is a dictionary, then we can format it into a string like "key1=value1 key2=value2" and pass that as --extra-vars.

But that's only possible if the variables are simple. If there are nested structures, that might not work. However, for the sake of this function, maybe that's acceptable.

So the steps could be:

- Construct the command line by combining cli_args with the --extra-vars option, using the vars_dict.

But how to handle the cli_args? Are they the arguments to pass to ansible-playbook? For example, if cli_args is ['playbook.yml', '-i', 'inventory'], then the command would be 'ansible-playbook' followed by those arguments, plus the --extra-vars.

But then, the function would need to know whether to use ansible or ansible-playbook. The function's name is _run_playbook, which suggests it's running a playbook, so probably ansible-playbook.

Putting this together, the code might look like:

import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Construct the command
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args
    # Add extra vars
    extra_vars_str = ' '.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in vars_dict.items()])
    cmd += ['--extra-vars', extra_vars_str]
    # Execute the command
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Return the result
    return result

But this is a simplistic approach and may have issues. For example, if the vars_dict contains complex data structures, this method won't work. Also, if cli_args already includes --extra-vars, this would add another one. But perhaps the function is designed to handle that.

However, the problem is that the user might expect the code to use Infrared's internal methods. But since the function parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, maybe those objects have methods to get the playbook path, inventory, etc. For example, the ir_workspace might have a method to get the inventory path.

Alternatively, the cli_args could be the arguments passed to the function, which might include the playbook name and other parameters. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Another approach is to use the Ansible Python API. For example, using the ansible.playbook.PlayBook class. But that would require more setup, like creating a PlayBook object, setting the inventory, variables, etc.

But again, without knowing the exact setup, it's challenging. However, the original function's docstring mentions that vars_dict is passed as Ansible extra-vars, which suggests that the variables are to be passed as extra variables, not as part of the playbook's variables.

Given that, perhaps the function is meant to run the Ansible CLI with the given arguments and variables. So using subprocess is a possible approach.

But the problem with the previous code is that if the cli_args already include --extra-vars, this would add another one. Also, the way of converting the vars_dict into a string may not handle all cases.

Another thing to consider is that the vars_dict may be a dictionary that needs to be passed as a JSON file. For example, using --extra-vars @vars.json. But how to generate that file?

In that case, the function would need to create a temporary file, write the vars_dict to it, and then pass the path to --extra-vars. However, that would require handling temporary files, which adds complexity.

But given that the function is part of a larger system (Infrared), maybe there's a helper function to handle this. However, since I don't have that information, I'll proceed with the simplest approach.

So, the code would be:

import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    # Construct the command line
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args
    # Add extra vars as --extra-vars parameter
    extra_vars_str = ' '.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in vars_dict.items()])
    cmd += ['--extra-vars', extra_vars_str]
    # Execute the command
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Return the result (could be more detailed)
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

But this is a basic implementation. However, the problem is that the cli_args may not be the arguments for ansible-playbook. For example, if cli_args is something like ['--tags', 'tag1'], then adding that to the command would be correct. But if the cli_args is meant to be the playbook name and other parameters, then this would work.

Another consideration is that the function may need to use the inventory from the ir_workspace. But how? Maybe the cli_args include the inventory, or the ir_workspace has a method to get it. But without knowing, it's hard to incorporate that.

Alternatively, the ir_workspace might be used to determine the working directory or other settings. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.

The function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, but they are not used in the code above. That's a problem. The current code ignores those parameters. So that's a mistake.

Wait, the parameters are part of the function signature, so they must be used. But how?

Maybe the ir_workspace is used to get the inventory path, or the playbook path. For example, the cli_args might not include the playbook name, and the ir_workspace has a method to get it. But again, without knowing the specifics, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the cli_args could be the arguments passed to the function, which may include the playbook name. For example, if the user runs a command like 'run_playbook playbook.yml -i inventory', then cli_args would be ['playbook.yml', '-i', 'inventory'].

In that case, the code above would work. But the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are not used. That's an issue. The function's parameters are given, so they must be used.

But why are they there? Maybe the function is part of a larger system where the ir_workspace and ir_plugin provide context, such as the inventory path, playbook path, or other settings.

For example, perhaps the ir_workspace has an inventory, and the cli_args may not include the -i parameter. So the function would need to add that.

But without knowing the exact implementation, I can't be sure. However, the presence of these parameters suggests that they are needed for the function to operate correctly.

This is a problem because the initial code I wrote doesn't use them. So I need to adjust.

Perhaps the ir_workspace is used to determine the inventory path. For example, the inventory is stored in the workspace, so the function would add the -i parameter pointing to that inventory.

But how to get that path? Maybe the ir_workspace has an attribute like inventory_path.

Assuming that, the code could be modified as follows:

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Assume ir_workspace has an inventory path
    inventory_path = ir_workspace.inventory_path
    # Add inventory to cli_args if not present
    if '-i' not in cli_args:
        cli_args = ['-i', inventory_path] + cli_args
    # ... rest of the code

But again, this is speculative. However, given that the parameters are present, they must be used somehow.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is a list that includes the playbook name and other parameters, and the ir_workspace is used to set the working directory for the Ansible command.

In that case, the code could be:

import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    # Construct the command line
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args
    # Add extra vars as --extra-vars parameter
    extra_vars_str = ' '.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in vars_dict.items()])
    cmd += ['--extra-vars', extra_vars_str]
    # Set the working directory to the workspace's path
    workspace_path = ir_workspace.path
    # Execute the command
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, cwd=workspace_path, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Return the result
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

This way, the ir_workspace's path is used as the working directory. That makes sense because Ansible often needs to run in the context of the workspace.

But again, this is an assumption. However, given the parameters, this is a plausible use.

Now, regarding the ir_plugin parameter. It's an InfraredPlugin object. Perhaps it's used to get the playbook path or other plugin-specific settings. But without more info, it's hard to say. For now, I'll assume that it's not needed in this simplified version.

Putting it all together, the code would use the ir_workspace's path as the working directory, and the cli_args as the arguments to ansible-playbook, along with the extra-vars.

But the initial code didn't use the ir_workspace, so this adjustment is necessary.

Another thing to consider is error handling. For example, if the cli_args is empty, or if the playbook is not found. But the function's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so maybe it's beyond the scope here.

Now, considering the test-driven approach, the user mentioned that I should first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown format. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention test-driven development. However, the user says to output ONLY the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the tests are not part of the required output here.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the tests are not part of the required output. The tips mention TDD, but the actual code to generate is the function itself, not the tests.

Therefore, focusing back on the function code.

So, the final code would be something like:

import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    # Construct the command line
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook'] + cli_args
    # Add extra vars as --extra-vars parameter
    extra_vars_str = ' '.join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in vars_dict.items()])
    cmd += ['--extra-vars', extra_vars_str]
    # Set the working directory to the workspace's path
    workspace_path = ir_workspace.path
    # Execute the command
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, cwd=workspace_path, capture_output=True, text=True)
    # Return the result
    return {
        'stdout': result.stdout,
        'stderr': result.stderr,
        'returncode': result.returncode
    }

But I need to make sure that the ir_workspace has a 'path' attribute. If not, this would raise an error. However, given that it's an Infrared Workspace object, this is plausible.

Another possible issue is that the cli_args may include the playbook name. For example, if cli_args is ['playbook.yml'], then the command would be ['ansible-playbook', 'playbook.yml'].

This seems reasonable.

But what if the cli_args is empty? Well, that's an error, but the function may not handle it, as per the docstring.

So this is the code I would generate based on the given function signature and docstring, making reasonable assumptions about the parameters.
