Okay, I need to generate Python code for the deprecated decorator function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function deprecated takes a message and returns a decorator. The decorator should be used to mark functions as deprecated, probably issuing a warning when they're called.

So, the decorator should wrap the original function. When someone uses @deprecated("message"), it should add a warning when the function is called. But how to implement that?

I remember that in Python, to create a decorator that takes arguments, you need to return a function that takes the function to decorate. So the structure would be:

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # issue warning here
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the warning should be issued when the deprecated function is called, not when it's defined. So inside the wrapper function, we need to generate a warning. Using the warnings module would be appropriate here.

So, in the wrapper, before calling the original function, we can issue a Warning. Maybe using warnings.warn with the message provided.

But the message might need to include the function name. The user's message could be a general message, but perhaps the decorator should include the function's name in the warning. For example, if the message is "use new_func instead", the warning would say "Deprecated: use new_func instead. Call to deprecated function old_func."

Wait, the original message might not include the function name. So maybe the decorator should prepend the function name to the message. Let me check the standard approach.

In Python's own deprecated decorator (like in the functools module?), I think they do something similar. But since the user hasn't specified that, perhaps the message is just passed as-is. However, to make it more useful, maybe the decorator should include the function name in the warning message.

But the docstring says the message is provided by the user. So maybe the message is intended to be the full message, and the decorator doesn't add anything else. However, that might not be very helpful. For example, if the user writes @deprecated("use new function"), the warning would just say "use new function", but it's better to include the function name.

Hmm, but the user's function signature only takes a message. So perhaps the message is supposed to be the full message, including the function name. Or maybe the decorator should format it. But the user hasn't specified that. Maybe the original code expects the message to be the reason, and the decorator adds the function name.

Wait, looking at the problem again. The user's function is supposed to return a decorator that can be used to deprecate functions. The message is passed to the decorator. So when the function is called, a warning is issued with that message.

But perhaps the standard way is to have the message include the function name. For example, in the Python standard library, the deprecated decorator from warnings might do that. However, since the user hasn't specified that, maybe the message is just passed as is.

But maybe the user expects that the message is the reason, and the decorator adds the function name. For example, if the message is "use new_func instead", the warning would say "Deprecated: use new_func instead. Call to deprecated function old_func."

But how to implement that? The message is passed to the deprecated function, so perhaps the decorator should prepend something to it.

Alternatively, maybe the message is intended to be the full warning message. So the user would pass in the entire message they want, including the function name.

But without more information, perhaps the correct approach is to generate a warning with the given message when the decorated function is called.

So the code would be:

import warnings

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(f"Deprecated: {message}", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the stacklevel=2 is important here. Because the warning is generated inside the wrapper, which is inside the decorator. So the stack level would point to the decorator's call, but we want the warning to point to the function call site. Setting stacklevel=2 would adjust that.

But maybe that's an implementation detail. However, including it would make the warning more accurate.

But the original problem didn't mention anything about stack levels, so maybe it's optional. However, including it would be better practice.

So, putting it all together, the code would import warnings, and in the wrapper, issue a warning with the message provided, then call the original function.

Now, the user also mentioned that the code should be generated with test-driven development, first writing unit tests. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in markdown. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips mention TDD. But the user's problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not to write tests first. Wait, the user's instruction says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the user might want the actual code, not the tests. But the initial problem says to generate the code, not the tests. However, the user's example shows that the function is to return a decorator for deprecating functions.

So, the code would be as I outlined above.

Wait, but the user's function is called 'deprecated' and returns a decorator. So the code would be:

import warnings

def deprecated(message):
    """
    Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(f"Deprecated: {message}", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But maybe the message should not have "Deprecated: " prepended, but that's up to the user. However, the user's message might want to include that. Alternatively, maybe the message is just the reason, and the decorator adds the "Deprecated: " part.

But the original docstring says that the message is provided. For example, if the user writes @deprecated("use new function"), then the warning would be "Deprecated: use new function".

Alternatively, maybe the message is intended to be the full message. But the code as written would prepend "Deprecated: " to the message. However, perhaps the user expects that the message is the full message, and the decorator doesn't add anything. So maybe the code should just use the message as is.

But that would mean that if the user writes @deprecated("use new function"), the warning would be "use new function", which might not be as clear. So perhaps the code should prepend "Deprecated: " to the message.

But the original problem's docstring says that the function returns a decorator for deprecating functions and methods. So the message is probably intended to be the reason for deprecation. Therefore, adding "Deprecated: " to the message would make the warning more informative.

But the user's code example may vary. However, given that the function is named 'deprecated', and the message is passed, perhaps the code should generate a warning with the message provided. However, in practice, the standard way is to have the message include the function name. But since the user hasn't specified that, maybe the code should just use the message as is.

Wait, looking at the Python standard library's approach. For example, the deprecated decorator in Python's own code (like in the six library or elsewhere) may format the message. However, since the user hasn't provided examples, perhaps the code should just issue the message as given.

But in that case, the code would be:

import warnings

def deprecated(message):
    """
    Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(message, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But then, if the user uses @deprecated("use new function"), the warning would be "use new function", which is okay. However, perhaps the user expects that the function name is included. But without that information, perhaps the code should just use the message as provided.

But the original problem's docstring says that the message is provided. So the code should use it as is. Therefore, the code would be as above.

But then, perhaps the user wants the message to be formatted with the function name. However, without that being specified in the docstring, it's better to stick to the given parameters.

So the code would be as follows, importing warnings and using the message as given.

But then, the user's function is supposed to return a decorator. So the code is correct.

Now, considering the test-driven approach, but the user hasn't asked for tests. The user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is as above.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. For example, when a function is decorated with @deprecated("message"), calling it should trigger a warning.

So the code seems correct. Therefore, the generated code is:

import warnings

def deprecated(message):
    """
    Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(message, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the stacklevel=2 is important to point to the correct line where the decorator is used. For example, if the user decorates a function with @deprecated(...), then the warning should point to the function definition line, not the wrapper. Setting stacklevel=2 would adjust that. However, if the user doesn't set it, the warning would point to the wrapper's code, which is inside the decorator. So including stacklevel=2 is better practice.

But perhaps the user's code doesn't include that. However, including it would make the warning more accurate. Therefore, the code includes stacklevel=2.

But in Python, the stacklevel parameter in warnings.warn is used to indicate how many stack frames to go up. The default is 1. So when you call warnings.warn inside the wrapper, the stack level is 1 (the wrapper's call). To get the stack level of the function that was decorated, you need to set stacklevel=2. Because the stack is:

1. The wrapper function (inside decorator)
2. The decorated function's call site.

So setting stacklevel=2 would make the warning point to the call site of the decorated function.

Therefore, including stacklevel=2 is correct.

So the final code includes that.

Thus, the generated code is as above.
