Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _parse_image_ref function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The function takes an image_href string and returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). It also mentions importing urllib, which probably means using urllib.parse to parse URLs.

First, I should figure out how to parse the href. The href could be a URL, so splitting it into components like netloc (the domain) and path. The image_id might be part of the path. Also, determining if SSL is used (i.e., if the URL starts with https).

Wait, the function returns a tuple with image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. So, for example, if the href is "https://example.com/images/12345.jpg", then image_id would be "12345", netloc is "example.com", and use_ssl is True.

But how to extract the image_id? Maybe the path is split by '/', and the last part before the extension is the image_id. But that might not be reliable. Alternatively, maybe the image_id is the part after the domain. But the problem is that the href could vary. The docstring doesn't give examples, so I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the image_href is structured in a way that the image_id is the last part of the path. For example, if the URL is "/images/12345.jpg", then image_id is "12345". But if the URL is "http://example.com/images/12345.jpg", then the netloc is "example.com", and image_id is "12345".

So, using urllib.parse.urlparse to break down the URL. Let's think about that. The urlparse function returns a ParseResult object with scheme, netloc, path, etc.

So steps:

1. Parse the image_href using urlparse.
2. Check the scheme to determine use_ssl (if scheme is 'https', then True, else False).
3. Extract the netloc (the domain part).
4. Extract the path, then split it into parts. Assuming that the image_id is the last part of the path before the extension. But how to handle different path structures?

Wait, maybe the image_href is something like "http://example.com/images/12345" where 12345 is the image ID. So the path is "/images/12345", and the image_id is "12345".

But what if the path has more parts? Like "/images/2023/12345.jpg"? Then the image_id might be "12345". But how to determine that? Maybe the image_id is the last part of the path, regardless of the extension.

So, split the path into parts, take the last part, then remove any file extension. For example, "12345.jpg" becomes "12345".

But how to handle cases where there's no extension? Like "12345".

So, perhaps using os.path.splitext to split the filename part. But first, get the last part of the path.

Let me outline the steps:

Parse the URL into parts.

- scheme: http or https
- netloc: example.com
- path: /images/12345.jpg

Then, split the path into parts. For example, path.split('/') gives ['', 'images', '12345.jpg']. The last element is '12345.jpg'. Then, split that into name and extension. The name is '12345', extension is '.jpg'.

So image_id would be '12345'.

But what if the path is something like '/images/12345'? Then the last part is '12345', which would be the image_id.

So code steps:

parsed = urlparse(image_href)

scheme = parsed.scheme
netloc = parsed.netloc
path = parsed.path

if not path:
    raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no path")

path_parts = path.strip('/').split('/')
filename = path_parts[-1]
image_id, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
image_id = image_id

But wait, what if the path is empty? Like if the href is "http://example.com"? Then path is '/', which when stripped becomes empty. So split into ['', '']? Hmm, that's a problem. So need to handle that case.

But the function's docstring says it raises ValueError, so perhaps in cases where the path doesn't contain an image ID, it raises an error.

But the problem is, how to determine what's the image_id. The function's purpose is to parse the href into image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. So maybe the image_href is expected to have a path that ends with the image ID, possibly with an extension.

So, assuming that the image_href is a URL pointing to an image, and the image_id is the last part of the path, without the extension.

But how to handle cases where the path is not properly structured? For example, if the href is "http://example.com", then there's no image_id. So in that case, the function should raise ValueError.

So, in code:

import urllib.parse
import os

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.scheme:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no scheme")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no netloc")
    if not parsed.path:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no path")
    
    path_parts = parsed.path.strip('/').split('/')
    if not path_parts:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: empty path")
    
    filename = path_parts[-1]
    image_id, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    if not image_id:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no image ID in path")
    
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but what if the path is '/images/12345'? Then path_parts is ['images', '12345'], filename is '12345', image_id is '12345', ext is ''. So that's okay.

But what if the path is '/images/12345.jpg'? Then image_id is '12345', ext is '.jpg'.

But what if the filename is something like 'image_12345.png'? Then image_id would be 'image_12345', which may not be desired. But the function's responsibility is to parse based on the structure, and perhaps the image_id is expected to be the last part of the path, regardless of the filename. So maybe that's the intended behavior.

But the problem is that the function's docstring doesn't specify how to extract the image_id. So perhaps the test cases will help. But since the user wants me to generate code, I need to make assumptions.

Another thing: the function is named _parse_image_ref, which suggests it's an internal helper. So perhaps it's part of a larger system where the image_href is expected to have a certain structure.

But given the information, I think the approach of splitting the path into parts, taking the last part as the filename, then splitting into image_id and extension is reasonable.

Now, considering the ValueError cases. The function should raise ValueError if the href is invalid. For example, if the URL is missing scheme, netloc, or path.

Now, the code I wrote checks for parsed.scheme, parsed.netloc, parsed.path. If any of them is missing, it raises ValueError.

But what about if the parsed.path is '/', which after stripping becomes empty? For example, if the href is 'http://example.com/', then parsed.path is '/', which after stripping is empty. Then path_parts is [''], which is not empty. Then filename is '', which would cause image_id to be empty, leading to a ValueError.

So in that case, the code raises ValueError.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Now, the function returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). The netloc is parsed.netloc, which for 'http://example.com' is 'example.com', which is correct.

Now, for the use_ssl, it's True if the scheme is 'https'.

Now, the code uses os.path.splitext, which splits on the last occurrence of a dot. So for 'image.12345.jpg', it would split into 'image.12345' and '.jpg', which may not be desired, but again, the function's logic is based on the last part of the path.

But perhaps the image_id is supposed to be the entire filename without extension, regardless of dots. So that's acceptable.

Now, the code needs to import Tuple from typing, and also import urllib.parse and os.

But the original code in the docstring says 'import urllib' but that's not correct. The correct import is urllib.parse.

So, the code should have:

from typing import Tuple
import urllib.parse
import os

But the user's initial code didn't have these imports. However, the function's code will need them.

Now, the user's initial code has the function signature, but the code generated must include the necessary imports.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code should include the imports.

Now, the user's example code in the docstring has 'import urllib.' which is probably a typo, but the correct import is urllib.parse.

Now, the code for the function would be as above.

But the user wants the code in Python markdown format, so the answer should be in triple backticks.

But the user also mentioned that they want the code generated, following test-driven development. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, not the tests. Wait, the initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. However, the tips mention that the assistant should follow TDD, generating tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the tests are not needed here, just the function code.

But the user's example shows the function signature and docstring, and the assistant is to generate the code for that function.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

from typing import Tuple
import urllib.parse
import os

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    """
    Parse an image href into composite parts import urllib.

    :param image_href: href of an image
    :returns: a tuple of the form (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)
    :raises ValueError:
    """
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed.scheme:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no scheme")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no netloc")
    if not parsed.path:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no path")
    
    path_parts = parsed.path.strip('/').split('/')
    if not path_parts:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: empty path")
    
    filename = path_parts[-1]
    image_id, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    if not image_id:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href: no image ID in path")
    
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the docstring says 'import urllib.' which is probably a mistake. The code above doesn't have that line. The original docstring may have had a typo, but the code doesn't need that line.

So, this code should handle the parsing as per the assumptions made. However, there might be edge cases where this code fails. For example, if the path has multiple slashes and the last part is not the image ID. But given the information, this is the best approach.
