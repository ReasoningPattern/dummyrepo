Okay, I need to generate Python code for the replace_dots function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function should do. The docstring says it replaces all '.' in the input string 'value' with the 'arg' string. So, for example, if value is "a.b.c" and arg is "x", the result should be "a xb x c".

First, I should consider how to replace all occurrences of '.'. In Python, the string method replace can do this. So value.replace('.', arg) would replace every '.' with arg. But wait, what if the input is not a string? The function's parameters are listed as 'value' and 'arg', but the docstring says they are strings. However, the function might need to handle cases where value is not a string. But according to the docstring, the function is supposed to take a string as input. So maybe we can assume that 'value' is a string. But perhaps the function should handle cases where it's not, but the docstring doesn't mention that. Hmm.

The problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says 'value' is the old string, so I can assume that 'value' is a string. Therefore, the implementation is straightforward: return value.replace('.', arg).

But wait, what about if arg is a string that contains '.'? Like, if someone passes arg as "..", then each '.' in value would be replaced by "..", which would result in two dots where each original dot was. But that's the intended behavior according to the function's description. The function is supposed to replace each '.' with the arg string, regardless of what arg contains.

So the code is simple: return value.replace('.', arg). But I need to write the function. Let me check the parameters again. The function is called replace_dots, takes value and arg. So the code would be:

def replace_dots(value, arg):
    """
    Replaces all values of '.' to arg from the given string
    Args:
        value: old string
        arg: new string to replace '.'
    Returns:
        str, the replaced string
    """
    return value.replace('.', arg)

But wait, what if value is not a string? Like, if someone passes an integer. Then the replace method would throw an error. But according to the docstring, value is a string, so perhaps the function is intended to be used with strings. So the code is correct as is.

Now, the user mentioned that they want test-driven development, so I should generate unit tests first. But the question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code, but the tips mention TDD, generating tests first. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. But maybe the user wants both? Let me check the original question again.

The user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." The tips suggest to first generate tests, but the actual code to output is the function itself. So perhaps the answer is just the function code. However, maybe the user wants the tests as well? But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function code is the main part here.

Wait, looking back, the user provided the function signature and docstring, and wants the code generated. So the answer is the function code. The tips are just suggestions for the developer, but the user wants the code. Therefore, the correct code is the function that uses the replace method.

So the code is as I wrote before. Let me write that in Python markdown format.
