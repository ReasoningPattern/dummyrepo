Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function os_is_mac() that checks if the operating system is macOS. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, the os module has a function called name which returns the operating system's name. For macOS, it should return 'posix' because macOS is based on Unix. Wait, but maybe there's a more specific way. Alternatively, the platform module might have more detailed information.

Wait, the os.name gives 'posix' for Unix-like systems, including macOS and Linux. So that's not specific enough. Maybe I should use the platform.system() function. Let me check: platform.system() returns 'Darwin' for macOS. Oh right! Because macOS is based on Darwin. So checking if platform.system() equals 'Darwin' would accurately identify macOS.

So the function should use the platform module. But I need to make sure to import platform. So the code would be:

import platform

def os_is_mac():
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

But wait, what about case sensitivity? Like, could it be 'darwin'? Probably not, because the documentation says that platform.system() returns the system name, and for macOS it's 'Darwin'. So comparing to 'Darwin' with a capital D is correct.

Now, the user mentioned to follow test-driven development. So first, I should write unit tests. Let me think about possible test cases.

The tests should check that the function returns True when the system is macOS, and False otherwise. But since I can't actually run the code on different OSes, maybe I can mock the platform.system() function.

But for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps the user expects the tests to be written using the unittest framework. Let me outline the test cases:

Test case 1: When platform.system() returns 'Darwin', the function returns True.
Test case 2: When platform.system() returns 'Linux', the function returns False.
Test case 3: When platform.system() returns 'Windows', the function returns False.
Test case 4: When platform.system() returns 'posix' (like on Linux), but that's not macOS, so returns False.

But how to test this? Using mocks. So in the test, I can mock the platform.system() function to return different values and check the output.

So the test code would be using the unittest module and the mock library. For example:

import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mymodule import os_is_mac

class TestOsIsMac(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_true(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Darwin'
        self.assertTrue(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false_linux(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Linux'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false_windows(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Windows'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false_posix(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'posix'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

Then, the actual function would be as I mentioned before.

Wait, but the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the function and the tests. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Also, the tips mention to first generate the tests, then the code.

So putting it all together, the answer should have the tests first, then the function.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check again: the function uses platform.system() == 'Darwin'. That's correct.

Another thing: the function is supposed to return a bool. The code does that.

So the final code would be the tests and the function. But the user might expect the code to be in a specific structure. Let me write the code accordingly.

Also, note that the tests need to import the function. So assuming that the function is in a module, but for the sake of the test, perhaps the code is in the same file. However, in practice, the tests would be in a separate file. But for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps the code is written as a module with the function and the tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is just the function, but the tips say to do test-driven development, so the answer should include both the tests and the code.

So the final answer would be:

First, the unit tests using unittest and mock, then the actual function implementation.

But I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted in Python markdown. Also, the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the answer should be the code blocks.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

The tests first, then the function.

Wait, but the user's example shows the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the function with the docstring, and the tests.

So the answer would be:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

import platform

def os_is_mac():
    """
    Checks if the os is macOS

    :return: bool, True is macOS, otherwise False.
    """
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

class TestOsIsMac(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_true(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Darwin'
        self.assertTrue(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false_linux(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Linux'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false_windows(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Windows'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false_posix(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'posix'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Wait, but in the code above, the function is defined before the tests. Also, the tests are in the same module. However, when running the tests, the code would need to be structured properly. But for the purpose of this exercise, this should be acceptable.

But the user's original function didn't have the import statements. So I need to include the necessary imports. The function uses the platform module, so importing that is necessary.

So the code is correct. The tests mock the platform.system function and check the return values. The function itself checks if the system is Darwin.

Yes, this should work. Now, I need to present this as the code in Python markdown format, with triple backticks.
