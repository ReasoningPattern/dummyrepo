Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function merge_extra_vars based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it extends vars_dict with extra_vars. The parameters are vars_dict, which is a dictionary, and extra_vars, which is a list of extra variables.

Wait, the function's purpose is to merge the extra variables into the vars_dict. But how exactly? Since extra_vars is a list, maybe each element in the list is a key-value pair that needs to be added to vars_dict. But the problem is, how are these elements structured? Like, if extra_vars is a list of tuples, or maybe a list of strings where each string is a key, and maybe the value is something default? Or perhaps the extra_vars are keys that should be added with some default value?

Hmm, the docstring isn't very specific. But looking at the parameters, the function is supposed to extend vars_dict with extra_vars. Maybe the extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs. For example, if extra_vars is [('a', 1), ('b', 2)], then merging would add those key-value pairs into vars_dict. But if the keys already exist in vars_dict, maybe they should be overwritten? Or maybe the function is supposed to add new keys and leave existing ones as is?

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a list of keys, and the values are taken from somewhere else. But the function's parameters don't mention where the values come from. That seems unclear. Wait, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where extra_vars are variables that need to be added to the dictionary, perhaps with default values or from some context. But without more context, I have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict, where extra_vars is a dictionary. But the parameter says it's a list. Oh, the parameter says extra_vars is a list of extra-vars. Maybe each element in the list is a variable name (string), and the function adds them to vars_dict with some default value, like None? Or maybe the function is supposed to take the list and add each element as a key with a value, perhaps from another source?

Wait, perhaps the original intention is that extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, and the function adds them to vars_dict. For example, if vars_dict is {'x': 1} and extra_vars is [('y', 2), ('z', 3)], then after merging, vars_dict becomes {'x':1, 'y':2, 'z':3}.

But the function's parameters don't specify the structure of the elements in extra_vars. So maybe the function expects that each element in extra_vars is a tuple of (key, value), and the function updates vars_dict with those key-value pairs. However, since the function is supposed to extend vars_dict, maybe it's supposed to add new keys and not overwrite existing ones? Or overwrite?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict as a list. For example, if vars_dict has a key 'vars' which is a list, and extra_vars is a list to be appended to that. But that's just a guess.

But given the lack of specific information, perhaps the safest approach is to assume that extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs (tuples), and the function merges them into vars_dict by updating it. However, since the function is supposed to extend, maybe it's adding new keys and not overwriting existing ones. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to take the list of variables (as strings) and add them to the vars_dict with some default value, like None. For example, if extra_vars is ['a', 'b'], then add 'a': None and 'b': None to vars_dict. But again, this is speculative.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to look for similar functions or common practices. For example, in some templating systems, variables are merged into a context. If extra_vars is a list of variables to be added, perhaps each variable is a key, and the value is taken from some context, but again, without more info, this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict as a list. For example, if vars_dict has a key 'extra' which is a list, and extra_vars is another list to be merged into that. But again, this is just a guess.

Wait, the function's name is merge_extra_vars, which suggests that it's merging extra variables into the existing vars_dict. The parameters are vars_dict (the main dictionary) and extra_vars (the list of extra variables). So perhaps the extra_vars is a list of variables (as strings) that need to be added to the vars_dict. But how?

Maybe the function is part of a system where variables are stored in a dictionary, and extra_vars is a list of variable names that need to be added with some default value. For example, if the extra_vars is ['var1', 'var2'], then the function adds 'var1': None and 'var2': None to vars_dict. But again, this is a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the list of extra_vars and merge them into vars_dict as a list. For example, if vars_dict has a key 'vars' which is a list, and the function appends the extra_vars to that list. But again, this is speculative.

Since the original function's docstring is minimal, perhaps the best approach is to make an assumption and proceed. Let's assume that extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs (tuples), and the function merges them into vars_dict, overwriting existing keys. That's a common approach in merging dictionaries. For example:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for key, value in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

Wait, but the function's docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which might imply adding new keys rather than overwriting. However, without more info, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict as a list. For example, if vars_dict has a key 'extra' which is a list, and the function appends the extra_vars to that list. But again, this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the list of extra variables and add them as keys in vars_dict with their own values. But how? If extra_vars is a list of strings, perhaps each string is a key, and the value is something else. But without knowing where the values come from, this is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the original function is part of a larger codebase where extra_vars is a list of variables that need to be added to the vars_dict, and their values are determined elsewhere. For example, in a templating engine, variables might be passed in, and extra_vars could be additional variables to include. However, without knowing the context, this is hard to determine.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that extra_vars is a list of (key, value) tuples, and the function merges them into vars_dict, overwriting existing keys. This is a common scenario. Also, the function's parameters indicate that extra_vars is a list, so perhaps each element is a key-value pair.

So, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for key, value in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

Wait, but the original function's docstring doesn't mention returning anything. The original function signature doesn't have a return statement. Wait, looking back, the user provided the function signature as:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """

So, the function's purpose is to extend vars_dict. However, in Python, dictionaries are mutable, so modifying vars_dict in-place would affect the original object. But the function may or may not return it. However, the code I wrote returns vars_dict, which is redundant since the original is modified. But perhaps the function is intended to return the modified vars_dict.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to create a new dictionary. But the docstring says "extend vars_dict", which implies modifying in-place. However, in Python, if you pass a dictionary to a function and modify it, the changes are reflected outside the function. So, the function may not need to return it. However, the code I wrote returns it, which is acceptable.

But the original function's code is not provided, so I have to make an assumption. Let's proceed with the code that modifies vars_dict in-place and returns it.

But wait, the function's name is merge_extra_vars. If the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict, then the code I wrote would do that. However, if the extra_vars is a list of keys, and the values are to be taken from somewhere else, like the current scope, that's different. But again, without more info, it's impossible to know.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the list of variables (as strings) and add them to the vars_dict with some default value. For example, if extra_vars is ['a', 'b'], then add 'a': None and 'b': None. But again, this is a guess.

But given the lack of information, the most logical assumption is that extra_vars is a list of (key, value) pairs. Hence, the code I wrote earlier.

Now, considering the test-driven approach, the user mentioned that I should generate comprehensive unit tests first. So, perhaps I should first write the tests, then the code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown. However, the tips suggest to follow test-driven development, generating tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. However, the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown.

Wait, the user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the tip says to follow test-driven development, first generating tests. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. Therefore, perhaps the tip is just a suggestion for the thought process, but the actual output is the code.

So, proceeding with writing the code for the function.

But given the ambiguity in the parameters, perhaps I should make the function merge the extra_vars into vars_dict, assuming that extra_vars is a list of (key, value) pairs. So, the code would be as I wrote before.

Another possibility: maybe the function is supposed to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict as a list. For example, if vars_dict has a key 'extra_vars' which is a list, and the function appends the elements of extra_vars to that list. But again, without knowing, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the list of extra variables and add them as keys in vars_dict with their own values. But how? Maybe the extra_vars is a list of strings, and each string is a key, and the value is taken from some other source, like the function's parameters. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a system where vars_dict is a dictionary of variables, and extra_vars is a list of variable names that need to be added, and their values are determined by some other means. But again, without more info, this is impossible to know.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that extra_vars is a list of (key, value) tuples, and the function merges them into vars_dict. So, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for key, value in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

But I should also consider that the function may not return anything. However, since the function is modifying vars_dict in-place, returning it might be redundant. However, it's common to return the modified dictionary for convenience.

Another consideration: what if extra_vars is not a list of tuples? For example, if it's a list of strings. Then the code would throw a TypeError. But the function's docstring says extra_vars is a list of extra-vars, which could be ambiguous. However, without more info, I have to proceed with the assumption that each element is a key-value pair.

Another possibility: maybe the function is supposed to merge another dictionary into vars_dict. But the parameter is called extra_vars, not extra_dict. So that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the list of variable names and add them to vars_dict with some default value. For example, if extra_vars is ['a', 'b'], then add 'a': None and 'b': None. In that case, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[var] = None
    return vars_dict

But again, this is a guess. However, the function's name is merge_extra_vars, which might imply adding variables, not key-value pairs.

But without knowing the context, it's impossible to be certain. However, given the function's parameters, the most logical assumption is that extra_vars is a list of (key, value) pairs. Therefore, the code I wrote earlier is the best guess.

Now, considering that the user wants the code generated, and the function's parameters, I'll proceed with that code.
