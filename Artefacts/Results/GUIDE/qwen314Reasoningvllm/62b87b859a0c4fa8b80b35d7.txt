Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called to_csv, part of a class (since it has self as the first parameter). The docstring mentions that this function is deprecated starting from Lena 0.5, and that iterables are converted to tables. The purpose is to convert a graph's points to CSV format.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The parameters are separator (default comma) and header (optional). The description says that for each point, first its coordinate is converted to string, separated by the separator, then each part of its value. So, maybe each point has coordinates and values, and they need to be combined into CSV rows.

But since the function is deprecated, maybe the actual implementation is not needed anymore. However, the user might still want the code that follows the docstring. But the note says that in Lena 0.5, to_csv is not used, and instead, use lena.output.ToCSV. So perhaps this function is a placeholder or a deprecated method that's not actively used.

But the user wants code based on the function signature and docstring. So I need to write the code for the to_csv method. However, the docstring says it's deprecated. So maybe the code should raise a DeprecationWarning or something similar.

Wait, the first line of the docstring says: .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used. So the function is deprecated. Therefore, the code for this function might be to issue a warning and perhaps not do anything, or maybe it's just a stub.

But the user wants the code that matches the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to generate CSV data as per the description, but since it's deprecated, maybe it's just a placeholder.

But how to proceed? Let's think about the parameters. The function is part of a class, probably a Graph class. Each point in the graph has coordinates and values. For example, a point might be (x, y) coordinate and a value like (z). So for each point, the coordinate is converted to string, separated by the separator, then the value parts.

But without knowing the exact structure of the Graph class, it's a bit challenging. However, the docstring says that iterables are converted to tables, so maybe the Graph's points are iterables. So the to_csv method would iterate over the points, and for each, process the coordinates and values.

But since the function is deprecated, maybe the actual code is not required. However, the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should be a method that issues a deprecation warning and maybe does nothing, or perhaps it's intended to be replaced by lena.output.ToCSV.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to generate the CSV data as per the description, even though it's deprecated. Let's think about that.

The function's purpose is to convert the graph's points to CSV. So, for each point, the coordinates are converted to strings, joined by the separator, then the value parts. For example, if a point has coordinates (x, y) and value (v1, v2), then the line would be "x,y,v1,v2".

But how to get the coordinates and values from the graph? Assuming that the Graph class has a way to iterate over points, each point having coordinates and values. For example, maybe each point is a tuple where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values. Or maybe the graph has separate attributes for coordinates and values.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the code is supposed to be a placeholder. However, the user might expect that the code is written in a way that follows the docstring's description.

But given that the function is deprecated, perhaps the code should raise a warning and not do anything. Let me check the docstring again. The first line says that in Lena 0.5, to_csv is not used. So maybe the function is just a stub that's not implemented anymore.

But the user wants the code generated. So perhaps the code would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.

    Convert graph's points to CSV.

    *separator* delimits values, the default is comma.

    *header*, if not ``None``, is the first string of the output
    (new line is added automatically).

    Since a graph can be multidimensional,
    for each point first its coordinate is converted to string
    (separated by *separator*), then each part of its value.

    To convert :class:`Graph` to CSV inside a Lena sequence,
    use :class:`lena.output.ToCSV`.
    """
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    # Maybe return something or do nothing?
    # Since the function is not used, perhaps it's just a placeholder.

But the user might expect that the code is written to actually generate the CSV, but since it's deprecated, maybe the code is not implemented. However, the docstring says that the function is not used, so perhaps the code is just a stub.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to generate the CSV data as per the description. Let me think again.

Assuming that the Graph has a way to iterate over points, and each point has coordinates and values. For example, if the graph is a list of points, where each point is a tuple of coordinates and values. But without knowing the actual data structure, it's hard to code.

But maybe the code is supposed to be written in a way that follows the docstring's description. For example, if the graph's points are stored in self.points, and each point is a tuple where the first part is the coordinate (maybe a tuple) and the second part is the value (maybe a tuple).

So, for each point, we take the coordinate, convert each element to string, join with separator, then take the value parts, convert to strings, and join with separator, then combine them all.

But the docstring says: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinate is converted to a string with separator, then the value parts are added.

For example, if the coordinate is (x, y) and value is (v1, v2), then the line would be "x,y,v1,v2".

But how to get the coordinate and value from each point? Let's assume that each point is a tuple where the first element is the coordinate (as a tuple) and the rest are the value parts. Or maybe the point is a tuple where the first elements are coordinates and the rest are values. For example, a 2D graph with x and y coordinates, and a value z. So the point is (x, y, z). Then the coordinate is (x, y), and the value is (z). So the line would be "x,y,z".

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the code is supposed to be written with placeholders. However, the user might expect that the code is written to follow the docstring's instructions.

But since the function is deprecated, maybe the code is not implemented and just raises a warning. Therefore, the generated code would be as follows:

Implementing the deprecation warning, and perhaps returning an empty string or something. However, the docstring says that the function is not used, so maybe it's just a stub.

In any case, the user wants the code generated. The function's parameters are separator and header. The header is the first string of the output, with a new line added automatically. So if header is provided, it's added as the first line.

So, perhaps the code would generate lines for each point, with the coordinate and value parts joined by the separator, and if a header is provided, it's added first.

But again, without knowing the internal structure of the Graph, it's hard to code. However, perhaps the code is supposed to be a placeholder that raises a warning and returns nothing, or returns a string.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be written with the assumption that the Graph has a points attribute, which is an iterable of points, and each point has a coordinate and value.

But given that the user is asking for code based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps the code should be written with the understanding that the actual implementation is not required, but the deprecation warning is added.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.

    Convert graph's points to CSV.

    *separator* delimits values, the default is comma.

    *header*, if not ``None``, is the first string of the output
    (new line is added automatically).

    Since a graph can be multidimensional,
    for each point first its coordinate is converted to string
    (separated by *separator*), then each part of its value.

    To convert :class:`Graph` to CSV inside a Lena sequence,
    use :class:`lena.output.ToCSV`.
    """
    import warnings
    warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use lena.output.ToCSV instead.", DeprecationWarning)
    # The actual implementation is not provided as the function is deprecated.
    # This is a placeholder.
    return ""

But maybe the user expects that the code is written to actually generate the CSV data. However, without knowing the internal structure of the Graph, it's impossible to write the correct code. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to be written with a note that it's deprecated and not implemented.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be written with the assumption that the Graph has a points attribute, which is an iterable of tuples, where each tuple represents a point. For example, each point might be (x, y, value), and the code would process that.

But since the user hasn't provided the rest of the code, perhaps the best approach is to generate code that issues a deprecation warning and returns an empty string, as a placeholder.

Therefore, the final code would include the deprecation warning and perhaps a note that the function is not implemented.
