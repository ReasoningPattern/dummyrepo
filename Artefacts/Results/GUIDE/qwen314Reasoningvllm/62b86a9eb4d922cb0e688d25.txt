Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _get_resource_name_regex. The docstring says it returns a regex used to validate Krake resource names. First, I should think about what the regex should look like.

Krake is a Kubernetes-based platform, so maybe the resource names follow Kubernetes naming conventions. Kubernetes names typically have restrictions: they can include lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, but can't start or end with a hyphen. Also, they can't have consecutive hyphens.

So the regex pattern for a valid Kubernetes resource name might be something like ^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$ which ensures the first and last characters are alphanumeric and allows hyphens in between.

But maybe Krake has specific rules. If the docstring doesn't specify, I should stick to common conventions. The function is supposed to return the regex pattern, probably as a string. So the function would return that regex string.

Wait, the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which suggests it's a helper function. So the code would be a simple return statement with the regex pattern.

But I need to make sure. Let me think again. The user wants the code based on the function signature and docstring. Since there's no existing code, I need to write the implementation.

So the function would return a regex string. Let me check Kubernetes' official documentation. Kubernetes resource names must be valid DNS labels. According to Kubernetes, a DNS label must be at least 1 character, at most 63 characters, and match the regex [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?.

So the regex pattern is r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$'.

Therefore, the function _get_resource_name_regex would return this regex as a string. So the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$'

But wait, the user mentioned test-driven development. They want unit tests first. However, the initial query says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. The tips mention TDD, but the user might want the actual code, not the tests. However, the original instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is just the function implementation.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown. So the answer should be the function code. But maybe the user expects tests as well? Wait, the initial problem says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips suggest TDD, but the user might just want the function code. The original question says to output only the code generated, so probably the function implementation.

So the correct code is the function that returns the regex string as discussed.
