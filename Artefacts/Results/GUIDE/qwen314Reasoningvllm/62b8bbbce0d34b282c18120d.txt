Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_file_exist that checks if a file exists. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so I should start with writing tests first.

First, I'll think about the unit tests. The function should return True if the file exists and False otherwise. So, I need to test both scenarios. But how do I create a temporary file for testing? Maybe using the tempfile module. Also, I should handle cases where the file name is invalid or the path doesn't exist.

Wait, the function's parameter is file_name. So, the function probably uses os.path.exists or something similar. But I should make sure that it's checking for a regular file, not a directory. Oh, the docstring says "existing file", so maybe using os.path.isfile would be better than just exists, because exists would return True for directories too.

Wait, the current implementation is just a stub. So the actual code should check if the file exists and is a file, not a directory. So the code would be something like:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But I need to write tests for that. Let me think about the test cases.

Test cases:
1. Test when the file exists. Create a temporary file, check returns True.
2. Test when the file does not exist, returns False.
3. Test when the path is a directory, returns False.
4. Test with a non-existent path, returns False.

So in the tests, I can use tempfile to create a temporary file. For the directory test, create a temporary directory and pass that path.

But how to structure the tests? Using the unittest framework.

So the test code would look like:

import unittest
import os
import tempfile

class TestIsFileExist(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_file_exists(self):
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as tmp_file:
            self.assertTrue(is_file_exist(tmp_file.name))
    
    def test_file_does_not_exist(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_file_exist("nonexistentfile.txt"))
    
    def test_directory_path(self):
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:
            self.assertFalse(is_file_exist(tmp_dir))
    
    def test_nonexistent_path(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_file_exist("nonexistentpath/file.txt"))

But wait, in the first test, the NamedTemporaryFile is created and deleted after the test. But when using delete=False, the file remains after the context manager exits. However, in the test, the file is created, and the test checks if it exists. Then, after the test, the file is left on the system. That might be an issue. Maybe using a context manager that deletes the file after the test? Or maybe using a temporary directory.

Alternatively, perhaps using the tempfile module's functions to create a file and then check.

Alternatively, maybe in the test, after creating the file, I can check if it exists, then delete it. But that's more code.

Alternatively, perhaps using the NamedTemporaryFile with delete=True, but then the file is deleted when the context manager exits. But during the test, the file exists. So the test can check is_file_exist(tmp_file.name) while the file is present.

Wait, when using NamedTemporaryFile with delete=False, the file is created and not deleted when the context manager exits. But if I use delete=True (the default), then the file is deleted when the context manager exits. But during the test, the file exists. So maybe:

def test_file_exists(self):
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as tmp_file:
        # The file exists here
        self.assertTrue(is_file_exist(tmp_file.name))
    # After exiting the context, the file is deleted.

But wait, if the file is deleted after the context, then during the test, the file exists. So the test should pass.

But what if the test is run in a way that the file is not deleted? Maybe it's better to create a file, check, then delete it. But using the context manager handles that.

So the test would be correct.

Now, for the directory test, creating a temporary directory and checking that is_file_exist returns False.

So the test code would be as above.

Now, the actual function code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, what about if the file_name is a symlink? The os.path.isfile follows symlinks by default. But the function's docstring says "existing file", so maybe that's acceptable. The function's behavior is to check if the path exists and is a file, following symlinks. If the user wants to check the symlink itself, that's different, but the current implementation is standard.

So the code seems correct.

Now, putting it all together. The user wants the code generated in Python markdown format, and only the code. But the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. But the tips mention to generate tests first. So the answer should include both the tests and the function code?

Wait, the original question says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So perhaps the answer should include both the test code and the implementation code.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. But the tips suggest TDD approach. So maybe the answer is the code for the function, but the user wants the code that includes the tests and the function?

But the original problem says that the user provided the function signature and docstring, and wants the code generated. However, the tips suggest to first generate tests. So perhaps the answer should include both the tests and the function code.

But the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the answer is the code for the function, but the tests are part of the code?

Wait, the initial problem says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The tips are just suggestions. So maybe the answer is the function code, but following TDD, the user would first write the tests. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the answer is the function code, but the user wants the tests as part of the code?

But the original problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The user's example shows that the function is a stub. So the answer is the implementation of the function, but according to the tips, the tests should be generated first. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, which would be the function code. But perhaps the user expects the tests and the function code.

But the problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". So the code is the function. But the tips suggest that the tests should be generated first. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer is the function code, but the tests are not part of the required output.

But the user's example shows that the function is a stub. So the answer is the code that implements the function. Therefore, the correct code is the function using os.path.isfile.

But I need to make sure. Let me check again.

The user's message says:

Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format.

The tips are for the assistant to follow, but the user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the answer is the implementation of the function. However, the tips suggest to first generate tests. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function, not the tests. Unless the user considers the tests as part of the code.

But the original problem may be expecting the function code. So the answer is the function code, which checks if the file exists using os.path.isfile.

So the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But I need to make sure that this is correct. Yes, because os.path.isfile returns True if the path is an existing regular file.

So that's the code.
