Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'on' and it's a method that returns a decorator to add a handler to a hook in the registry of the class. 

First, I should think about what this method does. The docstring says it returns a decorator that adds a new handler to the specified hook. So, the 'on' method is probably part of a class that manages hooks, like a plugin system or event system. The registry is likely a dictionary that maps hook names to lists of handler functions.

So, the 'on' method takes a 'hook' parameter, which is the name of the hook. The decorator function it returns should take a function as an argument and then add that function to the registry under the given hook.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The class should have a registry attribute, probably a dictionary, initialized in __init__.
2. The 'on' method needs to return a decorator. That decorator will accept a function and register it.
3. When the decorator is used, like @obj.on('some_hook'), it should add the decorated function to the registry for 'some_hook'.

Wait, but in Python, decorators are functions that take the decorated function as an argument. So the 'on' method returns a function that takes the handler function and then adds it to the registry.

So, the code for the 'on' method would look something like this:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(handler):
        if hook not in self.registry:
            self.registry[hook] = []
        self.registry[hook].append(handler)
        return handler
    return decorator

But wait, the registry needs to be part of the class. So the class must have an attribute, maybe self.registry, which is a dictionary. So the class would have an __init__ method that initializes this registry.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition. The function signature is part of a class. So the code should be part of a class that has a registry.

But the user only provided the function signature and docstring. So the task is to generate the code for the 'on' method, assuming that the class has a registry attribute.

But maybe the user expects the full class code? Or just the method? The original question says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class's other parts.

Hmm, but the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the code is just the method, but the registry must be part of the class. However, without the class's __init__ method, the code might not be complete.

But maybe the user expects the 'on' method implementation. Let me focus on that.

So, the 'on' method returns a decorator. The decorator takes a function and adds it to the registry. So the code for the method would be as I outlined before.

But I need to make sure that the registry exists. So the class must have a registry attribute. So perhaps the class has an __init__ method that initializes self.registry as a dictionary.

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code should include that as well? Or is the 'on' method part of a class that already has the registry?

The user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class. So the code should be the method's implementation, assuming that the class has a registry.

But to make it a complete example, maybe the user expects the class definition with the registry and the 'on' method.

But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is def on(self, hook): ... So the code should be the method's body.

But to make it work, the class must have a registry. So perhaps the code includes the class with the registry.

But the user might not have given the full context. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is just the method, but the registry is assumed to exist.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects a complete class with the registry and the 'on' method.

But since the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, perhaps the answer should include the 'on' method and the necessary parts of the class.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be the method, and the rest is assumed.

But given that the user's example is a method, perhaps the code is just the method's implementation. However, without the registry, the code would not work. So maybe the code should include the class with the registry.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is the method, and the registry is part of the class.

So, the code would be:

class HookManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in self.registry:
                self.registry[hook] = []
            self.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator

But the user's original function is part of a class, but the class name isn't given. However, the user's code example only shows the method, not the class. But to make it work, the class needs to have the registry.

But the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is just the method, but the registry is assumed to be present in the class.

But in that case, the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    """
    Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
    """
    def decorator(handler):
        if hook not in self.registry:
            self.registry[hook] = []
        self.registry[hook].append(handler)
        return handler
    return decorator

But this assumes that 'self' has a 'registry' attribute. So the class must have that.

But the user might expect the full class code. However, since the user hasn't provided the class's other parts, perhaps the answer is just the method.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class. So the code is the method's implementation.

But the user also mentioned tips about test-driven development, generating unit tests first. However, the user's current question is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. The initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code generated in Python markdown.

So perhaps the answer is the method's code as I outlined, assuming that the registry exists in the class.

But to make it a complete example, maybe the code includes the class with the registry and the 'on' method.

But the user's original function is part of a class, but the class name isn't given. However, the code can be written as a class with the registry and the 'on' method.

So the final code would be:

class HookRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registry = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        """
        Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.
        """
        def decorator(handler):
            if hook not in self.registry:
                self.registry[hook] = []
            self.registry[hook].append(handler)
            return handler
        return decorator

But the class name is arbitrary. However, the user hasn't provided that, so perhaps the code is just the method, but the class must have the registry.

But since the user's question is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, the answer is the method's code. However, without the registry, the code would not work. So maybe the code includes the class and the method.

But I think that's the right approach. So the generated code is the class with the registry and the 'on' method.
