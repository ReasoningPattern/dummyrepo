Okay, I need to generate Python code for the cached function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The description says it returns a decorator that saves results in a cache. So the cached function is probably used to decorate other functions, adding caching behavior.

First, the parameters: the cache is probably some kind of cache object, maybe like a dictionary. The key parameter defaults to hashkey, which I assume is a function that generates a key based on the arguments. The lock parameter might be for thread safety, but maybe that's optional.

Wait, the function is called cached, and it returns a decorator. So when you use @cached(cache), it applies this decorator to a function. The decorator itself would handle caching the results.

Let me think about how to structure the decorator. The decorator needs to take the function being decorated, and then when the function is called, it checks the cache using the key. If the key exists, return the cached value. Otherwise, compute it, store it in the cache, and return.

But how does the key work? The key is generated by the hashkey function, which probably takes the arguments of the decorated function. So the hashkey function would be called with the arguments, and returns a key that's used to store in the cache.

Wait, the default for key is hashkey. But in Python, if you have a default parameter that's a function, it's evaluated once when the function is defined, not when it's called. But maybe hashkey is a function that's supposed to be used here. However, the user might want to pass a different key function. So the cached function allows specifying a key function.

So the cached function returns a decorator that uses the provided cache, key function, and lock. The lock might be used to synchronize access to the cache in a multi-threaded environment.

Let me outline the steps for the decorator:

1. The decorator is created by cached(cache, key=..., lock=...).
2. When the decorated function is called, the decorator checks the cache using the key function.
3. If the key is present, return the cached value.
4. If not, compute the value by calling the original function, then store it in the cache with the key.
5. The lock is used to ensure that only one thread can access the cache at a time, preventing race conditions.

Now, how to implement this in Python. The cached function returns a decorator. So the cached function would look something like:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # generate key using key function
            k = key(args, kwargs)
            # check if lock is present, acquire it
            if lock is not None:
                lock.acquire()
            try:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            finally:
                if lock is not None:
                    lock.release()
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the key function's default is hashkey. But what is hashkey? Maybe it's a function that takes args and kwargs and returns a hashable key. However, in the code above, the key is called with (args, kwargs). But perhaps the key function should be called with the arguments and keyword arguments of the decorated function. So the default key function would generate a key based on those parameters.

But in the code above, the key function is passed args and kwargs. So if the default hashkey is a function that takes args and kwargs, then that's correct.

But what if the user wants to use a different key function? They can pass it in when calling cached.

Now, the lock is optional. If provided, it's used to synchronize access to the cache. So in the wrapper function, before checking the cache, we acquire the lock, and release it after.

But in Python, using a lock in this way might not be the most efficient, but it's a common approach for thread safety.

Wait, but the lock is passed in as an argument to the cached function. So when creating the decorator, the lock is available. So in the wrapper function, we check if lock is not None, then acquire and release.

But what if the lock is not a threading.Lock object? Well, the user is responsible for passing the correct lock.

Now, what about the cache? The cache is expected to be a mutable object, like a dictionary. So when the decorator is created, it uses the provided cache. So when multiple decorated functions use the same cache, they'll share it. But that's up to the user.

So putting it all together, the code for the cached function would be as outlined above.

But wait, the original function signature is def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. So the default for key is hashkey. But in Python, if hashkey is not defined, this would cause an error. So perhaps hashkey is a predefined function elsewhere. However, the user hasn't provided that, so maybe I need to define it as well? Or is it part of the standard library?

Alternatively, maybe the hashkey is a function that generates a key from the arguments. For example, maybe it's a function that returns a tuple of args and kwargs, or something like that. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should assume that hashkey is available, or perhaps the user expects that the key function is passed in.

But in the code generated, the default key is hashkey, which may not be defined. So perhaps the user expects that hashkey is a predefined function, maybe from somewhere else. However, in the code provided, the user hasn't given that. So maybe in the generated code, the hashkey is a placeholder, and the user is expected to provide it. But that might be an issue.

Alternatively, maybe the hashkey is a function that the user is supposed to pass. But the default is set to hashkey, which may not be correct. Perhaps the intended key function is to generate a key from the arguments. For example, a common approach is to use the arguments and keyword arguments as a tuple, but since they are not hashable, maybe using a tuple of the args and a frozenset of the kwargs items.

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code should have a default key function. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, not to assume anything else. So perhaps the code should use hashkey as the default, even if it's not defined. But that would be an error.

Wait, maybe the user intended that hashkey is a function that's supposed to be passed in. But the default is hashkey, which is a name that's not defined. That's a problem. So perhaps there's a mistake here, and the intended default is a function that generates a key from the arguments. For example, maybe the default key function is something like:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But since that's not provided, perhaps the code should have a default key function. However, the original problem says that the function signature is given as def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. So the user may have intended that hashkey is a predefined function elsewhere, or perhaps it's a typo. But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code should proceed with the assumption that hashkey is a valid function.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the key is generated using the arguments and keyword arguments, and the default key function is to generate a tuple of args and a frozenset of the kwargs. But since the user hasn't specified that, perhaps the code should use a default key function that does that.

But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the key parameter defaults to hashkey, which is presumably a function. So the code should use that as the default.

So the generated code would have the cached function as described, with the key being hashkey by default.

But then, when the code is run, if hashkey is not defined, it will throw a NameError. So perhaps the user expects that hashkey is defined elsewhere. But since the problem doesn't mention that, maybe the code should include a default key function.

Alternatively, maybe the hashkey is a typo and should be something else, like a function that generates a key. But without more information, I'll proceed with the given signature.

So the code for the cached function would be as I outlined before.

Now, the user also mentioned that they should follow a test-driven development approach, generating unit tests first. But the question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated in Python markdown format. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips mention writing tests first. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the cached function, not the tests. But the initial problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So perhaps the user is expecting the code for the cached function, not the tests. However, the tips mention TDD, but the actual code to generate is the function itself.

So putting it all together, the code for the cached function would be:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            k = key(args, kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                lock.acquire()
            try:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                else:
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[k] = result
                    return result
            finally:
                if lock is not None:
                    lock.release()
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the key function is called with args and kwargs. However, in Python, the args are a tuple, and kwargs is a dict. So the key function should generate a hashable key from these. For example, if the default key is hashkey, which may be a function that returns a tuple of args and a frozenset of kwargs items.

But in the code above, the key function is passed args and kwargs. So if the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the arguments, that's correct.

But what about the lock? The code acquires the lock before checking the cache, and releases it after. However, in the case where the key is not in the cache, the code computes the result, stores it in the cache, and returns. But during this process, the lock is held, preventing other threads from accessing the cache. That's correct for thread safety.

But there's a possible race condition between checking if the key is in the cache and storing it. However, with the lock, that's prevented. Because the lock is acquired before checking, so no other thread can modify the cache during this process.

So the code seems correct.

But what about the default key=hashkey? If hashkey is not defined, this code will throw a NameError. But the user's problem statement doesn't mention that, so perhaps it's assumed that hashkey is available.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the key is generated by a function that takes the arguments and returns a key. For example, the default key function could be something like:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should include that as part of the solution. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The given signature has key=hashkey, so perhaps the code is correct as is, assuming that hashkey is defined elsewhere.

Therefore, the final code would be as written above.
