Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_option_spec based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it gets the specification for a specified option name, and it mentions using self.get_parser_option_specs() to get options of the given command_name. 

First, I should figure out what the structure of the code might look like. The function is a method of a class, since it uses self. The parameters are command_name and argument_name. The function probably retrieves some option specifications from a parser, maybe using the command name to find the right parser and then looking up the argument name in that parser's options.

Wait, the docstring says to use self.get_parser_option_specs(). So maybe that method returns a dictionary or some structure that maps command names to their options. Then, for the given command_name, we get the options, and then find the one with the argument_name.

So the steps might be:

1. Call self.get_parser_option_specs() to get all the option specs.
2. Find the entry for the given command_name in that structure.
3. Within that command's options, find the one with the argument_name.
4. Return that specification.

But I need to make sure about the data structures. Let's assume that get_parser_option_specs returns a dictionary where keys are command names, and the values are dictionaries of argument names to their specs. So for example, something like:

{
    'command1': {'arg1': spec1, 'arg2': spec2},
    'command2': {'arg3': spec3},
}

In that case, the code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    specs = self.get_parser_option_specs()
    command_spec = specs.get(command_name)
    if command_spec:
        return command_spec.get(argument_name)
    return None

But wait, what if get_parser_option_specs() is a method that needs to be implemented? The user hasn't provided that, but the function is supposed to use it. So the code here depends on that method existing.

But the user's task is to generate code for get_option_spec, not for get_parser_option_specs. So the code for get_option_spec would call that method, assuming it's already implemented.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()". So the code would retrieve the options for the command, then get the argument's spec.

So the code would be something like:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    return options.get(argument_name)

Wait, but the original docstring says "Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()". Maybe the get_parser_option_specs method is called without arguments, and returns all options, and then we have to find the command_name in there. Or maybe get_parser_option_specs takes the command_name as an argument. The original docstring is a bit ambiguous.

Looking back at the original docstring: "Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()". The wording suggests that self.get_parser_option_specs() is called to get the options for the command_name. But how? Maybe the get_parser_option_specs method is supposed to take the command_name as an argument. Or maybe it's a method that returns all options, and then we filter by command_name.

But the original function signature for get_option_spec has parameters command_name and argument_name. So perhaps the get_parser_option_specs is a method that, when called, returns a dictionary of command names to their options. Then, for the given command_name, we get the options for that command, and then get the argument_name from that.

So the code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    all_specs = self.get_parser_option_specs()
    command_specs = all_specs.get(command_name)
    if command_specs:
        return command_specs.get(argument_name)
    return None

But then, what is the return type? It depends on what get_parser_option_specs returns. But since the user hasn't provided that, we can assume that it's structured in a way that this code works.

Alternatively, maybe get_parser_option_specs is a method that takes the command_name as an argument. For example:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    # returns the options for that command

In that case, the code for get_option_spec would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs(command_name)
    return options.get(argument_name)

But the original docstring says "Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()", which might imply that get_parser_option_specs is called without arguments, but that seems unlikely. It's more likely that get_parser_option_specs is called with the command_name.

But the original function signature for get_parser_option_specs isn't provided. The user only provided the signature for get_option_spec. So perhaps the get_parser_option_specs is a method that returns all the options for all commands, and then we have to find the command_name in there.

But without more information, I have to make an assumption. Let's go with the first approach where get_parser_option_specs returns a dict of command_name to options, and then we get the command's options and then the argument.

So the code would be as I wrote before. But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Another thing to consider: what if the command_name doesn't exist in the specs? Then, command_specs would be None, and returning None would be appropriate. Or maybe raise an exception? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps returning None is acceptable.

Now, the user also mentioned that they want to follow a test-driven development approach, generating unit tests first. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown format. But the initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips suggest to first generate tests. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. But the user's message says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the answer should be the code for the function, not the tests. But the tips mention TDD, but perhaps that's just a suggestion for the user's own development process, not part of the code generation task.

So, putting it all together, the code for get_option_spec would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    options = self.get_parser_option_specs()
    return options.get(command_name, {}).get(argument_name)

Wait, that's a more concise way. Call get_parser_option_specs, which returns a dict. Then, get the command_name entry, defaulting to an empty dict, and then get the argument_name from that.

Yes, that's better. So the code would be:

def get_option_spec(self, command_name, argument_name):
    """
    Gets the specification for the specified option name. Get options of the given command_name with self.get_parser_option_specs()
    """
    specs = self.get_parser_option_specs()
    return specs.get(command_name, {}).get(argument_name)

But this assumes that get_parser_option_specs returns a dictionary where each key is a command name, and the value is another dictionary of argument names to their specs. So, for example, if the specs are structured like:

{
    'command1': {'arg1': 'spec1', 'arg2': 'spec2'},
    'command2': {'arg3': 'spec3'},
}

Then, for command_name 'command1' and argument_name 'arg1', it returns 'spec1'.

This seems reasonable. So the code is as above.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. The function is supposed to get the option spec for the given command and argument. So this code should do that.

So the final code is as written.
