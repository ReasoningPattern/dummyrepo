Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function select_filenames_by_prefix. The function takes a prefix and a list of files, and returns all files that match the given prefix. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to filter files based on a prefix. So for each file in the 'files' list, I need to check if it starts with the 'prefix' string. In Python, the str.startswith() method can be used for this.

So the plan is: iterate over each file in the files list, check if it starts with the prefix, and collect those that do. Then return the collected list.

Wait, but what about case sensitivity? The problem statement doesn't mention it, so I'll assume that the comparison is case-sensitive. Unless specified otherwise, it's safer to stick with the default behavior.

Now, the parameters: 'prefix' is a string, and 'files' is a list of strings. The function should return a list of strings that start with the prefix.

Let me think about possible edge cases. For example, if the prefix is an empty string, then all files would match. But according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to return files that match the given prefix. So if the prefix is empty, does that count as a match? Well, the startswith method returns True for empty string, so that would include all files. But maybe the function is intended to have the prefix be non-empty. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify, so I'll proceed with the standard behavior.

Another case: files that are exactly the same as the prefix. For example, if prefix is 'abc' and a file is 'abc', then it should be included. Because 'abc'.startswith('abc') is True.

So the code would be something like:

def select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files):
    return [file for file in files if file.startswith(prefix)]

That's straightforward. But wait, the user mentioned to follow test-driven development, so maybe I should first write the tests. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. But the initial prompt says to generate code, but the tips suggest to first generate tests. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. Wait, the original problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the actual function code, not the tests. But the tips mention TDD, but perhaps that's just a suggestion for the developer, not part of the required output. So the answer should be the function implementation.

So the code would be as I thought: a list comprehension filtering files that start with the prefix.

But let me check the function's docstring again. The docstring says "return all files that match the given prefix". So the code is correct.

Therefore, the Python code is as simple as that. Now, I need to present it in markdown format, with triple backticks and the python tag.
