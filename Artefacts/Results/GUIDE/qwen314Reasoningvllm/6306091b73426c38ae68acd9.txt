Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called workspace_manager and it's a method that gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

First, I need to understand what this function does. The docstring says it retrieves the workspace manager using the _get_service method of the class, passing ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER as the argument. So the function is probably part of a class that has a _get_service method which takes a service name and returns the corresponding service instance.

But wait, the function is defined as a standalone function here. Wait, no, the def line starts with 'def workspace_manager(cls):', which suggests it's a class method. Because in Python, when you define a method with 'cls' as the first parameter, it's a class method. So this is a class method that returns the workspace manager by calling cls._get_service with ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER.

But the user hasn't provided the ServiceName enum or the _get_service method. So maybe the code is part of a larger framework where these are already defined. The task is to generate the code for this function.

So the code would be something like:

@classmethod
def workspace_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But wait, the original function signature doesn't have the @classmethod decorator. Wait, the user provided the function signature as def workspace_manager(cls): ... So maybe the user expects that the function is a class method, but in Python, you need to decorate it with @classmethod for that. However, the original code might not have the decorator. But in Python, if you define a function with 'cls' as the first parameter, it's not automatically a class method. So maybe the user's code is missing the decorator. But the user's code example doesn't include it. Hmm.

Wait, the user's provided code is:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """

So the user's code is a function that takes 'cls' as the first parameter. But in Python, that's not a class method unless decorated. So perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe they are using a different approach. But as a Python engineer, I should correct that by adding the @classmethod decorator.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So if the original code doesn't have the decorator, maybe I should follow that. However, in Python, without the decorator, the function would be a regular function that takes 'cls' as an argument, which is not typical. So maybe the user intended it to be a class method, and thus I should add the @classmethod decorator.

But the user's example doesn't show it. Hmm. Well, perhaps the user's code is part of a metaclass or some other setup where 'cls' is passed explicitly. But that's unlikely. So the correct approach is to add the @classmethod decorator to make it a class method.

So the code would be:

@classmethod
def workspace_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But then, ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER needs to be defined. However, the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the code is part of a larger codebase where ServiceName is an existing enum or class.

But the user's task is to generate the code for the function. So assuming that ServiceName is already defined elsewhere, the code would be as above.

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, generating unit tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, the original question says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the tips mention to do TDD, but the actual output is just the code. So perhaps the user is confused, but the main task is to write the function.

So the code would be the class method as discussed.

But the original function signature doesn't have the @classmethod decorator. Should I include it? Well, in Python, if the function is intended to be a class method, then yes. But the user's code didn't have it. However, the user's docstring says "in cls._get_service()", which implies that the function is a class method, because it's using 'cls' as the receiver.

Therefore, the correct code would have the @classmethod decorator. So I'll include that.

So the final code is:

@classmethod
def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But the user's original code didn't have the return statement. Wait, the original code's docstring says that the function gets the workspace manager via that method. So the function should return the result of cls._get_service(...). Therefore, the code should have a return statement.

But the original code provided by the user doesn't have any code inside the function. So the user's code is just the function signature and docstring, and the actual implementation is to be filled in.

So the generated code would be the function with the return statement.

Therefore, the correct code is as above.
