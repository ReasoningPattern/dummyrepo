Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function difference(d1, d2, level=-1) that returns a dictionary with items from d1 not in d2. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the docstring says it returns items from d1 not contained in d2. So, it's like a set difference but for dictionaries. But dictionaries can have nested structures, right? The level parameter might be for handling nested dictionaries. Wait, the level is set to -1 by default. Maybe level determines how deep to check for differences. If level is -1, perhaps it means check all levels recursively. But I need to clarify what the level parameter does here.

Wait, the user hasn't provided any examples, so I need to make assumptions. Let me think: if level is 0, maybe it only checks the top-level keys. If level is 1, maybe it checks one level deeper, etc. But how does that work with nested dictionaries?

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter is for specifying the depth of recursion. For example, if level is -1, it goes as deep as possible. If it's a non-negative integer, it stops at that level. But I need to make sure that the function can handle nested dictionaries and compare them based on the level parameter.

But the function's current signature doesn't have any parameters for handling nested structures. So perhaps the function is intended to compare dictionaries at a certain depth. Let me think about how to implement this.

Let me consider the case where d1 and d2 are simple dictionaries. The difference would be the keys in d1 that are not in d2, and their corresponding values. But if the dictionaries have nested dictionaries, how to handle that?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to recursively remove any key-value pairs from d1 that exist in d2, considering nested dictionaries up to a certain level. For example, if level is 0, it only checks the top level. If level is 1, it checks one level deeper, etc. But how to implement that?

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter is not related to recursion depth but something else. But the default is -1, which might indicate that it's for handling nested structures. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the level parameter is a way to control how deep the comparison goes. For instance, if level is -1, compare all levels recursively. If level is 0, compare only the top-level keys. If level is 1, compare top-level and one level deeper, etc. But how to implement that.

Alternatively, maybe the level is not part of the original problem. Wait, the user provided the function signature with level=-1. Maybe the level is for handling nested dictionaries, but I need to figure out how.

Alternatively, perhaps the level is not used, and the function is supposed to return a dictionary with keys present in d1 but not in d2. But that's a simple set difference. However, the function's name is 'difference', which might imply more than that.

Wait, the function's docstring says "return a dictionary with items from d1 not contained in d2". So, for example, if d1 is {'a': 1, 'b': 2} and d2 is {'b': 2}, then the result would be {'a': 1}.

But if the dictionaries have nested structures, how to compare them? For example, if d1 is {'a': {'b': 1}} and d2 is {'a': {'b': 1}}, then the difference should be empty. But if d2 has {'a': {'c': 1}}, then the difference would be {'a': {'b': 1}}.

But how does the level parameter affect this? Maybe the level is the depth of recursion. For example, if level is 0, then only compare the top-level keys. If level is 1, compare the top-level and one level deeper. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the level is not part of the original problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the function signature. But since the user provided it, I have to work with it.

Alternatively, perhaps the level is a parameter that's not used in the initial implementation. Maybe the user intended to have a function that does a simple set difference, and the level is for future expansion. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the level is for handling nested dictionaries. For example, if level is -1, it means to check all levels recursively. If level is a non-negative integer, it checks up to that depth. For example, level=0: only top level. level=1: top and one level deeper, etc.

But how to implement that. Let me think of a recursive approach. The function could check each key in d1. For each key, if it's not in d2, include it in the result. If it is in d2, then check if the values are dictionaries. If they are, and the level allows for deeper checks, then recursively call the difference function with level-1.

But how to handle the level parameter. Let me outline the steps:

- For each key in d1:
   - If the key is not in d2, add it to the result.
   - If the key is in d2:
      - Check if the value in d1 and d2 are both dictionaries.
      - If level is greater than 0 (since level starts at -1?), then recursively call difference on the values with level-1.
      - If the result of the recursive call is not empty, then include the key in the result with the recursive difference as the value.
      - Otherwise, if the values are not equal, include the key in the result.

Wait, but this seems a bit complicated. Let me think again. The function's purpose is to return items from d1 not in d2. So, if the value in d1 is a dictionary, and the same key exists in d2 with a different value (which is also a dictionary), then we need to check the nested dictionaries.

But the level parameter might limit how deep we go. For example, if level is 0, we don't check nested dictionaries. If level is 1, we check one level deeper, etc.

But how to handle the level. Let's think of the level as the maximum depth to check. So, for example, if level is -1, it means unlimited depth. If level is 0, check only the top level. If level is 1, check top level and one level deeper, etc.

So, the function could be implemented recursively. Here's a possible approach:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    result = {}
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            result[key] = d1[key]
        else:
            val1 = d1[key]
            val2 = d2[key]
            if isinstance(val1, dict) and isinstance(val2, dict):
                if level > 0:
                    # recurse with level -1
                    diff = difference(val1, val2, level -1)
                    if diff:
                        result[key] = diff
            elif val1 != val2:
                result[key] = val1
    return result

But wait, what if level is -1? Then, for the first call, level is -1. But in the recursive call, level would be -2, which would not be >0. So, the recursion would stop. That's not correct. Because if level is -1, we want to check all levels. So perhaps the level parameter is the maximum depth to check. For example, level=0 means check only top level. level=1 means check top and one level deeper. level=-1 means unlimited.

So, perhaps the initial level is set to -1, which means no limit. Then, in the recursive calls, we subtract 1 from the level. If the level is -1, then we can recurse indefinitely. Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the level parameter is the maximum depth allowed. For example, if level is 0, then only top level. If level is 1, then top level and one level deeper. If level is -1, then no limit.

But how to handle that in code. Let me think. The initial level is -1. For each recursive call, we check if level is greater than 0. Wait, that's not right. If level is -1, then we can recurse. But how to track the depth.

Alternatively, maybe the level is the maximum depth allowed. So, for example, if level is 0, we don't recurse. If level is 1, we can recurse once. If level is -1, we can recurse as much as needed.

So, in the function, when we make a recursive call, we check if level is not 0. Wait, perhaps the initial level is set to -1, which means no limit. Then, in the recursive call, we pass level-1. But if level is -1, then level-1 is -2, which is still not 0. So, the code would recurse infinitely. That's a problem.

Hmm. So maybe the level parameter should be the maximum depth. So, for example, level=0 means check only the top level. level=1 means check top level and one level deeper. level=2 means check up to two levels deep, etc. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps the level is the number of levels to check. For example, level=0 means check only the top level. level=1 means check top and one level deeper. So, when making a recursive call, we subtract 1 from the level. If the level is 0, we don't recurse.

But in this case, the initial level is -1, which would not be allowed. So perhaps the default level should be something else. But the user provided the default as -1. Maybe it's a mistake, but I have to work with it.

Alternatively, perhaps the level parameter is not used in the initial implementation. Maybe the user intended to have a function that does a simple set difference, ignoring nested structures. But the presence of the level parameter complicates things.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to implement the function for simple dictionaries, and then think about the level parameter. However, since the user included the level parameter, it's likely that the function is supposed to handle nested dictionaries, and the level parameter determines the depth of comparison.

But how?

Let me think of an example. Suppose d1 is {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}, d2 is {'a': {'b': 2}, 'c': 2}. The difference should be {'a': {'b': 1}}. But if level is 0, then only the top level is checked. So, since 'a' is in d2, but the value is a dict. If level is 0, then we don't check deeper, so the difference would be empty. But if level is 1, then we check the value of 'a' and find that the inner dicts differ, so the difference includes 'a': {'b': 1}.

So, the level parameter determines how deep to check nested dictionaries. The default of -1 might mean that it checks all levels. But how to implement that.

So, the function should recursively check the nested dictionaries up to the specified level. If level is -1, then no limit. If it's a non-negative integer, then check up to that depth.

So, the code could be structured as follows:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    result = {}
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            result[key] = d1[key]
        else:
            val1 = d1[key]
            val2 = d2[key]
            if isinstance(val1, dict) and isinstance(val2, dict):
                # Check if we can go deeper
                if level != 0:
                    # Recurse with level-1 if level is not 0
                    # But if level is -1, then we can recurse
                    new_level = level - 1 if level != -1 else -1
                    diff = difference(val1, val2, new_level)
                    if diff:
                        result[key] = diff
            elif val1 != val2:
                result[key] = val1
    return result

Wait, but if level is -1, then new_level would be -1 -1 = -2? No, in the code above, if level is -1, then new_level is set to -1. Because the code says:

new_level = level -1 if level != -1 else -1

Wait, that's not correct. Let me re-examine that line. The idea is that if level is not -1, then subtract 1. If it is -1, then keep it as -1. So, for example, if the initial level is -1, then in the recursive call, we pass -1 again. That way, the recursion continues indefinitely. But that would cause infinite recursion.

Ah, that's a problem. Because if level is -1, then in the recursive call, we pass -1 again. So, the function would keep recursing infinitely. Which is not acceptable.

So, perhaps the level parameter should be the maximum depth allowed. For example, level=0 means check only the top level. level=1 means check one level deeper. level=-1 means no limit. But how to handle that.

An alternative approach: if level is -1, then we can recurse as deep as needed. Otherwise, we decrement the level each time and stop when it reaches 0.

So, in code:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    result = {}
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            result[key] = d1[key]
        else:
            val1 = d1[key]
            val2 = d2[key]
            if isinstance(val1, dict) and isinstance(val2, dict):
                # Check if we can go deeper
                if level != 0:
                    # If level is -1, we can recurse
                    new_level = level - 1 if level != -1 else -1
                    diff = difference(val1, val2, new_level)
                    if diff:
                        result[key] = diff
            elif val1 != val2:
                result[key] = val1
    return result

But this still has the problem of infinite recursion when level is -1. Because new_level is -1, and in the next recursive call, level is again -1, so again new_level is -1, leading to infinite recursion.

So, perhaps the level parameter should be treated as the maximum depth allowed. For example, if level is -1, then it means no limit. But how to represent that in the code. Maybe we can use a flag, but the parameter is level. Alternatively, we can pass level as a non-negative integer, and if it's -1, we treat it as a very large number (like float('inf')).

But that's not ideal. Alternatively, we can adjust the code to check if level is not 0. So, for example, when level is -1, we can recurse. But how to track the depth. Let me think:

If the initial level is -1, then in the first call, we can recurse. In the next call, we pass level-1, which is -2. But since we check if level != 0, we can keep recursing. But this would lead to infinite recursion because level is always not 0.

So, that approach won't work. Therefore, perhaps the level parameter is intended to be a non-negative integer, and the default is 0. But the user provided the default as -1, which complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter is not used, and the function is supposed to return a dictionary with keys present in d1 but not in d2, and for values, if they are dictionaries, recursively do the same. But without the level parameter. However, the user's function signature includes the level parameter, so I need to account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the level parameter is a red herring, and the function is supposed to return the set difference of the keys. But that would be simple. For example:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    return {k: v for k, v in d1.items() if k not in d2}

But this doesn't handle nested dictionaries. However, the presence of the level parameter suggests that the function is intended to handle nested structures. So, perhaps the level is for the depth of recursion. But how to implement that.

Maybe the level is the maximum depth to check. For example, level=0: only top level. level=1: check top and one level deeper. level=-1: check all levels.

To implement this, perhaps the function can check if level is not 0, and then recurse with level-1. But for level=-1, we can treat it as a very large number, like infinity.

But in Python, we can't pass infinity as an integer. So, perhaps we can use a helper function that takes a depth parameter, and if the original level is -1, we set the depth to a large number, say, 1000, or something like that. But this is not ideal.

Alternatively, we can use a flag to indicate whether to recurse infinitely. But the function signature uses level, which is an integer.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the user intended for the level parameter to not be used, and the function is supposed to return the simple set difference. But given the presence of the level parameter, I need to make an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter is for the depth of the keys. For example, level=0 means only the top-level keys, level=1 means keys one level deeper, etc. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, the level parameter is not used, and the function is supposed to return the set difference of keys. But that would make the level parameter redundant. However, the user provided it, so I need to include it.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to write the function that returns the set difference of keys, ignoring the level parameter for now, and then see if that makes sense. But that might not be what the user wants.

Alternatively, perhaps the level parameter is for the depth of the dictionary. For example, if level is 0, compare only the top level. If level is 1, compare top level and one level deeper, etc. But how to handle that.

Let me think of the following example:

d1 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}
d2 = {'a': {'b': 2}, 'c': 2}

If level is 0, then the difference would be empty because 'a' is present in d2 and 'c' is present. But if level is 1, then we check the 'a' key's value, which is a dict. The difference between {'b':1} and {'b':2} would be {'b':1}, so the overall result would be {'a': {'b':1}}.

So, the level parameter controls how deep to check nested dictionaries.

To implement this, the function should recursively check nested dictionaries up to the specified level. The level starts at -1, which means no limit. For each recursive call, the level is decremented by 1. If the level reaches 0, we stop recursing.

So, the code would look like this:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    result = {}
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            result[key] = d1[key]
        else:
            val1 = d1[key]
            val2 = d2[key]
            if isinstance(val1, dict) and isinstance(val2, dict):
                # Check if we can recurse deeper
                if level != 0:
                    new_level = level - 1 if level != -1 else -1
                    diff = difference(val1, val2, new_level)
                    if diff:
                        result[key] = diff
            elif val1 != val2:
                result[key] = val1
    return result

But again, if level is -1, then new_level is -1, and we keep recursing infinitely. To avoid that, perhaps when level is -1, we treat it as a very large number. But how?

Alternatively, we can use a helper function that takes a current_depth parameter, and if the original level is -1, then current_depth is set to a large value, like 1000, and we decrement it each time. But this is not ideal.

Alternatively, we can adjust the code to check if level is -1, and in that case, allow infinite recursion. But this would lead to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.

This suggests that the level parameter may have been intended to be a non-negative integer, with the default being 0. But the user provided it as -1. This is conflicting.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the level parameter is for the depth of recursion, and that the default of -1 means no limit. To prevent infinite recursion, we can use a helper function that tracks the current depth, and if the original level is -1, it allows unlimited depth.

But how to implement that. Let me think of a helper function:

def _difference(d1, d2, current_level, max_level):
    result = {}
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            result[key] = d1[key]
        else:
            val1 = d1[key]
            val2 = d2[key]
            if isinstance(val1, dict) and isinstance(val2, dict):
                if current_level < max_level:
                    diff = _difference(val1, val2, current_level + 1, max_level)
                    if diff:
                        result[key] = diff
            elif val1 != val2:
                result[key] = val1
    return result

Then, the main function would call this helper with max_level set to a large number if the original level is -1, or to the original level otherwise.

But how to handle this. For example:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    if level == -1:
        max_level = float('inf')
    else:
        max_level = level
    return _difference(d1, d2, 0, max_level)

But this is not possible because Python can't handle infinite recursion. So, this approach won't work.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement the function for simple dictionaries, ignoring the level parameter, and then write tests. But the user included the level parameter, so I need to handle it.

Alternatively, perhaps the level parameter is for the depth of the keys, and the function is supposed to return the keys at that level. But this is unclear.

Given the time I've spent and the ambiguity, I'll proceed with implementing the function that compares dictionaries recursively, with the level parameter controlling the depth. I'll assume that level is the maximum depth to check, and if it's -1, it means unlimited depth. To handle this, I'll use a helper function that tracks the current depth and stops when it reaches the max depth.

But since Python doesn't have a way to represent infinite recursion, I'll set a high max depth when level is -1, say, 1000. This is a workaround.

So, here's the code:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    def _difference(d1, d2, current_level, max_level):
        result = {}
        for key in d1:
            if key not in d2:
                result[key] = d1[key]
            else:
                val1 = d1[key]
                val2 = d2[key]
                if isinstance(val1, dict) and isinstance(val2, dict):
                    if current_level < max_level:
                        diff = _difference(val1, val2, current_level + 1, max_level)
                        if diff:
                            result[key] = diff
                elif val1 != val2:
                    result[key] = val1
        return result

    if level == -1:
        max_level = 1000  # arbitrary large number
    else:
        max_level = level
    return _difference(d1, d2, 0, max_level)

But this is a bit of a hack. However, given the ambiguity in the problem, this might be the best approach.

Now, for testing. Let's think of some test cases.

Test case 1: simple dictionaries.

d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
d2 = {'b': 2}
Expected result: {'a': 1}

Test case 2: nested dictionaries with level=0.

d1 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}
d2 = {'a': {'b': 2}, 'c': 2}
level=0
Expected result: {} because 'a' and 'c' are present in d2. Since level=0, we don't check deeper.

Test case 3: nested dictionaries with level=1.

Same d1 and d2 as above, level=1. Expected result: {'a': {'b': 1}}.

Test case 4: level=-1 (unlimited), same d1 and d2. Expected result: {'a': {'b': 1}}.

Now, writing the unit tests using pytest.

But the user asked to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in python markdown format. But the user also mentioned to use test-driven development, generating tests first.

So, I should generate the tests first, then the code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in python markdown. However, the user also provided tips suggesting to use TDD, generating tests first.

But the user's main request is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. However, the user also says to output ONLY the code generated in python markdown format. But the tips suggest to generate tests first.

This is a bit conflicting. The user might want the code for the function and its tests. But the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated in python markdown.

But the user's tips say to use TDD, so perhaps the answer should include both the tests and the code.

But the user's instruction says to output ONLY the code generated. So perhaps the answer should include the function code, and the tests are not required. However, the user's tips suggest to generate tests first, but the main request is to generate the code.

This is confusing. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to write the function code as per the earlier plan, and include the tests as well, but the user might want only the function code.

But the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the answer should be the code for the function, not the tests. However, the tips suggest to generate tests first. But the user's main instruction is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring.

Therefore, I'll proceed to write the function code as per the earlier plan, with the helper function and handling the level parameter.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Another approach: the level parameter might be for the depth of the keys. For example, level=0 means top level, level=1 means one level deeper, etc. But how to implement that.

Alternatively, perhaps the level parameter is not part of the original function, and it's a mistake. But since the user provided it, I have to include it.

In conclusion, I'll proceed with the code that handles nested dictionaries up to the specified level, with the helper function and max_level as described earlier.
