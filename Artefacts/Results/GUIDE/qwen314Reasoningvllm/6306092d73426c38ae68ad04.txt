Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_parser_option_specs based on the given signature and docstring. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so I should start by writing unit tests first.

First, let me think about what the function does. The docstring says it gets all the options for a specified command. The parameter is command_name, and it returns a list of command options. So, the function is probably part of a class that handles command-line parsing, maybe for different commands like 'main', 'virsh', 'ospd', etc.

For the unit tests, I need to create a test class that mocks the necessary parts. Since the function is a method of a class (self is present), I'll need to create a test case where I can instantiate the class and call this method.

Let me consider possible test cases. For example, testing with valid command names like 'main', 'virsh', etc., and also invalid ones. The function should return the correct list of options for each valid command. For invalid commands, maybe it returns an empty list or raises an error. The docstring doesn't specify, so I need to make an assumption. Let's assume it returns an empty list for invalid commands.

Now, how to structure the tests. Using the unittest framework, I can create a test class with setUp method to initialize the object under test. Then, write test methods for each scenario.

But wait, the actual implementation isn't written yet. So the tests will be based on expected behavior. However, without knowing the actual code, I need to make assumptions. Maybe the function is part of a class that has a dictionary mapping command names to their options. For example, self.command_options could be a dictionary where keys are command names and values are lists of options.

So, in the test, I can mock this dictionary. For example, in the test setup, I can create an instance of the class and set self.command_options to have entries for 'main', 'virsh', etc. Then, when get_parser_option_specs is called with those names, it should return the corresponding lists.

Now, writing the test code. Let's outline:

Test class: TestCommandParser

setUp method: initializes the object with a command_options dictionary.

Test methods:

test_get_parser_option_specs_valid_command: checks that valid commands return their options.

test_get_parser_option_specs_invalid_command: checks that invalid commands return empty list.

But since the actual code isn't written yet, the tests will be based on the expected structure. However, the user wants the code generated, so perhaps the tests are part of the answer.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD. So first generate the tests, then the code.

So first, the unit tests. Let me draft that.

Then, the actual implementation. The function needs to retrieve the options for the given command. Assuming that the class has a data structure (like a dictionary) that maps command names to their options. So, in the code, the function would look up the command_name in that structure and return the corresponding list, or an empty list if not found.

So the code would be something like:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self.command_options.get(command_name, [])

But to make this work, the class must have a command_options attribute. So in the __init__ method, perhaps it's initialized with some default values.

But the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, so I need to make assumptions. The tests will check that when command_name is present in the dictionary, the correct list is returned, and when not, an empty list.

So putting it all together, the code would include the tests and the implementation.

Wait, the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the answer should have the tests first, then the implementation.

But the user's example might have the tests and code. Let me structure it as such.

So the final answer would be:

First, the test code using unittest, then the actual method implementation.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me write the tests first.

For example:

import unittest

class TestCommandParser(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.parser = CommandParser()
        self.parser.command_options = {
            'main': ['--option1', '-o'],
            'virsh': ['--virsh-opt', '-v'],
            'ospd': ['--ospd-flag', '-s']
        }

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_valid_command(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('main'), ['--option1', '-o'])
        self.assertEqual(self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('virsh'), ['--virsh-opt', '-v'])
        self.assertEqual(self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('ospd'), ['--ospd-flag', '-s'])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_invalid_command(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('invalid'), [])

But this assumes that the CommandParser class has a command_options attribute and the get_parser_option_specs method.

Then, the implementation would be:

class CommandParser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.command_options = {}

    def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
        """
        Gets all the options for the specified command

        :param command_name: the command name (main, virsh, ospd, etc...)
        :return: the list of all command options
        """
        return self.command_options.get(command_name, [])

But wait, in the setUp method of the test, the command_options is set directly. However, in the actual class, maybe the command_options are initialized in __init__. So perhaps the test's setUp is modifying the instance's command_options.

But in the actual code, the CommandParser's __init__ may initialize command_options with some default values. However, for the test, we can set it to the desired values.

So the code generated would include the test class and the CommandParser class with the method.

But the user's original function is part of a class (since it has self as the first parameter). So the code should include the class definition.

Putting it all together, the generated code would be:

The test code using unittest, then the class with the method.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the answer should have the tests and the code.

But the user might not have provided the rest of the class, so the code will have to include the necessary parts.

So the final answer is:

```python
import unittest

class TestCommandParser(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.parser = CommandParser()
        self.parser.command_options = {
            'main': ['--option1', '-o'],
            'virsh': ['--virsh-opt', '-v'],
            'ospd': ['--ospd-flag', '-s']
        }

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_valid_command(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('main'), ['--option1', '-o'])
        self.assertEqual(self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('virsh'), ['--virsh-opt', '-v'])
        self.assertEqual(self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('ospd'), ['--ospd-flag', '-s'])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_invalid_command(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('invalid'), [])

class CommandParser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.command_options = {}

    def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
        """
        Gets all the options for the specified command

        :param command_name: the command name (main, virsh, ospd, etc...)
        :return: the list of all command options
        """
        return self.command_options.get(command_name, [])
```

But wait, in the test, the CommandParser is instantiated, and then command_options is set. However, in the actual __init__, command_options is initialized as an empty dict. So in the test, the setUp method is overriding it with the test data. That's acceptable for testing.

This should cover the cases. The tests check that valid commands return their options and invalid ones return an empty list. The implementation uses a dictionary to store the options and returns them via get with a default of empty list.
