Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_hierarchy method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what this method is supposed to do. The docstring says it validates the storage root hierarchy and returns the number of objects checked and the number of valid ones.

First, I should think about the parameters. The method has three parameters: validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings. The defaults are True, True, and False respectively. So, depending on these flags, the validation process might vary.

The return values are num_objects and good_objects. So the method needs to count how many objects were checked and how many of them were valid.

Now, considering test-driven development, I should write unit tests first. But the user asked for the code generation, so maybe they want the actual implementation. Wait, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. But the tips mention TDD, generating tests first. However, the user might just want the implementation here.

But the user's message says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps they just want the method's code, not the tests. But maybe they want both? The tips suggest generating tests first, but the main request is for the code. Hmm.

Wait, looking back, the user provided a function signature and docstring, and wants the code generated. The tips are for the assistant's approach, but the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should be the implementation of the validate_hierarchy method.

But how to implement it? Since there's no context about what the storage root hierarchy is, I need to make assumptions. Maybe this is part of a class that manages some storage structure, like a tree or a hierarchy of objects. The method might traverse the hierarchy, check each object's validity, possibly checking digests (like hash values) if check_digests is True. If validate_objects is True, it would check each object's properties.

So, the code would need to:

1. Traverse the hierarchy (maybe starting from a root node).
2. For each object, check if it's valid based on the parameters.
3. Count the total objects checked (num_objects) and the valid ones (good_objects).
4. If show_warnings is True, maybe log warnings when issues are found.

But without knowing the actual data structure, I need to create a skeleton. Let's assume that the class has a root attribute, and each object has methods to check validity and digests.

So, the code might look like this:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Traverse the hierarchy starting from root
    # For example, using a queue or recursive approach
    # Assume self.root is the starting point
    # For each object in the hierarchy:
    #   if validate_objects is True, check if the object is valid
    #   if check_digests is True, check the digest
    #   increment num_objects
    #   if valid, increment good_objects
    #   if show_warnings and issues found, log a warning
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is very abstract. Since the actual implementation depends on the data structure, perhaps the user expects a placeholder or a mock implementation. Alternatively, maybe the method is part of a specific library or framework, but without more context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to check the hierarchy's structure, like ensuring that parent-child relationships are correct, or that all nodes are properly linked. But again, without specifics, it's challenging.

Given that, perhaps the best approach is to write a skeleton that follows the parameters and returns the expected values, with comments indicating where the actual logic would go. That way, the user can fill in the specifics based on their actual data structure.

So the code would be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    """
    Validate storage root hierarchy.

    Returns:
        num_objects - number of objects checked
        good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
    """
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0

    # Example: Start traversing from self.root
    # This is a placeholder; actual traversal logic depends on the data structure
    # For demonstration, assume we have a list of objects to check
    objects_to_check = self.get_all_objects()  # Hypothetical method

    for obj in objects_to_check:
        num_objects += 1
        is_valid = True

        if validate_objects:
            # Check object validity (example: check if it has required attributes)
            if not hasattr(obj, 'required_attr'):
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} is missing required attribute.")

        if check_digests:
            # Check digest (example: compare hash)
            if not obj.validate_digest():
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for object {obj}.")

        if is_valid:
            good_objects += 1

    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is hypothetical. The actual implementation would depend on how the objects are structured and what validity checks are needed. However, given the lack of context, this is a reasonable placeholder.

Alternatively, if the method is part of a specific class (like a storage manager), the code might interact with a database or file system. But again, without more info, it's impossible to know.

So, the generated code would be a skeleton that follows the parameters and returns the correct values, with comments indicating where the actual checks would be implemented.
