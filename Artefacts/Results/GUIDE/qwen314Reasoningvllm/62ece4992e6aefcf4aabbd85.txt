Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the find_roots function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to find roots in a transitive hierarchy using an RDF graph. The example given is using RDFS.subClassOf, which implies that the roots are classes that don't have any parents, i.e., they are the topmost nodes in the hierarchy.

First, I need to understand the parameters. The graph is an RDF graph, prop is a URIRef like RDFS.subClassOf. The function should return all nodes that are roots, meaning they don't have any incoming edges via the given property. Wait, noâ€”wait, the triple is (child, prop, parent). So for RDFS.subClassOf, the triple is (subclass, subClassOf, superclass). So the roots would be those nodes that are not the child in any such triple. In other words, nodes that have no superclass. So to find roots, we need to find all nodes that are not the subject of any triple with the given property.

Wait, no. Wait, if the triple is (child, prop, parent), then the roots are the nodes that are not a child in any such triple. Because if a node is a child, it has a parent, so it's not a root. The roots are those that have no parents. So the approach would be: collect all nodes that are not present as the subject in any triple with the given property.

But how to do that in RDFlib? Let's think. The graph is an RDF graph. So for the given property, we can iterate through all triples where the predicate is prop. For each such triple, the subject is a child. So the roots are all nodes in the graph that are not subjects of any such triple.

But wait, maybe the graph contains nodes that are not part of any such triples. So the roots are the nodes that are not in the subject position of any (s, prop, o) triple.

So the steps would be:

1. Collect all nodes that are subjects of any triple with predicate prop. Let's call this set children.
2. Collect all nodes in the graph. Let's call this all_nodes.
3. The roots are all_nodes - children.

But wait, maybe the graph doesn't have all nodes in the universe. So perhaps the roots are those nodes that are not in the children set. But how to get all nodes in the graph? Well, in RDFlib, the graph's subjects, predicates, and objects can be accessed. But perhaps the function should consider all nodes in the graph, but maybe not. Wait, the example given is for RDFS.subClassOf. In that case, the roots would be classes that are not subclasses of anything. So, for example, if a class is not the subject of any subClassOf triple, then it's a root.

So the approach is: find all nodes that are not the subject of any triple with the given property.

So the code would need to:

- Iterate through all triples in the graph where the predicate is prop. For each such triple, add the subject to a set of children.
- Then, collect all nodes in the graph. But how? Because the graph might have nodes that are not in any triple as subjects, predicates, or objects. Wait, but in RDF, a node can be a subject, predicate, or object. However, if a node is not part of any triple, then it's not in the graph. So perhaps the roots are the nodes that are not in the children set. But how to get all nodes in the graph? Maybe the function is intended to consider all nodes that are in the graph, but perhaps the roots are those nodes that are not in the children set. However, if a node is not present in any triple (as subject, predicate, or object), then it's not part of the graph. So perhaps the function should consider all nodes that are in the graph (i.e., present in any triple) and are not in the children set.

Wait, but the function's docstring says that when called with RDFS.subClassOf, it returns all roots of the sub-class hierarchy. So in that case, the roots are classes that are not subclasses of anything. But in RDF, a class might not have any subClassOf triples, but it could still be part of other triples. However, the function's purpose is to find the roots in the hierarchy defined by the given property. So the roots are those nodes that are not the subject of any triple with the given property.

Therefore, the code can proceed as follows:

- Create a set of all subjects that have the given property as their predicate. These are the non-root nodes.
- The roots are all nodes in the graph that are not in this set.

But how to get all nodes in the graph? Well, in RDFlib, you can get all the nodes by iterating through all subjects, predicates, and objects. However, that might be inefficient, but for the purpose of this function, perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to return all nodes that are not subjects of any (s, prop, o) triple. So even if a node is present in the graph as an object or predicate, but not as a subject of the given property, it's considered a root.

So the code would:

- Initialize a set called children.
- Iterate through all triples in the graph where the predicate is prop. For each such triple, add the subject to children.
- Then, collect all nodes in the graph. But how?

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to return all nodes that are not in the children set. However, how to get all nodes in the graph? Because the graph may have nodes that are not subjects of any triple. For example, a node that is an object in some triple but not a subject. But in RDF, nodes are identified by their URIRefs or BNodes. So, perhaps the function should consider all nodes that are present in the graph, but how to collect them?

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to find all nodes that are not in the children set, regardless of whether they are present in the graph. But that doesn't make sense. Because if a node isn't in the graph, it's not part of the hierarchy.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

The roots are the nodes that are not the subject of any (s, prop, o) triple in the graph. So even if a node is present in the graph as an object or predicate, but not as a subject of the given property, it's considered a root.

But how to collect all nodes in the graph? Well, in RDFlib, you can get all the nodes by checking the graph's subjects, predicates, and objects. However, that's a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to return all nodes that are not in the children set, regardless of whether they are present in the graph. But that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return all nodes that are not in the children set, but are present in the graph. But how to get all nodes in the graph?

This is a bit of a problem. Let's think again. The example given is when prop is RDFS.subClassOf. In that case, the roots are the classes that are not subclasses of anything. So, for example, if a class is not the subject of any subClassOf triple, then it's a root. However, the class may be present in other triples, like as an object in a subClassOf triple (e.g., if another class is a subclass of it). But in that case, it's a superclass, not a subclass. So in that case, it's not a root. Wait, no. The root is a class that has no superclass. So if a class is a superclass of others but not a subclass of anything, then it is a root.

So, in that case, the function needs to find all nodes that are not the subject of any (s, prop, o) triple. So even if they are present in the graph as objects or predicates, but not as subjects of the given property, they are considered roots.

So the code would:

1. Iterate through all triples in the graph where the predicate is prop. Collect all the subjects into a set called children.

2. Then, collect all nodes in the graph. How?

In RDFlib, the graph's subjects, predicates, and objects can be accessed. So perhaps the way to get all nodes is to collect all the subjects, predicates, and objects from the graph. However, predicates are URIRefs, and subjects and objects can be URIRefs or BNodes.

But perhaps the function is intended to consider all nodes that are present in the graph, regardless of their role. So the roots are those nodes that are not in the children set.

But how to collect all nodes in the graph? One approach is to iterate through all the subjects, predicates, and objects in the graph and collect them into a set. For example:

all_nodes = set()
for s, p, o in graph:
    all_nodes.add(s)
    all_nodes.add(p)
    all_nodes.add(o)

But this would collect all nodes that are part of any triple. However, there might be nodes that are not in any triple, but that's unlikely. So, the roots would be all_nodes - children.

But then, the function's parameter 'roots' is optional. The docstring says that if provided, it's a set of nodes. But the function returns a set of nodes. Wait, the docstring says:

Args:
    graph: Graph Class Object
    prop: URIRef Class Object
    roots: Optional list with set type

But the function's parameters have roots as an optional argument. The docstring says that the roots parameter is optional. However, the function's return is a set of nodes. The initial code has the roots parameter as optional, but the function is supposed to return the roots. So perhaps the roots parameter is intended to be a set that the function will modify, but the function returns it. But that's unclear.

Wait, looking back at the function signature:

def find_roots(
    graph: "Graph", prop: "URIRef", roots: Optional[Set["Node"]] = None
) -> Set["Node"]:

So the roots parameter is optional. The docstring says that if provided, it's a set. But the function returns a set. So perhaps the roots parameter is intended to be a set that the function will populate, but the function returns it. However, the default is None, so if not provided, the function creates a new set.

But the docstring says that the function returns the roots. So perhaps the roots parameter is an output parameter. However, the function returns the roots set. So the function could be designed to allow the user to pass in a set to populate, but the function returns it. However, in Python, mutable objects are passed by reference, so modifying the set in the function would modify the passed-in set. However, the function returns the same set.

But perhaps the roots parameter is a way to allow the user to pass in a set to avoid creating a new one each time. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention this. The initial code may have a mistake here. Let me check the docstring again.

The docstring says:

Args:
    graph: Graph Class Object
    prop: URIRef Class Object
    roots: Optional list with set type

Return:
    roots: a set with nodes

So the function returns the roots set. But the roots parameter is optional. So perhaps the function is intended to return a new set if roots is None, or modify the provided set and return it.

But in the example given, find_roots(graph, rdflib.RDFS.subClassOf) returns a set of all roots. So the function should generate the set.

So, the code would:

- If roots is None, create a new set.
- Else, use the provided set.

But how to collect all nodes that are not in the children set. So the steps are:

1. Collect all subjects that are in triples with predicate prop. These are the non-root nodes.

2. Collect all nodes in the graph (as per the earlier approach).

3. The roots are all nodes in the graph that are not in the children set.

But how to collect all nodes in the graph? Let's proceed with the code.

So, code steps:

- Initialize children = set()

- For each triple in graph.triples((None, prop, None)), add the subject to children.

Wait, in RDFlib, the triples method can be used with a pattern. For example, graph.triples((None, prop, None)) would yield all triples where the predicate is prop. So for each such triple, the subject is a child.

So:

children = set()
for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
    children.add(s)

Then, collect all nodes in the graph. How?

all_nodes = set()
for s, p, o in graph:
    all_nodes.add(s)
    all_nodes.add(p)
    all_nodes.add(o)

But this may include predicates and objects. However, the function's example for RDFS.subClassOf would consider all classes that are not subjects of any subClassOf triple. However, in that case, the nodes could be classes that are objects in some triples but not subjects. For example, a class that is a superclass of another class (so it's an object in a subClassOf triple) but not a subclass of anything. In that case, it would be considered a root.

So, the code would proceed as follows.

Then, the roots are all_nodes - children.

But then, the roots parameter is optional. So if the user provides a roots set, we can update it with the result.

So:

if roots is None:
    roots = set()
roots.update(all_nodes - children)
return roots

Wait, but all_nodes is the set of all nodes in the graph. So the code would be:

def find_roots(graph, prop, roots=None):
    if roots is None:
        roots = set()
    children = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    all_nodes = set()
    for s, p, o in graph:
        all_nodes.add(s)
        all_nodes.add(p)
        all_nodes.add(o)
    roots.update(all_nodes - children)
    return roots

But this would collect all nodes in the graph, subtract those that are children, and add them to the roots set.

But wait, what if the graph is empty? Then all_nodes is empty, and roots would be empty.

But this approach may have some issues. For example, if a node is present in the graph as a predicate (like the prop itself), but not as a subject of the given property. Then it would be considered a root. But is that correct?

In the case of RDFS.subClassOf, the prop is RDFS.subClassOf. So if a node is the predicate (i.e., RDFS.subClassOf itself), then it's not a subclass of anything. So it would be considered a root. But that's probably not intended. However, the function's example may not consider that. But perhaps the function is intended to work with the given property, and the prop is part of the graph's predicates.

But the function's example says that when called with RDFS.subClassOf, it returns all roots of the sub-class hierarchy. So the RDFS.subClassOf itself is a predicate, but not a class. So perhaps the function is intended to consider only nodes that are classes, but the code as written would include all nodes in the graph.

This suggests that the code may need to filter out the prop itself. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention this. So perhaps the code as written is correct, but there's an edge case.

But given the information provided, the code should proceed as per the initial plan.

Now, considering the test-driven development approach. The user mentioned that I should generate comprehensive unit tests first. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code. But the initial tips mention that I should follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code, not the tests. But the user's initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The tips are for me to follow, but the output should be the code generated.

So perhaps the user wants the code for the find_roots function.

But let me think again. The code I wrote earlier may have a problem. For example, in RDFlib, the graph.triples() method returns an iterator. However, in Python, when you loop through graph.triples((None, prop, None)), you get all the triples where the predicate is prop. But what if the graph is large? However, for the purpose of this function, it's acceptable.

Another point: in RDFlib, the graph may have multiple triples with the same subject and predicate but different objects. But in this case, we only care about the subject, so adding it once is sufficient.

Now, the code:

def find_roots(
    graph: "Graph", prop: "URIRef", roots: Optional[Set["Node"]] = None
) -> Set["Node"]:
    if roots is None:
        roots = set()
    children = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    all_nodes = set()
    for s, p, o in graph:
        all_nodes.add(s)
        all_nodes.add(p)
        all_nodes.add(o)
    roots.update(all_nodes - children)
    return roots

But this code may have an issue. For example, if the graph is empty, all_nodes is empty, so roots would be empty. Which is correct.

Another test case: suppose the graph has one triple (A, prop, B). Then children is {A}. all_nodes is {A, B, prop}. So roots would be {B, prop}.

But in the case of RDFS.subClassOf, prop is RDFS.subClassOf. So if a node is the prop itself, it would be considered a root. But that's not correct, because RDFS.subClassOf is a predicate, not a class. However, the function's example may not consider that, but the code as written would include it.

But perhaps the function is intended to work with any property, not just class hierarchies. So the code is correct as per the given docstring.

Another possible issue: the all_nodes set includes predicates and objects. But in the case of RDFS.subClassOf, the roots are classes. However, the function's example may not require filtering out predicates. So the code is correct.

Another possible optimization: instead of iterating through all triples to collect all nodes, perhaps we can collect all subjects, predicates, and objects in a more efficient way. But for the purpose of this function, it's acceptable.

Now, considering the parameters: the function's roots parameter is optional. The code uses it as a set to update. However, the function returns the same set. So if the user passes in a set, it will be modified. But the function returns it. So the code is correct.

So the generated code is as above. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format. So the final code would be:

```python
def find_roots(
    graph: "Graph", prop: "URIRef", roots: Optional[Set["Node"]] = None
) -> Set["Node"]:
    """
    Find the roots in some sort of transitive hierarchy.

    find_roots(graph, rdflib.RDFS.subClassOf)
    will return a set of all roots of the sub-class hierarchy

    Assumes triple of the form (child, prop, parent), i.e. the direction of
    RDFS.subClassOf or SKOS.broader

    Args:
        graph: Graph Class Object
        prop: URIRef Class Object
        roots: Optional list with set type
    Return:
        roots: a set with nodes
    """
    if roots is None:
        roots = set()
    children = set()
    for s, p, o in graph.triples((None, prop, None)):
        children.add(s)
    all_nodes = set()
    for s, p, o in graph:
        all_nodes.add(s)
        all_nodes.add(p)
        all_nodes.add(o)
    roots.update(all_nodes - children)
    return roots
```

But wait, the code uses the 'graph.triples' method. However, in RDFlib, the triples method returns an iterator, and in Python, when you loop through it, you get the triples. However, the code may need to handle large graphs, but that's beyond the scope here.

Another thing to note: the 'all_nodes' set includes all subjects, predicates, and objects. However, in RDF, a node can be a URIRef or a BNode. The code handles them as per the 'Node' type, which is correct.

This should be the correct implementation based on the given function signature and docstring.
