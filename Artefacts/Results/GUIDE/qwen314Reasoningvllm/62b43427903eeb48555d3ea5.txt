Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'format' and it's part of a class, since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The parameters are 'sql' which is an AnyStr, and 'params' which is a Union of a Dict with keys being Union[str, int] and values of Any, or a Sequence of Any. The return type is a Tuple of AnyStr and the same Union type as params.

The docstring says that the function converts sql using self._converter.convert. So the main task is to take the sql and params, apply the converter, and return the converted sql along with the params. But wait, the params are part of the return tuple. So maybe the converter modifies the sql, but the params are passed through? Or maybe the converter also processes the params? The docstring isn't very specific.

Looking at the function signature, the return is a tuple of the converted sql and the params. So the params themselves aren't modified, just passed along. So the function's job is to take the sql, convert it using self._converter.convert, and return that converted sql along with the original params.

So the code would be something like:

converted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql)
return (converted_sql, params)

But I need to make sure that the types are handled correctly. The parameters are either a dict or a sequence. The converter might expect certain types. But since the function's job is just to pass the sql to the converter and return the converted sql with the params, the actual implementation is straightforward.

Now, the user mentioned that I should follow test-driven development, generating unit tests first. But the question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not the tests. Wait, the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated in Python markdown format. But the tips suggest to first generate tests. However, the user might want the actual code for the 'format' method, not the tests. Let me check the original query again.

The user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code for the 'format' function. The tips are just suggestions, but the actual code required is the method itself.

So the code would be:

def format(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
		"""
		Convert sql using self._converter.convert
		"""
		converted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql)
		return converted_sql, params

But I need to make sure that the types are imported. For example, AnyStr is from typing, as is Union, Dict, Sequence, Tuple, and Any. So the code should have the necessary imports. However, the user might expect that the code is written with the proper type hints, assuming that the required imports (like from typing import AnyStr, Union, etc.) are present. But in Python, the code would need to import those.

Wait, but the user provided the function signature with those types, so the code would need to have the proper imports. However, the user might not want the imports in the code, just the function. But in Python, the code would need to have the imports. However, the user's example doesn't include them. So perhaps the code is written with the assumption that the necessary imports are present.

But the user's code example shows the function signature with the types, so the code would need to have the imports. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is written with the type hints as given, and the actual implementation.

So the code would be as follows, with the function body converting the sql and returning the tuple.

Another thing to consider: the 'self._converter' must have a 'convert' method that takes 'sql' as an argument. The code assumes that this converter is already initialized as part of the class.

So the final code is as I wrote above. Now, I need to present it in Python markdown format, which would be triple backticks with python specified.

But I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted. Also, the function is part of a class, but the user didn't show the class definition. However, the code provided is just the method, so that's okay.

So the generated code would be:

```python
def format(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
		"""
		Convert sql using self._converter.convert
		"""
		converted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql)
		return converted_sql, params
```

But wait, in Python, the 'AnyStr' is from the typing module, as is 'Union', 'Dict', 'Sequence', 'Tuple', and 'Any'. So the code would need to have the appropriate imports. However, the user's function signature includes these types, so the code is written with the assumption that the necessary imports are present. Therefore, the code is correct as written.
