Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function generate_default_observer_schema based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to generate default observer schemas for Kubernetes resources in the spec.manifest where a custom schema isn't specified. 

First, I should think about what the parameters are. The function takes 'app' as an argument. I assume 'app' is some object that has a 'spec' attribute, which in turn has a 'manifest' attribute. The manifest probably contains Kubernetes resources.

The task is to check each resource in the manifest. For each resource, if there's no custom observer schema defined, generate a default one. But how are these schemas stored? Maybe each resource has an 'observer_schema' field. If that's missing or not custom, we need to generate a default.

So the steps might be:

1. Iterate over each item in app.spec.manifest.
2. For each item, check if it has an 'observer_schema' key.
3. If not present or if it's a default (maybe a flag?), generate a default schema.
4. Assign the generated schema to the item's observer_schema.

But how to generate the default schema? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the default is a simple schema like {"type": "object", "properties": {}} or something more specific based on the resource type.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where observer schemas are defined for different Kubernetes resources. The default might be a generic schema that applies to all resources unless specified otherwise.

But without more context, I have to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the assumption that each resource in the manifest is a dictionary, and we need to check if 'observer_schema' exists. If not, generate a default.

So, the code would look something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not resource.get('observer_schema'):
            resource['observer_schema'] = {
                # default schema here
            }

But what's the structure of the default schema? Maybe it's a simple schema that just validates the presence of certain fields. For example, a basic schema could be:

{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {},
    "required": []
}

But that's very generic. Alternatively, maybe the default schema depends on the resource's kind. For example, a Deployment has different fields than a Service. However, without knowing the specifics, the function might just create a generic schema.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a schema based on the resource's spec. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.

Another consideration: the function's name suggests that it's generating a schema for an observer, perhaps in a monitoring or observability context. Maybe the observer schema defines how to observe the resource's state. But again, specifics are unclear.

Since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, I'll proceed with a basic implementation that checks for the presence of 'observer_schema' and sets a default if missing.

So, the code would loop through each resource in app.spec.manifest, check if 'observer_schema' is present. If not, assign a default.

But what about the 'app' object? How is it structured? Let's assume that app is an object with a spec attribute, which has a manifest attribute that is a list of resources (dictionaries).

Putting this together, the function would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if 'observer_schema' not in resource:
            resource['observer_schema'] = {
                # default schema
                "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {},
                "required": []
            }

But maybe the default schema is more specific. For example, if the resource is a Kubernetes object, maybe the schema includes fields like metadata, spec, status. However, without knowing the exact structure, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the default schema is generated based on the resource's kind. For example, for a Deployment, the schema might include spec.replicas, etc. But again, without knowing the actual requirements, this is guesswork.

Given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to create a generic default schema that's empty, as above.

Now, considering test-driven development, the user wants unit tests first. But the initial request was to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the user's tip says to generate tests first. However, the user's main instruction is to generate the code, not the tests. Wait, the user says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the user wants the actual function code, not the tests. But the tip says to follow TDD, generate tests first. However, the user's main instruction is to generate the code, so perhaps the answer should be the function code.

But the user's example shows that they want the code generated, not the tests. So I'll proceed with writing the function code.

Another thing to consider: the function may need to modify the app's spec.manifest in place. So the code would iterate over each resource and set the observer_schema if it's missing.

So the code I wrote earlier seems reasonable. However, perhaps the 'observer_schema' is supposed to be generated based on the resource's type. For example, if the resource is a Deployment, the schema might have certain properties. But without more info, it's impossible to know.

Therefore, the code I wrote is a plausible implementation based on the given docstring.
