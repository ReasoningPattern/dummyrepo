Okay, I need to generate Python code for the deep_merge_nodes function based on the given docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it merges node values for duplicate keys. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, the function is supposed to handle merging dictionaries, but with some specific rules.

First, I should figure out what a "node" is here. The term "MappingNode" suggests that nodes might be objects that have a 'value' attribute, which is a dictionary. Or maybe the nodes themselves are dictionaries. But the problem mentions that if the values are not MappingNodes, the last one is kept. So maybe the nodes are objects that can be either mappings (like dicts) or other types. The function needs to merge them deeply, handling nested structures.

Let me think about the approach. For each node, if it's a MappingNode (like a dict), we need to merge its contents with others. If there's a key collision, and the value is not a MappingNode, take the last one. But if the value is a MappingNode, then we need to recursively merge them.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that the input is a list of nodes. Each node might have a value that's a dictionary. Or maybe the nodes themselves are dictionaries. The problem isn't entirely clear. But the function's parameter is 'nodes', which is probably a list of some objects. Let me assume that each node has a 'value' attribute that is a dictionary. Or perhaps the nodes are the dictionaries themselves. Maybe the function is supposed to take a list of dictionaries and merge them deeply, with the rule that for duplicate keys, if the value is a mapping, merge them recursively, else take the last one.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are objects that can be either mappings or other types. For example, if a node is a dict, then we need to merge its keys. If a node is not a dict, then it's a value that, if there's a collision, the last one is kept.

So the function's input is a list of nodes. Each node can be a Mapping (like a dict) or another type. The output is a merged structure where for each key, if all the nodes have mappings, they are merged recursively. If any node has a non-mapping value for a key, then the last occurrence of that key is kept.

Let me think about how to implement this. The function needs to process each node in the list, and for each key in the nodes, merge them according to the rules.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Iterate over each node in the nodes list.
2. For each node, check if it's a Mapping (like a dict). If it is, process its items. If not, treat it as a value that can be added to the result if there's no collision, or overwrite if there's a collision.
3. For each key in the current node, check if it's already in the result. If not, add it. If it is, then check the existing value and the current value.
   a. If the existing value is a Mapping and the current value is a Mapping, recursively merge them.
   b. If either is not a Mapping, then replace the existing value with the current value (since the last one remains).

But how do I handle the nodes? Are the nodes themselves the mappings, or do they have a 'value' attribute that is the mapping? The problem statement isn't explicit. Let me recheck the docstring: "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So the nodes have values, which are the things being merged. So perhaps each node has a 'value' attribute that is a dictionary. Or maybe the nodes are the dictionaries themselves. The problem is a bit ambiguous here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are objects that can be either mappings or other types. For example, if a node is a dict, then its keys are to be merged. If it's not a dict, then it's a value that, when there's a collision, the last one is kept.

But given that the function is called deep_merge_nodes, perhaps the nodes are the mappings (like dicts) themselves, and the function is supposed to merge them. So the input is a list of dicts, and the output is a merged dict.

Wait, the function's parameter is called 'nodes', which might be a list of nodes, each of which has a 'value' that is a dict. For example, in a scenario where nodes are objects with a 'value' attribute that is a mapping. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the problem says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, perhaps each node is either a MappingNode (which has a value that is a mapping) or a non-MappingNode (which has a value that is not a mapping). So, the function needs to process each node's value, and merge them.

But maybe the nodes themselves are the values. For example, the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and the function merges them. Let me proceed under the assumption that each node is a dictionary. Then, the function would merge them deeply, with the rule that if a key exists in multiple nodes, and the values are dictionaries, merge them recursively. If the values are not dictionaries, take the last one.

So, the function would take a list of dictionaries and return a merged dictionary.

Let me think of an example. Suppose nodes is [ {'a': 1}, {'a': 2, 'b': {'c': 3}} ].

The merged result would be {'a': 2, 'b': {'c': 3}}.

Another example: nodes is [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}} ] → merged as {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}.

Another example: nodes is [ {'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'a': 3} ] → merged as {'a': 3}.

But if nodes is [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': 2} ] → merged as {'a': 2}.

So the function needs to process each node in the list, and for each key, if the current value is a dict and the existing value is a dict, merge them. Otherwise, replace with the current value.

So the approach is to iterate through each node in the list, and for each key in the node, update the result accordingly.

Now, how to implement this in Python.

The function would start with an empty result dictionary. Then, for each node in the nodes list:

For each key in the node:

- If the key is not in the result, add it.
- Else, check if the existing value and the current value are both mappings (dicts). If yes, recursively merge them.
- If not, replace the existing value with the current value.

But how to check if a value is a mapping? In Python, we can check if it's an instance of dict, or perhaps a more general Mapping type (from collections.abc). However, the problem mentions "MappingNode", which may be a custom class. But since the problem doesn't provide that, perhaps we can assume that a MappingNode is a dict.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are objects that have a 'value' attribute which is a dict. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.

But given the problem statement, perhaps the nodes are the values themselves. Let's proceed under the assumption that the nodes are dictionaries. Then, the function is to merge them as per the rules.

So the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but this code would take each node (a dict) and merge into the result. However, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the code is using the same function recursively. But the function is supposed to take a list of nodes. Wait, in the code above, the recursive call is passing [existing, value], which are two dicts. But the function expects a list of nodes. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should take a list of nodes (each being a dict), and merge them all. The code above would work if each node is a dict. Let's test this with examples.

First example:

nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2, 'b': {'c': 3}}]

Processing first node: result is {'a': 1}.

Processing second node: key 'a' exists. existing is 1 (not a dict), value is 2 (not a dict). So replace with 2. Then key 'b' is added. So result is {'a':2, 'b': {'c':3}}.

Which is correct.

Another example: nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}]

First node: result is {'a': {'b':1}}.

Second node: key 'a' exists. existing is {'b':1} (dict), value is {'c':2} (dict). So call deep_merge_nodes([{'b':1}, {'c':2}]). Which would merge into {'b':1, 'c':2}. So the result becomes {'a': {'b':1, 'c':2}}.

Which is correct.

Another example: nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'a': 3}]. The result would be {'a':3}.

Another case where a node has a non-dict value and another has a dict. For example, nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': 2}]. The existing value is a dict, current value is 2 (non-dict). So replace with 2. Result is {'a':2}.

This seems to handle the cases.

But wait, the function's parameter is called 'nodes', and in the code, each node is a dict. But the original problem says that the nodes could have non-MappingNode values. So perhaps the nodes are not necessarily dicts. For example, a node could be a string, and in that case, when there's a collision, the last one is kept.

But how to handle that? Let me think again. The function is supposed to merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys. So perhaps each node is an object that has a 'value' attribute. For example, if the node is a MappingNode, then its value is a dict. If it's a LeafNode, its value is a string. Then, when merging, for each key, if the existing value and the current value are both MappingNodes, merge recursively. Otherwise, take the last one.

But since the problem doesn't specify the node structure, perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of dictionaries, and merge them as per the rules. But the original function's parameter is 'nodes', which may be a list of objects with 'value' attributes. However, without knowing the actual structure, perhaps the problem expects that the nodes are the values themselves. For example, the nodes are the dictionaries to be merged.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are objects, and each has a 'value' attribute which is the data to merge. For example, in a scenario where nodes are objects that can be either mappings or not. Then, the code would need to check if the value is a mapping.

But since the problem mentions "non-MappingNode values", perhaps the nodes are objects of a certain type. However, without knowing the actual classes, it's hard to code. But perhaps the problem expects that the nodes are dictionaries, and the 'MappingNode' refers to a dict.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are objects that can be either a Mapping (like a dict) or not. So, for example, if a node is a dict, then it's a MappingNode, and we need to merge its keys. If it's not a dict, then it's a value that, when there's a collision, the last one is kept.

So, the code would process each node in the list. For each node, we check if it is a Mapping (like a dict). If yes, then process its items. If not, then treat it as a value that can be added to the result.

Wait, but the function's parameter is 'nodes', which may be a list of nodes, each of which has a 'value' attribute. For example, in a scenario where nodes are objects with a 'value' attribute that can be a dict or other types. Then, the code would need to process each node's value.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, it's hard to code. However, the problem's docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, perhaps the nodes are objects that have a 'value' attribute. And when merging, for each key, if the existing value and the current value are both MappingNodes (i.e., their 'value' is a dict), then merge recursively. Otherwise, take the last one.

But this is getting too speculative. Since the problem doesn't provide the node structure, perhaps the intended solution is that the nodes are the dictionaries themselves. Therefore, the code I outlined earlier would be correct.

But then the function's parameter is called 'nodes', which may be a list of dictionaries. So, the code I wrote earlier would be correct.

But let's think about the test cases. Let's write some unit tests first, as per the tip.

For example:

Test case 1: merging two dicts with same key and non-dict values.

nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}]
Expected result: {'a': 2}

Test case 2: merging two dicts with same key and dict values.

nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}]
Expected result: {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}

Test case 3: merging with a mix of dict and non-dict.

nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': 2}]
Expected result: {'a': 2}

Test case 4: merging multiple nodes with nested dicts.

nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': {'c': 2}}}]
Expected result: {'a': {'b': {'c': 2}}}

Test case 5: merging three nodes with same key, non-dict values.

nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'a': 3}]
Expected result: {'a': 3}

So, the code I wrote earlier would handle these cases.

But the code as written would process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, merge into the result. However, the code as written would not handle the case where a node is not a dict. For example, if a node is a string, but according to the function's parameters, the nodes are supposed to be objects that can be merged. But if the nodes are not dicts, then node.items() would throw an error.

This suggests that the initial assumption that the nodes are dicts may be incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the nodes are objects that have a 'value' attribute, which is a dict. So, for example, each node has a 'value' attribute that is a dict. Then, the code would process that.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, it's hard to code. However, given that the problem mentions "non-MappingNode values", perhaps the nodes are objects that can be either MappingNodes (which have a value that is a dict) or other types. Therefore, the code should check if a node is a MappingNode, and if so, process its value, else treat it as a value.

But since we don't have the actual classes, perhaps the problem expects that the nodes are the values themselves. For example, the nodes are the values to be merged, and a MappingNode is a dict.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of dictionaries, and merge them as per the rules. Given that, the code I wrote earlier would work.

But then, the function's name is 'deep_merge_nodes', which suggests that nodes are being merged. So perhaps the nodes are objects with a 'value' attribute. For example, in a tree structure, where each node has a value (which can be a dict or other type). Therefore, the code would need to process each node's value.

But without knowing the actual structure, perhaps the problem is expecting that the nodes are the dictionaries themselves. So, proceed with that.

But then, the code I wrote earlier would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But this code would have a problem when the nodes are not dicts. For example, if a node is a string, then node.items() would throw an error. So, this suggests that the nodes are expected to be dicts.

But the problem's docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, perhaps the nodes are objects that can be either MappingNodes (which have a value that is a dict) or not. Therefore, the code should check if the node is a MappingNode, and if so, process its value. Otherwise, treat it as a value.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, this is speculative. However, perhaps the problem is using a simplified model where nodes are either dicts (MappingNodes) or other types. So, for example, if a node is a dict, then it's a MappingNode, and we process its items. If it's not a dict, then it's a non-MappingNode, and when there's a collision, we take the last one.

But how to handle this in the code? For example, if the nodes are a mix of dicts and other types.

Let me think of a scenario where nodes are a mix of dicts and other types. For example:

nodes = [ {'a': 1}, 2, {'a': 3} ]

In this case, the first node is a dict, the second is an integer, the third is a dict. The function should merge them. But how?

The function's docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, perhaps the function is supposed to process each node's value, where the node could be a MappingNode (with a value that is a dict) or not. But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard to proceed.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended solution is that the nodes are the dictionaries themselves. Therefore, the code I wrote earlier is correct. However, the function's parameter is called 'nodes', which may imply that they are objects, not dicts. But without more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the nodes are dicts.

Now, the code I wrote earlier has a problem: when merging, the function is called with [existing, value], which are dicts. But the function expects a list of nodes. However, in this case, the existing and value are dicts, which are the nodes. So, the function is called recursively with a list of nodes (each being a dict), which is correct.

But what if the nodes are not dicts? For example, if a node is a string. Then, node.items() would throw an error. So, perhaps the code should check if the node is a dict before trying to iterate over its items.

But the problem's docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, perhaps the nodes are objects that can be either MappingNodes (which have a value that is a dict) or other types. Therefore, the code should check if the node is a MappingNode, and if so, process its value. Otherwise, treat it as a value.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, perhaps the problem expects that the nodes are the values themselves, and the function is supposed to merge them. For example, the nodes are the values to be merged, and a MappingNode is a dict.

In that case, the code I wrote earlier is correct.

But then, the function's parameter is 'nodes', which may be a list of nodes, each of which is a dict. So, the code would work.

But let's think about the test cases again. For example, if nodes is a list of dicts, then the code works. But what if a node is not a dict? For example, nodes = [ {'a': 1}, 2 ].

In this case, when processing the second node (which is 2), node.items() would throw an error. So, the code would crash. But according to the problem's docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, perhaps the nodes are objects that have a 'value' attribute, and the code should process that.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, it's impossible to proceed. Given that, perhaps the problem expects that the nodes are the dictionaries, and the function is to merge them. Therefore, the code I wrote earlier is correct.

But then, the function's name is 'deep_merge_nodes', which suggests that nodes are being merged. So perhaps the nodes are objects, and each node has a 'value' attribute which is a dict. Therefore, the code should process each node's value.

So, modifying the code to:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        # Assuming each node has a 'value' attribute which is a dict or other type
        value = node.value
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            for key, sub_value in value.items():
                if key in result:
                    existing = result[key]
                    if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(sub_value, dict):
                        result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, sub_value])
                    else:
                        result[key] = sub_value
                else:
                    result[key] = sub_value
        else:
            # Handle non-MappingNode value
            # But how to handle this? Maybe the node's value is a single value, and if there's a collision, replace.
            # But this depends on the context.
            pass
    return result

But this is speculative. However, given the problem's docstring, perhaps the nodes are objects with a 'value' attribute, and the function is supposed to merge their values. But without knowing the actual structure, it's hard to proceed.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended solution is to assume that the nodes are dictionaries. Therefore, the code I wrote earlier is correct.

But then, the function's parameter is 'nodes', which is a list of dictionaries, and the code merges them.

So, the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But wait, in this code, the function is called recursively with [existing, value], which are dicts. But the function expects a list of nodes. However, if the nodes are dicts, then this is correct.

But what if the nodes are not dicts? For example, if a node is a string, then node.items() would throw an error. So, this code would crash. But according to the problem's docstring, non-MappingNode values are handled by taking the last one. So, perhaps the nodes are objects that can be either MappingNodes (which have a value that is a dict) or other types. Therefore, the code should check if the node is a MappingNode (like a dict), and if so, process its items. Otherwise, treat it as a value.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, it's hard to code. However, perhaps the problem is using a simplified model where the nodes are the values themselves, and a MappingNode is a dict. So, the code would be as written.

Now, to write the unit tests, as per the tip.

The unit tests would need to cover various cases:

- Merging two dicts with same key and non-dict values.
- Merging two dicts with same key and dict values.
- Merging with a mix of dict and non-dict values.
- Merging multiple nodes with same key.
- Nested merging.

But since the code assumes that nodes are dicts, the tests would use lists of dicts.

So, the unit tests would look like:

import unittest

class TestDeepMergeNodes(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_merge_non_dict_values(self):
        nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}]
        result = deep_merge_nodes(nodes)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'a': 2})

    def test_merge_dict_values(self):
        nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}]
        result = deep_merge_nodes(nodes)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}})

    def test_merge_with_non_dict_and_dict(self):
        nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': 2}]
        result = deep_merge_nodes(nodes)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'a': 2})

    def test_multiple_nodes_same_key(self):
        nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'a': 3}]
        result = deep_merge_nodes(nodes)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'a': 3})

    def test_nested_merge(self):
        nodes = [{'a': {'b': {'c': 1}}}, {'a': {'b': {'d': 2}}}]
        result = deep_merge_nodes(nodes)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'a': {'b': {'c': 1, 'd': 2}}})

But in the code I wrote earlier, when merging two dicts, the function is called recursively with [existing, value]. But existing and value are dicts. So, the function is called with a list of two dicts, which are treated as nodes. This would work if the nodes are dicts.

But what if the nodes are not dicts? For example, if a node is a string, then the code would crash. However, according to the problem's docstring, such cases are handled by taking the last value. But in the code as written, it would crash because node.items() would throw an error.

This suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the nodes are not dicts, but objects that have a 'value' attribute. For example, in a scenario where each node is an object with a 'value' attribute that is either a dict or other type.

In that case, the code would need to access node.value, and then process that. For example:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        value = node.value
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            for key, sub_value in value.items():
                if key in result:
                    existing = result[key]
                    if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(sub_value, dict):
                        result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, sub_value])
                    else:
                        result[key] = sub_value
                else:
                    result[key] = sub_value
        else:
            # Handle non-MappingNode value
            # But how? Perhaps the node's value is a single value, and if there's a collision, replace.
            # But this depends on the context.
            pass
    return result

But again, without knowing the actual structure of the nodes, it's hard to proceed. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the original code is correct under the assumption that nodes are dicts.

But the problem's docstring mentions "non-MappingNode values", which suggests that the nodes are of a certain type, and MappingNode is a subclass. For example, if the nodes are instances of a class that has a 'value' attribute, and MappingNode is a subclass that has a value which is a dict.

But without knowing the actual classes, it's impossible to write the code. Given that, perhaps the problem expects that the nodes are the values themselves, and the function is to merge them, treating dicts as MappingNodes.

In that case, the initial code is correct, but with the caveat that the nodes are dicts.

But the function's name is 'deep_merge_nodes', which implies that nodes are being merged. If the nodes are dicts, then the function is merging them.

Therefore, I'll proceed with the initial code, assuming that the nodes are dicts.
