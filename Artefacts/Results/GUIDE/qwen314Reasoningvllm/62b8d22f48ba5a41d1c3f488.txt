Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that popitem removes the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value as a tuple. 

First, I should think about what data structure this method is part of. The method is called on an object (self), so it's likely part of a class. The popitem method is commonly found in dictionaries, but in Python's dict, popitem() removes and returns a (key, value) pair. However, in Python 3.7+, dictionaries remember insertion order, so popping from the end would make sense. But the docstring here mentions the "first inserted key", which suggests that the method is removing the earliest inserted item, not the last. That's different from the standard dict's popitem, which removes the last inserted item.

Wait, so maybe this is a custom data structure, like an ordered dictionary that removes the first item when popitem is called. So the class probably maintains a list of keys in insertion order. When popitem is called, it removes the first key from that list and also from the underlying data structure (like a regular dict).

So, the class might have an __init__ method that initializes a regular dictionary and a list to track insertion order. For example:

class OrderedDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
        self.keys = []

Then, when adding items, they are added to both the data dict and the keys list. The popitem method would then remove the first element from the keys list, get its value from the data dict, delete it from the data dict, and return the key-value tuple.

So, the popitem method would look like:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.keys:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = self.keys.pop(0)
    value = self.data.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But wait, the original function signature doesn't have parameters, so the method is part of a class that has these attributes. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition. The task is to generate the code for the popitem method, but perhaps also the class?

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The given function is def popitem(self): ... So maybe the user expects that the code is part of a class, but the class isn't provided. However, the user might expect that the code is written in a way that fits into a class, perhaps an OrderedDict-like structure.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition. So maybe the code is supposed to be part of a class, but the user only wants the popitem method. However, without the class, the code wouldn't be complete. But perhaps the user expects that the code is written as part of a class, and the rest of the class is assumed.

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting that this is part of a custom dictionary implementation. However, the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is just the method, but that's not possible without the class.

Wait, but the user says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So the function signature is def popitem(self): ... and the docstring. So the code would be the method inside a class. But the user hasn't provided the class name or other methods. However, the user might expect that the code is written as part of a class, perhaps a custom OrderedDict.

But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, perhaps the code is supposed to be written as part of a class, but the rest is omitted. However, the user's instructions might be expecting that the code is written in a way that can be part of a class, and the method is implemented.

But the user also mentioned that they should follow test-driven development, generating unit tests first. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the popitem method based on the signature and docstring. So perhaps the answer is the code for the popitem method, assuming that it's part of a class that has the necessary attributes (like a data dictionary and a keys list).

But to make this work, the class must have these attributes. For example, the class might be something like:

class MyOrderedDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
        self.keys = []

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
        """
        if not self.keys:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key = self.keys.pop(0)
        value = self.data.pop(key)
        return (key, value)

But the user's original function signature is just def popitem(self): ... So the code would be the method inside the class. However, the user hasn't provided the class name or other methods, but the code is supposed to be generated based on the function signature and docstring.

So, the generated code would be the method inside a class. However, the user might not have provided the class definition, but the code is supposed to be written as part of a class. Therefore, the answer should include the class and the method.

But the user's instruction says to output ONLY the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the code includes the class and the method.

But the user's example might not have the class. However, the function signature has 'self', so it's a method of a class. Therefore, the code must be part of a class.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

class MyOrderedDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
        self.keys = []

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
        """
        if not self.keys:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key = self.keys.pop(0)
        value = self.data.pop(key)
        return (key, value)

But the user's original function signature doesn't include the __init__ method. However, the popitem method relies on the data and keys attributes, which are initialized in __init__.

But the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function signature is for popitem, so perhaps the code is just the method, but that's not possible without the class. Therefore, the code must be part of a class.

But perhaps the user expects that the code is written as part of a class, and the rest of the class is assumed. However, without the __init__ method, the code would not work. Therefore, the generated code should include the necessary parts of the class.

But the user might not have provided all the details. However, based on the given information, the code for the popitem method would need to access self.data and self.keys, which implies that the class has those attributes.

Therefore, the generated code would be as above.

Now, considering test-driven development, the user's tip says to generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the popitem method. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the answer is the code for the method, and the tests are not part of the answer. However, the user's tip mentions TDD, but the actual task is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the answer is the code for the method.

But the user might have expected that the code includes the class and the method. Therefore, the answer would be the class with the popitem method as described.

Another thing to consider is error handling. The docstring says that popitem removes the first inserted key. If the dictionary is empty, it should raise a KeyError. So the code checks if self.keys is empty and raises the error.

Therefore, the code should include that check.

So, the final code would be as I wrote above.
