Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function process_text_links based on the given signature and docstring. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so I should start by writing comprehensive unit tests first. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it processes links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links. So, the function probably takes a string with text that contains links, maybe in a specific format, and converts them into proper HTML links with additional attributes.

First, I need to figure out the expected behavior. For example, if the text has something like [Click here](http://example.com), the function should turn that into an anchor tag with href and maybe other attributes like target="_blank" or rel="nofollow".

But the problem is, the original function's implementation isn't provided. So I need to make assumptions here. Let's think about common link processing tasks. Maybe the function is supposed to find all markdown-style links and convert them to HTML, adding specific attributes.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Parse the input text to find all instances of textual links, like [text](url).
2. For each link found, create an HTML anchor tag with the href attribute set to the URL.
3. Add additional attributes as specified, maybe target="_blank" and rel="nofollow".
4. Replace the original markdown link with the generated HTML link.

Now, for the unit tests, I need to cover various cases. Let's think of test scenarios:

- Test case 1: A simple link in markdown format.
- Test case 2: Multiple links in the text.
- Test case 3: Text with no links should remain unchanged.
- Test case 4: Links with different formats, maybe with spaces or special characters.
- Test case 5: Ensure that the added attributes are correctly included in the HTML tags.

Wait, but how does the function detect the links? It might be using regular expressions. So I need to write a regex pattern that matches [text](url) and captures the text and URL parts.

For example, the regex could be r'\[(.*?)\]\((.*?)\)', which matches [text](url) and captures text and url.

Then, for each match, replace it with <a href="url" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">text</a>.

So the function would use re.sub with a lambda function to perform the replacement.

Now, writing the unit tests. Let's use the unittest module.

Test case 1: Input "[Click here](http://example.com)" should become "<a href='http://example.com' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Click here</a>".

Test case 2: Input with two links, like "Visit [site1](http://site1.com) and [site2](http://site2.com)" becomes "Visit <a ...>site1</a> and <a ...>site2</a>".

Test case 3: Input without links remains the same.

Test case 4: Links with special characters in the URL, like "[Test](http://example.com/path?query=1)" should be handled properly.

Test case 5: Ensure that the attributes are added correctly, maybe check for the presence of target and rel attributes.

Now, writing the code. The function process_text_links would use re.sub with a regex pattern and a replacement function.

But wait, the original function's parameters are just 'text', so the code would be something like:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    def replace_link(match):
        text = match.group(1)
        url = match.group(2)
        return f'<a href="{url}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{text}</a>'
    pattern = r'\[(.*?)\]\((.*?)\)'
    return re.sub(pattern, replace_link, text)

But maybe there are edge cases. For example, if the URL has quotes or other characters that need escaping. However, the problem statement doesn't mention handling such cases, so perhaps it's beyond the scope.

Now, the unit tests. Using unittest, I can create a TestProcessTextLinks class with methods for each test case.

But the user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD. So first generate the tests, then the code.

But the user's initial message says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips suggest first generating tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format.

Wait, the user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips suggest to first generate tests. However, the user might want the actual implementation code, not the tests. But the initial problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the implementation. However, the tips suggest TDD approach, so maybe the user expects both tests and the code?

But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The user might be expecting the implementation code, not the tests. However, the tips mention that the assistant should follow TDD, first generating tests. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, which might be the implementation code.

This is a bit confusing. Let me recheck the user's original message:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the function process_text_links. But the tips suggest to first generate tests. However, the user might not want the tests, but the actual code. However, perhaps the user wants the code that includes both the tests and the implementation. But the original function's code is to be generated, not the tests. But the tips say to follow TDD, which implies writing tests first. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the implementation code.

Hmm. Maybe the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the tips are just suggestions for the assistant's approach. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the assistant should generate the function code, not the tests.

But the user might have intended that the code includes both the tests and the implementation. However, the initial problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the implementation. The tests are part of the development process but not the code that the function is supposed to generate.

Therefore, I think the correct approach here is to generate the implementation code for process_text_links, based on the docstring, using the TDD approach in mind but outputting the actual function code.

So, the code would be as follows:

Importing re, defining the function with regex substitution, replacing links with anchor tags with added attributes.

So the code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    def replace_link(match):
        text_part = match.group(1)
        url_part = match.group(2)
        return f'<a href="{url_part}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">{text_part}</a>'
    pattern = r'\[(.*?)\]\((.*?)\)'
    return re.sub(pattern, replace_link, text)

But I should make sure that the regex is correct. The pattern r'\[(.*?)\]\((.*?)\)' captures the text and URL parts. The re.sub replaces each occurrence with the HTML anchor tag.

This should handle basic markdown links. However, there might be edge cases, like links with escaped brackets or other complexities, but the problem statement doesn't specify handling those, so this should suffice.

So the final code is as above.
