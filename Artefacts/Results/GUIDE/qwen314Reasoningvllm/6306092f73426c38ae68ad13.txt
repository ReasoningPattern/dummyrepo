Okay, I need to generate Python code for the ansible_playbook function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function does. The docstring says it wraps the 'ansible-playbook' CLI, so the function is probably meant to execute an Ansible playbook using the provided parameters.

First, the parameters: ir_workspace and ir_plugin are objects related to Infrared, which I'm not too familiar with, but maybe they provide some context or configuration needed for running the playbook. The playbook_path is the path to the playbook. The verbose parameter is the verbosity level, extra_vars is a dictionary of variables to pass, and ansible_args is a dict of additional arguments for ansible-playbook.

Since the user mentioned test-driven development, I should first think about writing unit tests. But the question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so maybe the user wants the actual implementation first. Wait, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips suggest writing tests first. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. Maybe the user wants the code that implements the function, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the user wants the implementation of the ansible_playbook function.

But how to implement it? The function needs to call the ansible-playbook CLI. So in Python, that could be done using subprocess module. But how to handle the parameters? Let's think about the parameters:

- ir_workspace and ir_plugin might be used to get the necessary configuration or environment variables. For example, maybe the workspace has a directory where the playbook is located, or the plugin provides some specific arguments.

But since the function's parameters include playbook_path, perhaps that's the full path to the playbook. However, maybe the ir_workspace is needed to resolve the path. But without knowing the specifics of Infrared's Workspace and Plugin objects, it's hard to say. So perhaps the function uses these objects to get the necessary context, like the project directory, or to load variables.

The verbose parameter is passed as the -v, -vv, etc. flags. The extra_vars is a dict that needs to be converted into --extra-vars key=value pairs. The ansible_args is a dict of arguments that are passed directly to ansible-playbook, like --tags, --skip-tags, etc.

So, putting this together, the function would need to construct the command line arguments for ansible-playbook, then execute it using subprocess.

But how to handle the ir_workspace and ir_plugin? Maybe they have methods to get the project directory, or to get variables. For example, maybe the ir_workspace has a method to get the project root, which is needed to resolve the playbook path. But without knowing the actual methods of these objects, it's hard to code. However, the function's parameters include playbook_path, so perhaps that's already the resolved path. Or maybe the ir_workspace is used to determine the working directory when running the playbook.

Alternatively, maybe the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used to get the Ansible configuration or other settings. But again, without knowing their exact structure, I have to make assumptions.

Assuming that the playbook_path is the path relative to the workspace, perhaps the function needs to construct the full path by combining the workspace's base directory with the playbook_path. But the parameter is called playbook_path, so maybe it's already the full path.

Alternatively, maybe the ir_workspace provides a method like get_playbook_path() or something similar. But since the function's parameter is playbook_path, perhaps it's the full path, and the ir_workspace is not directly used in that part. However, the ir_workspace and ir_plugin might be used to set up the environment, like setting environment variables or handling logging.

But given that the function's parameters include these objects, perhaps they are used to get the necessary context for running the playbook. For example, the ir_workspace might have a method to get the Ansible configuration, or to get the inventory, or to handle variables.

But since the user hasn't provided details about these objects, perhaps the implementation will use them in a generic way. For example, maybe the ir_workspace has a 'project_dir' attribute, and the playbook_path is relative to that. Or perhaps the ir_plugin has methods to generate the command line arguments.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger framework where these objects are used to manage the execution context, but for the purpose of writing the function, the actual implementation would involve using these objects to get necessary parameters.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to focus on the parameters that can be handled with the given function signature. Let's proceed.

The function needs to call ansible-playbook with the given playbook_path. The parameters include:

- verbose: which could be -v, -vv, etc. So if verbose is 1, then '-v', if 2, '-vv', etc. But the parameter is called verbose, which could be a boolean or an integer. However, the default is None, so maybe it's an integer indicating the verbosity level. For example, if verbose is 1, then add '-v' to the command.

- extra_vars: a dict. These need to be converted into --extra-vars key=value. For example, if extra_vars is {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, then the arguments would be --extra-vars "a=1 b=2" or split into separate --extra-vars for each key? Wait, no, Ansible allows passing multiple --extra-vars, but it's more common to pass them as a single string with space-separated key=value pairs. So the function would need to format the extra_vars into a string like 'a=1 b=2'.

- ansible_args: a dict of arguments to pass directly. For example, if ansible_args is {'tags': 'tag1', 'skip_tags': 'tag2'}, then the command line would be --tags tag1 --skip-tags tag2. So each key in the dict is converted into a command line argument, with the value as the argument.

So, the function would need to construct the command line arguments.

Putting this together, the steps for the function would be:

1. Construct the base command: ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]

2. Add the verbose flags. For example, if verbose is 1, add '-v'; if 2, add '-vv', etc. But how to handle this? The verbose parameter could be an integer, and we can add '-v' multiplied by the integer. However, the default is None, so if it's None, we don't add anything. But the parameter is called verbose, which could be a boolean. Wait, the parameter is described as "Ansible verbosity level", which could be an integer (like 0, 1, 2, etc.) or a boolean (like True for -v). But the default is None. Hmm, perhaps the verbose parameter is an integer, and if it's None, we don't add any verbosity flags. Or maybe it's a boolean, where True adds -v. But the docstring isn't specific. Since the parameter is named 'verbose' and the default is None, perhaps it's intended to be an integer, and if provided, add that many -v flags. For example, verbose=2 would add '-vv'.

But without more info, perhaps the code should handle it as follows: if verbose is not None, then add '-v' multiplied by the integer value. But if it's a boolean, then maybe check if it's True and add '-v'. However, the parameter's type isn't specified. So perhaps the code should check if verbose is an integer and handle accordingly. Alternatively, assume that it's an integer, and if it's None, skip.

But this is a bit ambiguous. However, the function's parameters include 'verbose=None', so perhaps it's an integer. For example, in Ansible, the verbosity is controlled by -v, -vv, etc., so the number of v's corresponds to the verbosity level. So, if verbose is 1, add '-v'; if 2, '-vv', etc. So the code can generate the appropriate number of '-v's.

Next, the extra_vars. If extra_vars is provided (not None), then we need to convert the dict into a string of key=value pairs. For example, if extra_vars is {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, then the string would be "a=1 b=2". Then, we add --extra-vars followed by that string. However, if the extra_vars is a dictionary, we can use the 'json.dumps' function to convert it into a JSON string, but that's not how Ansible expects it. Wait, no, Ansible's --extra-vars can take a key=value string, or a JSON file. But in this case, the user is passing a dict, so perhaps the function should format it as a space-separated string of key=value pairs. For example:

extra_vars_str = ' '.join(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in extra_vars.items())

But if the values are not strings, this could cause issues. However, the function's responsibility is to pass them as they are, assuming that the caller has properly formatted them. So the code would generate the --extra-vars argument with the formatted string.

Then, the ansible_args is a dict of arguments to pass directly. For each key-value pair in ansible_args, we add the corresponding command line argument. For example, if the key is 'tags', the value is 'tag1', then the argument is --tags tag1. So, for each key in ansible_args, we add the argument as --key value.

Now, putting all this together, the code would:

- Initialize the command list with 'ansible-playbook' and the playbook_path.

- Add the verbose flags if verbose is provided.

- Add the --extra-vars argument if extra_vars is provided.

- Add the arguments from ansible_args.

But how to handle the ir_workspace and ir_plugin? Maybe they are used to set the working directory, or to provide environment variables. For example, the ir_workspace might have a 'project_dir' attribute, and the playbook is executed in that directory. Or maybe the ir_plugin provides some configuration.

But without knowing the actual structure of these objects, perhaps the function uses them to get the necessary context. For example, maybe the ir_workspace has a method to get the inventory or other Ansible-related settings. However, since the function's parameters include these objects, but the docstring doesn't specify their use, perhaps the actual implementation will use them in a way that's specific to the Infrared framework. But since I don't have that information, I'll have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where these objects are used to manage the execution environment, but for the purpose of this code, they are not directly used in constructing the command line. However, that seems unlikely. The presence of these parameters suggests they are important for the function's operation.

Wait, the function's docstring says that ir_workspace is an Infrared Workspace object representing the active workspace. Maybe the playbook_path is relative to the workspace's directory. So, the function would need to resolve the playbook_path relative to the workspace's base directory. For example:

playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_path(playbook_path)

But again, without knowing the actual methods of the ir_workspace object, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the ir_workspace is used to set the working directory when running the playbook. For example, the function could set the cwd parameter in subprocess.run to ir_workspace.project_dir.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the command line construction, assuming that the playbook_path is already the correct path, and the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used for other purposes, such as setting environment variables or handling logging.

But how to proceed? Let's think about the function's purpose. It's a wrapper for the ansible-playbook CLI. So, perhaps the function is responsible for executing the playbook, using the provided parameters, and possibly using the ir_workspace and ir_plugin to get necessary configuration.

But without more details, perhaps the code will use the ir_workspace and ir_plugin to get the necessary context, such as the inventory, variables, etc. However, since the parameters include playbook_path, maybe the function is designed to run the playbook in the context of the workspace and plugin.

In any case, for the code, perhaps the function will use the ir_workspace and ir_plugin to get the necessary parameters, but since I don't have their methods, I'll have to make placeholders. However, the user probably expects that the code will use these objects in some way. For example, maybe the ir_workspace has a method to get the inventory path, or the plugin has methods to generate arguments.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where these objects are used to manage the execution, but for the purpose of this code, they are not directly involved in constructing the command line arguments. However, that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to call the ansible-playbook command with the correct environment variables set based on the workspace and plugin. For example, the ir_workspace might have environment variables that need to be passed to the subprocess.

But again, without knowing the specifics, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function needs to construct the command line arguments and execute it using subprocess, and that the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used for other purposes, such as logging or error handling.

So, the code would look something like this:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    # Construct the command
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    
    # Handle verbose
    if verbose is not None:
        cmd.extend(['-v'] * verbose)
    
    # Handle extra_vars
    if extra_vars:
        # Convert dict to space-separated key=value pairs
        extra_vars_str = ' '.join(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in extra_vars.items())
        cmd.append(f'--extra-vars={extra_vars_str}')
    
    # Handle ansible_args
    if ansible_args:
        for key, value in ansible_args.items():
            cmd.append(f'--{key}={value}')
    
    # Execute the command
    # Assuming ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used to set the environment or working directory
    # For example, set the working directory to ir_workspace's project directory
    # And use environment variables from ir_plugin
    env = ir_plugin.get_env()  # hypothetical method
    cwd = ir_workspace.project_dir  # hypothetical attribute
    
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, cwd=cwd, env=env, capture_output=True, text=True)
    
    # Handle the result, maybe raise exceptions if there's an error
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Ansible playbook failed: {result.stderr}")
    
    return result

But this is speculative. The actual implementation would depend on how the ir_workspace and ir_plugin objects are structured. However, since the user hasn't provided details, this is the best guess.

Another thing to consider is that the ansible_args is a dict of arguments to pass directly. For example, if the key is 'tags', the value is 'tag1', then the argument is --tags tag1. But in the code above, it's written as --key=value, which would be incorrect. Because Ansible's command line arguments are usually --option value, not --option=value. For example, --tags tag1, not --tags=tag1. So the code should split the key and value into separate arguments.

So, for each key in ansible_args, the code should append '--' + key, then the value. For example:

for key, value in ansible_args.items():
    cmd.append(f'--{key}')
    cmd.append(str(value))

This would generate --tags tag1 for a key 'tags' and value 'tag1'.

Similarly, for extra_vars, the code appends --extra-vars followed by the string of key=value pairs. So the code for extra_vars is correct as:

cmd.append('--extra-vars')
cmd.append(extra_vars_str)

Wait, no. Because in the previous code, it was written as:

cmd.append(f'--extra-vars={extra_vars_str}')

Which would create --extra-vars=... which is not the correct syntax. The correct way is to have --extra-vars followed by the string. So the code should be:

cmd.append('--extra-vars')
cmd.append(extra_vars_str)

So the code for extra_vars should be:

if extra_vars:
    extra_vars_str = ' '.join(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in extra_vars.items())
    cmd.append('--extra-vars')
    cmd.append(extra_vars_str)

Similarly, for ansible_args, each key-value pair should be split into two arguments.

So, correcting that part:

for key, value in ansible_args.items():
    cmd.append(f'--{key}')
    cmd.append(str(value))

This would generate the correct command line arguments.

Also, the verbose parameter: if it's an integer, then adding '-v' multiplied by the integer. For example, verbose=2 would add '-v -v'.

Putting all this together, the code would be:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None,
                     extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    """
    Wraps the 'ansible-playbook' CLI.

    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active
    workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :param playbook_path: the playbook to invoke
    :param verbose: Ansible verbosity level
    :param extra_vars: dict. Passed to Ansible as extra-vars
    :param ansible_args: dict of ansible-playbook arguments to plumb down
        directly to Ansible.
    """
    # Construct the command
    cmd = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    
    # Handle verbose
    if verbose is not None:
        cmd.extend(['-v'] * verbose)
    
    # Handle extra_vars
    if extra_vars:
        extra_vars_str = ' '.join(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in extra_vars.items())
        cmd.append('--extra-vars')
        cmd.append(extra_vars_str)
    
    # Handle ansible_args
    if ansible_args:
        for key, value in ansible_args.items():
            cmd.append(f'--{key}')
            cmd.append(str(value))
    
    # Execute the command
    # Assuming ir_workspace provides a project directory and ir_plugin provides environment variables
    # This is hypothetical and depends on the actual objects' methods/attributes
    cwd = getattr(ir_workspace, 'project_dir', None)
    env = ir_plugin.get_env() if hasattr(ir_plugin, 'get_env') else None
    
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, cwd=cwd, env=env, capture_output=True, text=True)
    
    # Check for errors
    if result.returncode != 0:
        error_msg = f"Ansible playbook failed with exit code {result.returncode}\n"
        error_msg += f"stdout: {result.stdout}\n"
        error_msg += f"stderr: {result.stderr}"
        raise RuntimeError(error_msg)
    
    return result

But this is still making assumptions about the ir_workspace and ir_plugin objects. For example, the code assumes that ir_workspace has a 'project_dir' attribute, and that ir_plugin has a 'get_env' method. These are hypothetical and may not be accurate. However, given the lack of information, this is the best approach.

Another thing to consider is that the function may need to handle the case where the playbook_path is relative to the workspace's directory. So, the code may need to resolve the path using the workspace's base directory. For example:

playbook_path = ir_workspace.get_path(playbook_path)

But again, without knowing the actual methods, this is speculative.

In conclusion, the generated code would involve constructing the command line arguments based on the parameters, using subprocess to execute the command, and handling the ir_workspace and ir_plugin objects in a way that's consistent with their expected usage in the Infrared framework.
