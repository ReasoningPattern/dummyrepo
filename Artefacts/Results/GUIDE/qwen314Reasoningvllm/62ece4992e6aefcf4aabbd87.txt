Okay, I need to create a Python function called build_app_logger based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is supposed to return an instantiated logger object. The parameters are name, logfile, and debug. The docstring mentions that it's for application logging, mainly for debugging. So, I should use Python's built-in logging module.

Let me recall how the logging module works. To create a logger, you typically use logging.getLogger(name). Then, you set up handlers, formatters, and levels.

The function needs to configure the logger with a file handler that writes to the specified logfile. Also, if debug is True, the logger should be set to debug level. Otherwise, maybe info level?

Wait, the debug parameter's description says "is need to debug". So probably, when debug is True, the logger's level is set to DEBUG, else maybe INFO or WARNING? The default is True, so by default, it's debug mode.

So steps for the function:

1. Create a logger with the given name.
2. Set the logging level based on the debug flag. If debug is True, set to logging.DEBUG, else maybe logging.INFO?
3. Add a FileHandler to the logger, pointing to the logfile.
4. Maybe set a formatter for the log messages, like including the timestamp, logger name, level, and message.
5. Add the handler to the logger.
6. Return the configured logger.

Wait, but what about existing handlers? If the logger already has handlers, maybe we should avoid adding duplicates. But the function is supposed to be general-purpose, so perhaps it's okay to add a new handler each time it's called. Or maybe check if the logger already has handlers and avoid adding again? Hmm, but the function is meant to be called once to set up the logger. Maybe the user is expected to call it once, so adding the handler each time might not be a problem. Or perhaps we should check to prevent multiple handlers.

But the problem says to generate the code, so maybe proceed without checking for existing handlers, assuming that the function is called once.

Now, let's outline the code.

Import logging module.

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    # set level
    if debug:
        logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    else:
        logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    # create file handler
    fh = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    # create formatter
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    # add handler to logger
    logger.addHandler(fh)
    return logger

Wait, but what about the console handler? The docstring says it's useful for debugging, maybe the user wants logs to both file and console? But the function's parameters don't mention a console handler. The current code only adds a file handler. Maybe that's okay, as per the given parameters.

But the original function's docstring says "The log file need to save" which implies that the logs are saved to a file. So the FileHandler is correct.

But wait, in the current code, if the logger already has handlers, adding another FileHandler would result in duplicate logs. But perhaps the function is intended to be called once, so that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe we should check if the logger has any handlers and avoid adding again. However, the function's responsibility is to configure the logger, so maybe it's better to configure it each time, but that might lead to multiple handlers. Hmm, but in practice, you usually configure the logger once. So perhaps the function is intended to be called once, and the code is okay.

Another thing: the logging module's getLogger returns a logger with the specified name. If the logger already exists, it returns the existing one. So if the function is called multiple times with the same name, the handlers might be added multiple times. To prevent that, maybe check if the logger has handlers and if not, add the handler. But the function's parameters don't have an option to control that. So perhaps the code as written is acceptable, but in practice, it's better to check.

But given the problem statement, maybe proceed with the code as outlined.

Now, the user also mentioned that the code should be generated with test-driven development, so first write unit tests. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown. However, the initial tips mention to generate tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code for the function. However, the user might have intended to have both the tests and the code. Wait, the original instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the tips mention TDD, but perhaps that's just a suggestion for the developer, not part of the required output.

So the answer should be the code for build_app_logger function.

Wait, but the user's message says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code for the function, not the tests. But maybe the user expects the code with tests? Let me check the original question again.

The user provided the function signature and docstring, and says to generate Python code based on them. The tips mention TDD, but the actual code to generate is the function. So the answer is the code for the function.

But perhaps the user made a mistake, but according to the problem statement, the answer should be the code for the function. So proceed with writing the function code.

But let me think again. The function's code as I outlined earlier may have an issue with multiple handlers. Let me check.

For example, if someone calls build_app_logger twice with the same name, the second call would add another FileHandler, leading to duplicate logs. To prevent that, perhaps check if the logger already has handlers. But how?

Maybe:

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    # Check if the logger already has handlers to avoid duplicates
    if not logger.handlers:
        # set level
        if debug:
            logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        else:
            logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        # create file handler
        fh = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
        # create formatter
        formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
        fh.setFormatter(formatter)
        # add handler to logger
        logger.addHandler(fh)
    return logger

This way, if the logger already has handlers (from a previous call), it doesn't add another handler. That's better practice. So this code would prevent multiple handlers.

But the original code didn't have that check. So including that check is better.

So the final code would include that check.

Another point: the default for debug is True, so the logger is set to DEBUG level by default. That makes sense for debugging.

So the code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    # Check if the logger already has handlers to avoid duplicates
    if not logger.handlers:
        # Set the logging level
        logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
        # Create file handler
        fh = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
        # Create formatter
        formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
        fh.setFormatter(formatter)
        # Add handler to logger
        logger.addHandler(fh)
    return logger

Yes, that seems correct. Now, the user's docstring says that the function returns an instantiated logger object. This code does that.

So that's the code to generate.
