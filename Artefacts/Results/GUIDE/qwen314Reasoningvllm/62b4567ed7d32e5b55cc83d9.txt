Okay, I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that merges nodes with duplicate keys. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. Hmm, first, I need to understand what a MappingNode is. Oh right, in YAML processing, MappingNode represents a dictionary. So, the function is probably dealing with nodes from a YAML structure, where each node could be a MappingNode (like a dict) or other types.

The task is to merge these nodes. For duplicate keys, if they are MappingNodes, we need to merge them recursively. But if the values are not MappingNodes, then the last occurrence of the key should be kept.

So, the approach would be to iterate through the nodes, and for each key, check if it's already in the result. If it's a MappingNode, merge them deeply. Otherwise, replace with the latest value.

Wait, but how are the nodes structured? Are they a list of nodes, each of which is a MappingNode? Or maybe each node is a dictionary-like structure with keys and values?

Assuming that each node is a MappingNode, which is a dictionary-like object. So, the function takes a list of nodes, each of which is a MappingNode. The goal is to merge them into a single MappingNode, combining keys. For each key in all nodes, if the value is a MappingNode, then recursively merge them. Otherwise, take the last occurrence's value.

So, the steps would be:

1. Initialize an empty result dictionary.
2. Iterate over each node in the input list.
3. For each node, iterate through its key-value pairs.
4. For each key, check if it's already in the result.
   a. If the existing value in the result is a MappingNode and the new value is also a MappingNode, then recursively merge them.
   b. Else, replace the existing value with the new one (since the last one takes precedence).

But how to check if a value is a MappingNode? Maybe there's a way to check the type. For example, if the value has a method like 'items' or is an instance of a specific class. But since the problem mentions MappingNode, perhaps we can assume that the nodes are instances of a class that has a way to check if they are MappingNodes. Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a YAML processing library, and MappingNode is a specific type.

But since the user hasn't provided that context, maybe we can assume that a MappingNode is a dictionary. Or perhaps the nodes are dictionaries. Let me think. The problem says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So, perhaps each node is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to merge them, with the rule that if two keys collide, and their values are both dictionaries, then merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last one.

So, for example, if we have two nodes: { 'a': 1 }, { 'a': 2 }, the merged result would be { 'a': 2 }.

If we have { 'a': { 'b': 1 } }, { 'a': { 'c': 2 } }, then merged result would be { 'a': { 'b': 1, 'c': 2 } }.

But if one of the values is not a dict, like { 'a': 1 }, { 'a': { 'b': 2 } }, then the merged result would have 'a' as the second value, which is a dict.

So, the function needs to process a list of nodes (probably dictionaries) and merge them according to these rules.

So, the code would be something like:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    # recursively merge
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    # take the last one
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but the function is supposed to take a list of nodes. But in this code, each node is a dict. But the original function's parameter is nodes, which may be a list of MappingNodes. So, perhaps the code is correct.

But wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the input is a list of nodes. Each node is a MappingNode. So, the code would need to process each node's items.

But how to handle the case where the nodes are not dicts? Well, the problem says that if the colliding keys have non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, the code checks if existing and value are both dicts (MappingNodes), and if so, merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last.

But in Python, the isinstance check would need to know what a MappingNode is. But since the problem didn't specify, perhaps the user expects that the nodes are dictionaries, and that MappingNode refers to a dict. Or maybe the nodes are objects with a specific type.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a YAML parser, and MappingNode is a class from the ruamel.yaml or PyYAML library. However, since the user hasn't provided that context, perhaps we should assume that the nodes are dictionaries, and that the check for MappingNode is done via isinstance(value, dict).

But the original docstring says "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So, if the existing value is not a MappingNode (i.e., not a dict), then we replace it with the new value. So, the code above does that.

But in the code above, the function is called with a list of nodes, each of which is a dict. So, for example, nodes is a list of dicts. Then, the code loops through each node, and for each key in the node, it checks if it's in the result. If so, and both existing and new value are dicts, then recursively merge them. Otherwise, replace.

But in the code, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and in the recursive call, we pass [existing, value], which are both dicts. But the function expects a list of nodes. So, perhaps the function is designed to take a list of nodes (dicts), and merge them. So, the code would work.

But wait, the initial call is with a list of nodes. For example, if nodes is [node1, node2, ...], each being a dict. Then, the code loops through each node, and for each key in the node, adds it to the result. But if two nodes have the same key, the later node's value will overwrite the previous one, unless both are dicts, in which case they are merged.

But in the code above, the function is written to take a list of nodes (each being a dict), and returns a merged dict. But the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that it's merging multiple nodes. However, the code as written would process all nodes in the list, merging their keys. But the way the code is written, the first node's keys are added, then the second node's keys are processed, and so on.

But what if the nodes are not dicts? Well, the problem says that the function is supposed to merge nodes, which are presumably MappingNodes. So, perhaps the code is correct.

But the problem says that the function returns the merged result. So, the code seems to do that.

But let's think of test cases. For example:

Test case 1: nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}] → result should be {'a': 2}.

Test case 2: nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}] → result is {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}.

Test case 3: nodes = [{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 3}}, {'a': {'d': 4}, 'b': {'c': 5}}] → result is {'a': {'d':4}, 'b': {'c':5}}.

Wait, no. Because in the first node, 'a' is 1 (not a dict), and in the second node, 'a' is a dict. So, when processing the second node's 'a' key, since existing value is 1 (non-dict), it will be replaced by the new value (dict). So the merged result for 'a' is the dict from the second node.

Another test case: nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2}}] → merged 'a' is {'b': 2}.

But in the code, when merging, the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So, the code calls deep_merge_nodes([existing, value]). Wait, but the function is supposed to take a list of nodes. So, in this case, existing is a dict (from the first node's 'a' key), and value is a dict (from the second node's 'a' key). So, the code would call deep_merge_nodes([existing, value]), which would be a list of two dicts. Then, the function would process those two dicts, merging them. Which would result in {'b': 2}.

So, the code seems to handle that.

But in the code, the function is written as def deep_merge_nodes(nodes): ... which takes a list of nodes (dicts). So, when merging two dicts (existing and value), we pass them as a list to the same function. That makes sense.

But what about when there are more than two nodes? For example, nodes = [node1, node2, node3]. The code processes each node in order, and for each key, the later nodes overwrite the earlier ones unless they are both dicts. So, the code should handle that.

But what if the nodes are not dicts? For example, if a node is a list or a string. Well, according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to merge nodes, which are presumably MappingNodes. So, perhaps the function is designed to work with nodes that are either MappingNodes (dicts) or other types. But the code checks if the existing and new value are both dicts. If not, the last one is taken.

So, the code seems correct.

Now, the user wants the code to be generated, but also to follow test-driven development. So, first generate the unit tests, then the code.

But the user says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. However, the tips suggest to first generate tests. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. But the user also says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format.

But the initial problem says that the user is a Python software engineer and wants to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So, perhaps the answer is to write the code for the function, not the tests.

But the tips mention test-driven development, but the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So, perhaps the answer is the code for the function, not the tests.

But the user's instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the code for the function.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But wait, what if the nodes are not dicts? For example, if a node is not a dict, then node.items() would throw an error. So, perhaps the function assumes that all nodes are MappingNodes (dicts). So, the code is correct under that assumption.

But the problem says that the function is supposed to merge nodes, which are presumably MappingNodes. So, the code is okay.

But the problem says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, in the code, if existing is not a dict, or value is not a dict, then the last one is taken.

But in the code, the check is if both existing and value are dicts. If not, then replace with the new value. So, that's correct.

So, this code should work.
