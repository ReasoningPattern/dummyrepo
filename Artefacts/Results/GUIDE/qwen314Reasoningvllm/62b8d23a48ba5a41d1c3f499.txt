Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that this method removes and returns the least recently used (key, value) pair. That makes me think this is part of an LRU cache implementation.

First, I should figure out what class this method belongs to. Since popitem is a method that's removing the least recently used item, it's likely part of a class that manages a cache, like an LRU cache. So maybe the class is something like LRUCache, and this method is part of that class.

Now, the function signature is def popitem(self):. So the method doesn't take any parameters other than self. The return type should be a tuple of (key, value).

But wait, in Python's standard library, there's an OrderedDict which has a popitem method that can remove the least recently used item when using the move_to_end method. However, the standard OrderedDict's popitem method by default removes the last inserted item, but with the last=True parameter. Wait, maybe the user is expecting an LRU cache implementation here.

So, perhaps the class has a dictionary to store the items and a way to track the usage order. For an LRU cache, when an item is accessed, it's marked as recently used. The least recently used item is the one that hasn't been accessed for the longest time.

To implement popitem, the method needs to find the least recently used item. So the class might have a doubly linked list or some structure to track the order of usage. Alternatively, it could use an OrderedDict, which maintains insertion order, but for LRU, we need to move items to the end when they are accessed.

Wait, maybe the class uses an OrderedDict where each time an item is accessed (get or set), it's moved to the end, making it the most recently used. Then, when popitem is called, it removes the first item (the least recently used).

So, if the class uses an OrderedDict, then popitem would be something like:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.cache:
        raise KeyError('cache is empty')
    key, value = self.cache.popitem(last=False)
    return key, value

But wait, the standard OrderedDict's popitem with last=False removes the first inserted item. However, in an LRU cache, when you access an item, you move it to the end, so the first item is the LRU. So that makes sense.

But the user's function signature is for a method called popitem in a class. So the code would be part of a class that has an OrderedDict as its cache.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition. So perhaps the code is part of a class that's implementing an LRU cache. However, the user only provided the popitem method's signature and docstring.

But the user wants me to generate the code for the popitem method. However, without knowing the rest of the class, maybe I need to assume that the class has an OrderedDict or some structure that allows tracking of LRU items.

Alternatively, maybe the class is using a combination of a dictionary and a deque or another structure to track the order.

But given that the user's docstring says "least recently used", I think the intended approach is to use an OrderedDict where each access moves the item to the end, and popitem removes the first item.

So, the code for the popitem method would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
    """
    if not self.cache:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): cache is empty')
    key, value = self.cache.popitem(last=False)
    return key, value

But this assumes that the class has an attribute called 'cache' which is an OrderedDict. However, the user hasn't provided that context. But since the user only asked for the popitem method, perhaps the rest of the class is already in place, and this method is part of it.

But the user might be expecting a more complete implementation. However, the question says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the code is part of a class that's already defined, and the user wants the popitem method.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition. So perhaps the code is part of a class that uses an OrderedDict. However, without knowing the rest of the class, maybe I need to write the method as part of a class.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is def popitem(self):, which implies that it's a method of a class. So I need to create a class that includes this method.

But the user hasn't provided any other context. So perhaps I should create a class, say LRUCache, which has a popitem method as described.

But the problem is that the user might expect the code to be part of an existing class. However, given the information provided, I need to generate the code for the method.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the code is part of a class that uses an OrderedDict. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting a standalone function, but that doesn't make sense because popitem is a method.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self.cache:
            raise KeyError('cache is empty')
        return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But the user hasn't provided the __init__ method or the rest of the class. However, the user's question is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function signature is for the popitem method. So perhaps the user expects the code for that method, assuming that the class has the necessary attributes.

But the user might not have provided the full context. However, the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code would be the method itself, possibly within a class.

But the user's example shows the function signature as def popitem(self):, which is a method. So the code should be part of a class.

But without knowing the class name or other attributes, perhaps the code is part of a class that has an OrderedDict as self.cache.

But given that the user hasn't provided that context, perhaps the code should be written as a method inside a class, assuming that the class has an OrderedDict or similar structure.

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the code for a custom implementation without using OrderedDict. For example, using a dictionary and a deque to track the order.

But that would be more complex. However, given that the user's docstring says "least recently used", and the method is named popitem, which is similar to OrderedDict's popitem, perhaps the intended solution is to use OrderedDict.

So, the code would be:

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self.maxsize = maxsize
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self.cache:
            raise KeyError('cache is empty')
        return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But the user hasn't mentioned the __init__ method. However, the user's question is to generate the code for the popitem method. So the code would be the method inside the class.

But the user might not have provided the full class, so perhaps the code is just the method, assuming that the class has the necessary attributes.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be the method as part of a class. However, the user might not have provided the class name. But in Python, the class name is arbitrary. So perhaps the code is:

class SomeClass:
    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        # implementation here

But without knowing the implementation details, how to proceed?

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting the code to be part of a class that uses a dictionary and a list to track the order. For example:

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}
        self.order = []

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self.cache:
            raise KeyError('cache is empty')
        key = self.order.pop(0)
        value = self.cache.pop(key)
        return key, value

But this is a simplified version. However, this approach would have O(n) time complexity for popitem, which is not efficient for large caches. However, the user's question doesn't specify performance requirements.

But the original problem is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that popitem removes the least recently used item. So the code needs to implement that.

But without knowing the internal structure of the class, it's challenging. However, given that the user provided only the method signature and docstring, perhaps the code is expected to use an OrderedDict, as that's a standard way to implement LRU caches.

Therefore, the code would be:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self.maxsize = maxsize
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self.cache:
            raise KeyError('cache is empty')
        return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But the user's question says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. However, the user might not have provided the class definition. But the function signature is part of a class, so the code must be part of a class.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be the method inside a class. However, the user might not have provided the class name or other parts. But given that, I need to generate the method.

But the user's example shows the function signature as def popitem(self):, so the code would be:

class LRUCache:
    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        # implementation here

But without knowing the internal structure, how to implement it? The answer depends on the assumptions made.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is expecting a test-driven approach as per the tips. The tips say to generate comprehensive unit tests first before writing the actual code. However, the user's question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, and the tips are for the user to follow, but the user is asking for the code.

But the user's question says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the popitem method, which is part of a class. Assuming that the class uses an OrderedDict, the code would be as I mentioned before.

But perhaps the user expects that the code is part of a class that has a cache attribute, and the popitem method removes the LRU item.

Therefore, the final code would be:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self.maxsize = maxsize
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self.cache:
            raise KeyError('cache is empty')
        return self.cache.popitem(last=False)
```

But the user's function signature doesn't include parameters. The __init__ method is not part of the given function signature. However, the user's question is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The given function signature is for the popitem method, so the code for that method is needed.

But the code for the method depends on the class's attributes. So the code for the method would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
    """
    if not self.cache:
        raise KeyError('cache is empty')
    return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But this assumes that self.cache is an OrderedDict. However, the user hasn't provided that context. But given the function signature and docstring, this is the most logical approach.

So the code would be part of a class that has a cache attribute, which is an OrderedDict.

Therefore, the final answer is the code for the popitem method as part of a class, using OrderedDict.
