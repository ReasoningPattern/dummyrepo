Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called get_nested_custom_and_control_args that takes a list of args and splits them into control, nested, and custom arguments. The return is two dicts: control_args and nested_args. Wait, the docstring says it returns (control_args, nested_args), but mentions custom arguments as well. Hmm, maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait the docstring says: Control arguments are for IR behavior and not put into the spec yml. Nested are used by Ansible playbooks and go into the spec. Custom are custom ansible variables instead of normal nested usage. So maybe the function needs to separate control args, nested args, and custom args. But the return is two dicts: control and nested. Where do the custom args fit in?

Wait the return is (control_args, nested_args). But the docstring mentions custom arguments. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and the rest, where the rest are split into nested and custom. But the return is only two dicts. Maybe the custom args are considered part of the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to separate control args, and then split the remaining into nested and custom. But the return is only two dicts. The docstring says the return is (control_args, nested_args), but the custom args are mentioned as a separate category. Maybe there's a mistake in the docstring, or perhaps the custom args are part of the nested_args. Or maybe the function is supposed to return control_args, nested_args, and custom_args, but the docstring says two dicts. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait looking back at the function signature: the return is (dict, dict): flat dicts (control_args, nested_args). So the function returns two dicts. The docstring mentions custom arguments as a separate category. But how are they handled? Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and the rest, and then the rest are split into nested and custom. But the return is only two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. Or perhaps the custom arguments are not part of the return, but the docstring is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the input args into control arguments (which are not put into the spec) and the rest, which are split into nested (for spec) and custom (for ansible variables). But the return is only two dicts. So perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom args. But that doesn't fit the docstring.

Alternatively, perhaps the custom arguments are a subset of the nested arguments. For example, nested arguments are those that are used by Ansible playbooks and go into the spec, but some of them are custom variables. Wait, the docstring says: "Custom arguments: Custom ansible variables to be used instead of the normal nested usage." So maybe the custom arguments are not part of the nested ones. So the function needs to split the args into three categories: control, nested, and custom. But the return is only two dicts. That's conflicting.

Wait maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control arguments and the rest, which are then split into nested and custom. But the return is only two dicts. So maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom. But the docstring says that nested arguments are used by Ansible and put into the spec, while custom are used instead of normal nested. So perhaps custom arguments are a separate category from nested. Therefore, the function should return three dicts, but the docstring says two. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested arguments. For example, when you have a custom argument, it's a nested argument but with a specific flag. But the problem is that the function's return is only two dicts. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control_args and the rest (which are split into nested and custom), but the return is only two dicts. Maybe the custom args are part of the nested_args. Or perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom args are part of the nested_args. But then the docstring mentions custom args as a separate category. This is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control arguments (which are not in the spec) and the rest, which are split into nested (for spec) and custom (for ansible variables). But the return is only two dicts. So maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. Or perhaps the custom arguments are not part of the return. But the docstring says that custom arguments are to be used instead of the normal nested usage. So perhaps the custom arguments are a subset of the nested arguments, but with a different handling. However, the function's return is only two dicts. Therefore, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom args are part of the nested_args. But then how to differentiate them? Maybe the custom args are identified by a certain prefix or key.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the input args into control and non-control, and then the non-control are split into nested and custom. But since the return is two dicts, maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. But then the docstring says that custom args are used instead of the normal nested usage. So maybe the function is supposed to separate control arguments, and then for the rest, split into nested and custom. However, the return is only two dicts, so perhaps the custom args are part of the nested_args. But that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom args. But that would not align with the docstring's description. 

This is a bit of a problem. The function's docstring mentions three categories: control, nested, and custom. But the return is two dicts. Maybe the docstring is incorrect, or perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom arguments are not part of the return. But the docstring says that custom arguments are to be used instead of the normal nested usage, implying they are separate. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom args are part of the nested. But that's not clear. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps I should look for hints in the parameters. The function takes a list of args. How are these args structured? Are they key-value pairs? For example, perhaps each arg is a dictionary with keys like 'name', 'value', 'type', etc. Or perhaps the args are a list of strings, and the function needs to parse them based on some conventions. 

Alternatively, maybe the args are a dictionary, and the function splits the keys into control, nested, and custom. But the parameter is a list, not a dict. 

Wait, the function is called get_nested_custom_and_control_args, and the parameter is a list of args. So perhaps each element in args is a dictionary representing an argument. For example, each arg might have a 'type' field indicating whether it's a control, nested, or custom argument. 

But without more information, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args based on prefixes. For example, arguments starting with '--control-' are control arguments, those starting with '--nested-' are nested, and those with '--custom-' are custom. But the docstring doesn't mention this, so that's an assumption. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger system where certain keys are designated as control, nested, or custom. For example, in the args, certain keys are marked as control, others as nested, and others as custom. 

Since the problem is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the actual implementation details are not provided, and the code needs to be written with some assumptions. 

Given that, perhaps the function is supposed to process the args list, which contains dictionaries, and split them into control, nested, and custom based on some criteria. 

But since the return is only two dicts (control_args and nested_args), maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. Or perhaps the custom arguments are not part of the return. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom arguments. But that doesn't align with the docstring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and the rest, and the rest are split into nested and custom. But since the return is two dicts, maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. 

But without more information, it's challenging. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps I should make an assumption. For example, the function may process the args list, which is a list of dictionaries, and for each arg, determine if it's a control argument (based on some key), and then the rest are either nested or custom. But again, without knowing the structure of the args, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a system where certain parameters are designated as control, nested, or custom based on their names. For example, arguments that start with 'control_' are control arguments, those with 'nested_' are nested, and 'custom_' are custom. But again, this is an assumption. 

Assuming that, the function could iterate over the args, check for prefixes, and split them accordingly. However, since the function returns two dicts (control and nested), maybe the custom arguments are not part of the return. But the docstring says that custom arguments are to be used instead of the normal nested usage, which suggests they are separate. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom args. But that would not make sense with the docstring. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. For example, the nested_args include both normal nested arguments and custom ones. But the docstring says that custom are used instead of the normal nested usage. 

This is quite confusing. Given that, perhaps the function is supposed to separate control arguments from the rest, and then the rest are split into nested and custom. However, the return is only two dicts, so maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. But that's not clear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom arguments are not part of the return. But the docstring mentions them, which is conflicting. 

Given the lack of information, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. Or perhaps the custom arguments are not part of the return, and the docstring has a mistake. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return three dicts, but the docstring is wrong. However, the user provided the function signature and docstring, so I have to work with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control, nested, and custom, but the return is only two dicts, which suggests that the custom arguments are part of the nested. 

In any case, given the ambiguity, perhaps the code can be written to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are not part of the return. But that would not align with the docstring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom. But again, without knowing the structure of the args, it's hard to proceed. 

Perhaps I should look for examples or think of a possible implementation. For example, if the args are a list of dictionaries, each with a 'type' key indicating whether it's control, nested, or custom. Then, the function would iterate over each arg, check the type, and add to the appropriate dict. 

But since the function returns two dicts, perhaps the custom arguments are not part of the return. But the docstring says they are. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. So for example, when an argument is marked as custom, it's added to the nested_args. 

But again, without knowing the structure of the args, it's hard to proceed. 

Perhaps the function is supposed to split the args based on some naming convention. For example, arguments that start with 'control_' are control arguments, those that start with 'nested_' are nested, and those with 'custom_' are custom. Then, the function would split them accordingly. 

Assuming that, the code could be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    custom_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        # assuming each arg is a dict with 'name' and 'value'
        name = arg['name']
        if name.startswith('control_'):
            control_args[name] = arg['value']
        elif name.startswith('custom_'):
            custom_args[name] = arg['value']
        else:
            nested_args[name] = arg['value']
    # But the return is (control_args, nested_args), so custom_args are not returned?
    # But the docstring says they are custom arguments. So perhaps this is incorrect.

But the return is (control_args, nested_args). So in this case, the custom arguments are not part of the return. Which contradicts the docstring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. So in the code above, the 'custom_' args are added to nested_args. But then the docstring says that custom are used instead of normal nested. 

This is getting too stuck. Maybe I should proceed with writing code that splits the args into control and nested, assuming that the custom arguments are part of the nested. Or perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes both the normal nested and custom arguments, and the custom arguments are identified by some other means. 

Given that the user provided the function signature and docstring, but no examples, I have to make assumptions. 

Another approach: the function is supposed to return two dicts, control_args and nested_args. The custom arguments are not part of the return, but the docstring mentions them. This might be a mistake in the docstring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom. But the docstring says that nested arguments are put into the spec, and custom are used instead of normal nested. So maybe the custom arguments are not put into the spec, but are used in Ansible. 

But the return is only two dicts. 

At this point, perhaps the best approach is to write code that splits the args into control and nested, assuming that the custom arguments are part of the nested. For example, the function could process the args and separate those that are control arguments (based on some criteria) and the rest are nested. 

But without knowing the criteria, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, where control arguments are those that are not to be put into the spec, and nested are those that are. The custom arguments are a subset of the nested arguments. 

But again, without knowing how to identify them, it's challenging. 

Perhaps the function is part of a system where certain parameters are marked as control, and the rest are nested. For example, if an argument has a 'control' key set to True, it's a control argument. 

Assuming that, the code could be:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        if arg.get('control', False):
            control_args[arg['name']] = arg['value']
        else:
            nested_args[arg['name']] = arg['value']
    return control_args, nested_args

But this doesn't account for custom arguments. However, the docstring mentions them, but the return is only two dicts. 

Alternatively, perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, and the function returns them as such. 

In this case, the code would be as above, and the custom arguments are considered part of the nested_args. 

But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested usage. So maybe they are a subset of the nested_args. 

Given that, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. 

In this case, the code would be as above, and the custom arguments are included in nested_args. 

But the docstring says that custom arguments are separate. 

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, perhaps I should proceed with writing code that splits the args into control and nested, assuming that the custom arguments are part of the nested, and the function returns those two dicts. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and a dict that includes both nested and custom arguments. But again, without more info, it's hard. 

Another possibility: the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes both the normal nested arguments and the custom ones. The custom arguments are identified by some other means, like a flag. But the code would need to know how to separate them. 

In the absence of more information, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that separates control arguments from the rest, and the rest are considered nested. The custom arguments are not part of the return, and the docstring may have an error. 

But the user provided the docstring, so I have to follow it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom arguments. But the docstring says that nested arguments are put into the spec, and custom are used instead of the normal nested. So maybe the custom arguments are not put into the spec, but are used in Ansible. But the return is two dicts. 

This is really challenging. 

Perhaps I should look for similar functions or think about what the function's purpose is. The function is supposed to split input arguments into control, nested, and custom. But the return is two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested. 

In that case, the code would split the args into control and nested, and the custom are part of the nested. 

So, assuming that the args are a list of dictionaries, each with a 'type' key indicating whether it's control, nested, or custom. Then, the function would process each arg:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        if arg['type'] == 'control':
            control_args[arg['name']] = arg['value']
        else:
            nested_args[arg['name']] = arg['value']
    return control_args, nested_args

But this doesn't account for custom arguments. However, if the 'type' can be 'custom', then they would be added to the nested_args. But that would be incorrect. 

Alternatively, if 'type' is 'custom', they are added to a separate dict, but since the return is two dicts, perhaps the custom are part of the nested. 

This is very ambiguous. 

Given that, perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes both the normal nested and custom arguments. The custom arguments are not part of the return, but the docstring mentions them. 

In this case, the code would be as follows, assuming that the args are split into control and nested, and the custom are part of the nested. 

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with writing code that splits the args into control and nested, and the custom are part of the nested. 

So, the code would look like:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        # Assuming each arg is a dictionary with 'name' and 'value'
        # and a 'control' key indicating if it's a control argument
        if arg.get('control', False):
            control_args[arg['name']] = arg['value']
        else:
            nested_args[arg['name']] = arg['value']
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just an assumption. 

Alternatively, if the args are a dictionary, and the function is supposed to split the keys into control, nested, and custom, but the return is two dicts. 

But again, without knowing the structure of args, it's hard. 

Perhaps the function is part of a class that has other methods to determine if an argument is control, nested, or custom. 

In the absence of more information, I'll proceed with the code that splits the args into control and nested, assuming that the custom arguments are part of the nested. 

But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested. So perhaps they are a separate category, but the function returns only control and nested, and the custom are not part of the return. 

This is very unclear. Given the time, I'll proceed with writing the code as per the assumption that the function separates control arguments from the rest, which are considered nested, and the custom are part of the nested. 

So the code would be as follows.
