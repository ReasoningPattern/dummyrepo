Okay, I need to generate Python code for the from_raw_values class method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method should do.

The method is supposed to create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values. So, the input is a list of strings, and the output is an instance of the Bookmarks class. But wait, the method is a class method, so it's probably part of a Bookmarks class. 

First, I should figure out what the Bookmarks class looks like. Since the method is called from_raw_values, maybe the Bookmarks class has some structure that stores these values. Perhaps the class has an __init__ method that takes some parameters, and this class method is a way to construct instances from raw strings.

But the user hasn't provided the full code for the Bookmarks class. So maybe I need to make some assumptions here. Let's assume that the Bookmarks class has an attribute, maybe a list called 'bookmarks', which stores the processed values. The from_raw_values method would process the input list of strings into this structure.

Wait, the docstring says "Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values." So the raw values are strings, perhaps in a certain format that needs to be parsed. For example, each string might be a URL or some other data that needs to be converted into a bookmark object.

But without more information, I need to make some assumptions. Let's say that each raw value is a string that represents a bookmark, maybe in a specific format. For example, maybe each string is a URL, and the Bookmarks class stores them as a list. Or perhaps each string is a line from a file, and we need to parse them into some structure.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class has a specific structure, like a list of Bookmark objects, each created from a raw string. But again, without knowing the Bookmark class's structure, it's hard to say.

Since the user hasn't provided the full code, perhaps the from_raw_values method is supposed to take the list of strings and pass them to the constructor in some way. Maybe the Bookmarks class's __init__ method accepts a list of strings, or maybe it processes them into another format.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to validate the input, ensuring that all elements are strings, and then create the Bookmarks instance with those values. For example:

class Bookmarks:
    def __init__(self, values):
        self.values = values

    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        # process values here
        return cls(values)

But that's very basic. However, the docstring mentions "raw bookmark string values," which might imply some processing. Maybe each string needs to be parsed into a Bookmark object, and the Bookmarks class holds a list of those.

Wait, perhaps the Bookmarks class is a container for multiple Bookmark instances. So the from_raw_values method would process each string in the input list into a Bookmark object and store them in the Bookmarks instance.

But again, without knowing the Bookmark class's structure, I can't be sure. However, the user is asking for code that implements the from_raw_values method. Since there's no existing code provided, I need to make reasonable assumptions.

Let me proceed with the assumption that the Bookmarks class has an __init__ method that takes a list of processed bookmark objects, and the from_raw_values method is responsible for converting the raw strings into those objects.

For example, maybe each raw string is a URL, and the Bookmark class has a constructor that takes a URL. Then, from_raw_values would create a list of Bookmark instances from the raw strings and pass them to the Bookmarks constructor.

But since the user hasn't provided the Bookmark class, perhaps the from_raw_values method just stores the raw strings as is. However, that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to validate the input, ensuring that all elements are strings, and then create the Bookmarks instance.

Another angle: the method is a class method, so it's supposed to return an instance of the class. The parameters are 'values', which is a list of strings. So the method's job is to take that list and create the object.

Perhaps the Bookmarks class has a list of strings as an attribute. So the from_raw_values method would take the list and pass it to the constructor.

But maybe there's some processing. For example, trimming whitespace, or splitting the strings into parts. However, without more info, it's hard to know. The user's docstring is very minimal, so maybe the method is just a wrapper that creates the instance with the given values.

In that case, the code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    return cls(values)

But then the __init__ method of Bookmarks would need to accept a list of strings. However, the user hasn't provided that code. But since the user is asking for the code for from_raw_values, perhaps that's all that's needed.

But the user also mentioned that they want test-driven development, so maybe I should first write the unit tests. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown format.

Wait, the user's initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the from_raw_values method. But since the method is part of a class, I need to include the class definition. However, the user hasn't provided the full class. So perhaps I need to create a minimal example.

Let me think. The function signature is def from_raw_values(cls, values): ... So it's a class method. Therefore, the code would be part of a class, say Bookmarks.

So the code would look like:

class Bookmarks:
    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        """
        Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
        """
        # code here

But what's the implementation? Without more info, perhaps the method just returns an instance of the class with the values stored. For example:

class Bookmarks:
    def __init__(self, values):
        self.values = values

    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        """
        Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
        """
        return cls(values)

But that's a simple implementation. However, maybe the method needs to process the values. For example, ensuring that each value is a string, or doing some validation.

The docstring says "raw bookmark string values", so perhaps the method is supposed to validate that all elements in the list are strings. So adding some checks.

So the code could be:

class Bookmarks:
    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        """
        Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
        """
        if not isinstance(values, list):
            raise ValueError("Values must be a list")
        for value in values:
            if not isinstance(value, str):
                raise ValueError("All elements must be strings")
        return cls(values)

But again, this assumes that the __init__ method of Bookmarks takes a list of strings. However, the user hasn't provided that code. But since the user is asking for the code for from_raw_values, perhaps this is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the from_raw_values method is supposed to process each string into some other format. For example, parsing each string into a Bookmark object, and then the Bookmarks class holds a list of those.

But without knowing the structure of the Bookmark class, I can't implement that. Therefore, perhaps the minimal implementation is to pass the list to the constructor.

So the code would be as follows:

class Bookmarks:
    def __init__(self, values):
        self.values = values

    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        """
        Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
        """
        return cls(values)

But the user might expect more. However, given the limited information, this is the best I can do.

Wait, but the user mentioned test-driven development. So perhaps the tests would check that from_raw_values creates an instance with the correct values. But the user is asking for the code, not the tests. However, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code for the method.

Therefore, the answer is the code for the from_raw_values method as part of the Bookmarks class, which takes the list of strings and passes them to the constructor. So the code would be:

class Bookmarks:
    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        """
        Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
        """
        return cls(values)

But maybe the __init__ method is not shown. However, the user's function signature is for the class method, so the code should include that method.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to do some processing. For example, if the raw values are in a specific format, like lines from a file, and each line needs to be split into parts. But without knowing that, I can't code that.

In conclusion, given the limited information, the code would be as above, assuming that the Bookmarks class's __init__ method accepts a list of strings.
