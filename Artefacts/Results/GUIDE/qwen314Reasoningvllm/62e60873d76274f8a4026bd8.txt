Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding what the function does. The function protocol_handlers is a class method (since it takes 'cls' as the first parameter) that returns a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers, keyed by version tuples. 

The parameters: if protocol_version is provided, the dictionary should have either zero or one entries based on support. If not provided, all versions are returned. Also, if the protocol_version isn't a tuple, it should raise a TypeError.

First, I should think about how to structure the code. The function is a class method, so it's part of a class, probably related to protocol handlers. The method needs to check if protocol_version is given. If it's not None, validate that it's a tuple. Then, check if that version is supported. If it's None, return all supported versions.

But how does the class know which versions are supported? Maybe the class has a class-level attribute that lists the supported versions. For example, something like SUPPORTED_VERSIONS = [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5)].

So the steps for the function would be:

1. Check if protocol_version is not None. If it's not a tuple, raise TypeError.
2. If protocol_version is provided, check if it's in the supported versions. If yes, return a dict with that version mapped to its handler. Otherwise, return an empty dict.
3. If protocol_version is None, return a dict of all supported versions and their handlers.

But how are the handlers stored? Maybe each version has a corresponding class, and the class has a way to map versions to classes. For example, maybe there's a class method or a static method that returns the handler class for a given version.

Alternatively, perhaps the class itself is a base class, and each version has a subclass. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the class has a registry of versions to handler classes.

So, assuming that the class has a class-level dictionary called HANDLERS, which maps version tuples to handler classes. Then, the SUPPORTED_VERSIONS would be the keys of that dictionary.

Wait, but the function returns a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. So, the HANDLERS could be a class attribute that contains all the supported versions and their corresponding handler classes.

So, for example:

class ProtocolHandler:
    HANDLERS = {
        (3, 0): HandlerV3_0,
        (3, 1): HandlerV3_1,
        (3, 5): HandlerV3_5,
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # implementation here

But then, the SUPPORTED_VERSIONS would be the keys of HANDLERS.

So, the function would first check if protocol_version is a tuple. If not, raise TypeError. Then, if protocol_version is provided, check if it's in HANDLERS. If yes, return {protocol_version: HANDLERS[protocol_version]}, else return empty dict. If protocol_version is None, return a copy of HANDLERS.

But wait, the docstring says that if protocol_version is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items. So, if the version is not supported, return empty dict. If it is supported, return that one entry.

So, the code steps:

- Check if protocol_version is not None and not a tuple: raise TypeError.
- If protocol_version is provided:
   - Check if it's in cls.HANDLERS. If yes, return {version: handler}, else return {}.
- Else:
   - Return a copy of cls.HANDLERS.

But how to handle the case where protocol_version is not a tuple? For example, if someone passes a string or integer. The function should raise a TypeError. So, in code:

if protocol_version is not None:
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")

Then proceed.

Now, the code:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
        # Check if this version is supported
        if protocol_version in cls.HANDLERS:
            return {protocol_version: cls.HANDLERS[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        return dict(cls.HANDLERS)

But wait, the function is a class method. So, the code should be written as a class method. So, the code would be inside a class, and the function would be decorated with @classmethod.

But the user provided the function signature as def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), so the code is part of a class.

But the user's code is supposed to generate the code for this function, assuming that the class has a HANDLERS attribute.

But the user hasn't provided the rest of the class. So, perhaps the code is part of a class that has a HANDLERS class attribute.

So, the code would be:

class SomeProtocolClass:
    HANDLERS = {
        (3, 0): HandlerClass3_0,
        (3, 1): HandlerClass3_1,
        # etc.
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # the code as above

But the user's function is supposed to be generated. So, the code for the function would be as I wrote above.

But the user's question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be the function definition, but the HANDLERS would be a class attribute that the function uses.

But the user hasn't provided that. So, perhaps the code is written assuming that the class has a HANDLERS attribute.

But the user's code is only the function. So, the code would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    ...
    """
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
        if protocol_version in cls.HANDLERS:
            return {protocol_version: cls.HANDLERS[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        return dict(cls.HANDLERS)

But wait, the function is supposed to return a dictionary of available handlers. So, the HANDLERS must be a class-level attribute that maps version tuples to handler classes.

But the user hasn't provided that. So, perhaps the code is written with that assumption.

But the user's question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code for the function itself, assuming that the class has the necessary attributes.

Now, considering the test-driven development approach. The user's tip says to generate comprehensive unit tests first. But the user's question is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not the tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So, perhaps the user wants the code for the function, not the tests.

But the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD by first generating tests. But the user's output is only the code generated, not the tests. So maybe the user wants the code for the function, not the tests.

So, the code for the function would be as I outlined.

But the function is a class method, so the code must be inside a class. However, the user's provided function signature is just the def line. So, the generated code would be the function definition, assuming that the class has a HANDLERS attribute.

But the user's code may not include that. However, the function's code depends on that attribute. So, the code for the function would be as follows.

But the user's example shows the function signature as def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), so the code would be part of a class. Therefore, the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    HANDLERS = {
        # version tuples mapped to handler classes
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        """
        ...
        """
        if protocol_version is not None:
            if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
                raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
            if protocol_version in cls.HANDLERS:
                return {protocol_version: cls.HANDLERS[protocol_version]}
            else:
                return {}
        else:
            return dict(cls.HANDLERS)

But the user's function is supposed to be generated. However, the user's provided code is only the function signature and docstring. So, the code generated would be the function, but the HANDLERS is assumed to be present as a class attribute.

But in the code, the HANDLERS is not defined. So, perhaps the user expects that the code is written with that assumption.

But the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. Therefore, the code would be the function as written, with the assumption that the class has a HANDLERS attribute.

But the user's code may not include that. However, the function is supposed to return the dictionary based on that attribute. Therefore, the code for the function is as above.

Now, checking for possible errors. For example, if protocol_version is a tuple but not in HANDLERS, return empty dict. If protocol_version is None, return all versions.

Another thing: when returning the dictionary, perhaps we should return a copy to avoid modifying the original. For example, in the else clause, return dict(cls.HANDLERS) to create a new dictionary.

Yes, that's correct. Because if someone modifies the returned dict, it shouldn't affect the original HANDLERS.

So, the code is correct.

Now, the error checking: if protocol_version is not a tuple, raise TypeError. The message is as per the docstring.

So, the code seems correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as follows.
