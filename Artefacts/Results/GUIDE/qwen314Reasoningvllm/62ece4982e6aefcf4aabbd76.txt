Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. The function is called match and it checks if a filename is of type 'doxyfile'. The return value is True if the lowercase version of the filename is exactly 'doxyfile'. 

First, let me think about the implementation. The function takes a filename as input. So, the steps would be: convert the filename to lowercase and check if it equals 'doxyfile'. That's straightforward.

Wait, the docstring says "the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". But maybe that's a bit ambiguous. Oh, right, the function is probably checking the file extension or the base name. Wait, no, the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So, the entire filename, when lowercased, should be exactly 'doxyfile'. So, for example, if the filename is 'DoxyFile', converting to lowercase gives 'doxyfile', so it returns True. But if the filename is 'doxyfile.txt', then lowercasing it would be 'doxyfile.txt', which is not equal to 'doxyfile', so returns False.

So the code would be something like:

def match(filename):
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

That's simple. But maybe there's more to it? Like, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where filenames have specific extensions, but according to the docstring, it's just checking if the entire filename in lowercase is exactly 'doxyfile'.

Now, the user mentioned using test-driven development. So first, I should write unit tests. Let me think about possible test cases.

Test cases:
1. filename is 'doxyfile' → True
2. filename is 'DoxyFile' → True (because lowercasing it becomes 'doxyfile')
3. filename is 'DOXYFILE' → True
4. filename is 'doxyfile.txt' → False
5. filename is 'doxyfile_' → False
6. filename is 'doxyfile' with trailing spaces → like 'doxyfile ' → False
7. empty string → False
8. None as input? Well, the function's argument is 'filename', which is expected to be a string. But if someone passes None, it would throw an error. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that. So perhaps the function assumes that filename is a string. So maybe no need to handle that here.

So the tests would check these cases.

Now, the user wants the code generated, but the tips say to first generate comprehensive unit tests. So the answer should first show the unit tests, then the implementation.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown. However, the tips suggest TDD, so perhaps the answer should include both the tests and the code.

Wait, the original problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to first generate unit tests. However, the user might expect that the code includes both the tests and the function. But maybe the user wants only the function code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is to be implemented. The tests are part of the code generation process but perhaps not part of the final code. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.

But looking back, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So maybe they want just the function code, not the tests. But the tips suggest to do TDD, writing tests first. However, the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. Unless the user wants the tests as part of the code.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the function code, and the tests are part of the code generation process but not part of the final output. But the problem isn't clear. However, the original function is to be implemented. So perhaps the answer is just the function code.

But let me check the example. The user provided a function signature and docstring. The assistant is supposed to generate the code for that function. So the answer would be the code for the function, not the tests. Unless the user wants tests as part of the code.

But the tips mention TDD, but the user's main instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the answer is the function code.

But to be safe, perhaps the user expects the function code. Let me proceed with that.

So the code is:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But wait, the docstring says "the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". Maybe that's a typo, and they mean the filename's extension or something else. But according to the docstring, it's checking if the filename in lowercase is exactly 'doxyfile'. So the code is correct.

So that's the code. Now, the user might have wanted tests, but the problem says to output only the code generated. So the answer is the function code.
