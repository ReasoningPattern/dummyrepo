Okay, I need to generate Python code for the split function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what the function is supposed to do.

The function splits a string based on the platform. The platform can be 'this' to auto-detect, 1 for POSIX, or 0 for Windows/CMD. So, first, I need to determine the correct splitting method based on the platform parameter.

For POSIX (platform 1), the split is probably using the standard shell splitting, which is whitespace and semicolons, maybe? Or perhaps it's splitting on spaces, tabs, newlines, etc. Wait, in Unix-like systems, the split is usually done using the shell's rules, which can be a bit complex. But maybe for this function, it's simpler. Alternatively, maybe it's splitting on whitespace, but I need to check.

For Windows/CMD (platform 0), the splitting might be different. In CMD, the split is done using spaces, but also considering quotes and escaping. However, handling all that might be complicated. But maybe the function is supposed to split on spaces, but with some differences between POSIX and Windows.

Wait, perhaps the function is meant to split the string into parts similar to how command-line arguments are split. For example, in POSIX, splitting on whitespace, but in Windows, maybe using different delimiters. However, the exact behavior isn't clear from the docstring. Maybe the function is supposed to split the string using the same logic as the shell's split, but simplified.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split on spaces, but for Windows, it's splitting on spaces and semicolons, or something else. But without more details, I need to make assumptions.

Wait, looking at the problem again. The function's docstring says that when platform is 1, use POSIX style, and 0 for Windows/CMD. So perhaps the split is done using the same rules as the shell's splitting. For example, in POSIX, splitting on whitespace, but in Windows, splitting on spaces and semicolons? Or perhaps it's splitting on different delimiters.

Alternatively, maybe the split is done using the shlex module for POSIX and some other method for Windows. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the split is done by splitting on whitespace, but for Windows, it's splitting on spaces and semicolons. But I need to think of a way to implement this.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the string into tokens, considering the platform's path separators. For example, in POSIX, the path separator is colon (':'), while in Windows, it's semicolon (';')? Wait, no. Wait, in Windows, the PATH environment variable uses semicolons to separate paths, while in POSIX, it's colons. But the function's split might be splitting on those delimiters. But the function's name is 'split', which could imply splitting on those delimiters.

Wait, but the function's docstring says that when platform is 1, use POSIX style, and 0 for Windows/CMD. So maybe the split is done using the appropriate delimiter for the platform. For example, in POSIX, split on colon (':'), and in Windows, split on semicolon (';')? Or maybe split on whitespace for both, but with different handling of quotes?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to split the string into parts as if it were a command line, so splitting on whitespace, but respecting quotes and escaping. For example, in POSIX, the shell splits arguments considering quotes, while in Windows CMD, it's different. However, implementing that would be complex.

But given that the problem is to generate code for this function, perhaps the intended approach is to split on whitespace for both, but with different handling for quotes. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the split is done using the shlex.split function for POSIX, and some other method for Windows. For example, in Python, shlex.split is used to split a string into tokens according to shell rules. For Windows, perhaps using the same but with different quote handling.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided examples, so I need to make assumptions. Let me think about possible test cases.

For example, if the input is "a b c", then splitting on POSIX would return ["a", "b", "c"], same for Windows. If the input is "a;b c", then on POSIX it would split into ["a;b", "c"] if splitting on whitespace, but if splitting on colon, then ["a", "b c"]. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the split is done using the os.path.split or something else. But that doesn't fit with the function's name.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the string into parts based on the platform's path separator. For example, for POSIX, split on colon (':'), and for Windows, split on semicolon (';'). But that would make the function's purpose more about splitting paths.

But the function's docstring says "split the input str under given platform", which is vague. However, given that the platform can be 'this', 1, or 0, perhaps the function is intended to split the string into parts as per the command-line splitting rules for that platform.

In that case, for POSIX, we can use shlex.split, which handles quotes and escaping. For Windows, perhaps using a similar approach but with different quote handling. However, the Windows CMD's splitting is different from POSIX. For example, in CMD, the splitting is done with spaces as separators, but quotes are handled differently.

But implementing that might be complex. However, since the user is asking for code, perhaps the intended approach is to split on whitespace, but with different handling for quotes.

Alternatively, maybe the split is done using the split method with different delimiters. For example, for POSIX, split on whitespace, and for Windows, split on spaces and semicolons. But again, without examples, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the split is done using the same method as the shell's splitting, but for simplicity, the code uses the shlex module for POSIX and a simple split for Windows. However, this is just a guess.

Let me think of possible code structure.

First, determine the platform. If platform is 'this', then check the current OS. For example, on Windows, use 0, else 1.

Then, based on the platform, decide the splitting method.

For example:

If platform is 1 (POSIX), split using shlex.split, which handles quotes and escaping.

If platform is 0 (Windows), split using a method that splits on spaces, but perhaps handles quotes differently. However, in Windows CMD, the splitting is done with spaces as separators, but quotes are treated as part of the argument. For example, "a b" would be treated as one argument. However, implementing that would require parsing the string with CMD's rules, which is non-trivial.

But given that the user hasn't provided examples, perhaps the intended approach is to split on whitespace, but for Windows, split on spaces and semicolons. Or perhaps split on whitespace, but for Windows, split on spaces and semicolons.

Alternatively, perhaps the split is done using the split() method with default parameters, which splits on any whitespace. But that would be the same for both platforms. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the split is done using different delimiters. For example, POSIX uses colon (':') as a delimiter, and Windows uses semicolon (';'). But that would be splitting paths, which might be the case.

But the function's name is split, and the docstring says "split the input str under given platform". So perhaps the function is intended to split a path string into components based on the platform's path separator.

For example, in POSIX, the path separator is colon (':'), so splitting "a:b:c" would give ["a", "b", "c"], while in Windows, the path separator is semicolon (';'), so splitting "a;b;c" would give ["a", "b", "c"].

But then, the function's name would be more like split_path, but the name is split. However, given that the user provided the function signature, I have to proceed with that.

So, assuming that the split is based on path separators, then:

For platform 1 (POSIX), split on colon (':').

For platform 0 (Windows), split on semicolon (';').

But then, what about the 'this' option? It would check the current OS. For example, on Windows, use semicolon, else colon.

But then, the function would split the input string into parts based on the platform's path separator.

But the problem is that the function's docstring says "split the input str under given platform", which could be ambiguous. However, this seems like a plausible approach.

So, the code would look like:

- Determine the delimiter based on platform.

- Split the input string using that delimiter.

But how to handle the 'this' case? For example, on Windows, use 0, else 1.

So, code steps:

1. Determine the platform to use.

   if platform is 'this', then check the OS. For example, using os.name or sys.platform.

   if os.name is 'nt' (Windows), then use 0.

   else, use 1.

   So, the effective_platform is determined.

2. Based on effective_platform, choose the delimiter.

   if effective_platform is 1: delimiter is ':'

   if 0: delimiter is ';'

3. Split the input string s using the delimiter.

But then, the split would be done with s.split(delimiter).

But what if the input string has multiple delimiters? For example, "a:b;c" would split into ["a", "b", "c"] if platform is 1 (split on colon), but if platform is 0, split on semicolon, so "a:b;c" would split into ["a:b", "c"].

But this is just one possible interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the split is done using the same delimiter for both, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the split is done using the os.path.split or something else, but again, the function's name is split, not split_path.

But given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with this approach, assuming that the split is based on path separators.

Now, considering that, the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            platform = 1
    if platform == 1:
        return s.split(':')
    elif platform == 0:
        return s.split(';')
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")

But wait, the function's return is a list of splitting str. However, this code would split on the respective delimiters. But what about cases where the string has multiple delimiters? For example, "a;b:c" on platform 0 would split into ["a", "b:c"], which may or may not be intended.

But given the lack of examples, this is a possible approach.

However, the problem says that when platform is 0, use Windows/CMD style. CMD's splitting is different. For example, in CMD, the split is done on spaces, but with quotes. For example, "a b c" would split into ["a", "b", "c"], but "a\"b c" would split into ["a\"b", "c"], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the split is done using the same method as the shell's splitting, which for Windows is more complex.

But implementing that would require more complex code. However, without more information, perhaps the intended approach is to split on whitespace for both, but for Windows, split on spaces and semicolons. Or perhaps the split is done using the split() method with default parameters (split on any whitespace).

But then, why differentiate between platforms? That would not make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the split is done using the same method as the shell's splitting, which for POSIX uses shlex.split, and for Windows, uses a different approach. But how?

For example, in Python, the shlex module can be used to split a string according to shell rules. For POSIX, it's straightforward. For Windows, perhaps using shlex.split with the appropriate settings.

But the shlex.split function is for splitting command lines, and it uses the current OS's rules. However, the user wants to specify the platform. So perhaps for platform 1, use shlex.split with posix=True, and for platform 0, use shlex.split with posix=False.

Wait, the shlex.split function has a posix parameter. Let me check: yes, in Python, shlex.split() has a posix parameter. So, for example, shlex.split('a b c', posix=True) would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'], and similarly for Windows.

But perhaps the function is intended to split the string into tokens as per the shell's rules for the given platform. So, for platform 1, use POSIX shell rules, for platform 0, use Windows CMD rules.

In that case, the code would use the shlex module.

But then, for platform 0, the shlex.split would use the Windows rules. However, the shlex module's default is to use the current OS's rules. So, perhaps for platform 0, we set posix=False, and for platform 1, posix=True.

But how does that work? Let me think.

For example, in Windows, if I call shlex.split with posix=False, it would split according to Windows CMD rules. For example, "a b c" would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'], and "a\"b c" would split into ['a\"b', 'c'].

So, the code could be:

import shlex

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        # determine current platform
        if os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            platform = 1
    if platform == 1:
        return shlex.split(s, posix=True)
    elif platform == 0:
        return shlex.split(s, posix=False)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform")

But wait, the shlex.split function's default is posix=True. So for platform 1, we can just call shlex.split(s), and for platform 0, call shlex.split(s, posix=False).

But then, this would handle the splitting according to the shell rules for each platform.

This seems plausible. However, the problem is that the user's function is called 'split', and the shlex.split is a standard function. But the user's function may be intended to do this.

But then, what about the 'this' case? For example, if the current platform is Windows, then platform is set to 0, and use shlex.split with posix=False.

This would handle splitting according to the current OS's rules.

But then, the code would need to import os and shlex.

So, putting it all together:

import os
import shlex

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            platform = 1
    if platform == 1:
        return shlex.split(s, posix=True)
    elif platform == 0:
        return shlex.split(s, posix=False)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform value")

But wait, what if the platform is not 'this', 0, or 1? The function raises a ValueError.

But according to the docstring, platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So, the code checks for those.

But what about other values? The function raises an error.

Now, testing this function with some examples:

For example, if s is "a b c", platform 1 (POSIX), returns ['a', 'b', 'c'].

If s is "a\"b c", platform 0 (Windows), returns ['a\"b', 'c'].

But this depends on how shlex.split handles it.

But this seems like a plausible approach.

However, the user's problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and to output only the code in markdown.

But before writing the code, the user mentioned to follow test-driven development, generating unit tests first. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in markdown.

But the user's note says to follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the user's final instruction says to generate the code, not the tests. So perhaps the user expects the code, not the tests.

But the user's initial message says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the code should be generated, not the tests. However, the tips mention TDD, but perhaps the user is just giving a tip, not requiring the tests to be written.

Therefore, proceeding with the code that uses shlex.split.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Another possible issue: the shlex.split function may raise exceptions if the string is not properly formatted. However, the function's docstring does not mention error handling, so perhaps it's assumed that the input is well-formed.

Thus, the code would be as above.

Now, the code needs to import os and shlex.

But the function's code is as written.

But what about the 'this' case? For example, on Windows, it sets platform to 0, and uses shlex.split with posix=False.

Yes.

So, the code should be correct.
