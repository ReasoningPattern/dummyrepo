Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a method called popitem, which is supposed to remove and return a random key-value pair using __choice from the class. Hmm. First, I need to figure out what the class looks like. Since the method is part of a class (as indicated by the 'self' parameter), I need to consider what data structure is being used here.

The popitem method is typically found in dictionaries, but in Python's dict, popitem() removes and returns the last inserted item (in Python 3.7+). However, the user's docstring says it should use __choice, which makes me think that the class might be using a random selection. So maybe this is a custom dictionary-like class that stores items and allows random removal.

So, the __choice might be a method or a reference to the random.choice function. Wait, the user wrote "__choice in the class"—maybe the class has an attribute or method called __choice that's used to select a random element. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant using the random.choice function. But since the docstring says "via __choice in the class," I should assume that the class has some mechanism for choosing randomly, perhaps a list of items or something similar.

Assuming that the class has a way to get a random item, perhaps the class maintains a list of items. For example, if the class has a list called _items, then using random.choice on that list would select a random key-value pair. Then, when popitem is called, it removes that pair from the data structure.

But how is the data stored? Let's think. If it's a dictionary-like structure, maybe the class has a dictionary and a list. For example, when items are added, they are added to both the dict and the list. Then, when popitem is called, a random item is selected from the list, removed from both the dict and the list.

Wait, but the method is called popitem, which in standard dictionaries is O(1) in Python 3.7+. However, if we are using a list and random.choice, then selecting a random item would be O(1) for selection, but removing it from the list would be O(n) unless we have some way to track the indices. Alternatively, maybe the class uses a list to keep track of items, and when an item is popped, it's removed from both the list and the main storage (like a dict).

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a list of keys, and then when popitem is called, a random key is selected from the list, then the key is removed from the dict and the list. But that would require maintaining a list of keys, which could be done.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the full context of the class. So I need to make some assumptions here. Since the docstring mentions using __choice in the class, perhaps the class has a method or attribute named __choice that is used to select a random element. However, that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant using the random module's choice function.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So I need to code the popitem method as per the docstring. Let's think about the code structure.

The method needs to find a random key-value pair, remove it, and return it. So, the class must have some way to store the items. Let's assume that the class has a dictionary called self._data. Then, to get a random key, we can get the list of keys, use random.choice on that list, then delete the key from the dictionary.

But the docstring says "via __choice in the class"—maybe the class has a __choice method that returns a random key. Or perhaps the __choice is a reference to the random.choice function. For example, maybe the class has a list of items, and __choice is a method that selects a random item from that list.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the __choice is a method of the class, perhaps a helper method that returns a random element. For example, the class might have a list of items, and __choice is a method that uses random.choice on that list.

But without knowing the exact structure of the class, I need to make some assumptions. Let's proceed with the following approach:

Assume that the class has a dictionary (self._data) and a list (self._items) that contains all the key-value pairs. When an item is added, it's added to both the dict and the list. When popitem is called, we use random.choice on self._items to select a random item, then remove it from both the dict and the list.

But then, how to handle the removal? For example, if the list is self._items, and we select an item (key, value), we need to remove that key from the dict and remove the item from the list. However, if the list is maintained properly, then when an item is added, it's added to the list, and when removed, it's removed from the list.

But this approach would require that the list is kept in sync with the dict. However, this might not be efficient for large data, but given the problem statement, perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a list of keys, and the values are stored in the dict. Then, when popitem is called, a random key is selected from the list, then the key is removed from the dict and the list.

So, the code could look something like this:

import random

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}
        self._keys = []

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
        """
        if not self._keys:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key = random.choice(self._keys)
        value = self._data.pop(key)
        self._keys.remove(key)
        return key, value

But wait, the docstring mentions using __choice in the class. So maybe instead of using random.choice directly, the class has a __choice method that returns a random key. For example:

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}
        self._keys = []

    def __choice(self):
        return random.choice(self._keys)

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
        """
        if not self._keys:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key = self.__choice()
        value = self._data.pop(key)
        self._keys.remove(key)
        return key, value

But in this case, the __choice method is a helper that uses random.choice on the list of keys. However, the user's docstring says "via __choice in the class"—so maybe that's what they meant. However, the original code might not have the __choice method, but perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that the __choice is a reference to the random.choice function, but that's not clear. However, given the information, I think the best approach is to implement the popitem method using random.choice on the keys, and perhaps the __choice is a typo or misunderstanding.

But the user's instruction says that the code should be generated based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the docstring says that the method uses __choice in the class. Therefore, the code must use something called __choice from the class.

Assuming that the class has an attribute or method called __choice, perhaps it's a method that returns a random key. For example, the __choice method might return a random key from the class's data structure.

So, modifying the code:

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}
        self._keys = []

    def __choice(self):
        return random.choice(self._keys)

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
        """
        if not self._keys:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key = self.__choice()
        value = self._data.pop(key)
        self._keys.remove(key)
        return key, value

But then, the __choice method is part of the class. However, the user's code might not have that. But since the docstring says that popitem uses __choice in the class, this seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a reference to a class-level variable or something else. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Another possibility: perhaps the user intended that the __choice is a method of the class, and the code should use that method to select the random item.

In any case, the code must use __choice in the class. So, the code for popitem would call self.__choice() or something similar.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the rest of the class. So, perhaps the code is part of a class that has a __choice method, and the popitem method uses that.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

import random

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._items = []  # Assuming this is a list of (key, value) pairs
        # Or maybe a dictionary and a list of keys

    def __choice(self):
        # Assuming this returns a random element from _items or keys
        return random.choice(self._items) if self._items else None

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
        """
        if not self._items:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key, value = self.__choice()
        # Remove the key, value from the data structure
        # Assuming _items is a list of tuples
        self._items.remove((key, value))
        return key, value

But this depends on how the data is stored. However, without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, the user's question is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the method uses __choice in the class. So, the code must call self.__choice() or similar.

But perhaps the __choice is a method that returns a random key, and then the value is retrieved from the dictionary.

In any case, the code needs to be generated. Let's proceed with the assumption that the class has a __choice method that returns a random key, and that the class has a dictionary (self._data) and a list of keys (self._keys).

So, the code would be:

import random

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}
        self._keys = []

    def __choice(self):
        return random.choice(self._keys)

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
        """
        if not self._keys:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key = self.__choice()
        value = self._data.pop(key)
        self._keys.remove(key)
        return key, value

But then, the __choice method is part of the class. However, the user's original code may not have that. But according to the docstring, the popitem method uses __choice in the class, so this seems to fit.

Now, considering the test-driven development approach, the user wants unit tests first. So, I need to write tests for the popitem method. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the user wants the actual implementation code, not the tests. But the tips mention that the assistant should follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated. So maybe the user expects the code for the popitem method, not the tests.

But the initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the user wants the code for the popitem method. But given that the method is part of a class, the code would need to be within a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition. So, perhaps the code is part of a class that has the necessary attributes and methods.

But the user's function signature is def popitem(self): ... So, the code is part of a class. Therefore, the generated code should include the class definition with the popitem method.

But without knowing the rest of the class, it's challenging. However, the code must use __choice in the class. So, assuming that the class has a __choice method, and that the class maintains a data structure (like a dictionary and a list of keys), the code would be as I outlined earlier.

So, the final code would be:

import random

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}
        self._keys = []

    def __choice(self):
        return random.choice(self._keys)

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
        """
        if not self._keys:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key = self.__choice()
        value = self._data.pop(key)
        self._keys.remove(key)
        return key, value

But I need to make sure that the __choice method is properly implemented. Also, when adding items to the class, the _keys list must be updated. However, the user hasn't provided code for adding items, so perhaps that's beyond the scope of this question.

In conclusion, the generated code is as above.
