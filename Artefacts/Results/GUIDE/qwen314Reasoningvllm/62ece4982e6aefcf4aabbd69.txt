Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _replace_register based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function should replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and then delete flow_params[register_value]. So, the steps are: take the value from register_value, assign it to register_number, and then remove the register_value entry.

First, I should check if the flow_params is a dictionary, since it's using bracket notation. Assuming it's a dictionary. But maybe I should make sure that register_number and register_value are valid keys. However, the function might not handle errors here, as the docstring doesn't mention error checking. So perhaps it's assumed that these keys exist.

So the steps would be:

1. Get the value from flow_params at register_value.
2. Assign that value to flow_params[register_number].
3. Delete the key register_value from flow_params.

Wait, but what if register_number is the same as register_value? Like, if someone tries to replace a register with itself. Then, after assigning, we delete it. So in that case, the register_number would have the same value as before, but then the register_value (same as register_number) is deleted. So the original register_number's value would be overwritten with itself, then the key is deleted. But that's probably not intended. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention handling this case, so maybe it's up to the caller to ensure that register_number and register_value are different.

But the function's job is just to do what the docstring says, regardless of whether the keys are the same. So even if they are the same, the code should proceed.

So the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    # Get the value from register_value
    value = flow_params[register_value]
    # Assign it to register_number
    flow_params[register_number] = value
    # Delete the register_value key
    del flow_params[register_value]

Wait, but what if register_value is not present in flow_params? That would raise a KeyError. But again, the function's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps it's assumed that the keys exist.

Now, the user mentioned to use test-driven development, so I should first write unit tests. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. However, the tips mention to first generate tests. But the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. Wait, the original question says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So maybe the tests are not required here. But the tip says to follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the user might just want the implementation code.

So perhaps the user wants the actual function code. So the code for _replace_register.

But let me make sure. The user provided a function signature and docstring, and wants the code generated. So the code for the function.

So the code would be as I outlined above. Let me write that.

But wait, the function is supposed to modify flow_params in place? Because dictionaries are mutable, so changing them inside the function will affect the original. So the function doesn't return anything, but modifies the input dictionary.

Yes, that's correct. So the code is as I wrote.

Now, check for possible errors. For example, if register_value is not in flow_params, it will throw KeyError. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that, so it's up to the caller to ensure that register_value exists.

Another case: if register_number is the same as register_value. For example, if someone calls _replace_register(params, 'R1', 'R1'). Then, the code would take the value of R1, assign it to R1 (so no change), then delete R1. So the end result is that R1 is deleted. But that's probably not intended. However, the function's docstring says to replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value], which in this case would be the same value, and then delete the register_value. So the function is doing exactly what it's told, even if it's a no-op for the value but deletes the key.

So the code is correct as per the docstring.

Therefore, the Python code is as follows.
