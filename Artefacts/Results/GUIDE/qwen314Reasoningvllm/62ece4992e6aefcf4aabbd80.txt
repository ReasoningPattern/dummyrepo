Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function remove_ending_os_sep based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function should do.

The function takes an input_list, which is a list of strings. If the input is None, it should return an empty list. Then, for each string in the list, if the string's length is more than one and the last character is the OS separator (like a slash or backslash), we need to remove that trailing separator.

First, I need to figure out how to get the OS separator. In Python, os.path.sep gives the correct separator for the operating system. So I'll import os and use os.path.sep.

Wait, but the function is supposed to handle the trailing separator. So for each string in the input list, check if it ends with the separator. But also, the string's length must be greater than one. Because if the string is just the separator itself (like a single '/'), then removing it would leave an empty string, but according to the condition, we only remove it if the length is greater than one. So for example, 'file/' becomes 'file', but '/' would stay as '/'?

Wait the docstring says: "Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator." So, only if both conditions are met, we remove the trailing separator. So, for a string like 'a/b/', it would become 'a/b'. But if the string is just '/', since length is 1, we don't remove anything.

So the steps for each string in the input list:

- If the string is None? Well, the input list is checked for None, but the elements of the list are strings. Wait, the function's parameter is input_list, which is a list. The docstring says it's a string list. So assuming that each element is a string. But maybe we should handle cases where elements are not strings? But the docstring says it's a string list, so perhaps we don't need to handle that. So proceed under the assumption that all elements are strings.

So for each string in the input_list:

Check if len(string) > 1 and string ends with os.sep. If so, then remove the last character. Otherwise, leave it as is.

So, the code would be something like:

import os

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    result = []
    sep = os.path.sep
    for s in input_list:
        if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(sep):
            s = s[:-1]
        result.append(s)
    return result

Wait, but what about cases where the string ends with multiple separators? Like 'file//'. Then, this code would only remove the last one, leaving 'file/'. But according to the problem statement, we only remove the trailing separator once. Because the condition is checking if the last character is the separator. So, for 'file//', the last character is '/', so we remove it once, resulting in 'file/'. But maybe the user wants to remove all trailing separators. Wait, the docstring says "remove trailing os separator characters" but the code as per the docstring's condition only removes the last character if it's a separator. So perhaps the function is intended to remove only a single trailing separator, not all of them. For example, 'a/b/c/' becomes 'a/b/c', but 'a/b//' becomes 'a/b/'.

But the docstring says "trailing os separator characters" which might imply all trailing ones. However, the condition in the docstring says "if the last character is the pathname separator". So the code is supposed to check if the last character is a separator, and if so, remove it. So even if there are multiple, like 'a//b//', the code would check the last character. Let me think. For example, 'a//b//' has length 5, ends with '/', so we remove the last character, resulting in 'a//b'. But maybe the user wants to remove all trailing separators. However, according to the problem statement, the code should follow the docstring's logic. The docstring says each string is tested if its length is greater than one and the last character is the separator. So only remove the last character if that's the case. So the code as written is correct.

Now, the unit tests. The user said to use test-driven development, so first generate comprehensive unit tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown. But the user also said to follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the tips mention generating tests first. However, the user's main instruction is to generate the code for the function. So perhaps the answer should be the function code.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the answer is the function code. But the tips suggest to do TDD, but perhaps that's just a tip for the thought process, not part of the required output. So the answer is the function code.

So, the code would be as I outlined before. Let me write that.

But need to import os. Also, handle the case where input_list is None. So the code:

import os

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    """
    If input list is None, return []
    Iterate over a string list and remove trailing os seperator characters.
    Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last
    character is the pathname seperator.
    Returns:
    A list after removing trailing os seperator characters.
    """
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    sep = os.path.sep
    result = []
    for s in input_list:
        if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(sep):
            s = s[:-1]
        result.append(s)
    return result

Wait, but what about if the input list is empty? The function returns it as is. Which is correct.

Testing some examples:

Case 1: input_list is None → returns [].

Case 2: input_list is ['a/b/', 'c/d', 'e/f/'] → after processing, ['a/b', 'c/d', 'e/f'].

Case 3: input_list is ['/'] → len is 1, so no change → ['/'].

Case 4: input_list is ['file.txt/', 'another//'] → ['file.txt', 'another/'].

Yes, that seems correct.

So that's the code.
