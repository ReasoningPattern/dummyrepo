Okay, I need to generate Python code for the vertex3tuple function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function takes a list of vertices, which I assume are points in a polygon. For each vertex, I need to get three points: the vertex itself and the two adjacent points. But if the subscript is out of bounds, like for the first or last vertex, I should wrap around and take the value from index 0 or the end.

Wait, the docstring says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. Wait, maybe that's not quite right. Let me re-read the docstring. Oh, it says "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". Hmm, maybe that's a translation error. Probably, it means that when accessing the previous or next vertex, if the index is out of bounds (like for the first vertex, the previous would be the last one), we take the value from index 0. Or maybe it's a typo and should be "take the value of index as the modulo of the length"?

Wait, the function is supposed to get three points for each vertex: the vertex and the two on both sides. So for a polygon, each vertex has a previous and next vertex. For example, if the vertices are [v0, v1, v2, v3], then for v0, the previous would be v3 (since it's a polygon, cyclic), and next is v1. Similarly for v3, the next would be v0.

So the function needs to, for each vertex at index i, get the previous vertex (i-1), current (i), and next (i+1). But when i is 0, i-1 is -1, which is out of bounds. Similarly, for i being the last index, i+1 is out of bounds. So in those cases, we need to wrap around. For example, for i=0, previous is len(vertices)-1. For i = len(vertices)-1, next is 0.

So the way to handle this is to use modulo arithmetic. For the previous index, it's (i-1) % len(vertices), and for the next index, (i+1) % len(vertices). But wait, if the list is empty or has only one element? Well, the function might need to handle those cases. But according to the problem statement, perhaps vertices is a list of at least three points? Or maybe the function should handle any list, even empty or with one element.

But the docstring says "polygon", which implies that vertices is a list of at least three points. However, the code should handle cases where the list is empty or has less than three elements. But maybe the function expects that vertices is a non-empty list. Let me think.

The function returns a list where each element is a tuple of three points. So for each vertex, we need to get three points. Let's proceed under the assumption that vertices is a list of points (like tuples or lists), and that it's non-empty. But code should handle empty lists? Well, if vertices is empty, then the function returns an empty list. But the problem says "polygon", so perhaps vertices is a list of three or more points. However, the code should handle any input.

Now, the code structure: the function vertex3tuple takes vertices as input. For each vertex in vertices, we need to get the previous, current, and next points. Let's loop through each index i in range(len(vertices)). For each i, previous index is (i-1) % len_vertices, current is i, next is (i+1) % len_vertices. Then, collect the three points as a tuple. But wait, the problem says "the elements of vertices represented by tuple". Wait, the return is a list of tuples, each tuple containing three points?

Wait the docstring says "A list where the elements of vertices represented by tuple". Maybe that's a translation error. Let me recheck the docstring:

Returns:
    A list where the elements of vertices represented by tuple

Probably, the intended meaning is that each element in the output list is a tuple of three points (the previous, current, and next). So for each vertex, the three points are (prev, current, next), and the output is a list of these tuples.

So for example, if vertices is [v0, v1, v2], then for each vertex:

For v0: prev is v2, current v0, next v1 → tuple (v2, v0, v1)
For v1: prev v0, current v1, next v2 → (v0, v1, v2)
For v2: prev v1, current v2, next v0 → (v1, v2, v0)

So the output list would be [ (v2, v0, v1), (v0, v1, v2), (v1, v2, v0) ]

So the code needs to generate for each vertex in vertices, a tuple of (prev, current, next), where prev is the previous vertex (with wrap-around), current is the vertex itself, and next is the next vertex (with wrap-around).

Now, the code.

First, handle the case where vertices is empty. Then return an empty list.

Else, for each i in range(len(vertices)):

prev_index = (i - 1) % len_vertices

next_index = (i + 1) % len_vertices

Then, collect vertices[prev_index], vertices[i], vertices[next_index] as a tuple.

So the code would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    """
    Get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon.
    This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex
    If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0
    Args:
        vertices: vertices to be converted

    Returns:
        A list where the elements of vertices represented by tuple
    """
    if not vertices:
        return []
    len_vertices = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(len_vertices):
        prev_index = (i - 1) % len_vertices
        next_index = (i + 1) % len_vertices
        prev_point = vertices[prev_index]
        current_point = vertices[i]
        next_point = vertices[next_index]
        result.append( (prev_point, current_point, next_point) )
    return result

Wait, but the docstring says "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". But in the code above, for example, when i=0, prev_index is (0-1) % len_vertices → len_vertices -1, which is correct. So the code is handling the wrap-around correctly.

But the docstring says "take the value of index as 0" when out of bounds. That might be a mistranslation. For example, if the index is out of bounds, like when accessing i-1 when i=0, the code uses modulo to wrap around. But maybe the original intention was that when the index is out of bounds, use 0. For example, if the index is -1, take 0. But that would not be correct for a polygon. However, the code above uses modulo, which for i=0, prev_index is len_vertices -1, which is correct for a polygon.

But perhaps the original docstring meant that when accessing the previous or next index, if it's out of bounds, use 0. But that would not be correct. For example, for a polygon with 3 vertices, the previous of index 0 is 2, not 0. So the code as written is correct.

But maybe the original docstring's wording is confusing. However, given the problem statement, the code as written should be correct.

Now, the user wants the code generated, but also to follow test-driven development, generating unit tests first. But the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, the initial instruction says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's main request is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. But the tips are for the assistant's own process. However, the user says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the tests are not needed here. Wait, the user's instruction says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. The tips are for the assistant's own process, but the final answer is the code.

So the code for the function is as I wrote above.

But let me check for possible errors. For example, if vertices is a list of tuples, then the code will return a list of tuples of tuples. For example, if vertices is [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)], then the output would be [ ((0,1), (0,0), (1,0)), ((0,0), (1,0), (0,1)), ((1,0), (0,1), (0,0)) ].

Yes, that seems correct.

Another test case: vertices with one element. Suppose vertices = [ (0,0) ]. Then len_vertices is 1. For i=0, prev_index is (0-1) % 1 = 0. next_index is (0+1) %1 = 0. So the tuple is ( (0,0), (0,0), (0,0) ). So the output is [ ( (0,0), (0,0), (0,0) ) ].

But according to the problem statement, it's a polygon. A polygon should have at least 3 vertices. However, the code handles any input.

So the code seems correct. So the final code is as written.
