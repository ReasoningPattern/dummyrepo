Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _create_in_regex method based on the given function signature and docstring. The method is supposed to return a regular expression pattern (re.Pattern) that matches an "in-style" parameter. But what exactly is an "in-style" parameter? The docstring doesn't specify, so I might need to make some assumptions here.

First, maybe "in-style" refers to parameters that are in a certain format, like a list of values separated by commas, perhaps enclosed in parentheses or something. For example, something like (value1, value2, value3). Or maybe it's parameters that are in a specific syntax, like using the 'in' keyword in a query, such as 'in (1, 2, 3)'.

Alternatively, maybe it's about parameters that are in a format that includes a list, like "values in [1, 2, 3]". But without more context, it's a bit challenging. Since the user hasn't provided examples, I'll have to think of common regex patterns that might be used for such parameters.

Let me think about possible scenarios. For instance, in SQL, an IN clause might look like 'IN (1, 2, 3)'. So maybe the regex is supposed to match such a pattern. Or perhaps it's for a function parameter that takes a list, like 'values in [1, 2, 3]'.

Alternatively, maybe the "in-style" refers to parameters that are in a specific format, such as a comma-separated list enclosed in parentheses. Let's assume that for now. So the regex would need to match something like 'IN (value1, value2, value3)'.

But the method is named _create_in_regex, which suggests it's part of a larger class, perhaps related to parsing or validating parameters. The method returns a compiled regex pattern.

So, the regex might need to capture the 'IN' keyword followed by a list of values. Let's consider that. The regex could be something like r'IN\s*\(\s*([^)]+)\s*\)' which captures anything between parentheses after 'IN', allowing for optional whitespace.

But maybe the actual requirement is different. Since the user hasn't provided examples, I need to make an educated guess. Another possibility is that the "in-style" parameters are those that are in a specific format, such as a list of strings or numbers, possibly with quotes.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex is meant to match a parameter that is in a format like 'in: value1, value2', but that's speculative.

Since the user hasn't provided examples, perhaps the best approach is to create a regex that matches a common in-style parameter format, such as the SQL IN clause. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So, the regex pattern could be something like r'IN\s*\(\s*(?:[^)]+|\([^)]+\))*\s*\)', but that might be too simplistic. Alternatively, a more precise pattern that captures the values inside the parentheses.

Wait, but the method is called _create_in_regex, which might be part of a class that's generating regex patterns for different parameter styles. For example, maybe there's an 'eq' style for equals, 'in' style for IN clauses, etc.

Assuming that, the regex should match the IN clause. Let's think of the pattern as starting with 'IN' followed by parentheses containing a list of values separated by commas. So the regex could be:

r'IN\s*\(\s*([^)]+)\s*\)'

But this would capture everything inside the parentheses. However, if there are nested parentheses, this might not work. But perhaps for simplicity, we'll assume that the values don't contain closing parentheses.

Alternatively, using a non-greedy approach: r'IN\s*\(\s*.*?\s*\)' but that might not be precise.

Alternatively, using a more precise regex that matches the list of values. For example, values separated by commas, possibly with optional whitespace.

So, maybe the regex is:

r'IN\s*\(\s*(?:[^,]+(?:,\s*[^,]+)*|\s*)\s*\)'

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the actual implementation is simpler. Let's think about the most straightforward case.

If the in-style parameter is something like 'IN (1, 2, 3)', then the regex could be:

pattern = re.compile(r'IN\s*\(\s*([^)]+)\s*\)')

This would capture the part inside the parentheses. However, the exact requirements are unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the method is part of a parser that's looking for parameters in a certain format, such as 'in: [1, 2, 3]' or similar. But again, without examples, it's hard to tell.

Another approach is to look at the return type: it returns a re.Pattern. So the method compiles a regex pattern.

Given that, perhaps the code would be:

import re

def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
    pattern = r'IN\s*\(\s*([^)]+)\s*\)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

But this is just a guess. However, since the user hasn't provided examples, this is as good as any.

Alternatively, maybe the in-style parameters are those that are in a list format, such as [value1, value2], and the regex is for matching that. So the pattern could be r'\[.*?\]'.

But again, without more context, it's challenging. However, given the method name and the return type, the code would involve compiling a regex pattern.

So, the code would likely involve importing re, defining the pattern, and returning re.compile(...).

Now, considering test-driven development, the user mentioned generating unit tests first. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not the tests. However, the user's initial message says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the user wants the code for the _create_in_regex method. But since the docstring is vague, I need to make an assumption about what the regex should look like.

Another possibility is that the in-style parameters are those that are in a format like 'in (value)', so the regex would match that. For example, the pattern could be r'in\s*\([^)]+\)'.

But again, without more context, it's hard to know. However, given that the method is named _create_in_regex, perhaps it's part of a class that generates regex patterns for different parameter types, such as 'eq', 'in', 'like', etc.

In that case, the 'in' style might be for parameters that are lists, like 'IN (1, 2, 3)', so the regex would capture that.

So, the code would be:

import re

def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
    """
    Create the in-style parameter regular expression.

    Returns the in-style parameter regular expression (:class:`re.Pattern`).
    """
    pattern = r'IN\s*\(\s*([^)]+)\s*\)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. However, since the user hasn't provided examples, this is a best guess. Another possibility is that the regex is case-insensitive, but the docstring doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, maybe the regex is supposed to match a parameter that is in a specific format, such as a list of values separated by commas, and the method is part of a parser that extracts those values.

In any case, the code would involve compiling a regex pattern that matches the in-style parameters as per the assumptions made.
