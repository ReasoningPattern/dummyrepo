Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function protocol_handlers based on the given signature and docstring. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so I should start by writing unit tests first.

First, let me think about what the function does. The docstring says it returns different Bolt protocol handlers based on the protocol_version. So, the function is probably part of a class, maybe a class that manages different protocol versions. The function is a class method since it takes 'cls' as the first parameter.

For the tests, I need to create a test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase. The tests should check different protocol versions and ensure the correct handler is returned. Maybe the function returns instances of different handler classes depending on the version.

Let me outline possible test cases. For example, if protocol_version is 1, return HandlerV1; if 2, HandlerV2; default might be a latest version. Also, test for None, which might default to the latest.

Now, writing the tests. I'll need to mock the handler classes since they might not be defined yet. Using unittest.mock, I can create MagicMock instances for each handler. Then, in the test, I can check if the correct handler is instantiated.

Next, the actual implementation. The function is a class method, so it should be defined with @classmethod. The function needs to check the protocol_version and return the appropriate handler. Maybe the handlers are stored in a dictionary or a series of if-elif statements.

I should consider possible versions. Let's say versions 1, 2, 3, and default to 3 if not specified. The handlers could be attributes of the class, like cls.HandlerV1, etc.

Putting it all together, the code would have the class method checking the protocol_version and returning the corresponding handler instance. The tests would verify that each version returns the correct handler.

Wait, the original function doesn't have a return type specified, but the docstring says it returns different handlers. So the function probably returns an instance of a handler class.

I need to make sure that the code is structured properly. The tests should be in a separate test file, but since the user wants the code generated, maybe include the test class and the actual implementation.

So, the final code will have the tests first, then the implementation. The tests use mocks to simulate the handlers, and the actual code uses conditional checks to return the right handler based on the version.
