Okay, I need to generate Python code for the add_rendition method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the method assigns the filepath obtained by invoking filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions. So, the _renditions is probably a dictionary attribute of the class that maps language codes to file paths. The method takes a lang (like 'en' for English) and a file_path, then stores that path in _renditions under the given lang key.

Wait, but the parameters are lang and file_path. Wait, the first line of the docstring says "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions". Wait, maybe there's a typo here. The wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

The original docstring says: "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions in the class." So perhaps the method is supposed to take the file_path, but maybe the actual path is determined by calling a filepath() method? Or maybe the file_path is passed in, and it's stored under the lang key in _renditions.

Wait, the parameters are lang and file_path. So maybe the method is supposed to add an entry to _renditions where the key is lang and the value is file_path. But the docstring mentions "invoke by filepath()", which might be a misunderstanding. Maybe the original intention was that the file_path is obtained by calling a filepath() method, but the method's parameters include file_path. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the docstring is incorrect, and the method is supposed to take the lang and file_path, and store the file_path in _renditions under the lang key. That would make sense. So the method would do something like self._renditions[lang] = file_path.

But then why mention filepath()? Maybe the original code had a filepath() method that generates the path based on some parameters, but in this case, the method is given the file_path directly. Maybe the docstring is a bit misleading, but based on the parameters, the method is adding the provided file_path to the _renditions dictionary under the given lang.

So, assuming that, the code would be straightforward. The method would assign self._renditions[lang] = file_path. But I need to make sure that _renditions is initialized as a dictionary in the class. However, the user hasn't provided the full class code, so perhaps that's part of the code to generate.

Wait, the function is a method of a class (since it has self as the first parameter). So the class likely has an _renditions attribute. So the code for add_rendition would be:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    self._renditions[lang] = file_path

But maybe there's more to it. For example, maybe the filepath() method is supposed to be called to generate the file_path. But the parameters include file_path, which suggests that it's passed in. The docstring's wording is confusing. Let me re-examine the docstring:

"Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions in the class."

Wait, perhaps the original intention is that the method calls filepath() (a method of the class) to get the file path, and then assigns that to the lang key in _renditions. But in that case, the method wouldn't take a file_path parameter. So maybe the docstring is incorrect, or the parameters are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to take the lang and then use the filepath() method to generate the path, which is then stored in _renditions. But the current parameters include file_path, which would be redundant. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the docstring is trying to say that the method assigns the file_path (which is obtained by invoking the filepath() method) to the lang key in _renditions. But in that case, the method would not take a file_path parameter. So perhaps the parameters are wrong, or the docstring is wrong.

But given the function signature provided, the parameters are lang and file_path. So the method is supposed to take those two parameters and assign the file_path to the lang key in _renditions. So the code would be as simple as:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    self._renditions[lang] = file_path

But I need to make sure that _renditions is initialized. So perhaps in the class, there's an __init__ method that initializes self._renditions as a dictionary. However, the user hasn't provided that code, so maybe that's part of the code to generate. But the user's request is to generate the code for the add_rendition method based on the given signature and docstring.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to call a filepath() method, which returns the path, and then store that. For example:

def add_rendition(self, lang):
    self._renditions[lang] = self.filepath()

But the parameters include file_path, which would not be used in that case. So there's a discrepancy between the parameters and the docstring.

This is a bit of a problem. The user's docstring says that the method assigns the filepath obtained by invoking filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions. But the method's parameters include file_path. That suggests that perhaps the docstring is incorrect, or the parameters are incorrect.

But since the user provided the function signature with parameters (lang, file_path), I have to go with that. So the method is supposed to take lang and file_path, and assign the file_path to the lang key in _renditions. Therefore, the code is straightforward.

Now, the user also mentioned that I should follow test-driven development, generating unit tests first. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown format. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips suggest to first generate tests. But the user's main request is to generate the code for the add_rendition method, not the tests. However, the user's initial message says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So perhaps the user wants the actual implementation of the add_rendition method, not the tests. But the tips suggest to generate tests first. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code is the method itself, not the tests.

So, proceeding with writing the method. The code would be:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    """
    Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions in the class.
    """
    self._renditions[lang] = file_path

But wait, the docstring mentions "invoke by filepath()", which suggests that the file_path is obtained by calling a method named filepath(). But in the current code, the method is taking file_path as a parameter. So there's a contradiction here. Maybe the docstring is wrong, or the parameters are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to call self.filepath() to get the path, and then assign that to the lang key. In that case, the method would not take a file_path parameter. But the given function signature includes file_path as a parameter. So this is conflicting.

This is a problem. How to resolve this?

Maybe the docstring is incorrect. For example, maybe it should say that the method assigns the file_path (passed as an argument) to the lang key in _renditions. In that case, the code is correct as written.

Alternatively, maybe the docstring is correct, and the parameters are wrong. For example, the method should not take file_path as a parameter, but instead call self.filepath() to get the path. But the given function signature has file_path as a parameter. This is conflicting.

Since the user provided the function signature with parameters (lang, file_path), I have to assume that the method is supposed to take those parameters. So the docstring might have a typo. Perhaps the original intention was to say that the method assigns the file_path (provided as an argument) to the lang key in _renditions. In that case, the code is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the docstring is correct, and the method should call self.filepath() to get the path, but the parameters are wrong. But the user provided the parameters, so I have to follow that.

In any case, based on the given function signature and the docstring, the most logical code is to assign the file_path parameter to the lang key in _renditions. Therefore, the code would be as above.

Now, considering that _renditions must be a dictionary attribute of the class. So the class should have something like:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._renditions = {}

    def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
        self._renditions[lang] = file_path

But the user hasn't provided the full class code. However, the task is to generate the code for the add_rendition method. So the code for that method is as above.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is the method itself, not the entire class. Therefore, the code is:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    """
    Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions in the class.
    """
    self._renditions[lang] = file_path

But the docstring mentions "invoke by filepath()", which is confusing. Maybe the docstring should say that the method assigns the file_path (passed as an argument) to the lang key in _renditions. But given the current docstring, perhaps the user intended that the method calls a filepath() method to get the path. However, the parameters don't align with that.

Alternatively, maybe the docstring is trying to say that the file_path is obtained by invoking the filepath() method of the class. In that case, the method should not take a file_path parameter, but instead call self.filepath() to get it. But the function signature includes file_path as a parameter, which is conflicting.

This is a bit of a dilemma. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code that matches the function signature and the assumption that the docstring may have a typo. So the code is as above.
