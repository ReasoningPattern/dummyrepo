Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called lfu_cache that implements an LFU cache. Let me think about how to approach this. The function is supposed to memoize the results of a function, but using the LFU algorithm to evict the least frequently used items when the cache reaches its maxsize.

First, I remember that LFU caches track the frequency of each key. When a key is accessed, its frequency is incremented. When evicting, the least frequent items are removed. But if there's a tie, the least recently used among them might be chosen, but the problem statement here just says LFU, so maybe I don't need to handle that part unless specified.

The decorator needs to wrap a function. So, the structure would be similar to the built-in lru_cache, but with LFU logic.

Let me think about the components needed:

1. A cache structure to store the keys, their values, and their frequencies.
2. A way to track the frequency of each key.
3. When a key is accessed (either for a hit or a miss), update its frequency.
4. When the cache is full, evict the least frequent key.

For the data structures, perhaps using a dictionary to map keys to their values and frequencies. But to efficiently find the least frequent, maybe a heap or some kind of frequency table. However, maintaining a heap can be tricky when frequencies change.

Alternatively, I can have a dictionary that maps frequency counts to a list of keys with that frequency. And then keep track of the minimum frequency. When a key is accessed, increment its frequency, and move it to the next frequency bucket. When evicting, pick the key with the lowest frequency, and if there are multiple, maybe the one that was least recently used (but the problem statement doesn't mention that, so maybe just pick any).

Wait, but for LFU, when frequencies are the same, the least recently used is typically considered. But the problem says "based on a Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithm." So maybe the standard LFU approach, which in case of tie, uses the least recently used.

But implementing that might complicate things. Maybe the problem expects a basic LFU without handling the tie-breaker with LRU. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the LFU cache here is simplified. Let's proceed with the basic approach.

So, for the cache:

- A dictionary (cache) that maps keys to their values.
- A frequency dictionary (freq) that maps keys to their access counts.
- A frequency count dictionary (freq_count) that maps frequency values to the number of keys with that frequency. This helps in knowing which frequencies are present and which is the minimum.
- A min_freq variable to track the current minimum frequency.

When a key is accessed:

- If it's already in the cache, increment its frequency. Then, decrement the count in freq_count for the old frequency. If that count becomes zero, remove the frequency from freq_count. Then, increment the count for the new frequency (old +1). Also, update the min_freq if necessary (if the old frequency was the min and its count is now zero, then min_freq increases by 1? Or maybe not, since there could be other frequencies with the same min).

Wait, perhaps the min_freq is maintained as the minimum frequency in the cache. When a key is accessed, if it's a hit, its frequency increases. So the min_freq can't decrease. However, when a key is evicted, the min_freq may decrease.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The min_freq is the smallest frequency among all keys in the cache. When a key is accessed (hit), its frequency increases. So the min_freq can only stay the same or increase. Because the key's frequency is now higher, but other keys may have the same min_freq.

But when evicting, we need to find the key with the min_freq. So, perhaps the min_freq is tracked, and when a key is accessed, if it was the min_freq and after incrementing, if there are no more keys with that min_freq, then min_freq is increased.

This seems a bit complex. Let me think of an example.

Suppose the cache has keys with frequencies 1, 2, 3. The min_freq is 1. If a key with frequency 1 is accessed, its frequency becomes 2. Now, the min_freq is still 1 if there are other keys with frequency 1. If that was the only key with frequency 1, then min_freq becomes 2.

So, the min_freq variable needs to be updated accordingly.

Now, for the eviction process. When the cache is full, we need to find the key with the least frequency. If multiple keys have that frequency, we need to pick one. For simplicity, perhaps we can use a list for each frequency in the freq_count, and when evicting, pick the first one (or any), but to track the order, maybe we need to use an LRU approach for the same frequency. But the problem statement doesn't mention that, so perhaps the initial implementation can just pick any key with the min frequency.

But for the purpose of this problem, maybe that's acceptable.

So, the data structures:

- cache: dict[key] = value
- freq: dict[key] = count
- freq_count: dict[count] = set of keys with that count
- min_freq: int

But for the freq_count, perhaps using a defaultdict of lists or something similar.

Now, when a key is accessed:

If it's in the cache:

- Get its current count from freq.
- Remove it from freq_count[count] (decrement the count in the set, or remove if empty).
- If freq_count[count] becomes empty, remove the count from freq_count.
- Increment the count in freq for the key.
- Add the key to freq_count[count + 1].
- Update min_freq if necessary (if the old count was min_freq and freq_count for that count is now empty, then min_freq += 1? Or check if there are any keys with min_freq? Maybe not, because when you increment a key's count, the min_freq can't decrease. So if the old count was the min_freq and after removal, there are no keys with that count, then the new min_freq is the next higher count. But how to track that? Maybe not track min_freq, but when evicting, find the minimum key in freq_count.

But that might be computationally expensive. Alternatively, track min_freq.

Alternatively, when evicting, we can find the minimum frequency in freq_count's keys, which is the min_freq.

But for efficiency, tracking min_freq would be better.

So, during the access:

If the key is in the cache:

old_count = freq[key]
if freq_count[old_count] has only this key, then remove old_count from freq_count.
else, remove the key from the set for old_count.

Then, new_count = old_count + 1
add the key to freq_count[new_count]

if old_count was the min_freq and freq_count[old_count] is now empty, then min_freq = new_count? Or find the new min_freq by checking the keys in freq_count.

But that might be complicated. Maybe it's easier to not track min_freq and just find the minimum frequency each time we need to evict. However, that could be O(n) time, which may not be efficient for large caches, but for the scope of this problem, perhaps acceptable.

Alternatively, track min_freq and update it when necessary.

But perhaps for simplicity, during eviction, we can get the minimum frequency from the freq_count keys.

So, when evicting, we get the minimum key in freq_count, which is the min frequency. Then, pick a key from that frequency's set (say, the first one) and remove it.

Now, for the cache implementation.

The decorator will need to wrap the function. So, the lfu_cache decorator will return a function that, when called, checks if the arguments are in the cache. If so, returns the cached value. Otherwise, computes it, adds it to the cache, and so on.

But the parameters need to be hashable. Also, the typed parameter is part of the signature. The typed argument determines whether different types are considered distinct. For example, 1 and 1.0 would be considered different if typed is True.

So, the key for the cache should be generated based on the arguments and their types if typed is True.

So, the key can be generated using the functools.lru_cache approach, where the key is a tuple of the arguments, with types considered if typed is True.

But for the LFU cache, the key generation is similar to lru_cache. So, perhaps using the same method as lru_cache for generating the key.

So, the code would need to generate a key based on the arguments, considering the typed parameter.

Now, putting this together.

The steps for the decorator:

1. When the decorator is called, it creates a cache instance for the wrapped function.

2. The wrapped function will check if the arguments (with key generation) are in the cache.

3. If present, increment the frequency, update the freq_count, etc.

4. If not present, compute the value, add it to the cache, and initialize its frequency to 1.

5. When adding a new entry, if the cache is at maxsize, evict the least frequent key.

Now, the actual code structure.

The lfu_cache function is a decorator factory, which returns a decorator. The decorator is a function that wraps the original function.

So, the code would look something like:

def lfu_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # cache implementation here
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But the cache needs to be per function, so each decorated function has its own cache.

Now, implementing the cache:

Each cache instance will have:

- A dictionary (cache) to store the key-value pairs.
- A dictionary (freq) to track the frequency of each key.
- A dictionary (freq_count) that maps frequency counts to a list of keys with that frequency.
- A variable (size) to track the current number of items in the cache.
- The maxsize parameter.

Wait, but for the freq_count, perhaps using a defaultdict of lists. For example, freq_count is a dictionary where keys are frequencies, and values are sets or lists of keys with that frequency.

But for efficient removal, perhaps using a collections.defaultdict(set) for freq_count.

So, for example, when a key is accessed, we remove it from the old frequency's set, add it to the new frequency's set.

Now, the code outline for the decorator:

Inside the decorator function:

Initialize cache = {}
freq = defaultdict(int)
freq_count = defaultdict(set)
size = 0
maxsize = ... (the parameter passed to the decorator)
typed = ... (the parameter passed)

Wait, but for the key generation, need to handle the typed parameter. How to generate the key?

The standard approach for lru_cache is to use a tuple of the arguments, with types considered if typed is True. So, for example, for arguments (1, 2), and typed=True, the key would be (1, 2), but if the arguments are (1, 1.0), then they are considered different if typed is True.

So, the key can be generated by converting the arguments into a tuple, and for each argument, if typed is True, include the type in the key. For example, for an argument x, the key component would be (x, type(x)) if typed is True, else just x.

But how to do that in Python? Well, the lru_cache uses a method called _make_key which does that. However, for this problem, I need to implement that.

Alternatively, I can use the same approach as functools.lru_cache's key generation.

But for brevity, perhaps I can use the inspect module to get the arguments, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the key is generated as a tuple of the arguments, with the type included if typed is True. For example, for each argument, if typed is True, then the key is (arg, type(arg)), else just arg.

But how to handle mutable types? Well, the same as lru_cache: the arguments must be hashable. So, the key generation would be similar.

So, the code for generating the key would be:

def make_key(args, kwargs, typed):
    key = []
    # process args
    for arg in args:
        if typed:
            key.append( (arg, type(arg)) )
        else:
            key.append(arg)
    # process kwargs
    for k in sorted(kwargs.keys()):
        v = kwargs[k]
        if typed:
            key.append( (k, v, type(v)) )
        else:
            key.append( (k, v) )
    return tuple(key)

Wait, but the standard lru_cache uses the parameters as they are, but for keyword arguments, the keys are sorted to ensure consistency. So, for the key generation, the code should handle both positional and keyword arguments, and sort the keyword arguments by their names.

So, the make_key function would generate a tuple that uniquely identifies the function call based on the arguments and their types if typed is True.

But implementing that is a bit involved. However, since the problem says that the user is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the code can use the same approach as lru_cache for key generation.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I can use the following approach:

Inside the wrapper function, when the function is called, generate the key by combining the arguments and keyword arguments, considering the typed parameter.

So, in code:

def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    # generate key
    key = ...
    if key in cache:
        # handle hit
    else:
        # handle miss, compute value, add to cache

But how to generate the key? Let's think.

The standard approach for lru_cache is to use the parameters as they are, but with the typed flag. So, for example, for a function f(a, b), the key is (a, b) if typed is False, or (a, type(a), b, type(b)) if typed is True. However, for keyword arguments, the keys are sorted to ensure that the same arguments in different order (for keyword args) are considered the same.

So, perhaps the code can be:

from functools import wraps

def lfu_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # generate key
            key = []
            # process args
            for arg in args:
                if typed:
                    key.append( (arg, type(arg)) )
                else:
                    key.append(arg)
            # process kwargs
            for k in sorted(kwargs.keys()):
                v = kwargs[k]
                if typed:
                    key.append( (k, v, type(v)) )
                else:
                    key.append( (k, v) )
            key = tuple(key)
            # check if key is in cache
            if key in cache:
                # increment frequency
                # update freq_count
                # return cached value
            else:
                # compute value
                value = func(*args, **kwargs)
                # add to cache
                # check size
                # if over maxsize, evict
                # update freq, freq_count, etc.
                return value
        # initialize cache, freq, freq_count, etc.
        # need to have these variables inside the decorator's scope
        # but how? Because the wrapper is inside the decorator, which is inside lfu_cache.
        # So, the variables cache, freq, freq_count, size, etc. need to be initialized inside the decorator.
        # So, inside the decorator function:
        cache = {}
        freq = {}
        freq_count = defaultdict(set)
        size = 0
        # but then, when the wrapper is called, it can access these variables.
        # However, in Python, variables in the outer scope can be accessed in the inner function.
        # So, the code inside the decorator would have these variables.
        # But how to handle the initial setup?

        # Also, the maxsize is passed to the decorator, so it's available in the decorator's scope.

        # Now, the code for handling the hit and miss.

        # So, inside the wrapper:

        # For the hit case:
        # get the value from cache
        # increment the frequency of the key
        # remove the key from freq_count[old_freq]
        # add to freq_count[new_freq]

        # For the miss case:
        # compute value
        # add to cache
        # add to freq with count 1
        # add to freq_count[1]
        # increment size
        # if size exceeds maxsize, evict

        # So, the code inside the wrapper:

        # But the variables cache, freq, freq_count, size are in the decorator's scope.

        # Now, the problem is that when the wrapper is called, it can access these variables.

        # Let's proceed with writing the code.

        # However, the initial code for the decorator would have to initialize these variables.

        # So, inside the decorator:

        # cache is a dictionary
        # freq is a dictionary mapping keys to their frequencies
        # freq_count is a defaultdict(set) mapping frequencies to sets of keys
        # size is the current number of items in the cache
        # maxsize is the parameter passed to the decorator

        # So, inside the decorator:

        # Now, the code for the hit:

        # if key in cache:
        #     old_freq = freq[key]
        #     # remove from freq_count[old_freq]
        #     freq_count[old_freq].remove(key)
        #     if not freq_count[old_freq]:
        #         del freq_count[old_freq]
        #     # increment frequency
        #     new_freq = old_freq + 1
        #     freq[key] = new_freq
        #     # add to freq_count[new_freq]
        #     freq_count[new_freq].add(key)
        #     # return the value
        #     return cache[key]

        # For the miss:

        # value = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # cache[key] = value
        # freq[key] = 1
        # freq_count[1].add(key)
        # size += 1
        # if size > maxsize:
        #     # evict
        #     # find the min frequency in freq_count
        #     min_freq = min(freq_count.keys())
        #     # get a key from freq_count[min_freq]
        #     evict_key = next(iter(freq_count[min_freq]))
        #     # remove from cache, freq, freq_count
        #     del cache[evict_key]
        #     del freq[evict_key]
        #     freq_count[min_freq].remove(evict_key)
        #     if not freq_count[min_freq]:
        #         del freq_count[min_freq]
        #     size -= 1
        # return value

        # However, there's a problem here: when the maxsize is set to 0, but the code should handle that. Also, if maxsize is None (unbounded), but the original function's signature says maxsize=128, so perhaps the code should handle maxsize as a positive integer or None.

        # Wait, the original function's signature says maxsize=128, but in Python's lru_cache, maxsize can be None for unlimited. However, the problem's docstring says "saves up to `maxsize` results", so perhaps maxsize is a positive integer. However, the code should handle if maxsize is 0 or None, but the problem may not require that. For the scope of this problem, perhaps assume that maxsize is a positive integer.

        # Now, the code for the decorator:

        # Also, need to handle when maxsize is 0, but that's probably not required.

        # Also, for the case when the cache is not full (size < maxsize), no eviction is needed.

        # Now, putting this together in code.

        # However, the code inside the decorator function (the wrapper) needs to have access to the variables cache, freq, freq_count, size, and maxsize.

        # Now, the code for the decorator:

        # But in Python, the variables cache, freq, etc. are in the scope of the decorator function, which is outside the wrapper function. So, the wrapper can access them.

        # Now, the code for the decorator:

        # Also, need to import defaultdict from collections.

        # So, the code would be:

        from collections import defaultdict

        # inside the decorator function:

        cache = {}
        freq = {}
        freq_count = defaultdict(set)
        size = 0
        maxsize = ... # the parameter passed to the decorator

        # But how to handle the maxsize? The decorator's maxsize is passed as an argument to lfu_cache.

        # So, inside the decorator function, the maxsize is known.

        # Now, the code for the wrapper function.

        # Also, the code needs to handle when the maxsize is 0. For example, if maxsize is 0, the cache cannot store any items. But the problem says maxsize=128 by default, but the code should handle the case when maxsize is 0.

        # Now, putting all together.

        # However, there's a problem with the initial code: when a key is added to the cache, it's added to cache, and freq, and freq_count. Also, when evicting, the code must remove the key from all three structures.

        # Now, the code:

        # Also, need to handle the case when the maxsize is set to 0. But perhaps the code can check if maxsize is 0, and in that case, not cache anything.

        # Now, the code for the wrapper function.

        # Also, note that for the initial code, when the decorator is called, the variables cache, freq, etc. are initialized for each decorated function.

        # Now, putting all this into code.

        # But there's a problem with the code: in the case of a hit, the code increments the frequency, but the code for the hit is inside the wrapper function.

        # So, the full code would be:

                        nonlocal size
                        size += 1
                        # Check if eviction is needed
                        if size > maxsize:
                            # Evict
                            # Find min frequency
                            min_freq = min(freq_count.keys())
                            # Get a key from the min_freq group
                            evict_key = next(iter(freq_count[min_freq]))
                            # Remove from cache, freq, freq_count
                            del cache[evict_key]
                            del freq[evict_key]
                            freq_count[min_freq].discard(evict_key)
                            if not freq_count[min_freq]:
                                del freq_count[min_freq]
                            size -= 1
                        return value
                # Initialize cache, freq, etc.
                cache = {}
                freq = {}
                freq_count = defaultdict(set)
                size = 0
                return wrapper
            return decorator

        # Wait, but in the code above, the variables cache, freq, etc. are initialized inside the decorator function. However, the wrapper function is defined inside the decorator function, and the variables are in the same scope. So, the wrapper can access them.

        # However, in the code above, the 'nonlocal size' is used in the else clause. But 'size' is declared in the decorator function's scope. The wrapper is inside the decorator function, so 'nonlocal size' would refer to the 'size' variable in the decorator's scope.

        # But in Python, variables in the outer scope can be accessed if they are not modified. However, if you want to modify them (like incrementing size), you need to declare them as nonlocal.

        # So, in the code above, inside the else clause, when we do 'size += 1', we need to have 'nonlocal size' declared.

        # However, in the code above, the 'nonlocal size' is inside the else clause. But in Python, the 'nonlocal' declaration must be at the top of the function. So, the code would need to have 'nonlocal size' at the beginning of the wrapper function.

        # But in the code above, the 'nonlocal size' is inside the else block. That's not allowed. So, the code must declare 'nonlocal size' at the start of the wrapper function.

        # So, the code should be modified to:

        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            nonlocal size
            # ... rest of the code

        But wait, the 'nonlocal' declaration is used to refer to variables in the enclosing scopes. However, in this case, the 'size' variable is in the decorator's scope, which is the scope of the decorator function. The wrapper function is inside the decorator function, so 'nonlocal size' would refer to the 'size' variable in the decorator's scope.

        However, in Python, if you have nested functions, and you want to modify a variable in the outer scope, you need to declare it as nonlocal. But in this case, the 'size' variable is initialized in the decorator function's scope. So, inside the wrapper function, when you do 'size += 1', you need to have 'nonlocal size' declared at the top of the wrapper function.

        So, the code should have:

        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            nonlocal size
            # ... rest of the code

        But this is only possible if the 'size' variable is in an enclosing scope. However, in the code as written, the 'size' variable is declared inside the decorator function, which is the scope of the decorator. The wrapper is inside the decorator function, so the 'nonlocal size' would refer to the 'size' variable in the decorator's scope.

        However, in Python, the 'nonlocal' declaration can only refer to variables in enclosing scopes, not the global scope. So, in this case, it should work.

        But there's another problem: the 'cache', 'freq', 'freq_count', and 'size' variables are declared inside the decorator function, which is the scope of the decorator. The wrapper function is inside the decorator function, so it can access those variables.

        However, in the code above, the 'nonlocal size' is inside the wrapper function, which is allowed.

        Now, the code for the decorator function:

        But there's another problem: when the wrapper is called, the 'size' variable is in the decorator's scope. However, in the code above, the 'size' is initialized as 0 in the decorator function. So, the 'nonlocal size' in the wrapper function refers to that variable.

        Now, the code seems okay, but there are some possible issues:

        - When the maxsize is 0, the code will not cache anything. However, in that case, when size is 0, adding a new item would make size 1, which is greater than 0, leading to eviction. But if maxsize is 0, then the code will evict immediately, leading to the cache being empty again. So, the code would not cache anything, which is correct.

        - When the maxsize is set to a value larger than the number of possible keys, the code will cache them all.

        Now, testing for some cases.

        For example, if a key is accessed multiple times, its frequency increases, and it's less likely to be evicted.

        Now, the code for the evict step uses min(freq_count.keys()), which gives the minimum frequency. Then, it picks the first key in that set.

        However, when freq_count is empty, that would be a problem, but since the code only evicts when size > maxsize, and the initial size is 0, and adding items increases size, the code should not have an empty freq_count when evicting.

        Now, possible issues:

        - When the cache is empty, and adding a new item, size becomes 1. If maxsize is 1, no eviction occurs. But if maxsize is 0, then adding the item would trigger eviction, leading to the cache being empty again.

        Now, the code for the decorator function:

        However, in the code above, the 'cache', 'freq', 'freq_count', and 'size' variables are initialized inside the decorator function. But the code for the wrapper function is inside the decorator function, so it can access them.

        Now, the code may have a problem with the 'nonlocal size' declaration. Because the 'size' variable is declared in the decorator function's scope, which is the scope of the decorator function. The wrapper function is inside the decorator function, so the 'nonlocal size' declaration refers to that variable.

        However, in Python, if you have a nested function, and you want to modify a variable in the outer scope, you need to declare it as nonlocal. But in this case, the 'size' variable is declared in the decorator's scope, which is the outer scope of the wrapper function. So, the 'nonlocal size' is correct.

        Now, the code for the decorator function:

        But in the code above, the 'nonlocal size' is inside the wrapper function. However, the 'nonlocal' declaration must be at the top of the function. So, the code should have:

        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            nonlocal size
            # ... rest of the code

        But in the code I wrote earlier, the 'nonlocal size' is inside the else clause. That's not allowed. So, the code should have 'nonlocal size' at the start of the wrapper function.

        So, the code for the wrapper function should be:

        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            nonlocal size
            # generate key
            # ... rest of the code

        Now, this would allow the 'size' variable to be modified inside the wrapper function.

        Now, another possible issue: when the key is generated, if the arguments are unhashable, the code will crash. But that's the same as the standard lru_cache, which requires the arguments to be hashable.

        Now, the code for the key generation may have issues with keyword arguments. For example, the code uses sorted(kwargs.keys()) to ensure that the same keyword arguments in different order are considered the same. That's correct.

        Now, the code for the decorator function:

        Also, the 'maxsize' parameter is passed to the decorator, and used in the eviction step.

        Now, the code for the decorator function may have a problem with the initial setup of 'cache', 'freq', etc. For example, the code initializes them inside the decorator function, which is correct.

        Now, the code for the 'freq_count' uses defaultdict(set), which is correct.

        Now, the code for the hit case uses 'freq_count[old_freq].discard(key)' instead of 'remove' to avoid KeyError if the key is not present. However, since the key is in the cache, and the freq is tracked, this should be safe. But perhaps using 'discard' is safer.

        Now, the code for the hit case:

        freq_count[old_freq].discard(key)
        if not freq_count[old_freq]:
            del freq_count[old_freq]

        This is correct.

        Now, the code for the miss case:

        Adding the key to the cache, initializing its frequency to 1, and adding it to freq_count[1].

        Now, when evicting, the code finds the min frequency, then selects a key from that frequency's set.

        Now, the code for the evict step:

        min_freq = min(freq_count.keys())

        However, if the freq_count is empty, this would crash. But since the code only evicts when size > maxsize, and the size is at least 1 (since we added a new item and size was increased by 1), then freq_count must have at least one entry. So, this should be safe.

        Now, the code for the evict step:

        evict_key = next(iter(freq_count[min_freq]))

        This gets the first key in the set. It's arbitrary, but that's acceptable for the LFU algorithm.

        Now, after evicting, the code removes the key from cache, freq, and freq_count.

        Now, the code for the 'del freq[evict_key]' is correct.

        Now, the code for the 'freq_count[min_freq].discard(evict_key)' is correct.

        Now, the code for the 'if not freq_count[min_freq]:' checks if the set is empty, and deletes the entry from freq_count.

        Now, the code seems to handle all cases.

        However, there's a possible error in the code: when the maxsize is 0, the code will add the item, increment size to 1, which is greater than 0, so it will evict. The evict step will remove the item, and size becomes 0 again. So, the cache is empty, and the next call will compute the value again. So, for maxsize=0, the cache is effectively disabled.

        Now, testing this code would require writing unit tests. But according to the tips, the user wants to generate the code first, then the tests. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown format.

        Now, the code I've written may have some issues, but it's the best I can think of given the time.

        Now, putting all this together into the Python code.
