Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function fix_namespace_prefix_w. The function's purpose is to replace occurrences of "w:st=" with "w-st=" in the given content. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a string 'content' as input. The task is to replace every instance of "w:st=" with "w-st=". So, the simplest way is to use the str.replace method. Like, content.replace("w:st=", "w-st="). But wait, I should check if there are any edge cases. For example, what if the content is empty? Or if there are no matches? The replace method handles those cases gracefully by returning the original string if no replacements are made.

But wait, the problem says to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=". Let me make sure that the colon is part of the string. So, in the input, whenever there's a substring "w:st=", it should become "w-st=". So yes, using replace with the exact string should work.

Now, the user mentioned to follow test-driven development. So I should first write the unit tests. Let me think about possible test cases.

Test cases:

1. Test case where there are no replacements needed. For example, content is "hello". The output should be "hello".

2. Test case where there's exactly one occurrence. Like content is "w:st=hello", output should be "w-st=hello".

3. Test case with multiple occurrences. For example, "w:st=abc w:st=def" becomes "w-st=abc w-st=def".

4. Test case where the string is empty. Should return empty string.

5. Test case where the string has other parts with 'w:st' but not as a full substring. Like "w:stabc" should remain as is because the replacement is only for "w:st=".

Wait, the replacement is for "w:st=", so the equals sign is part of the target. So in the example "w:stabc", there's no equals sign, so it's not replaced.

Another case: what if there's a partial match? Like "w:st=123", which should be replaced. But "w:st" without the equals sign would not be replaced.

So the replace method is correct here.

Now, writing the unit tests using Python's unittest framework. Let me structure them.

The function is called fix_namespace_prefix_w, so the tests should check that after applying the function, the content is correctly modified.

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, and only the generated code. But the user also mentioned to first generate the tests. So the answer should include both the test code and the implementation.

Wait, the original question says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips say to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the answer should include both the tests and the function implementation.

But the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So I need to write the test code first, then the function.

So, the code would be:

First, the test module, then the function.

But how to structure it. Let me think.

The user probably expects that the code includes the function and the tests. But in Python, the tests would be in a separate test file, but perhaps for the purpose of this exercise, the code would include the function and the tests in the same file.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code is the function and the tests.

So the code would be:

First, the test cases using unittest, then the function.

But the user's example shows that the function is to be written. So the code would be:

Implement the function, and then the tests.

Wait, but the tip says to first generate the tests. So perhaps the code should first have the tests, then the function.

But in practice, the tests would be written before the function. However, in the code submission, the user probably wants the function and the tests.

So putting it all together.

The code would be:

import unittest

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

class TestFixNamespacePrefixW(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_replacement(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("hello"), "hello")
    
    def test_single_replacement(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=hello"), "w-st=hello")
    
    def test_multiple_replacements(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=abc w:st=def"), "w-st=abc w-st=def")
    
    def test_empty_string(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w(""), "")
    
    def test_no_match(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:stabc"), "w:stabc")
    
    def test_partial_match(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=123"), "w-st=123")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

But wait, the user's function is supposed to be generated. The original function's docstring is given. So the code would include the function with the docstring.

So the code would be:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    """
    Replace "w:st=" in content with "w-st=".
    """
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

And then the tests.

But the user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the answer should be the code with the function and the tests.

But perhaps the user wants the tests and the function. However, the initial problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the function. But the tip says to generate tests first. So the answer includes both.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the answer would be the code with the function and the tests.

But perhaps the user expects that the code is the function, and the tests are part of the code. So the code would be as follows.

But in the problem statement, the user provided the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the function with that docstring, and the tests.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

import unittest

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    """
    Replace "w:st=" in content with "w-st=".
    """
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

class TestFixNamespacePrefixW(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_no_replacement(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("hello"), "hello")
    
    def test_single_replacement(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=hello"), "w-st=hello")
    
    def test_multiple_replacements(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=abc w:st=def"), "w-st=abc w-st=def")
    
    def test_empty_string(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w(""), "")
    
    def test_no_match(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:stabc"), "w:stabc")
    
    def test_partial_match(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=123"), "w-st=123")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

But the user may not want the if __name__ == '__main__' part, but it's part of the test code. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So this should be included.

But perhaps the user expects that the code is the function and the tests. So that's the code.
