Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _c_optimizations_ignored based on the given docstring. Let me read the docstring again. It says the function should return True if the environment variable "PURE_PYTHON" is not none and not 0, else return False. Wait, maybe I should check the value of the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable.

First, I need to get the environment variable. In Python, I can use os.environ.get to retrieve it. The function os.environ.get returns None if the variable is not set. So, the condition is: if the value is not None and not equal to '0', then return True. Otherwise, return False.

Wait, the docstring says "get 'PURE_PYTHON' environ is not none and not 0". So, the check is whether the environment variable is present (not None) and its value is not '0'. So, for example, if the variable is set to '1', 'yes', or any non-zero value, it should return True. But if it's set to '0' or not set, return False.

So the code would be something like:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    value = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return value is not None and value != '0'

Wait, but what about case sensitivity? The docstring says "PURE_PYTHON" which is uppercase. So the environment variable name is case-sensitive. So the code is correct as is.

Now, I need to make sure that the function returns True when the environment variable is set to a non-zero value, and False otherwise.

Testing this function would require setting the environment variable. But since the user mentioned test-driven development, maybe I should write unit tests first.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown. However, the tips suggest generating tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. Wait, the initial instruction says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps the tests are not required here, but the function code.

So the code for the function would be as I thought: checking the environment variable. So the code is:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    """
    Return True if get "PURE_PYTHON" environ is not none and not 0, else return False
    """
    value = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return value is not None and value != '0'

Wait, but the docstring says "not none and not 0". So the function returns True when the environment variable is present (not None) and its value is not '0'. So that's correct.

I think that's the correct implementation. Let me check possible edge cases. For example, if the environment variable is set to '0', returns False. If not set, returns False. If set to '1', 'YES', 'abc', etc., returns True. That matches the docstring.

So the code is correct.
