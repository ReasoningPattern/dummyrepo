Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called plugins_manager and it's a method that gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

First, I need to understand what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it retrieves the plugin manager using the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER from the cls._get_service() method. So, the function is probably part of a class, maybe a manager class that handles plugins.

Wait, the function is defined as def plugins_manager(cls):, which suggests it's a class method because of the 'cls' parameter. So, the @classmethod decorator should be used here. That's important. Without the decorator, it might not work as intended.

Now, the actual implementation. The function needs to call cls._get_service() and then access the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. But how is ServiceName defined? It's probably an enum or a class with attributes like PLUGINS_MANAGER. So, the code would be something like:

return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But wait, the original docstring says "via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So maybe cls._get_service() is a method that takes a service name, and ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER is the key to get that service.

So putting it all together, the function would call cls._get_service with ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER as the argument. Therefore, the code would be:

@classmethod
def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName is properly imported or defined. However, the user hasn't provided that part, so maybe it's assumed to be available in the context.

Now, considering the tips, the user mentioned test-driven development. So I should first write unit tests. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. However, the tips suggest generating tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code for the function, not the tests. Wait, the initial instruction says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So perhaps the tests are part of the code generation?

Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So maybe they just want the implementation of the plugins_manager function. But the tips mention TDD, so maybe the user expects the tests as well. However, the original problem didn't mention writing tests, just the function. The user might have confused the steps. Let me check the original query again.

The user provided a function signature and docstring, and wants code generated based on that. The tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests. But the user's main instruction is to generate the code. However, the user might have intended to have both the tests and the code. But the problem says "Output ONLY the code generated", so perhaps just the function code. But maybe the user wants the tests as part of the code. Hmm.

But looking back, the original function is a method that returns the plugin manager. So the code for that method would be as I thought. The tests would involve mocking cls._get_service and checking if it's called correctly. But the user hasn't specified whether they want tests or just the function. However, the initial problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring", which implies the function's code. The tips are just suggestions, but the user might have intended to have the code for the function. So I'll proceed with writing the function code.

So the code would be:

@classmethod
def plugins_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName is accessible. Assuming that ServiceName is an enum or a class with the PLUGINS_MANAGER attribute. Also, the _get_service method is a class method that takes a service name and returns the corresponding service instance.

Therefore, the code should be correct. Now, in Python markdown format, the code would be enclosed in triple backticks with python specified. So the final answer is the code block with the class method.
