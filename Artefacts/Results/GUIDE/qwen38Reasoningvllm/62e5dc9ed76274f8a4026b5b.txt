Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called deprecated that issues a warning when a function or method is called. The user provided a function signature and a docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the decorator should probably use the warnings module. When the decorated function is called, it should trigger a warning with the given message. The warning should be of type DeprecationWarning, maybe. Also, the decorator should still allow the function to work as usual, just with the warning.

So the steps are: create a decorator that, when applied to a function, adds a warning when the function is called. The message is passed to the decorator.

Wait, the function signature is def deprecated(message): which returns a decorator. So the decorator is a function that takes a function and returns a new function. Let me outline this.

The deprecated function takes a message, then returns a decorator. The decorator takes a function, and returns a new function that, when called, issues a warning and then calls the original function.

So the structure would be:

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # issue warning here
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But how to issue the warning? Using warnings.warn, probably. The warning should be a DeprecationWarning, and maybe set the category. Also, the message should include the original message and maybe the name of the function being deprecated.

Wait, the message parameter is the message to be included in the warning. So the decorator should add that message, perhaps with some additional info like the function name.

So in the wrapper, when the function is called, we can generate a warning message that includes the original message and the function's name. For example: "The function {func_name} is deprecated: {message}".

But how to get the function's name? The func parameter is the original function, so func.__name__ would give the name.

So inside the wrapper, we can do:

import warnings

...

warnings.warn(f"The function {func.__name__} is deprecated: {message}", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)

Wait, stacklevel=2 might help in showing the correct line where the warning is issued. But maybe the user wants the warning to be issued at the point of the function call, so stacklevel=2 would point to the decorator's wrapper, but maybe that's okay.

But the user might want the warning to be shown when the function is called, so the stacklevel should be set so that the warning points to the original function's call. Hmm, maybe stacklevel=2 is appropriate here.

So putting it all together:

The decorator function would import warnings, then in the wrapper, issue a warning with the message and the function name.

Now, the unit tests. The user wants test-driven development, so first generate comprehensive unit tests.

What tests do we need? We need to check that when the decorated function is called, a warning is issued. Also, that the function still works as intended.

So for the tests, we can create a sample function, decorate it with deprecated, then call it and check that a warning is raised.

But how to test that a warning is issued? Using the pytest library's warnings module, or the unittest module's TestCase with assertWarns.

So for example, using unittest:

import unittest
import warnings

class TestDeprecatedDecorator(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_deprecated_warning(self):
        @deprecated("This function is deprecated")
        def sample_func():
            pass

        with self.assertWarns(DeprecationWarning):
            sample_func()

    def test_function_still_works(self):
        @deprecated("This function is deprecated")
        def sample_func(x):
            return x + 1

        self.assertEqual(sample_func(2), 3)

But wait, the first test checks that a warning is issued, and the second checks that the function still works.

But how to handle the message? The message in the warning should include the original message and the function name. So in the first test, the warning message should be "The function sample_func is deprecated: This function is deprecated".

So the test could check the warning message. However, the assertWarns context manager might not directly allow checking the message, but we can use a custom context manager or capture the warning message.

Alternatively, using the pytest framework, we can use pytest.warns to check the message.

But since the user wants unit tests, perhaps using the unittest framework.

Alternatively, using the warnings module's simplefilter.

But perhaps the tests should check that the warning is issued, and that the function's behavior is preserved.

So the code for the decorator would be:

import warnings

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(f"The function {func.__name__} is deprecated: {message}", DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the message is passed to the decorator, so the message is fixed for the decorated function. So when the function is called, the warning includes that message.

But the user might want the message to be customizable. So the decorator's message is the message that is included in the warning.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the unit tests. Let me think about possible edge cases.

Another test case: decorating a method. But for simplicity, maybe the tests can focus on functions.

Another test: checking that the function's docstring is preserved? Or maybe not, since the wrapper may not preserve it. But the user didn't mention that, so perhaps it's not required.

So the tests would be:

Test that the warning is issued when the function is called.

Test that the function's behavior is preserved.

Test that the message is correctly included in the warning.

So, for the first test, using assertWarns.

But in unittest, the assertWarns method can be used. However, the warning message may need to be checked. For example:

with self.assertWarns(DeprecationWarning) as cm:
    sample_func()
self.assertIn("sample_func", str(cm.warning))
self.assertIn("This function is deprecated", str(cm.warning))

But perhaps the user wants the message to be exactly as provided. However, the message in the warning is constructed as "The function {func_name} is deprecated: {message}".

So the test can check that the warning message includes the function name and the provided message.

So the test code would be:

import unittest
import warnings

class TestDeprecatedDecorator(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_deprecated_warning_message(self):
        @deprecated("This function is deprecated")
        def sample_func():
            pass

        with self.assertWarns(DeprecationWarning) as cm:
            sample_func()
        self.assertIn("sample_func", str(cm.warning))
        self.assertIn("This function is deprecated", str(cm.warning))

    def test_function_still_works(self):
        @deprecated("This function is deprecated")
        def sample_func(x):
            return x + 1

        self.assertEqual(sample_func(2), 3)

    def test_multiple_decorators(self):
        @deprecated("First message")
        @deprecated("Second message")
        def sample_func():
            pass

        with self.assertWarns(DeprecationWarning) as cm:
            sample_func()
        self.assertIn("sample_func", str(cm.warning))
        self.assertIn("Second message", str(cm.warning))

Wait, but the multiple decorators case may not be handled correctly. Because the deprecated decorator is applied twice. However, the first decorator would be the outer one. So if you apply @deprecated("Second message") then @deprecated("First message"), the first one is the outer decorator. So when you call sample_func, the first decorator (the outer one) would be applied. Wait, no. The order of decorators is from bottom to top. So if you have @decorator1 and @decorator2, then decorator2 is applied first, then decorator1. So in the case of multiple deprecated decorators, the first one (the outer one) would be the one that's applied. So in the example above, the sample_func is decorated with @deprecated("Second message") first, then @deprecated("First message") on top. So the final decorator is the one with "First message". So when the function is called, the warning message would be "First message". But the test case above would check for "Second message". So that test case is incorrect. Hmm, perhaps that's a problem. But maybe the user doesn't expect multiple decorators. Or perhaps the decorator should be applied once. So maybe the test case is not necessary. Or perhaps the decorator should be designed to allow multiple applications, but that's probably not intended. So perhaps the test case is not needed. Or maybe the user expects that the message is the one from the last decorator. But the original problem statement says that the deprecated function is a decorator that returns a decorator. So the message is passed to the deprecated function, which returns the decorator. So when you apply multiple decorators, each with their own message, the last one would be the one that's applied. But in the case of multiple deprecated decorators, the first one (the outer one) would be the one that's applied. Wait, no. Let me think. For example:

@decorator1
@decorator2
def func(): ...

This is equivalent to:

func = decorator1(decorator2(func))

So the order is decorator2 is applied first, then decorator1. So if you have:

@deprecated("message1")
@deprecated("message2")
def func(): ...

This is equivalent to:

func = deprecated("message1")(deprecated("message2")(func))

So when the function is called, the inner decorator (message2) is applied first, then the outer (message1). But the warning would be generated by the outer decorator. Wait, no. The wrapper function in the outer decorator would generate the warning. So in this case, the outer decorator's message is "message1", and the inner decorator's message is "message2". But the outer decorator is applied after the inner one. So when the function is called, the outer decorator's wrapper is called, which would generate a warning with message1. So the test case I wrote earlier would fail because the message is "message1", not "message2". So the test case for multiple decorators would check for "message2", but the actual warning would be "message1". So that test case is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the multiple decorators case is not something the user wants, or perhaps the decorator should not be used multiple times. So perhaps that test case is not needed. So maybe the test cases can focus on the basic functionality.

So the code for the decorator is as I outlined earlier.

Now, putting it all together, the code for the decorator would be:

import warnings

def deprecated(message):
    """
    Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(
                f"The function {func.__name__} is deprecated: {message}",
                DeprecationWarning,
                stacklevel=2
            )
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the stacklevel=2 is important. Because the warning is issued from the wrapper function, which is inside the decorator. So stacklevel=2 would make the warning point to the line where the function is called, not the decorator's code. That's probably better for debugging.

Now, the unit tests. Let me write them in Python, using unittest.

But the user said to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So the code for the decorator and the tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the decorator code, and the tests as part of the code.

Wait, the original problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the deprecated function, and the unit tests. But the initial instruction says to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user wants the output to be the code generated (the decorator and the tests?), or just the decorator?

Wait, the user provided the function signature and docstring for the deprecated function. The task is to generate the code for that function. But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating the tests. However, the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code includes both the decorator and the tests.

But the original problem says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So the main code is the deprecated function. But the user's tips suggest generating tests first. However, the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should include the decorator code and the tests.

But the user's example shows that the code to generate is the decorator function. However, the tips say to generate tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer is the code for the decorator, and the tests as part of the code.

But the user's initial message says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the code generated is the deprecated function. But the tips say to generate tests first. However, the user might expect that the code includes the tests. But perhaps the user wants only the decorator code. But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the main code is the decorator function. The tests are part of the code generated as per the TDD approach.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should include both the decorator and the tests.

But the initial problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So the main code is the deprecated function. However, the tips suggest generating tests first, but the user might expect that the code includes the tests.

But the user might not want the tests as part of the code. Maybe the user wants only the decorator code. However, the tips say to generate tests first. So perhaps the answer should include both the decorator and the tests.

But the user's example shows that the code to generate is the decorator function. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should include the decorator code and the tests.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck the original problem.

The user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

The function signature is for the deprecated function. The docstring is provided. So the code generated is the implementation of the deprecated function. However, the tips say to follow TDD, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the code generated would include the tests and the actual code.

But the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should include both the tests and the decorator code.

But how to structure that. For example:

The code would be:

import warnings

def deprecated(message):
    """
    Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(
                f"The function {func.__name__} is deprecated: {message}",
                DeprecationWarning,
                stacklevel=2
            )
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

import unittest

class TestDeprecatedDecorator(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_deprecated_warning(self):
        @deprecated("This function is deprecated")
        def sample_func():
            pass

        with self.assertWarns(DeprecationWarning):
            sample_func()

    def test_function_still_works(self):
        @deprecated("This function is deprecated")
        def sample_func(x):
            return x + 1

        self.assertEqual(sample_func(2), 3)

But the user might want the tests to be in a separate file, but the problem says to output the code generated. So including the tests in the code is acceptable.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So the code would include the decorator and the tests.

But the user might have intended only the decorator code. However, the tips say to generate tests first, so the answer should include the tests.

So the final code would be the decorator function and the unit tests.

But I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted. Also, the user said to output in python markdown format, which probably means using triple backticks with python.

So the final answer would be the code for the deprecated function and the tests.
