Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_file_exist, which checks if a file exists. The user wants me to follow a test-driven development approach, so first I should write the unit tests, then the actual code. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to check if a given file name is an existing file. So the tests should cover different scenarios: file exists, file doesn't exist, maybe edge cases like empty string, or special characters in the file name. Wait, but the function's parameters are a string, so maybe the tests should check for valid and invalid file names.

Wait, but the function's docstring says it checks if the file exists. So the function should return True if the file exists, False otherwise. But how does it handle different operating systems? Well, the os.path.exists function should handle that, I think.

So for the tests, I need to create test cases where the file exists, doesn't exist, and maybe some edge cases. But how to handle the actual file creation for testing? Maybe using temporary files. Oh right, the unittest module has a TempFileTestCase, or maybe I can use the tempfile module to create temporary files.

But since the user wants the code to be generated, maybe the tests should be written using the unittest framework. Let me outline the test cases:

1. Test when the file exists: should return True.
2. Test when the file does not exist: should return False.
3. Test with an empty string as file_name: probably should return False, since empty string isn't a valid file name.
4. Test with a non-string input, but the function's parameter is a string, so maybe the function doesn't handle that. Wait, the function's parameter is file_name, which is a string. So the function doesn't need to handle non-string inputs, but maybe the tests should check if the function raises an error. Wait, the original function's docstring says "Check whether file_name is an existing file." So maybe the function expects a string. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling non-string inputs. So perhaps the function doesn't need to handle that, and the tests don't need to cover it. So the function can assume that file_name is a string.

So the tests would be:

- Test case 1: file exists → return True.
- Test case 2: file does not exist → return False.
- Test case 3: empty string → return False.
- Test case 4: invalid file name (like a directory, but maybe that's not necessary. Or maybe a file that's a directory? Wait, the function checks if it's a file, not a directory. So maybe the function should check if it's a regular file, not a directory. Wait, the original function's docstring says "Check whether file_name is an existing file." So perhaps it's checking if the path is a regular file, not a directory. So in that case, the function should use os.path.isfile() instead of os.path.exists(). Because os.path.exists() would return True for directories as well. So the function's actual implementation should check if the file exists and is a regular file.

Wait, the user's function signature is is_file_exist(file_name), and the docstring says "Check whether file_name is an existing file." So the function should return True only if the file exists and is a regular file, not a directory. So the correct approach is to use os.path.isfile().

So the function's code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But then the tests need to check for that. So for the test cases:

Test 1: create a temporary file, call the function, expect True.

Test 2: create a temporary directory, call the function, expect False.

Test 3: pass an empty string, expect False.

Test 4: pass a non-existent file, expect False.

But how to create temporary files and directories for testing? Using the tempfile module.

So in the tests, I can use tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile to create a temporary file, which is deleted when closed. But if I open it in 'w' mode, it creates the file. Then, after the test, the file is deleted. Alternatively, using tempfile.TemporaryDirectory for directories.

But for the test cases, perhaps using the unittest framework with temporary files.

So the test cases would be:

- Test that a existing file returns True.
- Test that a non-existing file returns False.
- Test that an empty string returns False.
- Test that a directory returns False.

So the code for the tests would be:

import unittest
import os
import tempfile

class TestIsFileExist(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_file_exists(self):
        # Create a temporary file
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False) as tmp_file:
            tmp_file_path = tmp_file.name
        # Now, check if the function returns True
        self.assertTrue(is_file_exist(tmp_file_path))
        # Clean up
        os.remove(tmp_file_path)

    def test_file_does_not_exist(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_file_exist('non_existent_file.txt'))

    def test_empty_string(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_file_exist(''))

    def test_directory(self):
        # Create a temporary directory
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:
            self.assertFalse(is_file_exist(tmp_dir))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Wait, but the test_file_exists creates a temporary file, but after the test, it deletes it. However, in the test, the file is created with delete=False, so that the file is not deleted when the context manager exits. Then, after the test, we manually delete it. But in the test, the function is called with tmp_file_path, which is the path to the temporary file. So the test should pass.

But in the code, the function is_file_exist is called with that path, and the test expects True.

But the problem is that the temporary file is created, and then the test checks if the function returns True. Then, after the test, the file is deleted. So that's okay.

But in the test_file_exists method, the code creates the file, then checks, then deletes it. That's correct.

But what about the test for the directory? The test creates a temporary directory, and then checks if is_file_exist returns False, which it should, because a directory is not a file.

So the tests cover the cases.

Now, the actual code for the function is_file_exist would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

But wait, what about if the file_name is a symlink? Well, os.path.isfile() follows symlinks, so if the symlink points to a file, it returns True. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling symlinks, so perhaps that's acceptable.

So putting it all together, the code for the function is as above, and the tests are as written.

But the user wants the code generated, output only the code in Python markdown format. So the answer should have the tests first, then the function.

Wait, the user said: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the code generated should include the tests and the function.

But the user's instruction says to output ONLY the code generated. So the code should include the tests and the function.

But the user's function signature is given, and the docstring. So the code should include the function with the given docstring, and the tests.

But how to structure that? The user probably expects the code to be in a format where the tests are written first, then the function. But in Python, the tests would be in a separate module, but perhaps the user wants all code in one block.

So the final code would be:

import os
import unittest
import tempfile

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

class TestIsFileExist(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_file_exists(self):
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False) as tmp_file:
            tmp_file_path = tmp_file.name
        self.assertTrue(is_file_exist(tmp_file_path))
        os.remove(tmp_file_path)

    def test_file_does_not_exist(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_file_exist('non_existent_file.txt'))

    def test_empty_string(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_file_exist(''))

    def test_directory(self):
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:
            self.assertFalse(is_file_exist(tmp_dir))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

But wait, the test_file_exists creates a temporary file, but after the test, it deletes it. However, in the test, the file is created with delete=False, so that the file is not deleted when the context manager exits. Then, after the test, the code calls os.remove(tmp_file_path) to delete it. That's correct.

But in the test, the code uses 'with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile...' which creates the file, and then the code uses the path. Then, after the test, the file is deleted. So that's okay.

But in the test, the code is in the test method, so the tmp_file_path is available. Then, the test checks if is_file_exist returns True. Then, the code deletes the file.

But what if the test fails? Well, the file would be left behind, but in practice, the test would fail, so it's better to handle that. However, for the purposes of this test, it's acceptable.

So the code should be as above.

But the user wants the code generated, and the output is only the code in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as such, with the tests and the function.

So the final answer is the code with the tests and the function.
