Okay, I need to generate Python code for the replace_dots function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it replaces all '.' in the input string 'value' with the 'arg' string. So, for example, if value is "hello.world" and arg is "!", the result should be "hello!world".

First, I should think about how to implement this. The straightforward way is to use the string's replace method. So something like return value.replace('.', arg). But wait, I need to make sure that the function handles cases where arg might contain special characters or if there are edge cases like empty strings. But according to the docstring, the function is supposed to replace all '.' with the given argument, so the replace method should handle that.

Now, the user mentioned a test-driven development approach. So I should first write unit tests for this function. Let me think about possible test cases.

Test case 1: Basic replacement. Input "a.b.c", arg "X" should become "aXbXc".

Test case 2: No dots in the input. Like input "hello", arg "world" should return "hello".

Test case 3: All dots. Input "....", arg "X" becomes "XXXX".

Test case 4: Arg is an empty string. Input "a.b", arg "" becomes "ab".

Test case 5: Arg contains special characters, like "!", so input "test." becomes "test!".

Wait, but the function's parameters are 'value' and 'arg'. The function is supposed to replace each '.' with the 'arg' string. So the replace method's parameters are correct here. So the code is straightforward.

But wait, what if the 'arg' is not a string? The function's docstring says the args are old string and new string. So the function expects 'arg' to be a string. But in Python, if someone passes a non-string, like a number, it would throw an error. But the function's parameters are defined as 'arg', and the docstring says 'arg: new string to replace '.'', so the function is supposed to take a string. So the code doesn't need to handle that; it's up to the caller to pass correct types.

So the code is simple: return value.replace('.', arg). But wait, the function's name is replace_dots, which is a bit confusing. Wait, the function is called replace_dots, but the parameters are 'value' and 'arg'. So the function replaces all dots in 'value' with 'arg'. So the code is correct.

Now, writing the unit tests. Using Python's unittest framework. Let me structure the tests.

First, import unittest. Then create a test class, maybe TestReplaceDots, with multiple test methods.

Test method 1: test_basic_replacement. Input "a.b.c", arg "X" → "aXbXc".

Test method 2: test_no_dots. Input "hello", arg "world" → "hello".

Test method 3: test_all_dots. Input "....", arg "X" → "XXXX".

Test method 4: test_arg_empty. Input "a.b", arg "" → "ab".

Test method 5: test_arg_with_special_chars. Input "test.", arg "!" → "test!".

Wait, but the function's return type is a string. So all these tests should pass.

Now, the code for the function is straightforward. But I need to make sure that the function is correctly implemented.

So the code would be:

def replace_dots(value, arg):
    """
    Replaces all values of '.' to arg from the given string
    Args:
        value: old string
        arg: new string to replace '.'
    Returns:
        str, the replaced string
    """
    return value.replace('.', arg)

But wait, the function's name is replace_dots, but the docstring says "Replaces all values of '.' to arg from the given string". So the function is replacing '.' with arg. So the code is correct.

Now, the unit tests. Let me write them.

But the user said to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So the user wants the function code and the unit tests. Wait, the initial instruction says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But the tips say to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

So the user wants the code for the function and the unit tests. But the initial instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should include both the function and the unit tests.

But the original problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So perhaps the user wants just the function code. However, the tips mention to generate unit tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So maybe the answer should include the function code and the unit tests.

But the original problem's example shows that the user provided a function signature and docstring, and the assistant is to generate the code. However, the tips suggest writing tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer is just the function code.

However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should include both the function and the tests.

But the user might be expecting only the function code. Let me check the original problem again.

The user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the code generated is the function code. However, the tips say to generate unit tests first. But perhaps the user wants the function code.

But the tips suggest writing tests first. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So maybe the answer should be the function code.

But the user might have intended to have the tests as part of the code. However, the original problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring", which implies the function itself. So perhaps the answer is just the function code.

But the tips say to generate comprehensive unit tests first. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer is the function code.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me check the original problem again.

The user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the code generated is the function. The tips are just guidance, but the actual output is the code. So the answer is the function code.

But the tips say to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code generated includes the tests and the function. But the problem says "based on the function signature and docstring", which suggests the function itself.

But perhaps the user wants the function code and the tests. However, the original problem's example shows that the user provided a function signature and docstring, and the assistant is to generate the code. So the answer is the function code.

But the user's tips say to generate unit tests first. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer is the function code.

But I'm not sure. However, the initial problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the answer is the function code. The tests are part of the development process, but the output is only the code generated, which is the function.

But the user might have intended to have the tests as part of the code. However, the problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring", which is the function itself. So I'll proceed to write the function code.

So the function code is:

def replace_dots(value, arg):
    """
    Replaces all values of '.' to arg from the given string
    Args:
        value: old string
        arg: new string to replace '.'
    Returns:
        str, the replaced string
    """
    return value.replace('.', arg)

But wait, the function's name is replace_dots, which is a bit confusing. Because the function replaces '.' with arg. So the name is correct.

But perhaps the function should be called replace_dots, which is the name given. So the code is correct.

So the answer is the function code as above.
