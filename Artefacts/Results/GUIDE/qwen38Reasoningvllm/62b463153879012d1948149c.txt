Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function select_filenames_by_prefix. The function should take a prefix and a list of files, then return those files that start with the given prefix. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is clear: filter filenames based on a prefix. So, for each file in the input list, check if it starts with the prefix. But wait, how exactly? In Python, the string method startswith() can be used here. So, for each file in files, if file.startswith(prefix), include it in the result.

But wait, what about case sensitivity? The problem statement doesn't mention it, so I'll assume that the prefix match is case-sensitive. For example, if the prefix is 'Test', then 'test.txt' wouldn't match. Unless the problem expects case-insensitive, but since it's not specified, better to stick with the default.

Now, the function should return a list of filenames that match. So the code would be something like:

def select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files):
    return [file for file in files if file.startswith(prefix)]

But wait, what if the files list is empty or prefix is empty? Well, the function should handle those cases naturally. For example, if prefix is empty string, then all files would match, since startswith('') returns True for any string. But maybe the problem expects that? Let me check the docstring again. The docstring says "return all files that match the given prefix". So if the prefix is empty, all files are returned. That's correct.

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach. So first generate unit tests, then the code. But the user wants the code generated, not the tests. Wait, the original instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated..." But the tips say to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the code. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. But maybe the user wants the code that passes the tests. But since the code is to be written based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps the tests are part of the process but the final output is just the code.

But the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I need to write the code, not the tests. However, the initial instruction says to follow TDD approach, first generating tests. But perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. So I should focus on writing the code that meets the function's requirements.

Wait, maybe the user wants the code that would pass the tests generated by TDD. But since the user hasn't provided the tests, perhaps the code is straightforward. Let me think again.

The function's docstring says: "For each file in files, return all files that match the given prefix". So the code is simple. But perhaps there are edge cases. For example, if the prefix is longer than the filename. Like, if the prefix is 'test.txt' and the filename is 'test', then it won't match. That's correct.

So the code is as simple as a list comprehension using startswith. Let me write that.

But wait, what about if the files list is None? Well, the function's parameters are prefix and files. The function is supposed to process the files list. If files is None, then the code would raise an error. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling such cases. So perhaps the function assumes that files is a list. So the code is as simple as that.

So the code would be:

def select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files):
    """
    For each file in files, return all files that match the given prefix
    """
    return [file for file in files if file.startswith(prefix)]

But wait, the function's parameters: the files parameter is a list? The docstring says "for each file in files", so yes. So the code is correct.

But maybe the files parameter is not a list. But the function's parameters are given as 'files', so the code assumes that it's an iterable. So the code is correct.

So that's the code. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with python as the language.

But the user said to output only the code generated. So the final answer is the code as written above.
