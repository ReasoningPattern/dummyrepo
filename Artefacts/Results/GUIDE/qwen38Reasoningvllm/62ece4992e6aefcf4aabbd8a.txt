Okay, I need to generate Python code for the load_configurations function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function takes config_filenames, which is a sequence of filenames. It also has optional overrides and resolve_env. The goal is to load and validate each config file, handle errors, and return a tuple of a dict mapping filenames to parsed configs and a list of log records for errors.

First, I should think about the steps involved. For each config file, I need to read it, parse it, check for errors. If there's an error, log it. Then collect all the parsed configs and the error logs.

Wait, the docstring says that if a config file can't be read (permissions or parsing error), the error log is recorded. So, for each file, I need to attempt to read and parse, and if any error occurs during that process, log it. But how to handle the parsing? Are the config files in a specific format, like YAML, JSON, or something else? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to assume a common format. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the function is supposed to handle different formats, or maybe it's up to the user to parse. Wait, the function's responsibility is to load and validate the configuration files. So maybe the actual parsing is done by some method, perhaps using a library like configparser, yaml, etc. But since the function is generic, perhaps the actual parsing is left to the user, but the function needs to handle reading the files and handling errors.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to load the files, and the parsing is done by some method. But without knowing the format, perhaps the function is designed to load the files as text, and then parse them into a dictionary? Or maybe the function is supposed to handle different formats, but that's unclear. Hmm, the problem might be expecting that the function reads the files, and then parses them into a dictionary, but the actual parsing method isn't specified. So perhaps the function is supposed to read the files, and then parse them using a specific method, but since the user hasn't specified, maybe the function is a placeholder that needs to be implemented with some default parsing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the files and return their contents as strings, but that seems unlikely. The docstring says "parsed configuration", so it's likely that the function is supposed to parse the config files into a structured format, like a dictionary.

But without knowing the format, how can I proceed? Maybe the function uses a configuration parser library, like configparser for INI files, or yaml for YAML files. However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is supposed to read the files as text and then parse them into a dictionary, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to load the files, and the parsing is done by some external method, but the function is responsible for handling the reading and error checking. So, perhaps the function is supposed to read each file, and if there's an error (like permission denied or parsing error), log it. The actual parsing is up to the user, but the function needs to handle the reading and error logging.

Wait, the function's parameters include resolve_env, which suggests that environment variables might be resolved in the configuration. For example, if the config files have placeholders like ${VAR}, they should be replaced with the corresponding environment variables. So, maybe the function is supposed to process the config files, resolve environment variables, and then parse them into a dictionary.

But again, without knowing the exact parsing method, how to proceed? Maybe the function uses a library like python-dotenv or something similar. Or perhaps the parsing is done using the standard library's configparser, but that's for INI files.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the files as JSON, YAML, or similar, and parse them into a Python dict. But again, without knowing the format, this is ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to read the files, and the parsing is done by some method, but the actual implementation is left to the user. But the user is asking for code that implements this function, so I need to make assumptions.

Let me think about the steps again. For each config_filename in config_filenames:

1. Attempt to read the file. If there's an error (like permission denied, file not found), log it as an error.

2. Parse the content of the file into a dictionary. If parsing fails (e.g., invalid JSON, YAML syntax error), log that as an error.

3. If successful, add the filename to the result dict with the parsed config.

So, the function needs to handle reading the file, parsing it, and handling errors.

But how to parse? Let's assume that the config files are in JSON format. Then, the function would read the file, load it as JSON, and handle any exceptions during that process.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses a generic parser, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the function is supposed to handle different formats. However, without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the files as text, and then parse them into a dictionary using a specific method. For example, using the configparser module for INI files, or using the yaml module for YAML files. But again, without knowing, this is ambiguous.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to load the configuration files, resolve environment variables (as per the resolve_env parameter), and then parse them into a dictionary. For example, if the config files have environment variables in them, like ${VAR}, then resolve them.

But again, without knowing the exact parsing method, it's challenging. However, given that the function is supposed to return a dict of configuration filename to parsed configuration, perhaps the actual parsing is done using a library like configparser, or perhaps the function is supposed to read the file as a string and return it as the parsed config. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the file content and return it as a dictionary, but that's not clear.

Hmm. Maybe the function is supposed to read the config files, and the parsing is done by some method. For example, using the standard library's configparser for INI files, or using the yaml module for YAML files. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file as a string, and then parse it into a dictionary using some method. However, without knowing the format, this is not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the files, and the parsing is done by the user, but the function is responsible for handling the reading and error logging. But that would require the function to have a way to parse the content, which is not specified.

This is a problem. How to proceed?

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to read the files, and the parsing is done by some external method, but the function is supposed to handle the reading and error checking. For example, the function would read the file content, then pass it to a parser, which could be a parameter. But the function signature doesn't have such a parameter. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the files as text, and the parsing is done by the user, but the function is supposed to handle the reading and error logging. However, the function's docstring says "parse and validate each configuration file", so the function must perform the parsing.

This is a bit of a dead end. Maybe I need to make assumptions. Let's assume that the configuration files are in JSON format. Then, the function would read each file, load it as JSON, and handle any exceptions during that process. Also, if resolve_env is True, then perhaps the function should replace environment variables in the JSON content. But how to do that? For example, if the JSON has keys with values like "${VAR}", then replace them with the environment variable's value.

Alternatively, maybe the resolve_env parameter is for resolving environment variables in the configuration files. For example, if the config file has a value like ${ENV_VAR}, then it should be replaced with the value of the environment variable ENV_VAR.

So, the function would first read the file, then resolve any environment variables (if resolve_env is True), then parse the content into a dictionary. But again, the parsing method is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file, resolve environment variables, and then parse the content into a dictionary. For example, using the python-dotenv library to resolve environment variables, but that's not part of the standard library.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the function is supposed to read the file, and the parsing is done by some method, but the actual parsing is left to the user. However, the function's responsibility is to load and validate the configuration files, so it must handle the parsing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file content as a string, and then parse it into a dictionary using a specific method. For example, using the configparser module for INI files. But again, without knowing the format, this is not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the function is supposed to read the file, and the parsing is done by the user, but the function is responsible for handling the reading and error logging. However, the function's docstring says "parse and validate each configuration file", so the function must perform the parsing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file, and the parsing is done using the standard library's ConfigParser for INI files. Let's proceed with that assumption.

So, the steps would be:

For each config_filename:

1. Try to open the file. If there's an error (like permission denied, file not found), log it as an error.

2. Read the content of the file.

3. Parse the content using ConfigParser. If parsing fails (e.g., invalid syntax), log it as an error.

4. If successful, add the filename to the result dict with the parsed config.

But how to handle the resolve_env parameter? If resolve_env is True, maybe the function should replace environment variables in the config file before parsing. For example, if the config file has a value like ${ENV_VAR}, then replace it with the value of the environment variable ENV_VAR.

So, the steps would be:

For each config_filename:

1. Try to open the file. If error, log.

2. Read the content as a string.

3. If resolve_env is True, resolve environment variables in the content.

4. Parse the content into a dictionary (using ConfigParser, or another method).

5. If parsing fails, log error.

But again, without knowing the parsing method, it's hard to proceed. However, given that the function's return type is a dict of filenames to parsed configs, perhaps the parsing is done using ConfigParser, which returns a dictionary-like object.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the file and return it as a dictionary, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file as a string, and the parsing is done by some external method, but the function is responsible for handling the reading and error logging. However, the actual parsing is not specified, so this is ambiguous.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to read the files, and the parsing is done by some method, but the actual implementation is left to the user. However, the user is asking for code that implements this function, so I need to make assumptions.

Let me proceed with the following approach:

Assume that the configuration files are in JSON format. So, the function reads each file, loads it as JSON, and handles any exceptions. Also, if resolve_env is True, replace environment variables in the JSON content. For example, if the JSON has a key with a value like "${VAR}", replace it with the environment variable's value.

But how to resolve environment variables in the JSON content? That would require processing the string to replace ${VAR} with os.environ.get('VAR', default). So, for each line in the file, replace any occurrences of ${VAR} with the corresponding environment variable.

But how to handle that? For example, if the JSON content is a string, then we can process it to replace environment variables before parsing.

So, the steps would be:

For each config_filename:

1. Try to open the file. If error, log.

2. Read the file content as a string.

3. If resolve_env is True, resolve environment variables in the content.

4. Try to parse the content as JSON. If error, log.

5. If successful, add to the result dict.

But how to resolve environment variables in the string? For example, using a function that replaces ${VAR} with the environment variable's value.

So, the code would need to process the content string to replace any ${VAR} with os.environ.get('VAR', default). But what if the variable is not present? The default could be an empty string, or maybe the function should leave it as is, or raise an error? The docstring says to log the error if the file can't be read, but for parsing errors, like invalid JSON or missing environment variables, perhaps those are considered parsing errors and should be logged.

But this is getting complicated. However, given the time constraints, I need to proceed with an implementation.

So, the code outline would be:

Import necessary modules: os, json, logging, and maybe ConfigParser.

But since the function is supposed to return a tuple of (dict, list of LogRecord instances), the code would need to handle logging.

But the function is supposed to record error logs. So, perhaps the function uses the logging module to log errors.

But the function is supposed to return the LogRecord instances. However, in Python, the logging module's log records are not directly accessible. So, perhaps the function is supposed to create log records manually.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to log the errors using the logging module, and collect those log records. But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to capture the errors and create LogRecord instances manually. But that's complicated.

Wait, the docstring says: "the error log will be recorded. Otherwise, return the results as a tuple of: dict of configuration filename to corresponding parsed configuration, and sequence of logging.LogRecord instances containing any parse errors."

So, the function needs to collect LogRecord instances for any parse errors. So, for each error encountered during reading or parsing, create a LogRecord instance and add it to the list.

But how to create LogRecord instances? The logging module's LogRecord has attributes like name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, etc. So, the function would need to create these manually.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to log the errors using the logging module, and then collect those log records. However, the logging module's logger doesn't directly provide a way to collect all log records. So, perhaps the function is supposed to create the log records manually.

This is getting complex. Let's proceed step by step.

First, the function needs to process each config file.

For each filename in config_filenames:

- Try to open the file. If there's an error (like permission denied or file not found), log it as an error. How to log it? Maybe create a LogRecord instance with the error message.

- Read the file content. If the file is empty or invalid, that's a parsing error.

- If resolve_env is True, resolve environment variables in the content.

- Parse the content into a dictionary. If parsing fails (e.g., invalid JSON), log it as an error.

So, for the code:

Import os, json, logging.

But the function needs to return LogRecord instances. So, perhaps the function uses the logging module to create log records.

But how to create them? For example, when an error occurs, create a LogRecord with the message, level, etc.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to collect the error messages and then create LogRecord instances with those messages.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to use the logging module to log the errors, and then collect those log records. However, the logging module doesn't provide a way to collect all log records, so this approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to create the LogRecord instances manually. For example, when an error occurs, create a LogRecord with the message, level, etc., and add it to the list.

But this requires knowing the parameters for the LogRecord constructor. For example:

logging.LogRecord(name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func, keywords)

But for the purpose of this function, perhaps the function can create a LogRecord with some default parameters.

However, this is getting complicated. Let's proceed with the assumption that the function will create LogRecord instances with the error messages and other necessary parameters.

Now, putting it all together.

The code would look something like this:

import os
import json
import logging

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    config_dict = {}
    error_logs = []
    
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
        except Exception as e:
            # Log the error
            log_record = logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=0,
                msg=f"Error reading file {filename}: {str(e)}",
                args=None,
                exc_info=None,
                func=None,
                keywords=None
            )
            error_logs.append(log_record)
            continue
        
        if resolve_env:
            # Resolve environment variables in content
            # This is a simplified approach; in practice, this would need to handle ${VAR} replacements
            # For example, using a regex to find ${VAR} and replace with os.environ.get('VAR', default)
            import re
            def replace_env(match):
                var_name = match.group(1)
                return os.environ.get(var_name, '')
            content = re.sub(r'\$\{([^}]+)\}', replace_env, content)
        
        try:
            # Parse content into a dictionary
            parsed_config = json.loads(content)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            # Log parsing error
            log_record = logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=0,
                msg=f"Error parsing JSON in file {filename}: {str(e)}",
                args=None,
                exc_info=None,
                func=None,
                keywords=None
            )
            error_logs.append(log_record)
        else:
            # If no error, add to config_dict
            config_dict[filename] = parsed_config
    
    return config_dict, error_logs

But this is a simplified version. However, there are several issues here:

1. The logging.LogRecord constructor requires certain parameters. For example, the 'pathname' is the file path, 'lineno' is the line number where the error occurred. However, in the case of reading a file, the error might not have a specific line number. So, setting lineno=0 might be acceptable.

2. The resolve_env part uses a regex to replace ${VAR} with the environment variable. However, this is a simplified approach and might not handle all cases, like nested braces or other edge cases.

3. The function assumes that the config files are in JSON format. If the files are in a different format (like YAML, INI, etc.), this code would not work.

But given the ambiguity in the problem statement, this is a possible implementation.

Now, the user also mentioned that the code should be generated with test-driven development. So, I need to write unit tests first.

But the user asked to generate the code, not the tests. Wait, the initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. However, the initial instruction says to output only the code generated.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the user might have intended to generate the code, not the tests. So, perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to output only the code.

So, I need to generate the code as per the function signature and docstring.

But the code I wrote above is an implementation that assumes JSON files and environment variable resolution. However, the function's docstring mentions "parse and validate each configuration file", which may not be JSON. So, perhaps the function is supposed to handle different formats, but without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file and return it as a dictionary, but that's not clear.

Another approach: Maybe the function is supposed to read the file and return the content as a dictionary, but the actual parsing is left to the user. However, the function's responsibility is to load and validate the configuration files, so it must handle parsing.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file, parse it into a dictionary using a generic parser, and handle errors.

But without knowing the format, it's impossible to proceed. Therefore, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file, and the parsing is done using a library like configparser, which is part of the standard library.

Let me try that approach.

Assuming that the config files are in INI format, using configparser.

So, the code would:

For each filename:

- Try to open the file. If error, log.

- Parse the INI file using configparser.

- If parsing fails, log error.

So, the code would be:

import configparser
import os
import logging

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    config_dict = {}
    error_logs = []
    
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
        except Exception as e:
            # Log error
            log_record = logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=0,
                msg=f"Error reading file {filename}: {str(e)}",
                args=None,
                exc_info=None,
                func=None,
                keywords=None
            )
            error_logs.append(log_record)
            continue
        
        if resolve_env:
            # Resolve environment variables in content
            # Again, this is a simplified approach
            import re
            def replace_env(match):
                var_name = match.group(1)
                return os.environ.get(var_name, '')
            content = re.sub(r'\$\{([^}]+)\}', replace_env, content)
        
        try:
            config = configparser.ConfigParser()
            config.read_string(content)
            parsed_config = dict(config)
        except configparser.Error as e:
            log_record = logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=0,
                msg=f"Error parsing INI in file {filename}: {str(e)}",
                args=None,
                exc_info=None,
                func=None,
                keywords=None
            )
            error_logs.append(log_record)
        else:
            config_dict[filename] = parsed_config
    
    return config_dict, error_logs

But again, this is assuming INI files. The function's docstring doesn't specify the format, so this is an assumption.

However, the user's function signature and docstring do not specify the format, so this is a problem. But without knowing, it's impossible to proceed.

Another possibility is that the function is supposed to read the file and return it as a dictionary, with the content as a string. But that would not be parsing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the file and return it as a dictionary, with the content parsed as a Python dictionary, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the file and return it as a dictionary, with the content being a JSON or YAML string. But again, without knowing the format, it's impossible.

Given the ambiguity, I think the initial approach with JSON is acceptable, even though it's an assumption.

But the user's function docstring says "parse and validate each configuration file". So, the function must parse the file into a structured format. Assuming JSON is a common format, the code I wrote earlier is acceptable.

Now, the code needs to be written, and the user wants it in Python markdown format, with only the code.

So, the final code would be:

But I need to make sure that the code is correct and handles the errors properly.

Another thing: the overrides parameter is not used in the code. The function's parameters include overrides, but the code doesn't use it. So, perhaps the overrides are supposed to be applied to the parsed configurations. But the function's docstring doesn't mention overrides, so maybe it's a mistake. Or perhaps the overrides are supposed to be merged into the parsed configurations.

But the function's parameters include overrides, but the code doesn't use it. This is a problem.

Wait, the function's parameters are:

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):

So, the overrides parameter is optional. But the code I wrote doesn't use it. That's a problem. How to handle overrides?

The function's docstring says: "Given a sequence of configuration filenames, load and validate each configuration file. If the configuration file cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file, the error log will be recorded. Otherwise, return the results as a tuple of: dict of configuration filename to corresponding parsed configuration, and sequence of logging.LogRecord instances containing any parse errors."

The overrides parameter is not mentioned in the docstring. So, perhaps it's a mistake, or perhaps it's supposed to be used to override certain values in the parsed configurations. But without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Assuming that the overrides are supposed to be merged into the parsed configurations, perhaps the code should apply the overrides after parsing each file.

For example, if the parsed_config is a dictionary, then apply the overrides to it. But how to handle that? For example, if overrides is a dictionary, then for each key in overrides, update the parsed_config with the override value.

So, in the code:

if overrides is not None:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)

But this would merge the overrides into the parsed config. However, this depends on the structure of the parsed_config. For example, if the parsed_config is a nested dictionary, this might not be the correct way to apply overrides.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to merge the overrides into the parsed configuration. So, the code should include this step.

So, modifying the earlier code:

In the else clause:

if overrides is not None:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)
config_dict[filename] = parsed_config

But this is an assumption.

So, incorporating this into the code.

But again, without knowing the exact usage of overrides, it's hard to proceed. However, since the function's parameters include it, the code should handle it.

So, the final code would include the overrides parameter, and apply them to the parsed configuration.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import os
import json
import logging
import re

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    """
    Given a sequence of configuration filenames, load and validate each configuration file. If the configuration file

            log_record = logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,

                lineno=0,
                msg=f"Error parsing JSON in file {filename}: {str(e)}",
                args=None,

            # Apply overrides
            if overrides is not None:
                parsed_config.update(overrides)
            config_dict[filename] = parsed_config
    
    return config_dict, error_logs

But this code has several issues:

1. The LogRecord constructor may not be correct. For example, the 'pathname' should be the file path, and 'lineno' should be the line number where the error occurred. However, in the case of reading a file, the error may not have a specific line number, so setting lineno=0 is acceptable.

2. The resolve_env part uses a regex to replace ${VAR} with the environment variable. This is a simplified approach and may not handle all edge cases.

3. The function assumes that the config files are in JSON format. If they are in a different format, this code will fail.

4. The overrides parameter is applied to each parsed configuration. This may not be the intended behavior, but it's an assumption.

However, given the information provided, this is the best possible implementation.

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, output only the code.

So, the final code is as written above.
