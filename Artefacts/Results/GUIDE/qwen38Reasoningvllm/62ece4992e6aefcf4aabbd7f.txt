Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function _parse_image_ref based on the given signature and docstring. Also, they mentioned a test-driven development approach, so I need to write unit tests first. But wait, the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. Oh right, but the initial instruction says to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the final output should only be the code, not the tests. Hmm, maybe I need to generate both the tests and the code, but the user says output only the code. Wait, the original problem says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So maybe the user wants just the function code, not the tests. But the tip says to follow TDD, so perhaps I should generate the tests first, then the code. But the user says to output only the code. Maybe I need to generate the code, but the initial thinking process includes writing tests. Let me focus on the function.

The function _parse_image_ref takes an image_href string and returns a tuple (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). The docstring mentions using urllib. So I need to parse the image href into those parts. Let me think about how to parse the href.

First, the image_href could be a URL. For example, maybe it's something like "https://example.com/images/12345.png". The image_id would be the part after the domain, perhaps. But how to split it? Maybe split on the last '/' to get the image ID. Then, the netloc is the domain part, like "example.com". The use_ssl is whether the URL starts with https.

Wait, the netloc is the network location, which is the domain part. So for a URL like "https://example.com/path/to/image.png", the netloc is "example.com". So using urllib's urlparse might help here. Let me think: using urllib.parse.urlparse to parse the URL. Then, the netloc would be the netloc part. The image_id would be the path part, but maybe the last segment. For example, if the path is "/path/to/image.png", the image_id is "image.png". But maybe the image_href is not a full URL. What if it's just a path like "/images/12345.png"? Then the netloc would be empty? Or maybe the function expects the href to be a full URL. The docstring says to use urllib, so perhaps the function is intended to parse a full URL.

So steps:

1. Parse the image_href using urlparse.
2. Extract the netloc from the parsed result.
3. Determine use_ssl by checking if the scheme is 'https'.
4. Extract the image_id from the path. Maybe take the last part of the path. For example, if the path is '/a/b/c.png', the image_id is 'c.png'.

But what if the path is empty? Like if the image_href is 'http://example.com'? Then the path is empty, so image_id would be empty? Or maybe the image_href is supposed to have a path. The function's return type is a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So image_id could be empty if the path is empty.

But how to handle cases where the URL is not properly formatted? The function should raise ValueError in such cases.

So, first, I need to parse the URL. Let's think about using urlparse. Let me check the urllib.parse.urlparse documentation. The parsed result has scheme, netloc, path, etc.

So, for example:

image_href = "https://example.com/images/12345.png"

parsed = urlparse(image_href)
scheme = parsed.scheme  # 'https'
netloc = parsed.netloc  # 'example.com'
path = parsed.path  # '/images/12345.png'

Then, image_id would be the last part of the path. So split the path by '/' and take the last element. But if the path is empty, then image_id is empty.

But what if the path is something like '/image.png'? Then the last part is 'image.png'.

So, image_id = path.split('/')[-1] if path else ''

But what if the path is empty? Like the URL is 'http://example.com'? Then path is empty, image_id is empty.

So, that's one approach.

Now, the use_ssl is True if the scheme is 'https', else False.

But what if the scheme is not http or https? Like 'ftp'? Then, perhaps the function should raise ValueError. Because the function is supposed to parse image hrefs, which are likely to be HTTP/HTTPS URLs.

So, in that case, the function should check if the scheme is either 'http' or 'https'. If not, raise ValueError.

So, the steps for the function:

- Parse the image_href using urlparse.
- Check if the scheme is http or https. If not, raise ValueError.
- Extract netloc. If netloc is empty (like if the URL is 'http://'), then maybe raise ValueError? Or is that acceptable? The function's docstring doesn't specify, but perhaps the image_href is expected to have a valid URL with netloc.

But the problem says to raise ValueError, so perhaps in cases where the URL is invalid, like missing scheme or netloc, we should raise.

So, the function needs to handle invalid URLs by raising ValueError.

So, the code outline:

import urllib.parse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid scheme")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Missing netloc")
    image_id = parsed.path.split('/')[-1] if parsed.path else ''
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but what if the path is something like '/a/b/c'? Then split gives ['','a','b','c'], so last element is 'c'.

But what if the path is empty? Like the URL is 'http://example.com'? Then parsed.path is empty string, so image_id is empty.

But maybe the image_href is supposed to have a path. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's acceptable.

But what about if the image_href is not a URL? Like a local file path? The function uses urllib, which suggests that the image_href is a URL. So perhaps the function is intended to parse URLs.

Now, the unit tests. Let's think about test cases.

Test case 1: Valid HTTPS URL with image ID.

image_href = "https://example.com/images/12345.png"

Expected: image_id = '12345.png', netloc = 'example.com', use_ssl = True.

Test case 2: Valid HTTP URL with image ID.

image_href = "http://example.com/images/67890.jpg"

Expected: image_id = '67890.jpg', netloc = 'example.com', use_ssl = False.

Test case 3: URL with no path (only netloc).

image_href = "http://example.com"

Expected: image_id is empty string, netloc is 'example.com', use_ssl False.

Test case 4: URL with path but no image (like /index.html).

image_href = "https://example.com/index.html"

image_id is 'index.html'.

Test case 5: Invalid scheme (ftp).

image_href = "ftp://example.com/images/123.png" → raises ValueError.

Test case 6: Missing netloc (like 'http://') → raises ValueError.

Test case 7: Empty image_href → raises ValueError.

But how to handle empty image_href? The function would parse it as a URL with scheme empty, so the first check would fail.

So, the code should handle these cases.

Now, the code needs to import urllib.parse and use urlparse.

But the function's docstring says to import urllib. Wait, the docstring says: "import urllib." But that's probably a typo. Maybe it's supposed to say "import urllib.parse" or something. But the user's docstring says "import urllib." So perhaps the function is supposed to use urllib, but the actual code would need to import urllib.parse.

So, the code would need to import urllib.parse.

Now, the code for the function.

But what about cases where the path is something like '/a/b/c/d' → image_id is 'd'.

But what if the path is '/a/b/c/d/e.png'? Then image_id is 'e.png'.

So the code seems to handle that.

Now, the code:

import urllib.parse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid scheme")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Missing netloc")
    image_id = parsed.path.split('/')[-1] if parsed.path else ''
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but what if the parsed.path is something like 'images/12345.png'? Then split gives ['images', '12345.png'], so last element is '12345.png'.

Yes.

But what if the path is empty? Like the URL is 'http://example.com'? Then parsed.path is empty string, so image_id is empty.

But maybe the image_href is supposed to have a path. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify, so the code handles it.

Now, the unit tests. But the user says to output only the code generated. But the initial instruction says to generate the tests first. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tip says to follow TDD, but output only the code. So maybe the code is the main thing here.

So, the code is as above. But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Wait, but what about if the image_href is something like 'http://example.com/path/to/image?query=param'? The path is '/path/to/image', so image_id is 'image'.

Yes.

Another case: image_href is 'https://example.com/path/to/image.png?param=1' → image_id is 'image.png'.

Yes.

Now, what about if the image_href has a fragment? Like 'http://example.com/path#fragment'? The path is '/path', so image_id is 'path'.

Yes.

So the code seems to handle that.

Now, what about if the image_href is 'http://example.com' → image_id is empty string.

But perhaps that's acceptable.

Now, the code raises ValueError if the scheme is not http or https, or if netloc is missing.

So, the code should handle those cases.

Now, the code uses urllib.parse.urlparse, which is correct.

So, the code seems to be correct.

But the user's docstring says to import urllib. Maybe that's a typo, but the code imports urllib.parse.

So, the final code is as written.
