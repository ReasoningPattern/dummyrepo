Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function _c_optimizations_ignored based on the given docstring. The function should return True if the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable is not none and not 0, else False.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says to check the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable. So, the steps are: check if that variable exists and its value is not 0. Wait, but how is the environment variable accessed in Python? Oh right, using os.environ.get.

Wait, the function needs to check if the environment variable is set and not equal to 0. But wait, the docstring says "not none and not 0". So, first, check if the variable exists (i.e., os.environ.get returns a value, not None), and then check that the value is not "0" (as a string?), or maybe as an integer? Wait, the environment variables are strings. So, the value is a string. So, the function should return True if the variable is present and its value is not "0".

Wait, but the docstring says "not none and not 0". So, the environment variable could be set to "0", which would make the function return False. So, the logic is: if the variable exists (is not None) and its value is not "0", then return True. Otherwise, return False.

So, the code would be something like:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    pure_python = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return pure_python is not None and pure_python != "0"

Wait, but what if the variable is set to "0"? Then the function returns False. If it's set to anything else, like "1" or "abc", then returns True. If it's not set, returns False.

But wait, the docstring says "return True if get 'PURE_PYTHON' environ is not none and not 0, else return False". So, the condition is that the environment variable is present (not None) and its value is not 0. But since environment variables are strings, comparing to "0" as a string makes sense.

So the code would be as above.

But wait, maybe the user intended to check if the value is not equal to 0 as an integer? Like, if the variable is set to "0", then converting to int would be 0. But the original code would check the string value. So, perhaps the correct approach is to check if the variable is present and its value is not "0".

But the docstring says "not 0", which could be ambiguous. However, since environment variables are strings, comparing the string to "0" is correct.

So the code would be:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    """
    Return True if get "PURE_PYTHON" environ is not none and not 0, else return False
    """
    pure_python = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return pure_python is not None and pure_python != "0"

Wait, but what if the variable is set to something like "00"? Then it's not equal to "0", so returns True. But maybe the intended check is whether the variable is set to a non-zero value. But according to the docstring, it's checking if the value is not 0. So, perhaps the correct approach is to check if the variable is present and its value is not "0".

So the code above should be correct.

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. Wait, the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention to follow TDD by first generating tests. But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So maybe the user wants the actual function code, not the tests. But the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the user wants the function code, and the tips are just for guidance. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer is just the function code.

But the user's instruction says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the answer is the function code. The tips mention TDD, but perhaps that's just for the thought process, and the actual answer is the code.

So the code would be:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    """
    Return True if get "PURE_PYTHON" environ is not none and not 0, else return False
    """
    pure_python = os.environ.get("PURE_PYTHON")
    return pure_python is not None and pure_python != "0"

But wait, maybe the user wants the code to check if the value is not 0 when converted to integer? For example, if the environment variable is set to "0", then converting to int would be 0. But the current code checks the string value. So, perhaps the correct approach is to check if the variable is present and its value, when converted to integer, is not zero. But the docstring says "not 0", which could be ambiguous. However, the original code's docstring says "not none and not 0", which might imply that the value is not the string "0".

But perhaps the intended logic is that if the environment variable is set to "0", then it's considered as not being ignored. So, the function returns True if the variable is present and its value is not "0".

So the code as written is correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
