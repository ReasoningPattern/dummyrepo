Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function string_to_int based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function converts a string into an integer using a specified alphabet. The alphabet is a list of characters, and each character in the input string corresponds to a position in the alphabet. For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 'a' would be 0, 'b' 1, 'c' 2. Then the string would be treated as a base-(length of alphabet) number. So, for instance, 'ab' would be 0 * len(alphabet) + 1 = 1.

First, I need to make sure that each character in the input string is present in the alphabet. If not, the function might raise an error. But the docstring says that the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so maybe we don't need to handle invalid characters. However, perhaps it's better to include a check to raise a ValueError if any character is not in the alphabet. But the problem statement says the string is composed of the letters in the alphabet, so maybe that's not necessary. But to be safe, maybe include a check.

Next, the conversion process. For each character in the string, find its index in the alphabet. Then, compute the value as a base-N number, where N is the length of the alphabet. For example, if the alphabet has 3 letters, each position contributes (digit) * (N^position), starting from the right. Wait, but the order of the string matters. Let's think: the first character is the most significant digit. For example, 'ab' would be (index of 'a') * N^1 + (index of 'b') * N^0. So for the string 'ab', with alphabet ['a','b','c'], it would be 0 * 3 + 1 = 1.

So the steps are:

1. Check that all characters in the string are in the alphabet. If not, raise an error.
2. For each character in the string, get its index in the alphabet.
3. Treat these indices as digits in a base-N number, where N is len(alphabet).
4. Convert this to an integer.

Now, how to implement this in Python.

First, the function parameters: string (str) and alphabet (List[str]).

So, for the code:

We can start by checking if the alphabet is empty. Wait, but the problem says that the string consists of letters in the alphabet. So if the alphabet is empty, then the string must be empty as well. But perhaps the function should handle that. However, the problem says that the string is composed of letters in the alphabet, so maybe the alphabet is non-empty. But to avoid errors, perhaps we should check that the alphabet is not empty. But maybe the function is designed to handle empty alphabet? Let's think. If the alphabet is empty, then the string must be empty. But converting an empty string would return 0? Or maybe it's an error. But the problem says that the string is composed of letters in the alphabet. So if the alphabet is empty, the string must be empty. But perhaps the function should handle that. However, the problem may not cover that case. Let's proceed.

First, check that the alphabet is not empty. If it's empty, then the string must be empty. But if the string is not empty, then it's invalid. But according to the docstring, the string consists of letters in the alphabet. So if the alphabet is empty, the string must be empty. But perhaps the function should raise an error if the alphabet is empty and the string is not. But maybe the function is designed to have a non-empty alphabet. Let's proceed under the assumption that the alphabet is non-empty. However, in code, perhaps we should handle that.

But let's proceed. For each character in the string, we need to find its index in the alphabet. So, for example, for the string 'a', the index is 0. Then, the value is 0. For 'aa', it's 0 * len(alphabet) + 0 = 0. For 'ab', it's 0 * len(alphabet) + 1 = 1. So the code can be written as follows:

Initialize a result variable as 0. Then, for each character in the string:

result = result * len(alphabet) + index_of_char

So, for each character, multiply the current result by the base (len(alphabet)), then add the index of the current character.

Yes, that's the standard way to convert a string in a certain base to an integer.

So, the code steps:

- Check that the alphabet is not empty. If it is, then the string must be empty. Otherwise, it's invalid. But according to the docstring, the string is composed of letters in the alphabet. So if the alphabet is empty, the string must be empty. But perhaps the function should handle that. Let's think: if the alphabet is empty, then the string can't have any characters. So if the string is not empty, it's invalid. So in code:

if not alphabet:
    if string == '':
        return 0
    else:
        raise ValueError("Alphabet is empty but string is not empty")

But maybe the problem assumes that the alphabet is non-empty. However, to make the code robust, perhaps include that check.

But perhaps the problem expects that the alphabet is non-empty. Let's proceed.

So, for each character in the string, check if it's in the alphabet. If not, raise ValueError. Then, for each character, compute the index.

But how to check if the character is in the alphabet? Well, since the alphabet is a list, we can check if the character is in the list. However, for efficiency, perhaps we can create a dictionary that maps each character to its index. Because checking in a list is O(n), but with a dictionary it's O(1). So, perhaps create a mapping.

So, first, create a dictionary: char_to_index = {char: index for index, char in enumerate(alphabet)}.

Then, for each character in the string, check if it's in char_to_index. If not, raise ValueError.

Once that's done, proceed to compute the value.

So, the code:

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    if not alphabet:
        if string == '':
            return 0
        else:
            raise ValueError("Alphabet is empty but string is not empty")
    char_to_index = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(alphabet)}
    for char in string:
        if char not in char_to_index:
            raise ValueError(f"Character {char} not in alphabet")
    result = 0
    base = len(alphabet)
    for char in string:
        idx = char_to_index[char]
        result = result * base + idx
    return result

Wait, but what if the string is empty? For example, if the string is empty, then the result is 0. Which is correct. Because an empty string would represent zero in any base. But according to the problem statement, the string is composed of letters in the alphabet. So if the alphabet is non-empty, then the empty string is allowed. So the code handles that.

But what if the alphabet is empty and the string is empty? The code returns 0. But maybe that's not correct. Because if the alphabet is empty, then there are no characters, so the empty string is allowed. But the function's return value would be 0. But perhaps that's acceptable.

But perhaps the problem expects that the alphabet is non-empty. However, the code handles that case.

Now, let's think about test cases.

Test case 1: string is empty, alphabet is non-empty. Should return 0.

Test case 2: string is 'a', alphabet is ['a', 'b']. Should return 0.

Test case 3: string is 'ab', alphabet is ['a', 'b']. Then, 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1. So 0 * 2 + 1 = 1.

Test case 4: string is 'ba', alphabet is ['a', 'b']. Then, 'b' is 1, 'a' is 0. So 1 * 2 + 0 = 2.

Test case 5: string is 'aaa', alphabet is ['a', 'b']. Then, 0*2 + 0 = 0, then 0*2 + 0 = 0. So returns 0.

Another test case: alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], string is 'abc'. Then, 0*3 + 1 = 1, then 1*3 + 2 = 5. So returns 5.

Now, what about invalid characters? For example, string is 'd', alphabet is ['a', 'b']. Then, it should raise ValueError.

Now, the code includes checks for that.

Now, the code seems to handle all these cases.

Now, the problem says to generate the code. But the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the user wants the code, but the thinking process includes considering the tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code I wrote above should be correct.

But let me check for possible errors.

Wait, the function's parameters: the alphabet is a List[str]. So in Python, we need to import List from typing. But the code may not include that. However, the user's code may assume that the function is properly typed.

But the code as written should be correct.

Another possible edge case: the alphabet has one character. For example, alphabet is ['a'], string is 'a'. Then, the result is 0. If the string is 'aa', then 0 * 1 + 0 = 0. So it's correct.

Another case: alphabet is ['a', 'b'], string is 'b', returns 1.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the code should be written. Let me write it properly.

But the user wants the code in Python markdown format, so the code should be enclosed in triple backticks.

So the code would be:

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    """
    Convert a string to a number, using the given alphabet.
    :param string: a string consist of the letters in alphabet
    :param alphabet: list of letters
    :return: int, the corresponding number of the given string using the given transition rule.
    """
    if not alphabet:
        if string == '':
            return 0
        else:
            raise ValueError("Alphabet is empty but string is not empty")
    char_to_index = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(alphabet)}
    for char in string:
        if char not in char_to_index:
            raise ValueError(f"Character {char} not in alphabet")
    result = 0
    base = len(alphabet)
    for char in string:
        idx = char_to_index[char]
        result = result * base + idx
    return result

But wait, the function's docstring says that the string consists of the letters in the alphabet. So perhaps the code doesn't need to check for that, but the problem says to generate the code. However, the code includes the check, which is better for robustness.

So this code should be correct.
