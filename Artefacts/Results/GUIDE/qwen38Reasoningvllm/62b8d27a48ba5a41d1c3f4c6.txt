Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called cached that stores function results in a cache. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function signature is def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. The docstring says it returns a decorator that saves results in the cache. So the cached function is a decorator factory. It takes a cache object, a key function (defaulting to hashkey), and an optional lock.

Wait, what's hashkey? Oh right, maybe it's a function that generates a unique key for the arguments. So the key function is used to generate a key based on the function's arguments. The default key function is probably something like converting the arguments to a hashable type and then hashing them.

So the decorator will check if the result is already in the cache. If it is, return it. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and return it.

But how to handle the cache? The cache is passed to the cached function. So the decorator will use that cache. Also, there's a lock parameter, which might be used to handle concurrent access to the cache. So when multiple threads are accessing the cache, we need to lock to prevent race conditions.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The cached function takes cache, key, and lock. It returns a decorator.
2. The decorator will take a function and return a new function that wraps the original.
3. When the wrapped function is called, it will generate a key using the key function and the arguments.
4. Check if the key exists in the cache. If yes, return the cached value.
5. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and return it.
6. If there's a lock, acquire it before accessing the cache to prevent race conditions.

Wait, but how to handle the lock? The lock is probably a threading.Lock or similar. So when accessing the cache, we need to acquire the lock to ensure that only one thread is modifying the cache at a time.

But when checking if the key exists and then storing it, we need to make sure that these operations are atomic. So the lock should be acquired before checking and storing.

So the steps for the wrapped function would be:

- Generate the key using the key function and the arguments.
- Acquire the lock (if provided) to ensure exclusive access.
- Check if the key is in the cache.
- If present, return the value.
- If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and return it.
- Release the lock.

Wait, but what if the key is generated and then another thread checks it? The lock ensures that during the check and store, no other thread can interfere.

Now, the key function. The default is hashkey. What's hashkey? Maybe it's a function that takes the arguments and returns a hashable key. For example, for a function with arguments args and kwargs, the key could be a tuple of (args, frozenset(kwargs.items())). But how to handle the key function?

The key function is supposed to generate a unique key based on the function's arguments. So the key function should take the function's arguments and return a hashable value. The default key function is probably something like that.

So, the key function is passed as an argument to the cached decorator. So when the decorator is applied, it uses that key function to generate the key for the arguments.

So, the key function is called with the arguments of the decorated function. Wait, how do I get the arguments? The key function needs to take the arguments of the function call. So when the decorated function is called, the key is generated based on the arguments passed to that function.

So, for example, if the decorated function is called with args and kwargs, the key function is called with those args and kwargs to generate a key.

But how to pass those arguments to the key function? The key function is supposed to take the arguments of the decorated function. So the key function should be a function that takes *args and **kwargs, and returns a hashable key.

So, the default key function, hashkey, would be something like:

def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But maybe the user can provide their own key function. So the key function is passed to the cached decorator.

So, the decorator needs to generate the key by calling the key function with the arguments of the decorated function.

Now, putting this together.

The cached function returns a decorator. Let's think about how to structure that.

The decorator will take a function, say, func, and return a new function that wraps it.

So, the code would be something like:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # generate key
            key_val = key(*args, **kwargs)
            # check cache
            if key_val in cache:
                return cache[key_val]
            # compute result
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            # store in cache
            cache[key_val] = result
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, this doesn't handle the lock. So if there's a lock, we need to acquire it before checking and storing.

So, inside the wrapper function, before checking the cache, acquire the lock. But how to handle the lock? The lock is passed to the cached function. So, in the wrapper, when lock is present, we need to acquire it.

But how to handle the lock? Let's think. The lock is probably a threading.Lock instance. So, in the wrapper function:

if lock is not None:
    with lock:
        # check cache and store

But wait, the lock is passed to the cached function. So the decorator has access to it.

So modifying the code:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but this approach has a problem. If the lock is present, the code acquires it, checks if the key is in the cache, and if not, computes the result and stores it. But what if another thread checks the same key during this process? The lock ensures that only one thread is doing this at a time.

But in this code, when the lock is acquired, the code checks if the key is in the cache. If not, computes the result and stores it. So that's correct.

But what about the case where multiple threads are trying to compute the same key? The lock ensures that only one thread will compute it, and others will wait until it's done. Then, the first thread stores the result, and others will retrieve it from the cache.

So this should work.

But what about the default key function? The user might need to define hashkey. So, perhaps the hashkey function is a helper function that generates a key based on the arguments.

So, the hashkey function could be defined as:

def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But this is not part of the code. Wait, the user's function signature says key=hashkey, so hashkey must be a function that is available. So perhaps the user is expected to have a hashkey function, or maybe the code should include it.

Wait, the original problem says that the function signature is def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. So the default value for key is hashkey. Therefore, the code must have a hashkey function. But in the code generated, the hashkey function is not defined. So perhaps the code should include it.

Wait, but the user is asking to generate the code for the cached function. So perhaps the hashkey is a helper function that is part of the code. So, in the code, we need to define hashkey as a function.

But the problem says that the user is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should include the hashkey function as the default key function.

So, the code for the cached function would include the hashkey function as a default.

Wait, but the function signature says key=hashkey. So the hashkey must be a function that is available. Therefore, in the code, we need to define hashkey.

So, the code would have:

def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But wait, that's not correct. Because when you pass args and kwargs to the key function, you need to make sure that the key is hashable. For example, if the arguments are mutable, they need to be converted to a hashable type. So, the hashkey function would take the arguments and convert them into a tuple of args and a frozenset of the kwargs items. That way, the key is hashable.

So, the hashkey function is part of the code.

But the user's function signature says that the key parameter defaults to hashkey. So, the code for the cached function needs to include the hashkey function.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should include the hashkey function as part of the cached function's code.

Wait, but the function signature is def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. So, the hashkey is a function that is available. Therefore, in the code, the hashkey function must be defined.

So, the code for the cached function would include the hashkey function as a nested function, or perhaps as a separate function.

But the user's code is supposed to be generated, so the code must include the hashkey function.

So, the code would look like:

def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that saves the results in the cache
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the hashkey function is not part of the cached function. It's a separate function. But in the code, the cached function uses hashkey as the default key function. So, the code needs to have hashkey defined.

But the user's problem says that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should include the hashkey function as part of the cached function's code.

Alternatively, perhaps the hashkey is a helper function inside the cached function. But that's not possible because the default key is hashkey, which is a function. So, the code must have hashkey defined.

So, the code would include the hashkey function.

But the user's problem says that the code should be generated based on the given function signature and docstring. The function signature includes key=hashkey, which implies that hashkey is a function that is available. Therefore, the code should include the hashkey function.

So, the code would have:

def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that saves the results in the cache
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the hashkey function is not part of the cached function. It's a separate function. However, the code as written would have the hashkey function defined before the cached function. That's okay.

But the user's problem says that the code should be generated based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code should include the hashkey function as part of the code.

But the original problem's function signature is def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. So, the code must have hashkey defined. Therefore, the code generated should include the hashkey function.

Now, considering the test-driven development approach. The user mentioned that I should first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown format.

Wait, the initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But the tips say to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code, not the tests. So perhaps the user wants the code, but the tips are just for guidance. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated.

But the user's initial message says that the assistant should generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. So, the code should be generated, not the tests. However, the tips mention to generate unit tests first. But perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code is the main thing. However, the tips mention test-driven development, but the user's final instruction says to output only the code.

So, perhaps the code should be written as per the function signature and docstring, with the hashkey function included.

But wait, the hashkey function is not part of the function signature. The function signature is for the cached function. The hashkey is a default parameter for the key argument. Therefore, the code must include the hashkey function.

So, the code should include the hashkey function as part of the code.

But in the code, the hashkey function is not part of the cached function. So, the code would have:

def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that saves the results in the cache
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But the problem is that the hashkey function is not part of the cached function. However, the cached function uses it as the default key function. So, the code should include the hashkey function.

But the user's problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code should include the hashkey function.

Now, considering the code, there's a possible issue. The key function is called with *args and **kwargs. But when the key is generated, the args and kwargs are passed to the key function. For example, if the decorated function is called with args and kwargs, then the key function is called with those same args and kwargs.

But the hashkey function returns a tuple of args and a frozenset of kwargs items. This way, the key is hashable and unique for different arguments.

But what about if the same args and kwargs are passed in different orders? For example, if the function is called with args (1, 2) and kwargs {'a': 1}, versus args (1, 2) and kwargs {'a': 1} — they should generate the same key. But the hashkey function would generate the same key in both cases.

So, this should work.

Now, the code for the cached function includes the lock handling. If a lock is provided, it's acquired before checking and storing the cache. This prevents race conditions when multiple threads are accessing the cache.

But what about the cache? The cache is passed to the cached function. So, the cache could be a dictionary, or some other structure that supports key-value storage.

Now, the code for the cached function is written. But what about the tests? The user's tips mention to generate unit tests first, but the user's instruction says to output only the code. So perhaps the code is sufficient.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code is as written above.

But perhaps there are some issues. For example, the lock is acquired using a context manager (with lock: ...), which is correct for threading.Lock. But what if the lock is not a context manager? Well, assuming that the lock is a threading.Lock or similar, which supports the context manager protocol.

Another possible issue is that the key function may not be hashable. But the key function is supposed to return a hashable value, as it's used as a key in the cache. So, the key function must return a hashable type. The default hashkey function returns a tuple of args and a frozenset, which is hashable.

So, the code should work.

Now, putting all this together, the code would be as written above. But the user's problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format.

So, the final code would be:

```python
def hashkey(*args, **kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that saves the results in the cache
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                with lock:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
            else:
                if key_val in cache:
                    return cache[key_val]
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

But wait, the function signature in the problem is def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):. The code defines the hashkey function, which is correct.

But the user's problem says that the code should be generated based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code above is correct.

But the user's docstring says that the cached function returns a decorator that saves results in the cache. The code does that by checking the cache and storing the result if not present.

Another possible improvement: the key function could be called with the function's arguments, but what if the function has mutable parameters? The key function should generate a unique key based on the arguments. The hashkey function handles that by converting args to a tuple and kwargs to a frozenset.

So, the code seems correct.
