Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says it should remove and return the least frequently used (key, value) pair. Hmm, so this is likely part of a data structure that tracks usage frequency, maybe something like a cache with eviction based on frequency.

First, I should think about the data structures involved. Common approaches for such scenarios involve using a combination of a dictionary to hold the key-value pairs, and a way to track the frequency of each key. Also, since we need to efficiently find the least frequently used item, perhaps a priority queue or a heap could be useful. However, heaps can be tricky because when frequencies change, the heap might not reflect the current state correctly.

Alternatively, maybe using an OrderedDict with some modifications. Wait, but OrderedDict's move_to_end method can be used to track usage. However, the problem here is about frequency, not just access order. So perhaps we need a way to track the frequency of each key and keep track of the least frequent ones.

Another approach is to use a dictionary to store the frequencies and a priority queue (heap) that orders items by their frequency. But when the frequency of a key changes, we need to update the heap. However, standard heaps don't support efficient updates, so this could lead to issues with stale entries. To handle this, maybe we can use a lazy approach where we check if the top of the heap is still valid when we pop it.

Wait, but the problem says to remove and return the least frequently used. So each time a key is accessed, its frequency increases. The least frequent key is the one with the lowest count. So the data structure needs to support:

1. Insertion of key-value pairs.
2. Updating the frequency of a key when it's accessed.
3. Efficiently finding and removing the key with the minimum frequency.

Let me think about the possible data structures. One common approach for this is to use a combination of a dictionary for the values, a dictionary for frequencies, and a heap that stores tuples of (frequency, key, value). However, when the frequency of a key changes, the heap might have old entries. To handle this, when we pop from the heap, we check if the frequency stored in the heap entry matches the current frequency of the key. If not, we discard it and proceed to the next entry.

So, the steps for the popitem method would be:

- Check the heap for the entry with the minimum frequency.
- While the top entry's frequency doesn't match the current frequency of the key, pop it from the heap.
- Once a valid entry is found, remove the key from the dictionary and return the (key, value) pair.

But how do we manage the heap? Let's outline the data structures:

- A dictionary (self.data) to hold the key-value pairs.
- A dictionary (self.freq) to track the frequency of each key.
- A priority queue (heap) that stores tuples of (frequency, key, value). However, since the heap is a min-heap, the entry with the smallest frequency will be at the top.

But when a key's frequency is updated, the heap might have multiple entries for that key with different frequencies. So, when we pop from the heap, we need to check if the frequency in the heap entry matches the current frequency of the key. If not, we skip that entry.

So, for the popitem method:

1. While the heap is not empty:
   a. Pop the entry with the smallest frequency (frequency, key, value).
   b. Check if the current frequency of the key in self.freq matches the frequency in the entry.
   c. If it does, remove the key from self.data and self.freq, and return (key, value).
   d. If not, continue popping entries until a valid one is found.

But what if the heap is empty? That would be an error, but assuming the data structure is properly maintained, this shouldn't happen.

Now, considering that the heap might have multiple entries for the same key with different frequencies, but only the latest one (with the current frequency) is valid. The others are considered stale and should be ignored.

So, the code would need to handle this.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think about test cases:

Test case 1: Basic case. Insert a few items, check that popitem removes the least frequent. For example, if all items have the same frequency, then the order might be based on insertion, but since the problem says "least frequently used", if frequencies are the same, perhaps the one with the earliest insertion is removed. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe the order is arbitrary as long as the frequency is the same. However, for testing, perhaps we can assume that when frequencies are equal, the order is based on insertion order, but that's not specified. So maybe the test cases should focus on frequency changes.

Test case 2: After accessing a key, its frequency increases. So, after accessing, the least frequent key should be the one with the lower frequency.

Test case 3: Multiple keys with varying frequencies. Ensure that the least frequent is removed.

But how to implement the popitem method? Let's outline the code.

The class would need to have:

- self.data: a dictionary mapping keys to values.
- self.freq: a dictionary mapping keys to their current frequencies.
- self.heap: a priority queue (heapq) that stores (frequency, key, value) tuples.

But when we push to the heap, we can push the current frequency and key. However, when the frequency changes, the heap may have old entries. So, when we pop from the heap, we check if the frequency in the entry matches the current frequency of the key. If not, we discard it.

So, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    while self.heap:
        freq, key, value = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        if self.freq[key] == freq:
            del self.data[key]
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise KeyError("popitem from empty container")

But wait, what about the heap entries that are not valid? For example, if a key was accessed and its frequency increased, then the old entry in the heap is invalid. So, when we pop from the heap, we check if the frequency matches. If not, we continue popping.

But this approach could lead to O(n) time complexity in the worst case if there are many invalid entries. However, in practice, each entry is processed once, so the amortized cost might be acceptable.

Now, for the unit tests, we need to test scenarios where:

- The container is empty (should raise KeyError).
- After inserting items, popitem returns the least frequent.
- After updating frequencies, the least frequent is correctly chosen.

But how to implement the class? Let's assume that the class has an __init__ method that initializes the data structures.

So, the class would have:

class LFUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.data = {}
        self.freq = {}
        self.heap = []

    def popitem(self):
        # as discussed

But wait, the problem says the function is part of a class, but the function signature is given as def popitem(self). So, the code is part of a class, perhaps a cache implementation.

But the user hasn't provided the full class, just the popitem method. So, perhaps the class is a LFU cache, and the popitem method is part of that.

Now, for the unit tests, we can write test cases using pytest or unittest. But since the user wants the code generated, and the output is only the code, I need to generate the code for the class, including the popitem method, and the unit tests.

But the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, perhaps the code is part of a class, and the unit tests are written first.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code in Python markdown. So, the code would be the implementation of the popitem method, and possibly the class it belongs to.

But the user hasn't provided the full class, so I need to assume that the class is something like a LFU cache.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

Implementing the LFUCache class with popitem method that uses a heap to track frequencies, and handles stale entries.

Now, writing the code:

import heapq

class LFUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.data = {}
        self.freq = {}
        self.heap = []

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
        """
        while self.heap:
            freq, key, value = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
            if self.freq.get(key, 0) == freq:
                del self.data[key]
                del self.freq[key]
                return (key, value)
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty container")

But wait, the problem says that the function is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the other methods. However, the popitem method is supposed to be part of the class. Also, the capacity is probably part of the class's __init__.

But the user's function signature is def popitem(self), so the code is part of a class.

Now, for the unit tests, using pytest style:

def test_popitem_empty():
    cache = LFUCache(0)
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        cache.popitem()

def test_popitem_single_item():
    cache = LFUCache(1)
    cache.data['a'] = 1
    cache.freq['a'] = 1
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'a', 1))
    assert cache.popitem() == ('a', 1)

But wait, the LFUCache class's __init__ would need to initialize the data, freq, and heap. However, in the current code, when inserting items, how are they added to the heap? The current code for popitem doesn't handle inserting items. So, perhaps the LFUCache class has other methods like put or get that update the frequencies and the heap.

But the user hasn't provided those methods, so perhaps the code is incomplete. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, perhaps the code for the popitem method is as above, and the other methods are not required.

But the problem is that the popitem method would need to have the data structures properly maintained. For example, when a key is accessed, its frequency is incremented, and the heap is updated. However, the current code for popitem doesn't handle that. So, perhaps the code is incomplete.

But given the information provided, the user only asked for the popitem method. So, perhaps the code is as written, assuming that the other methods (like put or get) are handling the heap updates.

But this is a problem. Because, for example, when a key is accessed, its frequency increases, but the heap may have old entries. However, the popitem method is supposed to remove the least frequent, so the heap entries for that key with lower frequencies are considered stale and will be ignored when popped.

So, the code for popitem is as above.

Now, writing the unit tests. Let's think of test cases:

Test case 1: Empty cache raises KeyError.

Test case 2: Insert one item, popitem returns it.

Test case 3: Insert multiple items, check that the least frequent is removed.

But how to test that? For example, inserting two items with same frequency, then popitem should return one of them. But since the heap is a min-heap, the first one inserted would be popped first. But the problem says "least frequently used", so if frequencies are same, the order is based on insertion? Or maybe the order is arbitrary. But the test case would need to ensure that the correct item is removed.

But perhaps the test case can be written as:

def test_popitem_multiple_items():
    cache = LFUCache(2)
    cache.data['a'] = 1
    cache.freq['a'] = 1
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'a', 1))
    cache.data['b'] = 2
    cache.freq['b'] = 1
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'b', 2))
    assert cache.popitem() in [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]

But this test case would pass if either item is removed. However, the actual order depends on how the heap is structured. Since heapq in Python is a min-heap, the entries with the same frequency would be ordered based on the next elements in the tuple. Since the key is part of the tuple, the heap would order based on the key. But in Python, when tuples are compared, (1, 'a', ...) is considered less than (1, 'b', ...) because 'a' < 'b'. So, the first entry would be popped first.

So, the test case would expect 'a' to be popped first.

But this is dependent on the heap's ordering. So, the test case would need to account for that.

Another test case: after accessing a key, its frequency increases. For example:

cache = LFUCache(2)
cache.data['a'] = 1
cache.freq['a'] = 1
heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'a', 1))
cache.data['b'] = 2
cache.freq['b'] = 1
heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'b', 2))
# Access 'a' so its frequency increases to 2
cache.freq['a'] = 2
heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (2, 'a', 1))
# Now, popitem should return 'b' since it has frequency 1
assert cache.popitem() == ('b', 2)

But in this case, the heap has entries (1, 'a', 1), (1, 'b', 2), (2, 'a', 1). When we pop, the first entry is (1, 'a', 1), but the current frequency of 'a' is 2. So, this entry is invalid and is popped. Then the next entry is (1, 'b', 2), which has frequency 1. So, it's valid and is returned.

So, the test case would pass.

Now, putting all this together, the code for the class and the unit tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, outputting only the code. So, the code would be the LFUCache class with the popitem method, and the unit tests.

But the user may not have provided the other methods, but the popitem method is part of the class. So, the code is as follows:

Implementing the LFUCache class with the popitem method, and the unit tests.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown. So, the code would be:

```python
import heapq

class LFUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.data = {}
        self.freq = {}
        self.heap = []

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
        """
        while self.heap:
            freq, key, value = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
            if self.freq.get(key, 0) == freq:
                del self.data[key]
                del self.freq[key]
                return (key, value)
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty container")
```

And the unit tests:

```python
import pytest

def test_popitem_empty():
    cache = LFUCache(0)
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        cache.popitem()

def test_popitem_single_item():
    cache = LFUCache(1)
    cache.data['a'] = 1
    cache.freq['a'] = 1
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'a', 1))
    assert cache.popitem() == ('a', 1)

def test_popitem_multiple_items():
    cache = LFUCache(2)
    cache.data['a'] = 1
    cache.freq['a'] = 1
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'a', 1))
    cache.data['b'] = 2
    cache.freq['b'] = 1
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'b', 2))
    assert cache.popitem() in [('a', 1), ('b', 2)]

def test_popitem_after_access():
    cache = LFUCache(2)
    cache.data['a'] = 1
    cache.freq['a'] = 1
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'a', 1))
    cache.data['b'] = 2
    cache.freq['b'] = 1
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (1, 'b', 2))
    # Access 'a' to increase its frequency
    cache.freq['a'] = 2
    heapq.heappush(cache.heap, (2, 'a', 1))
    assert cache.popitem() == ('b', 2)
```

But the user's instruction says to output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. So, the answer should include the code for the class and the unit tests.

But the user may have intended that the code is only the popitem method, but given the function signature and docstring, it's part of a class. So, the code as written above is correct.

However, the code for the LFUCache class may not be complete. For example, the put and get methods are not implemented, which would be necessary for the cache to function properly. But the user hasn't asked for those, only the popitem method.

So, the final answer is the code for the LFUCache class with the popitem method, and the unit tests.
