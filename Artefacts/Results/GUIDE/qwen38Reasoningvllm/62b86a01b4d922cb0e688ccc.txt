Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function generate_default_observer_schema_dict based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

Let me start by understanding the function's purpose. The docstring says that the function creates a new dictionary where the values are generated based on the value types in the manifest_dict. The first_level parameter is a boolean, which might affect how the keys are processed, especially for nested structures.

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The manifest_dict is a dictionary, and for each key-value pair, the function should generate a schema dict. The schema might be something like specifying types, required fields, etc. For example, if a value is a dict, the function might generate a nested schema, and if it's a list, maybe a schema for the items in the list.

The first_level parameter might indicate whether the current level is the top level of the manifest_dict. This could affect how keys are handled, perhaps by not adding certain prefixes or by applying different rules for top-level keys.

Let me think about possible test cases. For example, if the manifest_dict is empty, the function should return an empty dict. If a key has a string value, maybe the schema would have a type 'string'. If it's a dict, then the schema would be a nested dict. For lists, maybe the schema would have a type 'list' and an items schema.

Wait, the function's docstring says the new dictionary is returned, with values generated based on the value types. So the function is building a schema that describes the structure of the manifest_dict. This sounds similar to generating a JSON schema, where each key's value type determines the schema structure.

So, for each key in manifest_dict, the function would create an entry in the new dict. The value in the new dict would be a schema based on the type of the value in manifest_dict.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Iterate over each key-value pair in manifest_dict.
2. For each key, determine the type of the value.
3. Based on the type, generate the corresponding schema value.
4. Add the key and generated schema to the new dict.
5. If first_level is True, maybe handle the keys differently, like not adding a prefix or something. Wait, the first_level parameter's purpose isn't clear. The docstring says "first_level=False" but doesn't explain what it does. Maybe the first_level parameter is used to determine whether to process the keys as top-level or nested. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added as-is, but when False, they might be prefixed or processed differently. However, the original function's docstring doesn't specify this, so perhaps I need to make an assumption here.

Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is used to indicate whether the current level is the first level, which could affect how the keys are handled. For instance, when first_level is True, the keys are added directly, but when False, they are nested under a certain prefix. However, without more information, this is speculative.

Wait, the original function's docstring says that the new dict is generated based on the value types in the manifest_dict. So perhaps the function is generating a schema that describes the structure of the manifest_dict. For example:

If the manifest_dict has a key 'name' with a string value, the schema would have 'name': {'type': 'string'}.

If the value is a dict, then the schema would recursively generate the schema for that dict. Similarly, for lists, it would generate a schema for the items.

So the function is building a schema that describes the structure of the manifest_dict. The first_level parameter might be used to determine whether to include certain keys or how to handle them at the top level. For example, maybe when first_level is True, the keys are not prefixed, but when False, they are nested under a certain key. But again, without more info, this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is used to indicate whether the current level is the first level, which could affect how the keys are processed. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added as-is, but when False, they are prefixed with something like 'observer_'.

But since the original function's docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the first_level parameter is a flag that affects the processing of the keys. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are processed as top-level, and when False, they are processed as nested keys. However, without more info, it's challenging to know.

Given that the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the assumption that the first_level parameter is used to determine whether the keys should be processed in a certain way, perhaps by not adding a prefix when first_level is True. Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is used to indicate whether the current level is the top level, which affects how the schema is generated for nested structures.

Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is a flag that affects the generation of the schema. For example, when first_level is True, the function generates a schema that includes all keys, but when False, it skips certain keys. However, without more context, it's hard to say.

Since the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps I should proceed with the core functionality first, assuming that the first_level parameter is used to handle the top-level keys differently. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added directly, but when False, they are nested under a certain key. However, this is just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is used to determine whether the keys should be included in the schema. For instance, if first_level is True, then the keys are included, but if False, they are excluded. But again, this is speculative.

Given that the user wants the code generated, perhaps I should proceed with writing the function, assuming that the first_level parameter is used to determine whether to process the keys as top-level or nested. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are processed as top-level, and when False, they are processed as nested under a certain key. However, without more info, this is challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the first_level parameter is a flag that affects the schema generation for nested structures. For example, when first_level is True, the function generates a schema for the top-level keys, and when False, it generates schemas for nested keys. But again, this is unclear.

Given that the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps I should proceed with writing the function that handles the basic case, and then see how the first_level parameter comes into play.

Let me think about the function's structure. The function takes manifest_dict and first_level. The goal is to generate a new dictionary where each key's value is based on the type of the value in manifest_dict.

For example:

If manifest_dict is {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, then the generated schema would be {'name': {'type': 'string'}, 'age': {'type': 'integer'}}.

If a value is a dict, like {'address': {'city': 'New York'}}, then the schema would be {'address': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'city': {'type': 'string'}}}}.

For lists, the schema might be {'type': 'array', 'items': ...}.

So, the function needs to recursively generate the schema for each value.

Now, considering the first_level parameter. Maybe when first_level is True, the function does not add any prefix to the keys, but when False, it adds a prefix like 'observer_' or something. However, the original function's docstring doesn't mention this, so perhaps the first_level parameter is not used in the current implementation. Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is used to determine whether to include certain keys or to process them differently.

Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is a flag that indicates whether the current level is the first level, and thus, the keys should be processed without any nesting. For example, if the manifest_dict is a top-level dict, then first_level is True, and the function processes the keys directly. If it's nested, then first_level is False, and perhaps the keys are processed with a prefix.

But without more info, it's hard to proceed. However, since the user wants the code generated, perhaps I should proceed with writing the function that handles the basic case, and then handle the first_level parameter as needed.

Let me outline the steps for the function:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary.
2. Iterate over each key-value pair in manifest_dict.
3. For each key, determine the type of the value.
4. Generate the corresponding schema value based on the type.
5. Add the key and generated schema to the new dictionary.
6. If the value is a dict, recursively call the function with first_level=False (assuming that nested dicts are processed with first_level=False).
7. If the value is a list, generate a schema for the items (e.g., if the list contains dicts, then the items schema is generated recursively).

But how does the first_level parameter affect this? Maybe when first_level is True, the keys are processed without any modification, but when False, they are prefixed. For example, if the first_level is False, the keys might be prefixed with 'observer_'.

Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is used to determine whether to include certain keys in the schema. For instance, if first_level is True, the keys are included, but if False, they are excluded. However, this is just a guess.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the first_level parameter is not used in the current implementation, but the user included it in the function signature. So, perhaps the first_level parameter is used to determine whether the keys should be processed as top-level keys or nested keys. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added directly, but when False, they are nested under a certain key. However, without more info, this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is a flag that affects the schema generation for nested structures. For example, when first_level is True, the function generates a schema that includes all keys, but when False, it generates a schema that only includes certain keys.

Given that the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps I should proceed with writing the function that handles the basic case, and then see how the first_level parameter comes into play. For example, the first_level parameter could be used to determine whether to include the key in the schema. But again, without more info, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the first_level parameter is used to indicate whether the current level is the first level, which affects how the keys are processed. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are processed without any prefix, but when False, they are prefixed with something like 'observer_'.

Assuming that, here's how the function could work:

- If first_level is True, the keys are added directly.
- If first_level is False, the keys are prefixed with 'observer_'.

But this is just a guess. However, given the function's name 'generate_default_observer_schema_dict', it's possible that the first_level parameter is used to indicate whether the keys should be prefixed with 'observer_'.

Alternatively, perhaps the first_level parameter is used to determine whether the keys are included in the schema. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are included, but when False, they are not. However, this is not clear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the first_level parameter is not used in the current implementation, and the function is supposed to generate a schema based on the types of the values, regardless of the first_level parameter. However, the presence of the first_level parameter in the function signature suggests that it does have an effect.

Another approach: think about the function's name and the term 'observer'. Maybe this function is part of a system that generates a schema for an observer, and the first_level parameter indicates whether the current level is the top level of the observer's configuration. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added as top-level keys in the observer's schema, and when False, they are nested under a certain key.

But without more context, it's hard to say. Given that, perhaps the first_level parameter is used to determine whether the keys should be processed as top-level or nested. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added directly, and when False, they are nested under a certain key. However, without knowing the exact logic, this is speculative.

To proceed, I'll assume that the first_level parameter is used to determine whether the keys should be processed as top-level. For example, if first_level is True, the keys are added directly, but if False, they are prefixed with 'observer_'.

But since the function's name is generate_default_observer_schema_dict, maybe the first_level parameter is used to indicate whether the keys are part of the observer's top-level schema or nested within it. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added as top-level, and when False, they are nested under a key like 'observer'.

But again, this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the first_level parameter is used to determine whether to include the key in the schema. For example, if first_level is True, the key is included, but if False, it's excluded. However, this doesn't make much sense.

Given that I need to generate code, perhaps I should proceed with the following approach:

The function generates a schema dict where each key's value is based on the type of the corresponding value in manifest_dict. For example:

- If the value is a string, the schema is {'type': 'string'}.
- If the value is a dict, recursively generate the schema for that dict.
- If the value is a list, generate a schema for the items in the list.

The first_level parameter might be used to determine whether to include certain keys or how to handle them. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are processed as top-level, and when False, they are nested under a certain key. However, without more info, I'll proceed with the assumption that the first_level parameter is not used in the current implementation, and the function simply generates the schema based on the types of the values.

But the presence of the first_level parameter suggests that it does have an effect. Let me think of another possibility: the first_level parameter might indicate whether the current level is the first level, and thus, the keys should be processed without any prefix. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added directly, but when False, they are prefixed with something like 'observer_'.

Assuming that, here's how the function could work:

def generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest_dict, first_level=False):
    schema = {}
    for key, value in manifest_dict.items():
        if first_level:
            # process key as top-level
            pass
        else:
            # process key with prefix
            pass
        # generate schema for value
    return schema

But again, without knowing the exact logic, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the first_level parameter is used to determine whether the keys should be included in the schema. For example, if first_level is True, the keys are included, but if False, they are excluded. However, this doesn't make much sense.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps I should proceed with writing the function that handles the basic case of generating a schema based on the types of the values, and then handle the first_level parameter as a flag that affects the keys. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added as-is, and when False, they are prefixed with 'observer_'.

So, here's a possible implementation:

def generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest_dict, first_level=False):
    schema = {}
    for key, value in manifest_dict.items():
        if first_level:
            key_in_schema = key
        else:
            key_in_schema = f'observer_{key}'
        # generate schema for value
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            schema[key_in_schema] = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value, first_level=False)
        elif isinstance(value, list):
            # handle list
            schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': 'array', 'items': generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value[0], first_level=False) if value else {}}
        else:
            schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': type(value).__name__}
    return schema

But this is just a guess. However, the user mentioned that the function should generate a new dictionary based on the value types in the manifest_dict. So, for each key, the value in the new dict is a schema based on the type of the value in manifest_dict.

Another possibility is that the function is generating a schema where each key's value is a type string, like 'string', 'integer', etc. For example:

If the value is a string, the schema is {'type': 'string'}.
If the value is a dict, the schema is {'type': 'object', 'properties': ...}.
If the value is a list, the schema is {'type': 'array', 'items': ...}.

So, the function would recursively generate the schema for each value.

In this case, the first_level parameter might be used to determine whether to include certain keys or how to handle them. For example, when first_level is True, the keys are added directly, and when False, they are prefixed with 'observer_'.

But again, without more info, this is speculative.

Given that, I'll proceed with writing the code that generates a schema based on the types of the values in the manifest_dict, with the first_level parameter affecting the keys by adding a prefix. For example, if first_level is True, the keys are added as-is, but if False, they are prefixed with 'observer_'.

So, the code would look something like this:

def generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest_dict, first_level=False):
    schema = {}
    for key, value in manifest_dict.items():
        key_in_schema = key if first_level else f'observer_{key}'
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            schema[key_in_schema] = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value, first_level=False)
        elif isinstance(value, list):
            if value:
                schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': 'array', 'items': generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value[0], first_level=False)}
            else:
                schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': 'array', 'items': {}}
        else:
            schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': type(value).__name__}
    return schema

But this is just an example. However, the user's docstring says that the values in the new dict are generated based on the value types in the manifest_dict. So, for example, if the value is a string, the schema would have 'type': 'string'.

But what about if the value is a boolean? The type would be 'boolean', and so on.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think of some test cases:

Test case 1: manifest_dict is empty. The function should return an empty dict.

Test case 2: manifest_dict has a string value. The schema should have a key with 'type': 'string'.

Test case 3: manifest_dict has a dict value. The schema should have a key with a nested schema.

Test case 4: manifest_dict has a list value. The schema should have a key with 'type': 'array' and 'items' schema.

Test case 5: first_level is True, so keys are added as-is. If first_level is False, keys are prefixed with 'observer_'.

But since the first_level parameter's exact effect is unclear, the tests should cover both scenarios.

However, without knowing the exact behavior, the tests may not be accurate. But given the function's name and the presence of the first_level parameter, the tests should cover both cases.

So, the unit tests would look like this:

import unittest

class TestGenerateDefaultObserverSchemaDict(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_manifest(self):
        manifest = {}
        result = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest, first_level=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, {})

    def test_string_value(self):
        manifest = {'name': 'Alice'}
        result = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest, first_level=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'name': {'type': 'str'}})

    def test_dict_value(self):
        manifest = {'address': {'city': 'New York'}}
        result = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest, first_level=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'address': {'type': 'dict', 'properties': {'city': {'type': 'str'}}}})

    def test_list_value(self):
        manifest = {'tags': ['python', 'java']}
        result = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest, first_level=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'tags': {'type': 'list', 'items': {'type': 'str'}}})

    def test_first_level_false(self):
        manifest = {'name': 'Alice'}
        result = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest, first_level=False)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'observer_name': {'type': 'str'}})

    def test_nested_dict(self):
        manifest = {'user': {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}}
        result = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest, first_level=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'user': {'type': 'dict', 'properties': {'name': {'type': 'str'}, 'age': {'type': 'int'}}}})

    def test_nested_list(self):
        manifest = {'items': [{'name': 'item1'}, {'name': 'item2'}]}
        result = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest, first_level=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'items': {'type': 'list', 'items': {'type': 'dict', 'properties': {'name': {'type': 'str'}}}}})

But again, this depends on the actual implementation of the function. However, without knowing the exact behavior, this is the best guess.

Now, the actual code. The function needs to generate a schema based on the types of the values in the manifest_dict. The first_level parameter might affect how the keys are processed.

Assuming that the first_level parameter is used to determine whether to add a prefix to the keys (like 'observer_'), the code would look like this:

def generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest_dict, first_level=False):
    schema = {}
    for key, value in manifest_dict.items():
        if first_level:
            key_in_schema = key
        else:
            key_in_schema = f'observer_{key}'
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            schema[key_in_schema] = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value, first_level=False)
        elif isinstance(value, list):
            if value:
                schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': 'array', 'items': generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value[0], first_level=False)}
            else:
                schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': 'array', 'items': {}}
        else:
            schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': type(value).__name__}
    return schema

But this code has some issues. For example, if the value is a list but empty, the 'items' would be an empty dict. Also, for the type, we're using the __name__ of the type, which for int is 'int', for str is 'str', etc. However, the actual schema might expect 'integer' instead of 'int', 'string' instead of 'str', etc. So perhaps we need to map the type names.

For example, instead of 'int', use 'integer', and 'str' to 'string', 'bool' to 'boolean', etc.

So, modifying the code:

def generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest_dict, first_level=False):
    schema = {}
    for key, value in manifest_dict.items():
        if first_level:
            key_in_schema = key
        else:
            key_in_schema = f'observer_{key}'
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            schema[key_in_schema] = generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value, first_level=False)
        elif isinstance(value, list):
            if value:
                schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': 'array', 'items': generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value[0], first_level=False)}
            else:
                schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': 'array', 'items': {}}
        else:
            type_name = type(value).__name__
            if type_name == 'int':
                type_name = 'integer'
            elif type_name == 'str':
                type_name = 'string'
            elif type_name == 'bool':
                type_name = 'boolean'
            schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': type_name}
    return schema

This would handle the type names more appropriately.

Now, testing this code with the previous test cases:

Test case 1: empty manifest_dict returns empty dict.

Test case 2: {'name': 'Alice'} returns {'name': {'type': 'string'}}.

Test case 3: {'address': {'city': 'New York'}} returns {'address': {'type': 'dict', 'properties': {'city': {'type': 'string'}}}}.

Wait, but in the code above, for a dict value, the schema is generated recursively. So, for the 'address' key, the value is a dict, so the schema would be a dict with 'type': 'dict' and 'properties' as the generated schema for the inner dict. But in the current code, the schema for a dict is just the recursively generated dict, not including 'type': 'dict' and 'properties'.

Ah, here's a problem. The current code for dict values just recursively generates the schema, but doesn't include the 'type' and 'properties' keys. So, for example, if the value is a dict, the schema should be {'type': 'object', 'properties': ...}.

So, the code needs to handle dict values by generating a schema that includes 'type': 'object' and 'properties' with the recursively generated schema.

So, modifying the code:

def generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest_dict, first_level=False):
    schema = {}
    for key, value in manifest_dict.items():
        if first_level:
            key_in_schema = key
        else:
            key_in_schema = f'observer_{key}'
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            # For dict values, generate a schema with type 'object' and properties
            schema[key_in_schema] = {
                'type': 'object',
                'properties': generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value, first_level=False)
            }
        elif isinstance(value, list):
            if value:
                schema[key_in_schema] = {
                    'type': 'array',
                    'items': generate_default_observer_schema_dict(value[0], first_level=False)
                }
            else:
                schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': 'array', 'items': {}}
        else:
            type_name = type(value).__name__
            if type_name == 'int':
                type_name = 'integer'
            elif type_name == 'str':
                type_name = 'string'
            elif type_name == 'bool':
                type_name = 'boolean'
            schema[key_in_schema] = {'type': type_name}
    return schema

This way, for dict values, the schema includes 'type': 'object' and 'properties' with the recursively generated schema.

Now, testing this code with the previous test cases:

Test case 3: {'address': {'city': 'New York'}} would generate for 'address' a schema {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'city': {'type': 'string'}}}.

Test case 2: {'name': 'Alice'} would generate {'name': {'type': 'string'}}.

Test case 4: {'tags': ['python', 'java']} would generate {'tags': {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'string'}}}.

This seems better.

Now, the first_level parameter. In the current code, when first_level is False, the keys are prefixed with 'observer_'. For example, if the manifest_dict is {'name': 'Alice'}, and first_level is False, the key becomes 'observer_name'.

But what about when the value is a dict? For example, if the manifest_dict is {'user': {'name': 'Alice'}}, and first_level is False, then the key for 'user' is 'observer_user', and the schema for 'user' would be {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'name': {'type': 'string'}}}.

This seems correct.

Now, the unit tests. The test cases should cover these scenarios.

Now, the final code would be as above. However, the user mentioned that the function should return a new dictionary where the values are generated based on the value types in the manifest_dict. The current code does that.

But what about if the value is a list of dicts? For example, [{'name': 'Alice'}, {'name': 'Bob'}], the schema would be {'type': 'array', 'items': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'name': {'type': 'string'}}}}.

Yes, that's handled correctly.

Now, the first_level parameter is used to prefix the keys with 'observer_' when first_level is False.

Thus, the code should be as written above.

Now, the user also mentioned that the code should be generated in Python markdown format, and only the code, not the tests. However, the user initially said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and then to output only the code in Python markdown format.

But the initial instruction said to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user then said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format.

So, perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and to output only the code.

So, the final answer is the code for the function generate_default_observer_schema_dict, which handles the schema generation based on the types of the values in manifest_dict, with the first_level parameter affecting the keys by adding a prefix.

Thus, the code is as follows.
