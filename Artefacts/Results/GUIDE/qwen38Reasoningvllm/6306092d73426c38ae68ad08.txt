Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the function _get_conditionally_required_args based on the given docstring and function signature. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so first, I should think about writing unit tests, then the actual code.

First, understanding the function's purpose. The function is supposed to list arguments that meet the 'required_when' condition. The parameters are command_name, options_spec, and args. The options_spec is a list of command spec options, which probably include some conditions. The args are the input arguments provided.

So, the function needs to check for each option in options_spec if the 'required_when' condition is met based on the given args. But wait, how exactly is the 'required_when' condition structured? Maybe each option in options_spec has a 'required_when' key that specifies a condition. For example, maybe it's a string that evaluates to True or False based on the args.

Wait, the function returns a list of argument names where the 'required_when' condition is matched. So for each option in options_spec, if the condition is met, add the argument name to the result list.

But how is the 'required_when' condition defined? Let's think. Maybe each option in options_spec has a 'required_when' key that is a string expression. For example, if the condition is "arg1 is not None", then we check if arg1 is present in the args. Or maybe it's a more complex condition involving other arguments.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'required_when' is a function or a lambda that takes the args and returns a boolean. But the function signature doesn't mention that. The parameters are command_name, options_spec, and args. The options_spec is a list of command spec options, which I assume are dictionaries. So each option might have a 'required_when' key that is a condition.

But how to evaluate that condition? For example, if the condition is a string like "arg1 is not None", then we need to evaluate that in the context of the args. But how to do that safely? Or maybe the condition is a function that takes the args and returns a boolean.

Wait, the function's docstring says that the options_spec is the list of command spec options. So perhaps each option in options_spec is a dictionary that includes 'required_when' as a key. For example, each option might have a 'name' and 'required_when' condition.

So, the function needs to iterate through each option in options_spec, check if the 'required_when' condition is met based on the args, and collect the names of those options.

But how to evaluate the 'required_when' condition? Let's think of possible scenarios.

Case 1: The 'required_when' is a string that represents a condition. For example, "arg1 is not None". We need to evaluate this string in the context of the args. But evaluating arbitrary strings can be dangerous. However, perhaps in this context, it's safe, or maybe the conditions are predefined.

Alternatively, maybe the 'required_when' is a function that takes the args and returns a boolean. But the function signature doesn't mention that. So perhaps the 'required_when' is a string that can be evaluated using the args.

But how to handle that? For example, if the condition is "args['arg1'] is not None", then we can check if arg1 is present in args. Wait, but args is a dictionary of the input arguments. So maybe the 'required_when' is a condition that uses the keys in args.

But how to parse that condition? Maybe using eval? But eval can be risky. However, given that this is internal code, perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the 'required_when' is a function that is part of the options_spec. But the function signature doesn't indicate that. The user hasn't provided any examples, so I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the 'required_when' is a boolean, but that doesn't make sense. The function is supposed to find arguments that are required based on some condition.

Wait, the function's return is a list of argument names with matched 'required_when' condition. So for each argument in the options_spec, if the 'required_when' condition is true, then include that argument's name in the result.

But how is the 'required_when' condition determined? Let's think of a possible example.

Suppose an option has 'required_when': "arg1 is not None". Then, if the args contain 'arg1' (i.e., arg1 is present), then this condition is met, and the argument is required.

But how to evaluate that condition? Let's think of the args as a dictionary. So, for example, if the condition is "arg1 is not None", then we check if args.get('arg1') is not None.

But how to handle more complex conditions? For example, "arg1 and arg2" would require both args to be present. But perhaps the 'required_when' is a string that can be evaluated using the args.

But using eval is risky. However, given that the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps the 'required_when' is a simple condition that can be checked using the args.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'required_when' is a function that takes the args and returns a boolean. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'required_when' is a string that represents a condition on the command name. For example, if the command is 'create', then certain arguments are required.

But the function's parameters include command_name, so maybe the 'required_when' is a condition that depends on the command name. For example, "command_name == 'create'".

But again, without more info, it's challenging. Let's proceed with the assumption that 'required_when' is a string that can be evaluated using the args and command_name.

So, for each option in options_spec, if the 'required_when' condition evaluates to True, then include the option's name in the result.

So, the steps for the function would be:

1. Iterate through each option in options_spec.
2. For each option, check if it has a 'required_when' key.
3. If it does, evaluate the condition using the args and command_name.
4. If the condition is true, add the option's name to the result list.

But how to evaluate the condition? Let's think of using eval, but that's unsafe. Alternatively, perhaps the 'required_when' is a function that is part of the options_spec. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 'required_when' is a boolean, but that doesn't make sense. The function is supposed to find arguments that are required based on some condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'required_when' is a list of conditions, but again, no info.

Hmm. Since the user hasn't provided examples, perhaps I should make some assumptions. Let's proceed with the following approach:

Assume that each option in options_spec has a 'required_when' key, which is a string that can be evaluated as a boolean using the args and command_name. For example, the condition could be something like "command_name == 'create' and args['arg1'] is not None".

But how to evaluate that? We can use the built-in eval function, but that's risky. However, given that this is internal code, perhaps it's acceptable for the scope of this problem.

So, the code would look like:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in option:
            condition = option['required_when']
            # evaluate the condition using command_name and args
            # but how?
            # maybe using a lambda or eval
            # but how to handle variables?
            # perhaps using a dictionary of variables
            # create a context with command_name and args
            context = {'command_name': command_name, 'args': args}
            # evaluate the condition as a boolean
            try:
                if eval(condition, context):
                    required_args.append(option['name'])
            except:
                # handle exceptions, maybe log or ignore?
                pass
    return required_args

But this is a possible approach. However, using eval is not safe, but given the problem statement, perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the 'required_when' is a function that takes command_name and args. But that would require the options_spec to have functions, which is not possible in a static structure. So, perhaps the initial approach is the way to go.

But then, how to handle the evaluation? For example, if the condition is "args.get('arg1') is not None", then eval would work.

But in the code, the args are passed as a dictionary. So, the context would include 'args' as the dictionary. So, the code would evaluate the condition string in that context.

But what if the condition uses other variables? For example, maybe it's "command_name == 'create'". Then, the code would check if command_name is 'create'.

So, this approach would work for simple conditions. However, it's not safe. But given that the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps this is the intended approach.

Now, considering the test cases. Let's think of some test cases.

Test case 1: options_spec has an option with required_when that is true. For example, command_name is 'create', and the condition is "command_name == 'create'". Then, the required_args should include that option's name.

Test case 2: options_spec has an option with required_when that is false. So, it's not included.

Test case 3: condition depends on args. For example, "args['arg1'] is not None". If arg1 is present, then include.

But how to structure the tests? The function is part of a class, so the tests would need to mock the class and call the method.

But since the user wants test-driven development, first write the tests.

But the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and also to follow TDD by generating unit tests first.

But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and to follow TDD by first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

But given that, I'll proceed to write the code for the function.

So, the code for the function would involve iterating through each option in options_spec, checking if 'required_when' is present, then evaluating the condition using the command_name and args.

But how to evaluate the condition? Using eval as discussed earlier.

But perhaps the 'required_when' is a function. For example, each option in options_spec has a 'required_when' key that is a function. But then, the code would need to call that function with the command_name and args. But that would require the function to accept those parameters.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'required_when' is a string that represents a condition using the args and command_name. So, using eval with a context that includes those variables.

So, the code would be:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    """
    List arguments with ``required_when`` condition matched.

    :param command_name: the command name.
    :param options_spec: the list of command spec options.
    :param args: the received input arguments
    :return: list, list of argument names with matched ``required_when``
        condition
    """
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        if 'required_when' in option:
            condition = option['required_when']
            # Create a context with command_name and args
            context = {'command_name': command_name, 'args': args}
            try:
                if eval(condition, context):
                    required_args.append(option['name'])
            except Exception as e:
                # Handle any exceptions, maybe log or ignore
                pass
    return required_args

But this code uses eval, which is not safe. However, given the problem statement, perhaps it's acceptable.

But what if the options_spec is not a list of dictionaries? Well, the function's parameters say options_spec is a list of command spec options, which I assume are dictionaries.

But what if the 'required_when' is a function? Then, the code would need to call that function. For example, if the option has 'required_when': lambda cmd, args: cmd == 'create', then the code would need to call that function. But that would require the 'required_when' to be a callable, which would complicate the code.

But without more information, it's hard to say. Given the docstring and function signature, the code above is a possible implementation.

Now, considering the tests. For example:

Test case 1: options_spec has an option with required_when "command_name == 'create'". If command_name is 'create', then the argument is required.

Test case 2: options_spec has an option with required_when "args['arg1'] is not None". If args has 'arg1' present, then it's required.

But how to structure the tests? Since the function is part of a class, the tests would need to mock the class and call the method.

But the user hasn't provided the class structure, so the tests would be hypothetical.

But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. So the code above is the answer.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let's think of possible issues.

What if the 'required_when' is a string that uses other variables not in the context? For example, if the condition uses a variable that's not in the context, it would raise an error. But the code catches exceptions, so it would ignore them. But that's not ideal.

Alternatively, maybe the 'required_when' is a string that uses the args and command_name, which are in the context.

Another possible issue: the args may not have certain keys, leading to KeyError. But in the code, the context uses args as a dictionary, so accessing args['arg1'] would raise KeyError if 'arg1' is not present. However, the code uses eval, which would raise an error. But the code has a try-except block, so it would catch that and not add the argument to the list.

But this is a problem. For example, if the condition is "args['arg1'] is not None", and 'arg1' is not present in args, then eval would raise KeyError. The code catches the exception and ignores it, so the argument is not added. But that's correct, because the condition is not met.

But perhaps the code should handle such cases. However, without more information, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, the code I wrote uses eval with a context that includes command_name and args. It's a possible implementation based on the given information.
