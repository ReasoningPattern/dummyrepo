Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_nested_custom_and_control_args based on the given docstring. Let me first understand what the function is supposed to do.

The function's purpose is to split input arguments into control_args and nested_args. Control arguments affect IR behavior and aren't saved in the spec yml, while nested arguments are used by Ansible playbooks and are saved. Also, there's a mention of custom arguments, which are custom Ansible variables replacing normal nested usage. But the return is two dicts: control_args and nested_args. Wait, the docstring says the return is (dict, dict), but the description mentions custom arguments. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or perhaps there's a third category? Hmm, the function signature returns two dicts, so maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. Or maybe the function is supposed to separate control, nested, and custom, but the return is only two? Wait, the docstring says the function returns (control_args, nested_args), but the description mentions custom arguments. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to split into control, nested, and custom, but the return is two dicts? That's confusing. Let me re-read the docstring.

The docstring says: Split input arguments to control nested and custom. Controls arguments are for IR behavior, not put into spec yml. Nested arguments are used by playbooks and put into spec yml. Custom arguments are custom ansible variables to replace normal nested usage. The return is (control_args, nested_args). So, perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or maybe the function is supposed to split into control, nested, and custom, but the return is only two? That's unclear. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but the function's return is two dicts: control and nested. So the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. Or perhaps the function is supposed to split into control, nested, and custom, but the return is two dicts, which might imply that custom is part of nested? Or maybe the function is supposed to split into control and nested, and custom is a separate category but not part of the return? That's confusing. Let me think again.

The function's return is (control_args, nested_args). The docstring says that custom arguments are custom ansible variables to be used instead of the normal nested usage. So perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or maybe they are separate. But the return is only two dicts. So maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. Or perhaps the function is supposed to separate control, nested, and custom, but the return is two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, and the function's return is control_args and nested_args (which includes custom). Or maybe the function is supposed to separate control, nested, and custom, but the return is two dicts, which might be control and nested, and custom is part of nested. Or perhaps the function is supposed to split into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. So the function's job is to separate the args into control and nested, where nested includes custom arguments. But how to determine which arguments are control and which are nested?

The function's parameters are args, which is a list of arguments. The function needs to process this list and split them into control_args and nested_args. But how to determine which arguments belong to which category? The docstring doesn't specify the criteria for splitting. That's a problem. Without knowing the rules, how can I implement this function?

Wait, maybe the function is part of a larger system where certain argument names are predefined as control arguments, and others are nested. For example, maybe arguments that start with a certain prefix are control arguments, and others are nested. But since the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps this is a placeholder, and the actual implementation depends on some predefined rules. But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on some predefined keys. For example, maybe the control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and the rest are nested. But again, without knowing the actual criteria, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, the user is asking me to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that control arguments are for IR behavior and not put into the spec yml, while nested are used by playbooks and put into the spec yml. Custom arguments are custom variables to replace normal nested usage. But the return is two dicts. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and custom arguments are part of the nested. Or maybe the function is supposed to split into control, nested, and custom, but the return is only two dicts. This is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where arguments are processed into different categories. For example, maybe the control arguments are those that are not part of the nested structure, and the nested arguments are those that are part of the nested structure. But without knowing the exact criteria, how to proceed?

This is a problem. The user hasn't provided the actual logic for splitting the arguments. The docstring is vague. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on some predefined keys. For example, perhaps the control arguments are those that start with a certain prefix, like '--control-', and the rest are nested. But since this is not specified, perhaps the function is a placeholder, and the actual implementation depends on some other logic.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on whether they are in a certain list. For example, maybe there's a list of control argument names, and the rest are considered nested. But again, without knowing the actual list, it's impossible to code.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a larger codebase where the control arguments are those that are not part of the nested structure. For example, maybe the nested arguments are those that are passed to the Ansible playbooks, and the control arguments are those that affect the IR behavior. But without knowing the exact criteria, it's impossible to code.

This seems like a problem. The user hasn't provided enough information about how to split the arguments. However, since the user wants me to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps I need to make some assumptions.

Let me think of a possible approach. For example, maybe the function is supposed to separate the arguments into control and nested based on certain keys. For instance, if the argument starts with a certain prefix, like '--control-', then it's a control argument. Otherwise, it's a nested argument. But again, this is just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on whether they are in a predefined list of control arguments. For example, maybe the control arguments are those that are in a list like ['--control-arg1', '--control-arg2'], and the rest are nested.

But without knowing the actual criteria, how can I proceed? Maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys. For example, maybe the control arguments are those that are not part of the nested structure. But again, this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested by checking if the argument is a custom argument. But the docstring says that custom arguments are custom variables to replace normal nested usage. So maybe the function is supposed to separate control, nested, and custom arguments, but the return is two dicts. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested, where nested includes custom arguments. So the function's return is control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes custom arguments. But how to determine which arguments are control and which are nested?

Given the lack of information, perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on some predefined criteria. For example, perhaps the control arguments are those that start with a certain prefix, and the rest are nested. Let me proceed with that assumption.

For example, let's assume that control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and the rest are nested. Then, the function would iterate over the args list, check each argument, and split them into control_args and nested_args.

But this is just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys. For example, maybe the control arguments are those that are not part of the nested structure. But again, without knowing the actual criteria, it's impossible to code.

This is a problem. Without knowing the actual logic for splitting the arguments, I can't write the function. However, the user wants me to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys. Let me think of a possible way to implement this.

Maybe the function is supposed to separate arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys. For example, if the argument starts with a certain prefix, like '--control-', then it's a control argument. Otherwise, it's a nested argument. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, the code would iterate over each argument in the args list. For each argument, check if it starts with '--control-'. If yes, add it to control_args. Otherwise, add it to nested_args.

But wait, the docstring mentions custom arguments. How are they handled? The docstring says that custom arguments are custom ansible variables to be used instead of the normal nested usage. So perhaps the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. So the function's return is control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes both normal nested arguments and custom ones.

But how to differentiate between normal nested and custom? Maybe the custom arguments are those that start with a different prefix, like '--custom-'. Or perhaps they are passed in a different way. But again, without knowing the actual criteria, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. So the function's return is control_args and nested_args, which includes custom arguments.

But how to determine which arguments are control and which are nested? Maybe the function is supposed to split based on the presence of certain keys. For example, the control arguments are those that are in a predefined list, and the rest are nested.

But since the user hasn't provided that list, perhaps the function is supposed to split based on the presence of certain keys. For example, the control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and the rest are nested.

So, here's a possible implementation:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('--control-'):
            # Process control argument
            key = arg[11:]  # Remove '--control-'
            control_args[key] = True  # Or some value
        else:
            # Process nested argument
            key = arg[2:]  # Remove '--'
            nested_args[key] = True  # Or some value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just a guess. The actual implementation depends on how the arguments are structured. For example, if the arguments are in the form of '--key=value', then parsing them would be different.

Alternatively, maybe the arguments are passed as a list of strings, and each string is a key-value pair. For example, '--key=value' would be split into key and value. But without knowing the format, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys. For example, if the argument is a control argument, it's added to control_args, else to nested_args.

But again, without knowing the actual criteria, it's impossible to write the function. However, the user wants me to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual criteria, perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args.

In the absence of more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and the rest are nested arguments. Also, custom arguments are part of the nested_args.

But how to handle the actual values? For example, if the arguments are in the form of '--key=value', then we need to parse them into key-value pairs. But the function's parameters are a list of args, which could be individual arguments. So perhaps the function is supposed to parse each argument into key-value pairs.

But again, without knowing the exact format, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys, and the actual values are stored as values in the dictionaries.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys, and the values are stored as the values in the dictionaries.

But given the lack of information, I think the best approach is to write a function that splits the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args.

So, here's a possible implementation:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('--control-'):
            key = arg[11:]
            control_args[key] = True
        else:
            key = arg[2:]
            nested_args[key] = True
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just a guess. However, the user wants me to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps this is the best I can do given the lack of information.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. But again, without knowing the actual criteria, it's impossible to proceed.

In conclusion, given the lack of information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and the rest are nested arguments. The custom arguments are part of the nested_args. The function will split the arguments into control_args and nested_args based on this criteria.
