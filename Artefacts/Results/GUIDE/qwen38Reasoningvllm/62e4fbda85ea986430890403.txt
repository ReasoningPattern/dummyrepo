Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _shuffled that takes a sequence of strings and returns a shuffled list. The docstring mentions using a FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. Oh right, so the shuffling must be deterministic based on that seed. 

First, I should figure out how to shuffle the sequence. In Python, the standard way is to use the random module. But since the seed is fixed, I need to set it before shuffling. Wait, the function is supposed to use a fixed seed, but the problem says "FIXED_RANDOM_SEED"—maybe that's a constant defined elsewhere? Or maybe it's a typo and they mean that the seed is fixed within the function. Wait, the function's docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED"—so perhaps the seed is a fixed value, like 42, but maybe the user expects that the function uses a predefined seed. But the function signature doesn't take a seed parameter. Hmm, maybe the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant in the code, like a global variable. 

Wait, the user hasn't provided the value of FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. So maybe the function is supposed to use a fixed seed, like 42, but the actual value isn't specified. But the function's docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED"—so maybe the function is supposed to take that seed as a parameter? Wait, the function signature is given as def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str], so there's no parameter for the seed. That's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant that's defined in the code, and the function uses that. For example, maybe in the code, there's a variable called FIXED_RANDOM_SEED, and the function uses that to seed the random module. So the function would set the random seed to that value before shuffling. 

So the steps would be: 

1. Import random module.
2. Set the random seed using the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED.
3. Shuffle the input sequence.
4. Return the shuffled list.

But how to handle the sequence? The input is a Sequence[str], so it could be a list, tuple, etc. The function needs to convert it into a list, shuffle it, and return the list. 

Wait, but the function is supposed to return a list of strings. So the steps would be:

- Convert the input sequence into a list.
- Shuffle the list using the fixed seed.
- Return the shuffled list.

But how to shuffle? Using random.shuffle() would modify the list in place. So perhaps:

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    import random
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    seq_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(seq_list)
    return seq_list

But wait, the problem says "Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". So the seed is fixed, but the function is supposed to use that seed. However, the function's parameters don't include the seed. So maybe the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a global variable. But the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the code is supposed to use a fixed seed, like 42, but the docstring says "given" which implies that it's passed in. But the function signature doesn't have that parameter. 

This is confusing. Maybe the original problem had a typo, and the function is supposed to take the seed as a parameter. But according to the given function signature, it's not. 

Alternatively, maybe the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant that's defined in the code, and the function uses that. For example, in the code, there's a line like FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42, and the function uses that. 

Assuming that, then the code would be as above. 

But the user hasn't provided the value of FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. So perhaps the code should use a fixed seed, like 42, but the docstring says "given" which is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use a fixed seed, and the docstring's mention of "given" is a mistake. 

In any case, the code should use the random module with a fixed seed. 

So, the code would be:

import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # Assuming this is the fixed seed

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    return list(seq)

Wait, no. Because just converting to a list and returning it wouldn't shuffle. Oh right, need to shuffle. So:

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    import random
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    seq_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(seq_list)
    return seq_list

But then, the function is using the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. But where is that defined? The code would need to have that variable. 

But the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the code should define it. 

But the function's docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED"—so maybe the function is supposed to take that as a parameter. But the function signature doesn't. 

This is a problem. Maybe the original problem had a mistake. 

Alternatively, perhaps the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant in the code, and the function uses it. 

In that case, the code would need to import random, set the seed, shuffle the list, and return it. 

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # Example value; actual value may vary

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    seq_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(seq_list)
    return seq_list

But the user's function signature doesn't have the seed as a parameter. So the code is correct as per the given function signature. 

Now, for the unit tests. The user mentioned to follow TDD, so first generate comprehensive unit tests. 

The tests should check that the function returns a shuffled list, and that the shuffling is deterministic (i.e., same seed produces same output). 

For example:

Test case 1: Input is a list, output is shuffled. 

Test case 2: Input is a tuple, output is shuffled. 

Test case 3: Check that the same input produces the same output. 

But how to test that? Because the seed is fixed, the output should be the same for the same input. 

So, the tests would need to verify that. 

But first, the code needs to have the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED defined. 

So, the code would have that variable. 

Now, writing the unit tests. 

But the user wants the code generated, and the tests first. 

So, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but first generate the unit tests. 

So, the assistant should first generate the unit tests, then the code. 

But the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." 

But the tips say to follow TDD, first generate unit tests. 

But the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the assistant is supposed to generate the code, but the code should be written with the tests in mind. 

But the user's instruction is to generate the code, not the tests. However, the tips suggest generating tests first. 

But the user's main request is to generate the code. 

So, perhaps the assistant should generate the code that implements the function, using the fixed seed. 

But the code needs to have the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. 

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # Assuming this is the fixed seed

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    seq_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(seq_list)
    return seq_list

But the problem is that the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is not defined in the code. So perhaps the code should define it. 

But the user's function docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED"—so maybe the code is supposed to use a fixed seed, and the value is predefined. 

So, the code as above would work. 

But the user may have intended that the seed is fixed, like 42, but the actual value may vary. 

Thus, the code is correct. 

Now, the unit tests. 

But the user says to output only the code, not the tests. 

So, the final code is as above. 

But the user's function signature uses Sequence[str], which is from typing. So the code should import Sequence from typing. 

Wait, in Python 3.9+, Sequence is in typing, but for earlier versions, it's in typing_extensions. 

But the code may need to import it. 

So, adding:

from typing import Sequence

So, the complete code would be:

from typing import Sequence
import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # Assuming this is the fixed seed

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    seq_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(seq_list)
    return seq_list

But the user's function returns list[str], so the code is correct. 

So, this should be the generated code.
