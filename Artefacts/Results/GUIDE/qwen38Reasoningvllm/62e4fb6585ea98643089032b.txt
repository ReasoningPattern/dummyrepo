Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_version that takes a string s and returns a tuple of integers. The string is concatenated by dots, like "1.2.3", and the function should split it into individual parts, convert each to an integer, and return them as a tuple. 

First, I should think about the steps involved. The input is a string, so I need to split it on the dot character. Then, each part should be converted to an integer. Then, pack them into a tuple.

Wait, but what about invalid inputs? The problem statement doesn't mention handling errors, so maybe I can assume that the input is always a valid version string. But maybe I should consider cases where splitting results in empty strings? Like if the input is empty or has multiple dots. But the docstring says it's a string concatenated by dot, so perhaps the input is well-formed. However, to be safe, maybe I should handle cases where splitting results in empty strings. For example, if the input is "1..2", splitting on '.' would give ['1', '', '2'], which would cause conversion to int to fail. But the problem says the input is a valid version string, so maybe such cases are not considered. 

So, the steps are: split the string into parts using the split('.') method. Then, convert each part to an integer. Then, return as a tuple.

Let me think about the test cases. For example, "1.2.3" should return (1,2,3). What about leading zeros? Like "0.0.0"? That's allowed, as integers can have leading zeros when converted. Wait, no, when you convert a string like "00" to int, it becomes 0. So that's okay. 

So the code would be something like:

def parse_version(s: str) -> tuple[int, ...]:
    parts = s.split('.')
    return tuple(int(part) for part in parts)

Wait, but what if the input is empty? Like s is an empty string. Then split would return [''], and converting that to int would give 0, so the tuple would be (0,). But maybe the function is supposed to handle that. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a valid version string. So perhaps the input is not empty. But the function should handle any valid input. 

But the problem says that the string is concatenated by dot. So maybe the input is like "1.2.3", but maybe it's also possible to have a single number, like "42", which would split into ["42"], and return (42,). 

So the code seems straightforward. But I need to write unit tests first. Let me think about the test cases.

Test case 1: "1.2.3" → (1,2,3)
Test case 2: "0.0.0" → (0,0,0)
Test case 3: "1" → (1,)
Test case 4: "1.0" → (1,0)
Test case 5: "123.456.789" → (123,456,789)
Test case 6: "1.2.3.4" → (1,2,3,4)
Test case 7: "0.1.0" → (0,1,0)
Test case 8: "12345.67890.123" → (12345, 67890, 123)

What about invalid inputs? Like "1.2.3a" or "1.2.3."? But according to the problem statement, the input is a valid version string, so perhaps those cases are not considered. So the function can assume that the input is properly formatted.

So the code is as simple as splitting on '.' and converting each part to int.

Now, writing the unit tests. Using assert statements.

But the user wants the code generated, and the tests first. So the user wants me to generate the tests first, then the code.

So the function is parse_version, and the tests would check various cases.

So the code would be:

def parse_version(s: str) -> tuple[int, ...]:
    parts = s.split('.')
    return tuple(int(part) for part in parts)

But wait, what if the split results in empty strings? For example, if the input is "1.2.", then split would give ['1', '2', '']. Converting that to int would raise ValueError. But according to the problem statement, the input is a valid version string. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle that. But the problem says the input is a string concatenated by dot, which implies that there are no leading or trailing dots. So maybe the input is always valid. So the code is correct.

So the unit tests would include the cases I mentioned earlier.

So the code is straightforward. Now, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format, only the code. So the answer is the function code.
