Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function generate_default_observer_schema based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it generates a default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in spec.manifest where there's no custom observer schema specified. So the function takes an app object, which probably has a spec attribute with a manifest. The manifest likely contains a list of Kubernetes resources. For each resource in that list, if there's no existing observer schema, we need to generate a default one.

First, I need to figure out how the app object is structured. Since the function is part of a Python application, maybe the app has a spec attribute that contains a manifest. The manifest might be a list of resource objects. Each resource might have an observer_schema attribute, which could be None if it's not specified.

So the steps for the function would be:

1. Access the spec.manifest of the app. Assume that app has a spec attribute, and that spec has a manifest attribute which is a list of resources.
2. Iterate over each resource in the manifest.
3. For each resource, check if it has an observer_schema. If not, generate a default one.
4. Return the updated app with the default schemas added.

But how to generate the default schema? The docstring doesn't specify the structure of the schema, so I need to make assumptions. Maybe the default schema is a dictionary with certain keys, like 'type', 'properties', etc. For example, a default observer schema might look like {'type': 'object', 'properties': {}} or something similar.

Wait, the function is supposed to generate the schema for each resource. So perhaps each resource is an object that can have an observer_schema attribute. If it's not present, we create a default one.

But how to represent the schema? Maybe the default schema is a dictionary with some standard structure. For example, a default observer schema could be a dictionary with 'type' set to 'object' and 'properties' as an empty dict. Or maybe it's a more complex structure based on the resource's metadata.

Alternatively, maybe the default schema is generated based on the resource's kind or metadata. But without more information, I'll have to make a simple assumption.

Let me think about the test-driven development approach. The user mentioned generating comprehensive unit tests first. So I should write tests that check if the function correctly adds default schemas where they are missing.

But since the user wants the code first, maybe I should proceed with writing the code, then think about the tests.

So, the function generate_default_observer_schema takes an app. Let's assume that app has a spec attribute, which has a manifest attribute. The manifest is a list of resource objects. Each resource has an observer_schema attribute, which may be None.

The function needs to iterate through each resource in the manifest. For each resource, if observer_schema is None, generate a default schema and assign it to the resource.

But how to generate the default schema? Let's assume that the default schema is a dictionary with 'type' as 'object' and 'properties' as an empty dict. Or maybe it's a predefined structure.

Alternatively, maybe the default schema is generated based on the resource's metadata. For example, if the resource has a 'metadata' attribute, the schema could include properties based on that.

But without knowing the exact structure of the resource objects, I'll have to make a simple default. Let's say the default schema is a dictionary like {'type': 'object', 'properties': {}}.

So, the code would look something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema') or resource.observer_schema is None:
            resource.observer_schema = {'type': 'object', 'properties': {}}
    return app

But wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the generated schemas, not modify the app in place. Or maybe the app is modified in place. The docstring says "generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified." So the function is likely modifying the app's resources.

But how is the app structured? Maybe the app is an object that has a spec attribute, which has a manifest. The manifest is a list of resource objects. Each resource has an observer_schema attribute that may be None.

So the code would iterate through each resource in app.spec.manifest, check if observer_schema is missing, and if so, assign a default.

But perhaps the function is supposed to return the generated schemas, not modify the app. However, the docstring says "generate the default observer schema for each... resource", which implies that the schemas are added to the resources.

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a dictionary of schemas. But without more information, it's hard to tell.

Another possibility is that the function is part of a framework where the app's spec.manifest is modified in place. So the function's purpose is to ensure that each resource in the manifest has an observer_schema, defaulting to a certain structure if not present.

So the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema'):
            resource.observer_schema = {'type': 'object', 'properties': {}}
        # Or check if it's None and set it
    return app

But maybe the function should return the generated schemas. However, the docstring says "generate the default observer schema for each... resource", which suggests that the schemas are added to the resources.

But the user's function signature is def generate_default_observer_schema(app):, which returns nothing (implicitly). But the docstring says "generate the default observer schema", which might imply that the function returns the generated schemas. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary of schemas, where the keys are the resource names and the values are the default schemas. But again, without more information, it's hard to know.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function is modifying the app's resources in place, adding a default observer_schema if it's missing.

Now, considering the test-driven approach, I need to write tests that check if the function correctly adds the default schema.

For example, a test case could be:

- Create an app object with a spec.manifest containing a resource that doesn't have an observer_schema.
- Call generate_default_observer_schema(app).
- Check that the resource now has an observer_schema with the default structure.

But since the user wants the code first, I'll proceed with writing the code, then think about the tests.

Another thing to consider: what if the resource already has an observer_schema? The function should not overwrite it. So the code should check if the attribute exists and is None, or if it's not present.

So the code would check if the resource has the observer_schema attribute. If not, assign the default. If it is present, leave it as is.

So the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema'):
            resource.observer_schema = {'type': 'object', 'properties': {}}
    return app

But maybe the function should also handle cases where the observer_schema is None. So:

if resource.observer_schema is None:
    resource.observer_schema = default_schema

But how to check if the attribute exists? Using hasattr.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should check if the observer_schema is not present or is None.

So:

if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema') or resource.observer_schema is None:
    resource.observer_schema = default_schema

But in Python, if the attribute is present but None, then hasattr returns True. So the code would be:

for resource in app.spec.manifest:
    if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema') or resource.observer_schema is None:
        resource.observer_schema = {'type': 'object', 'properties': {}}

But perhaps the function should also handle cases where the observer_schema is not present. So the code would set it if it's missing or None.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Another consideration: what if the resource is a dictionary? Or some other structure? But given the context of Kubernetes resources, it's likely that each resource is an object with attributes.

So the code above should work.

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, output only the code.

So the final code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema') or resource.observer_schema is None:
            resource.observer_schema = {'type': 'object', 'properties': {}}
    return app

But wait, the function's docstring is provided, so the code should include it. The user's function signature includes the docstring, so the code should have that.

But the user's provided function signature has the docstring as:

"""
Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
"""

So the code should have that docstring.

But in the code, the function's docstring is already provided. So the code would be as above.

But perhaps the default schema should be more specific. For example, maybe the default schema includes certain properties based on the resource's metadata. But without more information, it's hard to know. So the code uses a simple default schema.

Now, considering the test cases, the user wants comprehensive unit tests. But the user's instruction says to generate the code first, then the tests. However, the user's initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code.

So the code is as above.

But wait, the function returns app. So the code returns app, which is modified in place.

But perhaps the function is supposed to return the generated schemas. However, the docstring says "generate the default observer schema for each... resource", which implies that the schemas are added to the resources. So the function modifies the app's resources and returns the app.

So the code is correct as written.

Now, I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted in Python markdown. So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with the python language specified.

So the final answer is the code as written above.
