Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_from_file method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also wants me to follow a test-driven development approach, so first I should think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

Let me start by understanding the function's purpose. The function is supposed to load a YAML file and validate that all required fields are present. If any mandatory data is missing, it should raise an IRValidatorException. The return value is a dictionary with the loaded data.

First, I need to figure out what the required fields are. Wait, the problem statement doesn't specify which fields are required. Oh, right, maybe the required fields are defined in the class or some other part of the code. But since the function is a class method (cls is passed as the first parameter), perhaps the required fields are defined within the class. However, the current function signature doesn't include a parameter for required fields. Hmm, that's a problem. How can the function know which fields are required without that information?

Wait, maybe the required fields are part of the class's structure. For example, maybe the class has a class-level attribute that lists the required fields. So the validate_from_file method would check against that. But the current function signature doesn't include that. So perhaps the function is part of a class that has a list of required fields. But the user hasn't provided that information. 

Alternatively, maybe the required fields are determined by some other means. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe I should assume that the required fields are defined in the class, perhaps as a class attribute like REQUIRED_FIELDS. So the function would check if all those fields are present in the loaded YAML data.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided that information. However, the function's docstring says "mandatory data is missing in file", so perhaps the required fields are determined by the class. So the code should check that all required fields (as defined in the class) are present in the YAML file.

But how to handle that in the code? Let me think. The function is a class method, so maybe the class has a list of required fields. For example, in the class definition, there's something like:

class MyClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']

Then, the validate_from_file method would check that all these fields are present in the loaded data.

But the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the code should assume that the required fields are defined in the class. Therefore, the function would need to access that list.

So, the steps for the function would be:

1. Load the YAML file into a dictionary.
2. Check if all required fields (from the class) are present in the dictionary.
3. If any are missing, raise IRValidatorException.
4. Return the dictionary.

But first, I need to write the unit tests. Let's think about possible test cases.

Test case 1: YAML file has all required fields. Should return the data.

Test case 2: YAML file is missing a required field. Should raise IRValidatorException.

Test case 3: YAML file is not found. Should raise an exception (maybe FileNotFoundError? Or is that handled by the YAML loader?).

Wait, the function's docstring says it raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So perhaps other exceptions (like file not found) are not handled here. But maybe the function should handle that? Or perhaps the function assumes that the file exists. But the user hasn't specified. So perhaps the function should handle the case where the file is not found by catching exceptions and raising IRValidatorException? Or maybe not. The user's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing, so perhaps other exceptions (like file not found) are not covered here. But maybe the function should handle that.

But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps I should assume that the YAML file exists and is accessible. So the function will load it, and if it's missing, perhaps it's an exception that's not handled here. However, in practice, the code should handle that. But since the user hasn't mentioned it, maybe I should proceed.

So, the unit tests would need to cover:

- Valid YAML with all required fields.
- Invalid YAML missing a required field.
- YAML file not found (but maybe that's handled by the YAML loader, which would raise an exception, which the function would need to catch and re-raise as IRValidatorException? Or perhaps not. The user's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException only when mandatory data is missing. So perhaps other exceptions are not handled here. But that's a possible oversight. However, given the information, I'll proceed.

Now, writing the unit tests. Let's assume that the required fields are defined in the class as a class attribute. For example:

class MyValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']

Then, the validate_from_file method would check for these fields.

So, the unit tests would need to:

- Create a YAML file with all required fields.
- Create a YAML file missing one required field.
- Check that the function raises the exception in the second case.

But how to write these tests? Let's think about using the unittest framework.

But the user hasn't provided the actual code for the class, so I need to generate the code for the validate_from_file method, and the unit tests.

Wait, the user says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code for the validate_from_file method. But the user also says to follow a test-driven approach, so first generate the unit tests, then the code.

So, first, I need to write the unit tests. Let me outline them.

Test case 1: Test that valid YAML with all required fields is loaded and returned.

Test case 2: Test that missing a required field raises IRValidatorException.

Test case 3: Test that invalid YAML (syntax error) raises an exception. But according to the docstring, the function is supposed to raise IRValidatorException only when mandatory data is missing. So maybe the function doesn't handle syntax errors. However, in practice, the YAML loader would raise an exception, which the function may need to catch. But the user hasn't specified. So perhaps the function should handle that. But given the docstring, I'll assume that the function is only responsible for checking required fields, and other exceptions are not handled here. However, in practice, the code should handle that. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps I should proceed.

But for the purpose of writing the code, perhaps the function will load the YAML, and if any required fields are missing, raise the exception. So, the code will need to:

- Load the YAML file into a dictionary.
- Check if all required fields are present.
- If not, raise the exception.

So, the code would need to:

Import PyYAML's safe_load function.

But the user hasn't specified, but since it's a YAML file, we can assume that the code uses PyYAML.

So, the code for the function would be:

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    """
    Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

    :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
    """
    # Assume that the class has a class attribute REQUIRED_FIELDS
    required_fields = cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS
    # Load the YAML file
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    # Check required fields
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
    return data

But wait, the function is a class method. So the first parameter is cls. But in the code above, the function is a class method, so perhaps it's decorated with @classmethod. However, the user's function signature shows it as a class method. So the code would need to have that.

But the user's function signature shows it as a class method. So the code would be:

@classmethod
def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    ...

But the user hasn't provided that. However, the function signature shows it as a class method. So the code should include that.

But the user's function signature shows the first parameter as cls, so the code should have that.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's assume that the class has a class attribute REQUIRED_FIELDS. So, for example:

class MyValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        ...

Then, the unit tests would need to test this.

So, the unit tests could be:

import unittest
import yaml
from my_module import MyValidator

class TestValidateFromYAML(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_yaml(self):
        # Create a YAML file with all required fields
        with open('test_valid.yaml', 'w') as f:
            f.write("field1: value1\nfield2: value2")
        data = MyValidator.validate_from_file('test_valid.yaml')
        self.assertEqual(data['field1'], 'value1')
        self.assertEqual(data['field2'], 'value2')
        # Clean up
        import os
        os.remove('test_valid.yaml')

    def test_missing_required_field(self):
        # Create a YAML file missing a required field
        with open('test_missing.yaml', 'w') as f:
            f.write("field1: value1")
        with self.assertRaises(IRValidatorException):
            MyValidator.validate_from_file('test_missing.yaml')
        # Clean up
        import os
        os.remove('test_missing.yaml')

    def test_invalid_yaml(self):
        # Create a YAML file with invalid syntax
        with open('test_invalid.yaml', 'w') as f:
            f.write("field1: value1\ninvalid: ")
        with self.assertRaises(yaml.YAMLError):
            MyValidator.validate_from_file('test_invalid.yaml')
        # Clean up
        import os
        os.remove('test_invalid.yaml')

But the user's function is supposed to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, the test_missing_required_field would check that. The test_invalid_yaml would check that a YAML syntax error raises an exception, which is not handled by the function. However, the function may not handle that, so the test would expect a yaml.YAMLError.

But the user's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So other exceptions (like syntax errors) are not covered here. However, the function may not handle them, so the test would expect them to propagate.

But the user hasn't specified, so the code should handle that. However, the code as written would not handle syntax errors. So, perhaps the function should catch exceptions and re-raise them as IRValidatorException? But that's not specified. So, perhaps the code should not handle that, and let the exceptions propagate.

But the user's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, other exceptions are not covered. Therefore, the unit tests should check that.

But the user's question is to generate the code for the function and the unit tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So, the user wants the code for the function and the unit tests.

But the user's initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So the main code is the function, and the unit tests are generated as part of the TDD approach.

But the user's question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the code for the function and the unit tests.

But the initial problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code for the function, and the unit tests are part of the generated code.

But the user also says to follow a test-driven approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the answer should include both the unit tests and the actual code.

But the user's example shows that the code is to be generated. However, the user's initial instruction says to output only the code generated. So, perhaps the code for the function and the unit tests.

But the user's function signature is part of a class. So, the code would be part of a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class name. So perhaps the class is named something like 'Validator' or similar.

But the user's function is a class method. So, the code would be part of a class.

But given that the user hasn't provided the class name, perhaps I should assume a class name. For example, let's say the class is called 'IRValidator'.

So, the code would be:

import yaml
from some_module import IRValidatorException

class IRValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        """
        Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

        :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
        """
        required_fields = cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as f:
            data = yaml.safe_load(f)
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        return data

But the user's function is part of a class, but the class name isn't specified. However, the user's function signature shows it as a class method. So, the code would be part of a class.

But the user's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException, which suggests that this exception is defined elsewhere. So, the code would need to import it.

Now, the unit tests would be:

import unittest
import yaml
import os
from my_module import IRValidator, IRValidatorException

class TestIRValidator(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.temp_dir = 'test_files'
        os.makedirs(self.temp_dir, exist_ok=True)

    def tearDown(self):
        for f in os.listdir(self.temp_dir):
            os.remove(os.path.join(self.temp_dir, f))
        os.rmdir(self.temp_dir)

    def test_valid_yaml(self):
        yaml_file = os.path.join(self.temp_dir, 'valid.yaml')
        with open(yaml_file, 'w') as f:
            f.write("field1: value1\nfield2: value2")
        data = IRValidator.validate_from_file(yaml_file)
        self.assertEqual(data['field1'], 'value1')
        self.assertEqual(data['field2'], 'value2')

    def test_missing_required_field(self):
        yaml_file = os.path.join(self.temp_dir, 'missing.yaml')
        with open(yaml_file, 'w') as f:
            f.write("field1: value1")
        with self.assertRaises(IRValidatorException):
            IRValidator.validate_from_file(yaml_file)

    def test_invalid_yaml_syntax(self):
        yaml_file = os.path.join(self.temp_dir, 'invalid.yaml')

        with self.assertRaises(yaml.YAMLError):
            IRValidator.validate_from_file(yaml_file)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

But the user's function is part of a class, so the code for the function is part of the class. The unit tests are separate.

So, putting it all together, the code is as above.

However, the user's function signature shows that the function is a class method, so the code includes the @classmethod decorator.

But the user's function signature doesn't show the class name. So the code assumes a class named IRValidator.

But the user's docstring mentions IRValidatorException, which is an exception class. So the code imports it.

Now, the final answer would be the code for the function and the unit tests.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So the answer should include both the function code and the unit tests.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So the answer includes both.

Thus, the final code would be as written above.
