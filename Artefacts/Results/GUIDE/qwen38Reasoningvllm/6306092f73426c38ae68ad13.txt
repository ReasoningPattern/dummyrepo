Okay, I need to generate Python code for the ansible_playbook function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it wraps the 'ansible-playbook' CLI. So the function should execute an Ansible playbook with various parameters.

First, the parameters: ir_workspace and ir_plugin are objects, but I'm not sure what methods they have. Maybe they provide paths or configurations. The playbook_path is the path to the playbook. Then there's verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args. The verbose is the Ansible verbosity level, which can be 0, 1, 2, etc. Extra_vars is a dictionary passed to Ansible as extra-vars. Ansible_args is a dict of arguments to pass directly to the ansible-playbook command.

So the function needs to construct the command line arguments for ansible-playbook. Let me think about how to structure that. The base command is 'ansible-playbook', then the playbook path. Then, the verbose level would be passed as -v, and the number of times. For example, verbose=2 would be --verbose 2? Wait, no. Ansible's --verbose option takes a number, but the standard way is to use -v multiple times. Like -v for 1, -vv for 2, etc. But maybe the function should handle converting the verbose parameter into the correct number of -v flags. Or maybe the user can pass --verbose with a number. Hmm, the function's parameter is called verbose, which is an integer. So perhaps the function should generate the appropriate number of -v flags based on the verbose value. For example, if verbose is 2, then add two -v options.

Then, extra_vars is a dictionary. In Ansible, extra-vars are passed with --extra-vars. So the function should convert the dictionary into key=value pairs and add them as --extra-vars arguments. For example, if extra_vars is {'key': 'value'}, then --extra-vars key=value.

The ansible_args parameter is a dict of arguments to pass directly to the ansible-playbook command. These are the arguments that are not handled by this function. For example, if the user wants to pass --connection=ssh, that would go into ansible_args. So the function should process these arguments and add them to the command line.

Now, the function needs to construct the command as a list of strings. Then, execute it. But how to execute it? Using subprocess module, probably. So the steps would be:

1. Construct the command list.
2. Execute the command using subprocess.

But what about the ir_workspace and ir_plugin? The docstring says they are Infrared Workspace and Plugin objects. Maybe they have methods to get the path to the playbook or other configurations. For example, maybe the playbook_path is relative, and the ir_workspace provides the absolute path. Or maybe the ir_plugin has some settings. But since the function's parameters include playbook_path, perhaps the function just uses that path directly. But maybe the ir_workspace is used to determine the working directory or other environment settings. However, the function's parameters include playbook_path, so perhaps the function is supposed to take that path as given. Maybe the ir_workspace is used to get the path to the playbook, but the parameter is already the path. Hmm, maybe the function is part of a larger framework where ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used to get certain paths or configurations. But since the function's parameters include playbook_path, perhaps the function doesn't need to use ir_workspace or ir_plugin for that. However, the parameters are present, so maybe the function should use them for something else, like setting the working directory or environment variables.

But the docstring doesn't specify what ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used for. Maybe they are used to get the path to the playbook. For example, maybe the playbook_path is relative, and the function needs to resolve it using the ir_workspace's path. But the function's parameter is playbook_path, so perhaps the function is supposed to take that path as absolute. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But since the user hasn't provided more info, maybe the function just uses the playbook_path as given. But perhaps the ir_workspace is used to get the path to the playbook. For example, maybe the playbook is located in the workspace's directory, and the function uses ir_workspace.get_playbook_path(playbook_path) or something. But again, without knowing the actual implementation of ir_workspace and ir_plugin, it's hard to say. However, since the function's parameters include these objects, perhaps they are used to get the path to the playbook. But since the function has a playbook_path parameter, maybe that's the path to use. Maybe the ir_workspace is used to set the working directory. For example, the function might change to the workspace's directory before running the playbook. Or perhaps the ir_plugin is used to get some configuration.

But given that the function's parameters are provided, maybe the function should use the ir_workspace and ir_plugin to get certain paths or settings. However, without more information, perhaps the function can ignore them for now. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the ir_workspace to get the path to the playbook. For example, if the playbook_path is relative, then the function could resolve it using the ir_workspace's base directory. But again, without knowing the exact methods of ir_workspace and ir_plugin, it's hard to proceed. However, since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the function should just use the playbook_path as given. Maybe the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are not used in this function, but are included as parameters for future use. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger framework where the ir_workspace provides the path to the playbook. For example, maybe the playbook_path is a name, and the function uses ir_workspace.get_playbook_path(playbook_path) to get the absolute path. But again, without knowing the actual methods, it's hard to say. However, since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the function should just use the playbook_path as given. So the function would construct the command as 'ansible-playbook' followed by the playbook_path, then the other arguments.

So, the main steps for the function:

- Construct the command list.
- Execute the command using subprocess.

Now, for the command list:

Start with ['ansible-playbook'].

Then add the playbook_path.

Then add the verbose arguments. If verbose is provided, add '-v' multiplied by the value. For example, verbose=2 would add '-v' twice.

Then add the extra_vars as --extra-vars key=value pairs. For each key in extra_vars, add --extra-vars key=value.

Then add the ansible_args as arguments. For each key-value pair in ansible_args, add the argument as per the key. For example, if ansible_args is {'connection': 'ssh'}, add '--connection=ssh'.

Wait, but the ansible_args is a dict of arguments to plumb down directly to Ansible. So for each key in ansible_args, the value is the argument's value. So for example, if the key is 'connection', the value is 'ssh', then the argument would be '--connection=ssh'.

But how to handle arguments that are flags (without values)? For example, '--check' is a flag. But the function's ansible_args is a dict, so perhaps the keys are the argument names, and the values are the values. If the value is None, then it's a flag. But the function's parameters don't specify that. So perhaps the function should assume that all arguments in ansible_args have values. Or maybe the function should handle cases where the value is None by adding the argument without a value. For example, if ansible_args has {'check': None}, then add '--check'.

But since the function's parameters are not specified in detail, perhaps the function should just pass each key-value pair as --key=value. So for each key in ansible_args, add '--' + key + '=' + value. But if the value is None, then just add '--' + key.

But how to handle that? For example, if the key is 'check', and the value is None, then the argument is '--check'. If the value is 'something', then it's '--check=something'.

But the function's parameters for ansible_args is a dict of arguments. So perhaps the function should process each key-value pair in ansible_args, and for each, add the corresponding argument. So for example, if ansible_args is {'check': True}, then add '--check'.

But how to handle that in code. So, for each key in ansible_args:

if the value is None, then add '--' + key.

else, add '--' + key + '=' + value.

But perhaps the function should handle that. So, the code would loop through the ansible_args dictionary and construct the arguments accordingly.

Putting it all together:

The command list starts as ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path].

Then, add the verbose arguments. For example, if verbose is 2, then add '-v' twice.

Then, add the extra_vars as --extra-vars key=value.

Then, add the ansible_args as --key=value or --key.

But how to handle the extra_vars. For example, if extra_vars is {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}, then the arguments would be --extra-vars key1=value1 --extra-vars key2=value2.

So, for each key in extra_vars, add '--extra-vars key=value'.

Now, the code:

First, import subprocess.

Then, construct the command list.

But what about the ir_workspace and ir_plugin? The function's parameters include them, but the docstring doesn't specify their use. Maybe they are used to get the path to the playbook. For example, maybe the playbook_path is relative, and the function uses ir_workspace to resolve it. But since the function has a playbook_path parameter, perhaps the function is supposed to take that path as absolute. However, without knowing the actual implementation of ir_workspace, it's hard to say. But since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the function should just use the playbook_path as given. So the code would proceed as follows.

So, the code steps:

1. Construct the command list.

command = ['ansible-playbook']

if verbose is not None:

    for _ in range(verbose):

        command.append('-v')

command.append(playbook_path)

if extra_vars is not None:

    for key, value in extra_vars.items():

        command.append(f'--extra-vars {key}={value}')

if ansible_args is not None:

    for key, value in ansible_args.items():

        if value is None:

            command.append(f'--{key}')

        else:

            command.append(f'--{key}={value}')

Then, execute the command using subprocess.

But how to execute it. The function should probably run the command and return the output, or raise an exception if it fails. But the function's return type isn't specified. The docstring doesn't mention return values. So perhaps the function should run the command and return the result, or raise an exception if it fails.

But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps the function should run the command and return the output, or capture the output. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to return the exit code. But without more info, it's hard to say. However, the function's docstring says it wraps the CLI, so perhaps it's intended to run the playbook and return some result, like the output or exit code.

But for the purpose of this code, perhaps the function should run the command and return the output. So using subprocess.run, capturing stdout and stderr.

So:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(...):

    ...

    result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)

    return result.stdout, result.stderr, result.returncode

But the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, which we haven't used yet. So maybe they are used to set the working directory. For example, changing to the ir_workspace's directory before running the playbook. Or perhaps the ir_plugin is used to get some configuration.

But since the function's parameters are given, perhaps the function should use the ir_workspace to get the path to the playbook. For example, if the playbook_path is relative, then the function should resolve it using the ir_workspace's path. But again, without knowing the actual methods of ir_workspace, it's hard to proceed. However, perhaps the function is supposed to use the ir_workspace's path to resolve the playbook_path. For example, maybe the playbook_path is a relative path, and the function should join it with the ir_workspace's base directory.

But since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the function should just use the playbook_path as given. However, the presence of ir_workspace and ir_plugin as parameters suggests that they are used in some way. Maybe the function is supposed to use them to get the path to the playbook. For example, maybe the playbook_path is a name, and the function uses ir_workspace.get_playbook_path(playbook_path) to get the absolute path. But again, without knowing the actual methods, it's hard to say. However, since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the function should just use the playbook_path as given. So the code would proceed as before.

But perhaps the ir_workspace is used to get the path to the playbook. For example, maybe the function should resolve the playbook_path using the ir_workspace's path. So, the code would do something like:

playbook_abs_path = ir_workspace.get_playbook_path(playbook_path)

But again, without knowing the actual method, it's hard to proceed. However, given that the function's parameters include ir_workspace, perhaps the code should use it to get the path. But since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the function should just use the playbook_path as given. So, the code proceeds as before.

Putting it all together, the code would look like this:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None,
                     extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):

    command = ['ansible-playbook']
    
    # Handle verbose
    if verbose is not None:
        for _ in range(verbose):
            command.append('-v')
    
    # Add playbook path
    command.append(playbook_path)
    
    # Handle extra_vars
    if extra_vars is not None:
        for key, value in extra_vars.items():

        check=False  # Don't raise exception on error
    )
    
    # Return the output and return code
    return result.stdout, result.stderr, result.returncode

But wait, the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin. The code above doesn't use them. That's a problem. Because the function's parameters are present, but the code doesn't use them. So perhaps they are used for something else, like setting the working directory. For example, changing to the ir_workspace's directory before running the playbook.

So, maybe the code should set the working directory to ir_workspace's path. But how to get that path? Assuming that ir_workspace has a method like get_path() or something similar. For example:

import os

...

os.chdir(ir_workspace.path)

But again, without knowing the actual methods of ir_workspace, it's hard to say. However, since the function's parameters include ir_workspace, perhaps the code should use it to set the working directory. So, adding:

os.chdir(ir_workspace.path)

But again, this is speculative. However, given that the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, it's possible that they are used for this purpose. So, perhaps the code should use them. But since the user hasn't provided that info, it's a bit of a guess. However, to make the function more complete, perhaps the code should include using the ir_workspace to set the working directory. For example:

import os

...

os.chdir(ir_workspace.get_workspace_path())

But again, without knowing the actual methods, this is a guess. However, since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the code should proceed without using them, but that would be incomplete. Alternatively, maybe the ir_workspace is used to get the path to the playbook. For example, if the playbook_path is a relative path, then the function should resolve it using the ir_workspace's path. So:

playbook_abs_path = os.path.join(ir_workspace.path, playbook_path)

But again, without knowing the actual structure, it's hard to say. However, given that the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, it's possible that they are used for this purpose. So, perhaps the code should use them to resolve the playbook path. But since the function has a playbook_path parameter, maybe that's the absolute path. So, the code may not need to use ir_workspace for that. But again, this is unclear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should proceed without using ir_workspace and ir_plugin, but that would be incomplete. However, the user may have intended that the function uses these parameters. So, perhaps the function should use the ir_workspace to set the working directory. For example, changing to the workspace's directory before running the playbook. So:

import os

...

os.chdir(ir_workspace.path)

But again, without knowing the actual method to get the path, it's a guess. However, assuming that ir_workspace has a 'path' attribute, the code could do that. So adding that line.

But since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the code should proceed without using them, and the function may not use them. However, the presence of the parameters suggests that they are used. So, perhaps the function is supposed to use them to get the path to the playbook.

playbook_abs_path = os.path.join(ir_workspace.path, playbook_path)

So, modifying the code:

        check=False  # Don't raise exception on error
    )
    
    # Return the output and return code
    return result.stdout, result.stderr, result.returncode

But again, this is assuming that ir_workspace has a 'path' attribute. However, the user may have intended that the function uses ir_workspace and ir_plugin in some other way. But without more info, this is the best guess.

Now, regarding the test-driven development approach. The user mentioned that the code should be generated with comprehensive unit tests first. But since the user is asking for the code, perhaps the tests are not needed in the output. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention to follow TDD by generating tests first. But the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the tests are not needed in the output, but the code should be written with the function as described.

So, the final code would be as above, with the assumption that ir_workspace provides the path to the playbook. However, without knowing the actual structure of ir_workspace, this is a guess. But given the parameters, this seems like a reasonable approach.
