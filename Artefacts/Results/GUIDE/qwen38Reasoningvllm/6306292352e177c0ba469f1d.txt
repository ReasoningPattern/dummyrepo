Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function find_tags based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the function's purpose is to find tags in text, ignoring those inside code blocks. Also, there's an optional replacer function that can replace the tags. The return is a tuple of a set of tags and the modified text.

So, the main steps are: parse the text, identify tags not inside code blocks, collect them, and apply the replacer if provided.

But how to detect code blocks? The docstring says to ignore tags inside code blocks. So I need to figure out what constitutes a code block. Commonly, code blocks might be enclosed in triple backticks or something like that. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume that code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks (```), which is a common convention.

Wait, but how to handle that? Let me think: the text could have code blocks, and within those, tags should be ignored. So the plan is to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts, then process the non-code parts for tags.

Alternatively, perhaps the code blocks are marked with some delimiters, and I need to scan the text, identify those regions, and then process the rest.

But how to handle nested code blocks? Well, maybe the problem assumes that code blocks are not nested. So perhaps the approach is to split the text into parts that are inside code blocks and parts that are not. Then, for the non-code parts, find tags.

So first, I need to split the text into code blocks and non-code regions. Let me think about how to do that. For example, the text could have lines starting with ``` followed by some language, then the code block until another ```.

But perhaps the code blocks are any text between ``` and ```? Or maybe the code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks. So the approach would be to split the text into code blocks and other parts.

Once I have the non-code parts, I can process them for tags. But what defines a tag? The docstring says "find tags in text", but it's not clear what a tag is. Maybe a tag is a word that starts with a certain prefix, like #tag, or perhaps it's a specific pattern. Wait, the function's name is find_tags, but without more info, perhaps the tags are words that are enclosed in some delimiters, like <tag> or something else. Alternatively, maybe the tags are words that are surrounded by certain characters, like # or @.

But the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is supposed to find all occurrences of certain patterns. However, the user hasn't provided specifics, so maybe the function is supposed to find any word that matches a certain pattern, but since it's not specified, perhaps the function is supposed to find all words that are enclosed in angle brackets, like <tag>, or perhaps it's a placeholder for a more specific implementation.

Wait, the function's docstring says "tries to ignore tags inside code blocks". So perhaps the tags are parts of the text that are not inside code blocks. But how to define what a tag is? Maybe the tags are words that start with a certain character, like #, or maybe they are enclosed in some delimiters. Since the problem is not specific, perhaps the function is intended to find all occurrences of certain patterns, but the user hasn't provided the exact pattern. This is a problem.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a larger system where tags are defined elsewhere. But given that the user hasn't provided more info, perhaps the function is supposed to find all words that are not inside code blocks, and then apply the replacer. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are defined as any sequence of characters that are enclosed in angle brackets, like <tag>, and the function is supposed to find those, ignoring those inside code blocks.

But since the problem is ambiguous, maybe I should make assumptions. Let me think: perhaps the tags are any words that are enclosed in angle brackets, like <tag>, and the function should find those. But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps the function is supposed to find all occurrences of certain patterns. However, without knowing the pattern, it's impossible to proceed. Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to find all words that are not inside code blocks, and then apply the replacer. But again, that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the tags are defined as any word that starts with a certain prefix, like #, and the function is supposed to find those. But again, without more info, it's hard to proceed.

Hmm. Maybe the function is intended to find all instances of a tag, which are defined as any word that is not inside a code block. But how to define a tag? Maybe the tags are any sequence of characters that are not inside code blocks, but that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a system where tags are defined as words that are surrounded by certain delimiters, like <tag> or #tag. But again, without knowing, perhaps the function is supposed to find all occurrences of a certain pattern. Since the problem is not specific, maybe the function is supposed to find all words that are not inside code blocks, and then apply the replacer. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are any words that are not inside code blocks, and the replacer is applied to them. But again, the problem is unclear.

Wait, the function's name is find_tags, and the docstring says "tries to ignore tags inside code blocks". So maybe the tags are parts of the text that are not inside code blocks.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to find all words that are not inside code blocks, and then apply the replacer. But how to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts?

Let me think again. The function's goal is to find tags in text, ignoring those inside code blocks. So the steps are:

1. Split the text into code blocks and non-code parts.
2. In the non-code parts, find the tags.
3. Apply the replacer to the tags if provided.
4. Return the set of tags and the modified text.

But without knowing what a tag is, how can I proceed? Maybe the tags are any words that are not inside code blocks, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the tags are defined as any occurrence of a certain pattern, like #tag, and the function is supposed to find those. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the function is supposed to find all occurrences of a certain pattern, but the user hasn't specified.

Wait, maybe the function is intended to find all occurrences of a tag, where a tag is defined as any word that is not inside a code block. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the tags are defined as any sequence of characters that are not inside code blocks, but that's too broad.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to find all occurrences of a certain pattern, like words that start with a #, but again, the user hasn't specified.

This is a problem. Without knowing what a tag is, I can't write the code. However, perhaps the function is part of a system where tags are defined elsewhere. For example, maybe the tags are words that are enclosed in angle brackets, like <tag>, and the function is supposed to find those. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are defined as any sequence of characters that are not inside code blocks, and the replacer is applied to them. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to find all instances of a certain pattern, like #tag, and the code is supposed to find those. But again, without knowing, it's impossible.

This is a problem. Maybe the user expects that the function is supposed to find all the words in the text that are not inside code blocks, and then apply the replacer. But how to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts?

Let me think about the code block detection first. Suppose that code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks, like:

```
This is a code block.
```

So the approach would be to split the text into parts that are inside code blocks and parts that are not. Then, for the non-code parts, find the tags.

But how to split the text into code blocks. Let's think of the text as a series of lines. We can iterate through the lines, and when we encounter a line starting with ``` (assuming that's the delimiter), we start a code block, and when we encounter another ``` line, we end it. The lines between are part of the code block.

Once we have the non-code parts, we can process them for tags. But again, what defines a tag? Let's assume that a tag is any word that starts with a #, like #tag. So the function would find all occurrences of #tag in the non-code parts.

But since the problem statement doesn't specify, perhaps the function is supposed to find all words that are not inside code blocks, and then apply the replacer. However, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to find all the words in the text that are not inside code blocks, and then apply the replacer to them. But again, without knowing what a word is, it's unclear.

This is a problem. Maybe the user expects that the function is supposed to find all occurrences of a certain pattern, but since it's not specified, I need to make assumptions. Let me proceed with the assumption that a tag is any occurrence of a word that is not inside a code block, and the replacer is applied to those words. But how to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts.

Let me outline the steps for the code:

1. Split the text into code blocks and non-code parts. For example, split the text into parts that are inside code blocks and parts that are not.

2. For each non-code part, find all tags (assuming tags are words that are not inside code blocks).

3. Collect all the tags found, apply the replacer if provided.

4. Return the set of tags and the modified text.

But again, without knowing what a tag is, this is not possible. However, since the user hasn't provided more info, perhaps the function is supposed to find all words in the text that are not inside code blocks, and then apply the replacer. But how to define a word? Maybe using regex to split on whitespace.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are defined as any occurrence of a certain pattern. For example, maybe the tags are words that are enclosed in angle brackets, like <tag>. So the function would find all occurrences of <tag> in the non-code parts.

But without knowing, I have to make an assumption. Let's proceed with the assumption that a tag is any word that is not inside a code block, and the replacer is applied to those words. But how to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts.

So, first, the code block detection. Let's write code to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts. For example:

- Iterate through the text, split into lines.
- When a line starts with ``` (assuming that's the delimiter), start a code block.
- Continue until another line starts with ``` to end the code block.
- All lines between are part of the code block.
- The rest are non-code parts.

Once the non-code parts are extracted, process them for tags. Let's assume that a tag is any word that is not inside a code block. But how to define a word? Maybe split on whitespace and collect each word.

But the function's name is find_tags, which suggests that it's looking for specific tags. Maybe the tags are defined as any occurrence of a certain pattern, like #tag, or <tag>, but without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to find all occurrences of a certain pattern, like any word that is not inside a code block. But again, this is unclear.

Wait, the function's docstring says "tries to ignore tags inside code blocks". So the function is supposed to find tags, but ignore those inside code blocks. So the tags are in the text, but not inside code blocks. So the first step is to find all tags in the text, then exclude those that are inside code blocks.

But again, what defines a tag? Maybe the tags are defined as any occurrence of a certain pattern, like #tag, or <tag>, or something else.

This is a problem. Without knowing what a tag is, I can't write the code. However, since the user provided the function signature and docstring, perhaps the function is supposed to find all occurrences of a certain pattern, but the user hasn't specified. Maybe the tags are defined elsewhere, and this function is supposed to find them.

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are defined as any word that is not inside a code block, and the replacer is applied to those words. For example, if the text is "Hello #tag, this is a code block: ```code```", then the tag is #tag, and the replacer would replace it.

But again, without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed. However, given that the function's name is find_tags, and the docstring mentions tags, perhaps the tags are defined as any occurrence of a certain pattern, like #tag, and the function is supposed to find those, ignoring those inside code blocks.

Assuming that, let's proceed. So the function will find all occurrences of #tag in the text, but ignore those inside code blocks. Then, apply the replacer to those tags.

But how to implement this. Let's outline the steps:

1. Split the text into code blocks and non-code parts.

2. For each non-code part, find all occurrences of the tag pattern (e.g., #tag).

3. Collect all found tags, apply the replacer if provided.

4. Return the set of tags and the modified text.

But how to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts. Let's think about the code block detection.

Let me think about the code block detection. For example, the text could have lines like:

This is some text.

```python
This is a code block.
```

Another line.

So the code blocks are between the triple backticks. So the code needs to split the text into code blocks and non-code parts.

To do this, I can split the text into lines, and track whether I'm inside a code block.

Let me think about implementing this in code. For example:

def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set, str]:
    # Split text into code blocks and non-code parts
    code_blocks = []
    non_code_parts = []
    in_code_block = False
    current_code_block = []
    lines = text.split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('```'):
            if in_code_block:
                # End of code block
                code_blocks.append('\n'.join(current_code_block))
                current_code_block = []
                in_code_block = False
            else:
                # Start of code block
                in_code_block = True
                current_code_block.append(line)
        elif in_code_block:
            current_code_block.append(line)
        else:
            non_code_parts.append(line)
    # After processing all lines, check if there's a pending code block
    if in_code_block:
        code_blocks.append('\n'.join(current_code_block))
    # Now, non_code_parts contains the lines not in code blocks
    # Combine them into a single string
    non_code_text = '\n'.join(non_code_parts)
    # Now find tags in non_code_text
    # Assume tags are words starting with #, like #tag
    # Find all occurrences of #tag in non_code_text
    # But how to find them? Using regex?
    # Let's use regex to find all tags
    import re
    # Pattern for tags: # followed by non-whitespace characters
    tag_pattern = r'#\S+'
    tags = set(re.findall(tag_pattern, non_code_text))
    # Apply replacer if provided
    if replacer:
        # Replace each tag with replacer(tag)
        # But how to do this? Need to replace each occurrence
        # However, the replacer may modify the tag, so we need to replace each occurrence
        # But how to do this without overlapping?
        # Maybe use a regex substitution
        # But the tags are in the non_code_text
        # So we can process the non_code_text and replace each tag with replacer(tag)
        # However, the replacer may return a string, which could have tags, but the function is supposed to replace the original tag
        # So, for example, if the tag is #tag, and replacer is a function that returns 'replaced', then #tag becomes 'replaced'
        # So we can use a regex substitution with a function
        # But since the tags are in non_code_text, we can process them
        # However, the replacer may modify the tag, but the function is supposed to replace the tag with the result of the replacer
        # So, for each tag found, replace it with the replacer's output
        # But how to do this in a way that doesn't affect other tags?
        # Using a regex substitution with a function
        # But the tags may overlap, so we need to process them in a way that replaces each occurrence
        # So, we can use re.sub with a function that replaces each tag
        # However, the tags are in the non_code_text, so we can process them
        # Let's create a new text by replacing each tag with the replacer's output
        # But how to do that? Let's use a regex substitution
        # For example:
        # modified_non_code_text = re.sub(tag_pattern, lambda m: replacer(m.group(0)), non_code_text)
        # But this would replace each tag with the replacer's output
        # However, the replacer may return a string that contains tags, but the function is supposed to replace the original tag
        # So, the modified text would have the replaced tags
        # So, the code would be:
        modified_non_code_text = re.sub(tag_pattern, lambda m: replacer(m.group(0)), non_code_text)
        # Then, the final text is the original text with the non_code parts replaced
        # But how to combine the code blocks and the modified non_code parts?
        # The original text is split into code blocks and non-code parts. The non-code parts are replaced, and the code blocks remain the same.
        # So, the final text is the original text, but with the non-code parts replaced.
        # However, the original text may have code blocks and non-code parts interleaved. So, how to reconstruct the text?
        # Wait, the non_code_parts are the lines not in code blocks. The code_blocks are the code blocks. The original text is a combination of code blocks and non-code parts. But when we replace the non_code parts, we need to replace the non-code parts with the modified_non_code_text, and keep the code blocks as they are.
        # But how to reconstruct the original text? Because the non_code_parts are the lines not in code blocks, and the code_blocks are the code blocks. So, the original text is the combination of code blocks and non-code parts, but the non-code parts are now modified.
        # However, the original text may have multiple non-code parts. For example, the text could be:
        # line1
        # line2
        # ```code
        # line3
        # ```
        # line4
        # So the non_code_parts are line1, line2, line4. The code_blocks are the code block.
        # After processing, the non_code_parts are replaced with modified_non_code_text, which is the combined non_code_parts with tags replaced.
        # But how to reconstruct the text? The original text is the combination of code blocks and non-code parts. But when we process the non-code parts, we need to combine them into a single string, replace the tags, and then reconstruct the text by interleaving the code blocks and the modified non-code parts.
        # Wait, no. The original text is split into code blocks and non-code parts. The non-code parts are the lines not in code blocks. So, the original text is the combination of code blocks and non-code parts. But when we process the non-code parts, we need to replace the tags in them, and then reconstruct the text by putting the code blocks and the modified non-code parts back in their original order.
        # However, the code_blocks and non_code_parts are stored as separate lists. So, the original text is the combination of code_blocks and non_code_parts, but the non_code_parts are the lines not in code blocks. But how to reconstruct the original text? Because the non_code_parts are the lines not in code blocks, and the code_blocks are the code blocks. So the original text is the lines of non_code_parts interleaved with code_blocks. But this is not straightforward.
        # For example, the original text could be:
        # line1 (non-code)
        # line2 (non-code)
        # ```code
        # line3 (code)
        # ```
        # line4 (non-code)
        # So the non_code_parts are [line1, line2, line4], and the code_blocks are [line3]. The original text is line1 + line2 + code_block + line4.
        # But when we process the non_code_parts, we need to combine them into a single string (line1 + line2 + line4), replace the tags, and then reconstruct the text as the original code_blocks and the modified non_code_parts.
        # However, the original text's structure is not preserved, so this approach may not work. Because the code_blocks and non_code_parts are split into separate lists, but the original text may have multiple non_code_parts and code_blocks interleaved.
        # So, this approach would lose the original structure of the text. For example, the code_blocks and non_code_parts are stored as separate lists, but the original text may have multiple non_code_parts and code_blocks interleaved. So, when we replace the non_code_parts, we need to reconstruct the text by interleaving the code_blocks and the modified non_code_parts.
        # This seems complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to process the text line by line, keeping track of whether we're in a code block, and for each line, if it's not in a code block, process it for tags, and apply the replacer if needed.
        # Let me think again. Maybe instead of splitting the text into code blocks and non-code parts, I can process the text line by line, and for each line, if it's not in a code block, process it for tags. This way, the original structure is preserved.
        # So, the steps would be:
        # 1. Iterate through each line of the text, tracking whether we're in a code block.
        # 2. For each line, if it's not in a code block, process it for tags.
        # 3. Collect all tags found in non-code lines.
        # 4. Apply the replacer to the tags.
        # 5. Reconstruct the text with the replaced tags.
        # But how to process the tags in the lines. For example, if a line is "Hello #tag", then the tag is #tag. We need to find all such tags, collect them, and replace them.
        # So, for each line not in a code block, we can find all tags using regex, collect them, and then replace them in the line.
        # However, the replacer may return a string that contains tags, but the function is supposed to replace the original tag with the result of the replacer. So, the replacer is called with the tag word, not the entire line.
        # So, for example, if the line is "Hello #tag", and the replacer is a function that returns "replaced", then the line becomes "Hello replaced".
        # So, the approach would be:
        # For each line not in a code block:
        #   find all tags in the line
        #   collect them into a set
        #   replace each tag with the replacer's output
        # Then, the modified line is added to the result text.
        # But how to do this in code. Let's think about it.
        # So, during processing, for each line, if it's not in a code block:
        #   find all tags in the line using regex
        #   collect them into the tags set
        #   replace each tag with the replacer's output
        #   add the modified line to the result text
        # If the line is in a code block, just add it to the result text as is.
        # This way, the original structure of the text is preserved, and tags are processed only in non-code lines.
        # This approach seems better because it preserves the original line structure.
        # So, let's proceed with this approach.
        # Now, the code steps:
        # 1. Split the text into lines.
        # 2. Iterate through each line, track if in code block.
        # 3. For each line:
        #    a. if in code block: add to result text as is.
        #    b. else: process the line for tags.
        #       i. find all tags using regex (e.g., #\S+)
        #       ii. collect them into a set
        #       iii. replace each tag with replacer(tag)
        #       iv. add the modified line to the result text
        # 4. Return the set of tags and the modified text.
        # But how to collect the tags. For example, if a line has multiple tags, they are all added to the set.
        # Also, the replacer may return a string that contains tags, but the function is supposed to replace the original tag. So, the replacer is called with the tag word, not the entire line.
        # So, the code would look something like:
        # import re
        # def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set, str]:
        #     tags = set()
        #     lines = text.split('\n')
        #     in_code_block = False
        #     result = []
        #     for line in lines:
        #         if line.strip().startswith('```'):
        #             if in_code_block:
        #                 in_code_block = False
        #             else:
        #                 in_code_block = True
        #         if in_code_block:
        #             result.append(line)
        #         else:
        #             # Process this line for tags
        #             # Find all tags in the line
        #             tag_matches = re.findall(r'#\S+', line)
        #             tags.update(tag_matches)
        #             # Replace each tag with replacer(tag)
        #             if replacer:
        #                 # Replace each tag in the line
        #                 # But how to do this without affecting other tags?
        #                 # Use re.sub with a function
        #                 modified_line = re.sub(r'#\S+', lambda m: replacer(m.group(0)), line)
        #             else:
        #                 modified_line = line
        #             result.append(modified_line)
        #     final_text = '\n'.join(result)
        #     return tags, final_text
        # But wait, this code has a problem: the regex for finding tags is r'#\S+', which matches any sequence starting with # followed by non-whitespace characters. However, this may not capture all possible tags, but it's a starting point.
        # Also, the code assumes that code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks. But what if the code block starts or ends with other characters? For example, if the line is '```code', then it's considered a code block. But the code may have lines that start with ``` but are not code blocks. However, the code assumes that any line starting with ``` starts a code block, which may not be accurate. For example, if the text has a line like '```', it would start a code block, but that's probably not intended. However, given the lack of specifications, this is a reasonable assumption.
        # Also, the code handles the case where the line starts with ``` and ends the code block. But what about lines that have ``` in the middle? For example, a line like 'This is a line with ``` in it.'? In this case, the code would treat it as a code block start, which is incorrect. But again, without specifications, this is a limitation.
        # Now, the code also collects the tags in a set, and applies the replacer to each occurrence. However, the replacer is called with the entire tag (e.g., '#tag'), and the modified_line replaces each occurrence with the result of the replacer.
        # Now, the function returns the set of tags and the modified text.
        # But what about overlapping tags? For example, if a line has '#tag1#tag2', the regex would find both tags. But this is handled by the regex.
        # Now, testing this code. Let's take an example:
        # Input text:
        # Hello #tag1, this is a code block:
        # ```
        # code here
        # ```
        # Another line with #tag2.
        # The code would split into lines:
        # line 1: 'Hello #tag1, this is a code block:'
        # line 2: '```'
        # line 3: 'code here'
        # line 4: '```'
        # line 5: 'Another line with #tag2.'
        # Processing line 1: not in code block. Find #tag1, add to tags. Replace with replacer('#tag1').
        # Line 2: starts with ``` → in_code_block becomes True.
        # Line 3: in code block → added as is.
        # Line 4: starts with ``` → in_code_block becomes False.
        # Line 5: not in code block. Find #tag2, add to tags. Replace with replacer('#tag2').
        # The final text would have the replaced tags.
        # The tags set would be {'#tag1', '#tag2'}.
        # This seems correct.
        # Now, what about the replacer function? For example, if replacer is a function that returns the uppercase version of the tag:
        # def replacer(tag):
        #     return tag.upper()
        # Then, the modified text would have '#TAG1' and '#TAG2'.
        # So the code seems to handle that.
        # Now, what about tags that are part of other words? For example, 'hello#tag'? The regex r'#\S+' would match '#tag' but not 'hello#tag'. So the code would not find it. But that's correct, as the tag is supposed to start with #.
        # So this code seems to handle the basic case.
        # Now, the function returns a tuple of a set of tags and the modified text.
        # Now, the code needs to import re and use it.
        # Also, the function returns a Tuple[Set, str], so we need to import Tuple from typing.
        # Also, the function should handle the replacer being None.
        # Now, the code seems to handle that.
        # But what about cases where the code block is not properly closed? For example, if there's an opening ``` but no closing. The code would treat the remaining lines as code block, which is incorrect. But again, without specifications, this is a limitation.
        # Now, the code for the function would be as outlined above.
        # Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips say to follow TDD by generating tests first. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips say to generate tests first. But the user's final instruction says to output only the code. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips say to generate tests first. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. So I should proceed to write the code as per the above reasoning.
        # Now, the code needs to import re and typing.
        # So, the final code would be:
        # import re
        # from typing import Tuple, Set
        # def find_tags(text: str, replacer: callable = None) -> Tuple[Set, str]:
        #     tags = set()
        #     lines = text.split('\n')
        #     in_code_block = False
        #     result = []
        #     for line in lines:
        #         if line.strip().startswith('```'):
        #             if in_code_block:
        #                 in_code_block = False
        #             else:
        #                 in_code_block = True
        #         if in_code_block:
        #             result.append(line)
        #         else:
        #             # Find tags in this line
        #             tag_matches = re.findall(r'#\S+', line)
        #             tags.update(tag_matches)
        #             # Replace tags with replacer if provided
        #             if replacer:
        #                 modified_line = re.sub(r'#\S+', lambda m: replacer(m.group(0)), line)
        #             else:
        #                 modified_line = line
        #             result.append(modified_line)
        #     final_text = '\n'.join(result)
        #     return tags, final_text
        # But wait, the code for the line processing has a problem. The line may have leading or trailing whitespace, but the code uses line.strip().startswith('```') to detect code blocks. However, this would incorrectly detect lines that have ``` after stripping. For example, a line like '   ```   ' would be considered a code block start. But this is probably acceptable.
        # Also, the code for the code block detection is simplistic. It assumes that any line starting with ``` (after stripping) starts a code block. This may not be accurate, but given the lack of specifications, it's a reasonable approach.
        # Now, the code returns a set of tags and the modified text. The tags are collected from all non-code lines, and replaced if a replacer is provided.
        # So this should meet the function's requirements.
        # Now, let's test this code with some examples.
        # Example 1:
        # Input text: "Hello #tag1, this is a code block:\n```\ncode here\n```\nAnother line with #tag2."
        # The code would process the first line, find #tag1, add to tags. Replace with replacer if provided. Then, the code block lines are added as is. The last line is processed, find #tag2, add to tags. The final text would have the replaced tags.
        # Example 2: No code blocks. Input text: "This is a line with #tag and another #tag2." The code would process the line, find both tags, and replace them.
        # Now, what about tags inside code blocks? The code ignores them, as they are in code blocks.
        # Now, what about the replacer? If replacer is None, the text is unchanged. If provided, each tag is replaced.
        # So this code should work.
        # Now, the code needs to import re and typing. The function returns a Tuple[Set, str], so we need to import Tuple and Set from typing.
        # So the final code would be as above.
        # Now, the user's docstring says that the function returns a set of tags and the original or replaced text. The code does that.
        # So this should be the correct implementation.
