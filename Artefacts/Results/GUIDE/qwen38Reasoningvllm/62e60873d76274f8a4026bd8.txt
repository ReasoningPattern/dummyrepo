Okay, I need to generate Python code for the protocol_handlers function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is part of a class (since it's a method with 'cls' as the first parameter). It returns a dictionary of Bolt protocol handlers keyed by version tuples. If a protocol_version is provided, the dictionary will have either zero or one item, depending on whether that version is supported. If not provided, all available versions are returned. Also, there's a TypeError if the protocol_version isn't a tuple.

First, I should think about the structure. The function is a class method, so it's probably part of a class that has different protocol handlers. The handlers are likely stored in the class, maybe as a class-level dictionary. For example, the class might have a _protocol_handlers attribute that maps version tuples to handler classes.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if protocol_version is provided. If it is, validate that it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError.
2. If protocol_version is given, check if it exists in the class's protocol handlers. If yes, return a dict with that version as the key. If not, return an empty dict.
3. If protocol_version is None, return all the protocol handlers as a dict.

But how do I access the protocol handlers? Since it's a class method, perhaps the class has a class variable or a static method that holds the handlers. For example, maybe the class has a _protocol_handlers dictionary.

Wait, the function is called protocol_handlers, which suggests that the class has some handlers. So maybe the class has a class attribute like _protocol_handlers that maps version tuples to handler classes.

So in the code, the function would check the class's _protocol_handlers. Let me think about the code structure.

First, the function starts by checking if protocol_version is not None. Then, it checks if it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError.

Then, if protocol_version is provided, check if it's in the class's _protocol_handlers. If yes, return a dict with that version as the key. If not, return empty dict.

If protocol_version is None, return the entire _protocol_handlers dict.

But how to handle the class's handlers? Let's assume that the class has a class attribute called _protocol_handlers. So the code would look something like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
        # Check if the version exists in the class's handlers
        handlers = {}
        if protocol_version in cls._protocol_handlers:
            handlers[protocol_version] = cls._protocol_handlers[protocol_version]
        return handlers
    else:
        return cls._protocol_handlers.copy()

But wait, the docstring says that if protocol_version is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items. So if the version is not supported, return empty dict. So in that case, if the version is not present, return empty.

But what if the class's _protocol_handlers is a static variable? For example, maybe the class has a class-level dictionary that's initialized once.

But how to handle that? Well, the code would need to have that class attribute.

But the user hasn't provided the actual handler classes, so the code would need to assume that the class has this _protocol_handlers attribute.

Now, the function is a class method, so it's called as a class method. So the code would be part of a class, perhaps something like:

class BoltProtocol:
    _protocol_handlers = {
        (3, 5): SomeHandler,
        (3, 6): AnotherHandler,
        # etc.
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # code here

But the user hasn't provided the actual handlers, so the code would need to be generic.

Now, the function is supposed to return a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. So the code would check the class's _protocol_handlers.

But what if the class doesn't have this attribute? Well, the function would raise an AttributeError. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps it's assumed that the class has this attribute.

Now, the test cases. The user mentioned to follow test-driven development, so first generate comprehensive unit tests.

But the user wants the code generated, not the tests. Wait, the original instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So maybe the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to follow TDD approach, but the final output is only the code.

So perhaps the code is to be written, assuming that the class has the necessary _protocol_handlers attribute.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
        # Check if the version exists in the class's handlers
        handlers = {}
        if protocol_version in cls._protocol_handlers:
            handlers[protocol_version] = cls._protocol_handlers[protocol_version]
        return handlers
    else:
        return cls._protocol_handlers.copy()

Wait, but the function is a class method. So the code should be a class method. Oh right! The function is a class method, so it should be decorated with @classmethod.

So the correct code would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    # code here

But the original function signature shows 'def protocol_handlers(cls, ...)', so the code should be a class method.

So the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    _protocol_handlers = {
        (3, 5): SomeHandler,
        # etc.
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        """
        Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
        keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
        provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,

        version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

            # Check if the version exists in the class's handlers
            handlers = {}
            if protocol_version in cls._protocol_handlers:
                handlers[protocol_version] = cls._protocol_handlers[protocol_version]
            return handlers
        else:
            return cls._protocol_handlers.copy()

But the user's function is part of a class, but the code is to be generated as the function. However, the user's function signature shows that it's a class method. So the code should include the @classmethod decorator.

But the original function signature is given as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):

So the code should be a class method. Therefore, the code should include the @classmethod decorator.

But in the code, the user may have a class with this method. So the code for the function would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    # code here

But the user hasn't provided the class, so the code is just the function.

Wait, but the user's function is part of a class. So the code would be part of a class. But the user hasn't provided the class name. So perhaps the code is written as a class method.

So the code would be:

class BoltProtocol:
    _protocol_handlers = {
        # versions and handlers
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # code here

But the user's function is called protocol_handlers, and the code is to be generated. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should be the function, but as a class method.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

@classmethod

        return handlers
    else:
        return cls._protocol_handlers.copy()

But wait, the function is supposed to be part of a class. So the code would be inside a class. However, the user hasn't provided the class name, so perhaps the code is written as a class method.

But the user's function signature is given as a method of a class. So the code is part of a class, and the function is a class method.

So the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    _protocol_handlers = {
        # some versions
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # code here

But the user hasn't provided the class name. So perhaps the code is written as a class method, assuming that the class has the _protocol_handlers attribute.

Now, the code needs to handle the case where protocol_version is None, returning all handlers. Also, when protocol_version is provided, check if it exists in the class's _protocol_handlers.

But what if the class doesn't have _protocol_handlers? Well, that's an assumption. The code would raise an AttributeError if the class doesn't have that attribute. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps it's assumed that the class has that attribute.

So the code as written should meet the requirements.

Now, the TypeError is raised if protocol_version is not a tuple. So in the code, if protocol_version is not None, check if it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError.

So the code should be:

@classmethod

    else:
        return cls._protocol_handlers.copy()

But wait, the function is supposed to return a dictionary. When protocol_version is provided, it returns a dict with either zero or one item. If the version is not present, returns empty dict. If present, returns a dict with that version.

Yes.

Now, the code is written. But the user's function is part of a class, so the code should be inside a class. But since the user hasn't provided the class name, perhaps the code is written as a class method, assuming that the class has the _protocol_handlers attribute.

So the final code would be as above.

Now, the user's instruction says to output only the code in Python markdown format. So the code should be written with proper indentation and syntax.

So the final code would be:
