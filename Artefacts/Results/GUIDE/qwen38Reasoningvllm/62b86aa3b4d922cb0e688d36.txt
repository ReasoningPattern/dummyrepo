Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _validate_labels function based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to check that keys and values in the given labels using validate_key() and validate_value(). But wait, the problem says to generate the code, but the user hasn't provided the definitions for validate_key and validate_value. Hmm, maybe those are helper functions that are supposed to be defined elsewhere. 

Wait, the user mentioned a test-driven development approach. So first, I should create unit tests for the _validate_labels function. But how can I write tests without knowing what validate_key and validate_value do? Oh, right, maybe those functions are part of the same module and are supposed to be implemented as part of the solution. But the user hasn't provided their definitions. 

Wait, the original problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function checks keys and values using validate_key and validate_value. So perhaps those are helper functions that need to be defined. But the user hasn't provided them. Maybe I need to assume that they are already defined elsewhere. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the _validate_labels function will call these helper functions. So the actual code for _validate_labels would iterate over the labels dictionary, apply validate_key to each key, and validate_value to each value. 

But since the user hasn't provided the definitions for validate_key and validate_value, I need to make some assumptions. Let me think: perhaps validate_key checks if the key is a string, and validate_value checks if the value is a certain type, like a string or a number. But without knowing, maybe I should define them as part of the solution. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function checks keys and values using those two functions. So the actual code would need to call those functions. But since they are not provided, perhaps the user expects that they are already present in the codebase. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants me to implement validate_key and validate_value as part of the solution. But the function signature given is only for _validate_labels. 

Hmm, perhaps the user wants me to write the _validate_labels function, assuming that validate_key and validate_value are already defined. So the code would loop through each key-value pair in labels, apply validate_key to the key, and validate_value to the value. 

But how to handle errors? The docstring doesn't mention returning anything, but perhaps the functions validate_key and validate_value raise exceptions if the key or value is invalid. So _validate_labels would need to catch any exceptions raised by those functions. 

Wait, but the user hasn't specified what exceptions are raised. Maybe the functions validate_key and validate_value are supposed to return a boolean, and _validate_labels would check that. But the docstring says "Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value()", which implies that those functions are used to validate each key and value. 

So the code for _validate_labels would iterate over each key and value in the labels dictionary. For each key, call validate_key(key), and for each value, call validate_value(value). If any of these calls raise an exception, the function should propagate it. Or maybe the functions return a boolean, and _validate_labels checks that all return True. 

But without knowing the exact behavior of validate_key and validate_value, it's hard to say. However, given the docstring, the function is supposed to check the labels by using those two functions. So the code would probably look like this:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

But that's assuming that validate_key and validate_value are functions that raise exceptions if validation fails. Alternatively, if they return booleans, then:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key, value in labels.items():
        if not validate_key(key):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid key: {key}")
        if not validate_value(value):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid value: {value}")

But again, without knowing the exact behavior of the helper functions, it's hard to say. However, given the docstring, the function is supposed to check the labels using those two functions. So the code would need to call them for each key and value. 

Now, considering the test-driven approach, I need to write unit tests first. Let's think about possible test cases. 

For example, if labels is a dictionary with valid keys and values, the function should not raise any exceptions. If a key is invalid, validate_key should raise an exception. Similarly for values. 

But since the helper functions are not defined, perhaps the tests would check that the function raises specific exceptions when invalid keys or values are present. 

But without knowing the helper functions, the tests would be hypothetical. 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the helper functions are part of the same code, and I need to define them as well. But the function signature given is only for _validate_labels. 

Hmm, perhaps the user wants me to write the _validate_labels function, assuming that validate_key and validate_value are functions that take a single argument and return a boolean. So the code would check each key and value. 

But since the user hasn't provided the helper functions, maybe they are supposed to be defined in the same module. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. 

So, perhaps the correct approach is to write the _validate_labels function that calls validate_key and validate_value for each key and value in the labels dictionary. 

But since the user hasn't provided the helper functions, maybe they are supposed to be implemented as part of the solution. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, not to implement the helper functions. 

This is a bit confusing. But given the information, I'll proceed to write the _validate_labels function that iterates through the labels, applies the helper functions, and raises exceptions if any validation fails. 

So the code would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    """
    Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
    """
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

But this assumes that validate_key and validate_value are functions that raise exceptions when validation fails. 

Now, for the unit tests, I need to write tests that check if the function raises exceptions for invalid keys or values. However, since the helper functions are not defined, the tests would be hypothetical. 

But perhaps the user expects that the helper functions are part of the same module and are defined elsewhere. So the tests would check that _validate_labels raises exceptions when invalid keys or values are present. 

For example, a test case where a key is not a string would trigger validate_key to raise an error. 

But without knowing the exact validation rules, the tests would need to be written in a way that they check for exceptions. 

So, the unit tests would look like:

import pytest

def test_validate_labels_valid():
    labels = {"key1": "value1", "key2": 42}
    _validate_labels(labels)

def test_validate_labels_invalid_key():
    labels = {"123": "value1"}
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        _validate_labels(labels)

def test_validate_labels_invalid_value():
    labels = {"key1": 3.14}
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        _validate_labels(labels)

But again, this depends on the helper functions raising ValueErrors. 

But since the user hasn't provided the helper functions, perhaps the actual code for validate_key and validate_value are supposed to be part of the solution. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. 

So, perhaps the user expects that the helper functions are already defined, and the _validate_labels function is to be written. 

In that case, the code for _validate_labels would be as I wrote earlier. 

But the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, so first generating comprehensive unit tests. 

But since the helper functions are not defined, the tests would need to assume their behavior. 

So, putting it all together, the code for _validate_labels would call the helper functions for each key and value. 

Therefore, the generated code would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    """
    Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
    """
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

And the unit tests would check for exceptions when invalid keys or values are present. 

But since the user wants only the code generated, not the tests, perhaps the answer is just the code for _validate_labels. 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the user wants the code for the _validate_labels function. 

But the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. 

So perhaps the user wants the code for _validate_labels, assuming that validate_key and validate_value are defined elsewhere. 

Therefore, the code would be as I wrote earlier. 

But maybe the user expects that the helper functions are also part of the solution. However, the function signature given is only for _validate_labels. 

So, the final code would be the _validate_labels function that iterates through the labels and calls the helper functions. 

But to make sure, perhaps the helper functions are supposed to be implemented as part of the solution. However, the user hasn't asked for that. 

In conclusion, the code for _validate_labels would be as follows.
