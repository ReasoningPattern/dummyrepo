Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function directlyProvidedBy, which returns the interfaces directly provided by a given object. The docstring mentions that the return value is an IDeclaration. Hmm, I need to recall how Zope interfaces work.

First, I remember that in Zope's interface system, an object can provide multiple interfaces. The function should return all the interfaces that the object directly provides, not inherited ones. So, how do you get that in Zope?

Wait, the function is supposed to return an IDeclaration. Oh right, IDeclaration is a marker interface, but maybe in this context, it's referring to the declaration of interfaces. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return a list or a collection of interfaces that the object provides directly.

Wait, maybe the function is part of the Zope interface system. Let me think. In Zope, the interfaces provided by an object can be obtained using the providedBy() method. But that returns all interfaces, including those from adapters and utilities. Wait, no. Wait, the providedBy() method returns all interfaces that the object provides, including those from adapters. But maybe the function here is supposed to get the direct interfaces, not those that are provided via adapters.

Wait, the question says "directly provided by the given object". So, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly declared by the object, not those that are provided through adapters or other means.

Wait, but how does that work in Zope? Let me think. In Zope, when you have an object that implements an interface, that interface is considered as provided by the object. But if an adapter is registered for that object, then the adapter's interface is also considered provided by the object. But maybe the function here is supposed to get the interfaces that are directly provided by the object's implementation, not those from adapters.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly declares as providing. For example, if a class implements an interface, then that interface is considered provided by instances of that class. But if an adapter is registered for that class, then the adapter's interface is also considered provided.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, not those from adapters. So, for example, if a class implements an interface, then that interface is directly provided. But if an adapter is registered for that class, then the adapter's interface is not directly provided by the class, but by the adapter.

But how to get that in Zope? Let me think. The providedBy() method returns all interfaces that the object provides, including those from adapters. But maybe there's a way to get only the direct ones. Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, not those that are provided via adapters. So, for example, if the object is an instance of a class that implements an interface, then that interface is directly provided. But if there's an adapter registered for that class, then the adapter's interface is not directly provided by the class, but by the adapter.

But how to get that? Maybe the function should look at the class's __class__ and check for interfaces declared on it. Wait, but in Zope, interfaces are declared using @implementer or similar. So, perhaps the function should check the class's __class__ for interfaces that are directly implemented.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, not considering any adapters. So, for example, if the object is an instance of a class that implements an interface, then that interface is directly provided. But if there's an adapter registered for that class, then the adapter's interface is not directly provided by the class, but by the adapter.

But how to get that in code? Let me think. The providedBy() method returns all interfaces that the object provides, including those from adapters. But maybe the function here is supposed to get the interfaces that are directly provided by the object's class, not those from adapters. So, perhaps the function should check the class's __class__ for interfaces that are directly implemented.

Wait, but how to get that? Maybe using the class's __class__ and checking for interfaces that are declared on it. For example, if the class is decorated with @implementer(SomeInterface), then SomeInterface is directly provided by the class. But if there's an adapter registered for the class, then the adapter's interface is not directly provided by the class.

So, the function directlyProvidedBy(object) should return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides. But how to get that in Zope?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object provides directly, not through any adapters. So, perhaps using the providedBy() method but filtering out those that are provided via adapters. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, which can be obtained by checking the class's __class__ for interfaces. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of the Zope interface system, and the correct way to get the interfaces directly provided by an object is to use the providedBy() method, but that returns all interfaces, including those from adapters. So maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, not those from adapters. But how?

For example, if the class is decorated with @implementer(SomeInterface), then SomeInterface is directly provided.

But how to get that in code? Let me think. In Zope, the interfaces that a class provides can be obtained by looking at the class's __class__ and checking for interfaces. But perhaps the function should use the zope.interface's providedBy() function, but that returns all interfaces. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly provided by the object's class, not those that are provided via adapters.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, which can be obtained by checking the class's __class__ for interfaces. For example, using the zope.interface's providedBy() function on the class itself.

Wait, maybe the function should call providedBy on the object's class. For example:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return providedBy(object.__class__)

But that would return the interfaces provided by the class, not the instance. But maybe that's what is needed. However, in Zope, the providedBy() function returns the interfaces that the object provides, which includes those from the class and any adapters. So if we call providedBy on the class, perhaps that gives the interfaces directly provided by the class.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have a class:

from zope.interface import Interface, implementer

class IMyInterface(Interface):
    pass

@implementer(IMyInterface)
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()

Then, providedBy(obj) would return IMyInterface, because the instance provides it. But if there's an adapter registered for MyClass, then providedBy(obj) would include that adapter's interface as well.

But if we call providedBy on the class itself, MyClass, then it would return the interfaces that the class provides, which is IMyInterface. So, in this case, directlyProvidedBy(obj) would return IMyInterface, which is the same as providedBy(obj) in this case. But if there's an adapter registered for MyClass, then providedBy(obj) would include the adapter's interface, but providedBy(MyClass) would not. So, perhaps the function directlyProvidedBy is supposed to return the interfaces provided by the class, not the instance.

But the function's name is directlyProvidedBy(object), which suggests that it's about the object, not the class. So maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object provides directly, not through any adapters. But how to do that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, which can be obtained by checking the class's __class__ for interfaces. But I'm not sure.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

So, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which is the same as the interfaces that the object's class provides. So, the function would call providedBy on the class.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's look at the docstring again. It says that the return value is an IDeclaration. Wait, IDeclaration is a marker interface, but maybe it's a typo and they meant IDeclaration, which is a base class for declarations. Or maybe it's a reference to the zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration, which is a marker interface. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which can be obtained by using the providedBy() function, but that returns a list of interfaces. However, the docstring says that the return value is an IDeclaration. Maybe that's a mistake, and the actual return value is a list of interfaces.

But regardless, the user wants the code to return the interfaces directly provided by the object.

Assuming that the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, then the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return providedBy(object.__class__)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the function should return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which would be the same as the interfaces provided by the object's class. So, the code would be as above.

But perhaps the function should return the interfaces that the object provides directly, not through any adapters. In that case, the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return providedBy(object)

But that would return all interfaces provided by the object, including those from adapters. So that's not what the function is supposed to do.

Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The function is called directlyProvidedBy, which suggests that it's about the object's direct interfaces, not those inherited or provided via adapters. So, perhaps the correct approach is to get the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, not those from adapters.

In Zope, the providedBy() function returns all interfaces that the object provides, including those from adapters. To get only the interfaces directly provided by the object's class, perhaps we need to call providedBy on the class itself.

So, the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return providedBy(object.__class__)

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the function should return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, which can be obtained by checking the class's __class__ for interfaces.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which is the same as the interfaces that the object's class provides. So, the code would be as above.

But I'm not certain. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the function using the providedBy() function on the object's class, as that would give the interfaces directly provided by the class, not through adapters.

So, the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return providedBy(object.__class__)

But I'm not sure if that's what the user wants. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which would be the same as the interfaces provided by the object's class. So, the code would be as above.

But perhaps the user is referring to the interfaces that are directly declared by the object, not those that are provided via adapters. So, the function would return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides.

In that case, the code would be as above.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose there's a class that implements an interface, and an adapter registered for that class. The object instance would provide both the interface from the class and the adapter's interface. But the function directlyProvidedBy would return only the interface from the class.

So, the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return providedBy(object.__class__)

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the function should return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which can be obtained by checking the object's class for interfaces. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function should return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which is the same as the interfaces that the object's class provides. So, the code would be as above.

In any case, I think the correct approach is to use the providedBy() function on the object's class. So, the code would be as follows.
