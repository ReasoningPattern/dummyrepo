Okay, I need to generate Python code for the process_text_links function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it processes links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links. Hmm, so the function should take a string of text and modify any links within it. 

First, I need to figure out what "linkifying textual links" means. Maybe it refers to converting plain text URLs into clickable hyperlinks. For example, turning "https://example.com" into a link with an anchor tag. Also, adding some attributes—maybe like target="_blank" or rel="noopener" for security?

But the exact requirements aren't specified. Since the user hasn't provided specific details, I should make some assumptions. Let's think about common link processing tasks. Typically, such functions use regular expressions to find URLs in the text and replace them with HTML anchor tags. 

So the steps might be:
1. Identify URLs in the text using regex.
2. For each URL found, wrap it in an anchor tag with appropriate attributes.
3. Return the modified text.

But what about the "adding some attributes" part? Maybe the function should add attributes like class, id, or other custom attributes. However, since the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the attributes are part of the linkification process. For example, adding a target or rel attribute to prevent security issues when linking to external sites.

Let me outline the approach. The function will process the input text, find all URLs, and replace them with HTML links. Let's assume that the attributes to add are target="_blank" and rel="noopener". That's a common practice to prevent tab-napping and improve security.

Now, how to find URLs. A regex pattern for URLs can be a bit complex, but a basic one might match http, https, and ftp protocols. Let me think of a regex pattern. Something like r'(https?://\S+)' would match URLs starting with http or https. But maybe it's better to use a more comprehensive pattern. However, for simplicity, perhaps start with a basic regex and then refine if needed.

Once the URLs are found, replace them with <a href="..." target="_blank" rel="noopener">...</a>. But wait, the original text might have URLs that are not properly formatted. For example, "Visit example.com" should become "Visit <a href="https://example.com">example.com</a>". So the regex should capture the URL and then wrap it in the anchor tag.

Wait, but the regex needs to find the URL in the text. So the replacement would be to take the matched URL and wrap it in the anchor tag. However, the original text might have URLs that are part of a larger sentence. For example, "Check out https://example.com for more info." So the regex would find "https://example.com" and replace it with the anchor tag.

So the plan is:
- Use re.sub with a regex pattern to find URLs.
- For each match, create an anchor tag with the URL as the href, and add the attributes.
- Return the modified text.

Now, writing the code. Let's start with the function definition. The function is called process_text_links and takes a text parameter.

Testing: The user mentioned a test-driven approach. So I should generate unit tests first. Let me think about possible test cases.

Test case 1: Input text with a simple URL. Expected output is the URL wrapped in an anchor tag with attributes.

Test case 2: Input text with multiple URLs. Each should be processed.

Test case 3: Input text with no URLs. The text remains unchanged.

Test case 4: URLs with different protocols (http, https, ftp).

Test case 5: URLs that are part of a longer sentence.

Test case 6: URLs that are not properly formatted (like missing http://). Wait, but the regex might not match those. So maybe the function should only process URLs that start with http:// or https://.

But what about email addresses? The docstring doesn't mention them, so perhaps the function is only for URLs.

Now, writing the unit tests. Using Python's unittest framework.

But the user said to generate the code first, then the tests. Wait, the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips say to follow TDD: first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So maybe I should first write the tests, then the code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. However, the tips suggest generating tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code. However, the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips suggest TDD. But the user might have intended to have the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to output only the code generated. However, the user might have made a mistake. Let me recheck.

The user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow TDD approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user might have intended that the code should be written, but the tips are just advice. But the user's main instruction is to generate the code, not the tests. So perhaps the tests are part of the code? Or maybe the user wants the code and the tests?

Wait, the initial problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the answer should be the code, not the tests. However, the tips mention generating tests first. But perhaps the user is confused. Let me proceed to generate the code.

So, the code for process_text_links. Let me think about the regex. Let's use a regex that matches URLs starting with http:// or https://. The pattern could be r'(https?://\S+)'.

Then, replace each match with an anchor tag. For example, for a match group, the replacement would be f'<a href="{match}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{match}</a>'.

Wait, but the original text might have the URL as part of a sentence. For example, "Check out https://example.com". The regex would find the URL and replace it with the anchor tag. So the replacement string would be the anchor tag with the URL as the href and the text of the link being the URL itself.

But maybe the user wants the link text to be the URL, or maybe to be the text around it. However, the docstring says "linkifying textual links", which suggests that the text is already a link (like "https://example.com") and it's being converted into an HTML link. So the link text would be the URL itself.

So the code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    # Define the regex pattern for URLs
    url_pattern = re.compile(r'(https?://\S+)')
    # Replace each URL with an anchor tag
    processed_text = url_pattern.sub(lambda m: f'<a href="{m.group(1)}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{m.group(1)}</a>', text)
    return processed_text

But wait, the lambda function in sub() will replace each match with the anchor tag. However, the original text might have URLs that are part of a larger sentence. For example, "Visit https://example.com for more info." The regex would find the URL and replace it with the anchor tag. That seems correct.

Now, testing this code. Let's think about some test cases.

Test case 1: Input "Check https://example.com", expected output "Check <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://example.com</a>".

Test case 2: Input with multiple URLs: "Visit http://example.com and https://another.com", expected output with both URLs linked.

Test case 3: Input with no URLs: "This is a normal text." remains the same.

Test case 4: URLs with paths and query parameters: "Go to https://example.com/path?query=1" becomes a link.

But what about URLs that are not properly formatted? For example, "www.example.com" without http://? The regex would not match those, so they remain as is. That's acceptable unless the function is supposed to handle those cases, which it's not according to the docstring.

Now, considering edge cases. What if the text has a URL that's part of another word? Like "https://example.com is a link". The regex would match the entire URL, which is correct.

Another consideration: the regex might match too much. For example, in the text "http://example.com", the regex would match it. But what about "http://example.com?param=1"? The regex would match that as well, which is correct.

So the code seems to handle these cases. Now, the function's docstring says "adding some attributes"—the code adds target="_blank" and rel="noopener". That's a good practice to prevent security issues.

Now, the code is written. But the user wants the code generated. So the final code would be as above. However, the user might want the code to be more robust. For example, using a more comprehensive regex for URLs. But without specific requirements, the current approach is acceptable.

So the generated code is as written above. Now, I need to present it in Python markdown format, which is triple backticks with python as the language. But the user says to output only the code generated. So the answer is the code between triple backticks.
