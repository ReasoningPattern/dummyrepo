Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _dump_string based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is supposed to serialize a Python object into a YAML stream. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes an obj and an optional dumper. The docstring says it returns a YAML stream. So, the main task is to convert the object into YAML format.

I remember that Python's PyYAML library can be used for this. The yaml.dump function can serialize objects to a YAML stream. But wait, the function's name is _dump_string, which might imply that it's a helper function. Also, the parameter dumper is optional. Maybe the dumper is a custom dumper class, but the default is to use the standard dumper.

Wait, the standard yaml.dump function has parameters like default_style, default_flow_style, and a Dumper class. So perhaps the function _dump_string is using the yaml.dump function, allowing for a custom dumper if provided.

So the function would use the yaml module. Let me check the PyYAML documentation. The yaml.dump function takes the object, and a Dumper class. So the code would be something like:

import yaml

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    return yaml.dump(obj, Dumper=dumper)

But wait, the default Dumper is usually yaml.Dumper. So if dumper is not provided, use the default. But maybe the function is supposed to handle cases where the dumper is not provided, so we need to set a default.

Wait, the function's parameters: the dumper is optional. So in the code, if dumper is None, we should use the default Dumper. But in PyYAML, the default is yaml.Dumper. So the code would be:

import yaml

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    if dumper is None:
        dumper = yaml.Dumper
    return yaml.dump(obj, Dumper=dumper)

Wait, but the yaml.dump function's parameters are a bit different. Let me check. The function signature is yaml.dump(data, stream=None, Dumper=yaml.Dumper, **kwds). So the Dumper is a parameter. So the code would be:

import yaml

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    """
    Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream

    Args:
        obj: python object

    Returns:
        YAML stream
    """
    if dumper is None:
        dumper = yaml.Dumper
    return yaml.dump(obj, Dumper=dumper)

Wait, but the function is called _dump_string. However, the yaml.dump function returns a string if stream is not provided. Wait, no. The yaml.dump function can take a stream parameter. If stream is not provided, it returns a string. So when you call yaml.dump(obj), it returns the YAML string. So the function _dump_string would return that string.

But wait, the function's docstring says it returns a YAML stream. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the YAML as a string. So the code above would work.

But what about the dumper parameter? The user can pass a custom dumper. For example, if they want to use a different dumper for custom objects.

So the code seems correct. However, I need to make sure that the function is properly handling the dumper. Also, the function is supposed to be part of a larger codebase, perhaps in a class or module. But the code as written should work.

Now, considering the test-driven development approach. The user mentioned that I should first generate comprehensive unit tests. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. However, the tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests. But the user's final instruction is to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention TDD. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code. So maybe the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention TDD. But the user's final instruction says to output only the code. So perhaps the answer is to write the code as per the function signature.

But the user's example shows that the assistant should generate the code. So I need to write the code for _dump_string.

Another thing: the function is called _dump_string, which suggests it's a private function. So perhaps it's part of a class, but the code as written is a standalone function.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

import yaml

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    """
    Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream

    Args:
        obj: python object

    Returns:
        YAML stream
    """
    if dumper is None:
        dumper = yaml.Dumper
    return yaml.dump(obj, Dumper=dumper)

But wait, in PyYAML, the Dumper is a class, and the dump function uses it. So this should work.

But what about the case where the user passes a custom dumper? For example, if they have a custom dumper class, they can pass it in. So the code allows for that.

So the code seems correct. Now, I need to make sure that the function returns a string. Let me check: when you call yaml.dump(obj), it returns a string. So yes.

So the code should be as above. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, so the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with python as the language.

But the user's instruction says to output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. So the final answer is the code as written.
