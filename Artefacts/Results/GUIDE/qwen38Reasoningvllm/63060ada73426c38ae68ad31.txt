Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the _convert_non_cli_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. They also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

First, I need to understand what the function does. The docstring says it casts arguments to correct types by modifying the values_dict. By default, all values are strings. The parameters are parser_name (like 'main', 'virsh', etc.) and values_dict, which is a dictionary of arguments.

So, the function's job is to convert the values in values_dict to the appropriate types. But how? The docstring doesn't specify the exact conversion rules. Hmm. Maybe there are specific rules based on the parser_name? For example, different parsers might have different expected types for their arguments.

Wait, since the user hasn't provided specific conversion rules, I need to make some assumptions. Maybe the function is part of a larger system where different parsers have predefined type mappings. For example, the 'virsh' parser might expect certain arguments to be integers or booleans, while 'main' might have different requirements.

But without specific details, I need to create a general approach. Perhaps the function uses a predefined mapping of parser names to their argument type specifications. For instance, for each parser, there's a dictionary that maps argument names to their expected types. Then, the function would iterate through the values_dict and convert each value according to the specified type for that argument.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle common type conversions, like converting strings to integers, booleans, etc., based on some criteria. But again, without more info, I have to make assumptions.

Let me think about possible test cases. For example, if the parser is 'virsh', and an argument 'port' is supposed to be an integer. The test would check that the value is converted from a string to an integer. Similarly, a 'debug' flag might be converted to a boolean.

So, the function might have a set of rules based on the parser_name. Let's say there's a helper function or a data structure that maps parser names to their argument type specifications. For example:

type_mappings = {
    'virsh': {
        'port': int,
        'timeout': int,
        'debug': bool,
    },
    'main': {
        'verbose': bool,
        'count': int,
    },
    # etc.
}

Then, the _convert_non_cli_args function would look up the parser_name in type_mappings, and for each argument in values_dict, if it's in the mapping, convert it to the specified type.

But how to implement this? The function would need to check each key in values_dict against the type mappings for the given parser_name. If a match is found, convert the value.

But since the user hasn't provided specific mappings, maybe the function is supposed to handle some common conversions, like converting 'true'/'false' to booleans, or numbers to integers. However, without knowing the exact requirements, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a framework where the type conversions are determined by the parser's configuration. For example, in argparse, when you define a parser, you can specify type. But in this case, the function is modifying the values_dict after parsing, so maybe it's handling cases where the CLI arguments are parsed as strings, but need to be converted to other types.

Wait, the function is called _convert_non_cli_args. Maybe it's for arguments that are not CLI arguments but come from other sources, like configuration files or environment variables. So, the function's job is to convert those values to the correct types.

But again, without specific conversion rules, I need to make some assumptions. Let's proceed with the idea that there's a predefined mapping of parser names to their argument type specifications. For example, for 'virsh', certain arguments are integers, others are booleans, etc.

So, the code would first check if the parser_name exists in the type_mappings. If not, maybe do nothing. Then, for each key in values_dict, check if it's in the type_mappings for that parser. If so, convert the value to the specified type.

But how to structure this in code? Let's outline the steps:

1. Define a type_mappings dictionary that maps parser names to their argument type specifications.
2. For the given parser_name, retrieve the corresponding type specifications.
3. Iterate over each key-value pair in values_dict.
4. For each key, check if it exists in the type specifications.
5. If it does, convert the value to the specified type.
6. Update the values_dict in place.

But since the user hasn't provided the type_mappings, perhaps the function is supposed to be a placeholder, and the actual conversion logic is to be implemented. However, the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. Since the docstring doesn't specify the conversion rules, maybe the function is supposed to be a stub, and the actual implementation depends on some external configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class, and the type conversions are handled based on some class attributes or methods. But without more context, it's hard to say.

Wait, the user mentioned that they want the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. Since the docstring doesn't specify the conversion logic, perhaps the function is supposed to be a placeholder, and the actual implementation would depend on specific requirements. However, the user also mentioned a test-driven approach, so maybe I should create some test cases that assume certain conversions.

Let me think of possible test cases. For example:

Test case 1: parser_name is 'virsh', values_dict has 'port' as '8080' → should be converted to integer 8080.

Test case 2: parser_name is 'main', values_dict has 'debug' as 'true' → converted to True.

Test case 3: parser_name is 'ospd', values_dict has 'count' as '5' → converted to 5.

But without knowing the exact mappings, how can I write the code? Maybe the function is supposed to handle common conversions, like converting strings to integers, booleans, etc., based on some heuristics.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert arguments that are known to be of certain types. For example, if the argument is 'port', convert to int; if 'debug', convert to bool.

But again, without knowing the exact mappings, I need to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the idea that there's a predefined mapping for each parser. For example:

type_mappings = {
    'virsh': {
        'port': int,
        'timeout': int,
        'debug': bool,
    },
    'main': {
        'verbose': bool,
        'count': int,
    },
    'ospd': {
        'max_retries': int,
        'log_level': str,  # maybe not converted
    },
}

Then, the function would check each key in values_dict against the type_mappings for the given parser_name and convert accordingly.

So, the code would look something like:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    type_mappings = {
        'virsh': {
            'port': int,
            'timeout': int,
            'debug': bool,
        },
        'main': {
            'verbose': bool,
            'count': int,
        },
        'ospd': {
            'max_retries': int,
            'log_level': str,  # no conversion needed
        },
    }
    if parser_name not in type_mappings:
        return
    for arg_name, arg_type in type_mappings[parser_name].items():
        if arg_name in values_dict:
            try:
                values_dict[arg_name] = arg_type(values_dict[arg_name])
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                # handle conversion error, maybe log or raise?
                pass

But the user hasn't provided this mapping, so perhaps this is part of the code that needs to be implemented. However, the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. Since the docstring doesn't specify the conversion rules, maybe the function is supposed to be a placeholder, and the actual implementation is left to the developer.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle some standard conversions, like converting 'true'/'false' to booleans, numbers to integers, etc. For example:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    for key, value in values_dict.items():
        if key in ['debug', 'verbose']:
            values_dict[key] = value.lower() == 'true'
        elif key in ['port', 'timeout', 'count']:
            try:
                values_dict[key] = int(value)
            except ValueError:
                pass
        # handle other keys as needed

But again, without knowing the specific keys and their types, this is speculative.

Given that the user wants the code generated, and the docstring doesn't specify the conversion logic, perhaps the function is supposed to be a stub, and the actual implementation would depend on the specific use case. However, since the user mentioned test-driven development, I should create some test cases that assume certain conversions.

So, perhaps the code would look like this:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    # Example conversion logic based on parser name
    if parser_name == 'virsh':
        if 'port' in values_dict:
            try:
                values_dict['port'] = int(values_dict['port'])
            except ValueError:
                pass
        if 'debug' in values_dict:
            values_dict['debug'] = values_dict['debug'].lower() == 'true'
    elif parser_name == 'main':
        if 'verbose' in values_dict:
            values_dict['verbose'] = values_dict['verbose'].lower() == 'true'
        if 'count' in values_dict:
            try:
                values_dict['count'] = int(values_dict['count'])
            except ValueError:
                pass

But again, this is just an example. The actual implementation depends on the specific requirements.

Since the user hasn't provided specific conversion rules, I need to make assumptions. The best approach is to write a function that converts certain known arguments based on the parser name, and include test cases that verify these conversions.

So, putting it all together, the code would have the function with some conversion logic, and the tests would check that the values are converted correctly.

But since the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring, and not the tests, perhaps the code is supposed to be a stub. However, the user mentioned test-driven development, so I should generate the tests first.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." And the tips say to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

So, the user wants the code (the function) to be generated, but following TDD, which means first writing the tests, then the code. However, the user's instruction is to generate the code, not the tests. But the tips suggest to generate tests first. However, the final output should be the code, not the tests.

Hmm, maybe the user wants the code, but the thinking process includes considering TDD, which would involve writing tests first. But the final answer is just the code.

In any case, the function is supposed to convert the values in values_dict to the correct types based on the parser_name. Since the exact conversion rules are not given, I need to make some assumptions. Let's proceed with the idea that the function converts certain arguments based on the parser name, like 'virsh' converting 'port' to int and 'debug' to bool.

So, the code would look like:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    if parser_name == 'virsh':
        if 'port' in values_dict:
            try:
                values_dict['port'] = int(values_dict['port'])
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                pass
        if 'debug' in values_dict:
            values_dict['debug'] = values_dict['debug'].lower() == 'true'
    elif parser_name == 'main':
        if 'verbose' in values_dict:
            values_dict['verbose'] = values_dict['verbose'].lower() == 'true'
        if 'count' in values_dict:
            try:
                values_dict['count'] = int(values_dict['count'])
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                pass
    # Add more parser names and their conversion rules as needed

But again, this is just an example. The actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements.

In conclusion, the code would need to have logic to convert certain arguments based on the parser_name. Since the user hasn't provided specific conversion rules, the code is a placeholder with some example conversions. The function modifies the values_dict in place.
