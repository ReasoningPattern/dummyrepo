Okay, I need to generate Python code for the protocol_handlers function based on the given function signature and docstring. The user mentioned a test-driven development approach, so first, I should think about what tests would be necessary.

The function is supposed to return different Bolt protocol handlers depending on the protocol_version. Let me think about possible protocol versions. Bolt is a protocol for Neo4j, right? So maybe versions like 1, 2, or 3. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the user hasn't specified the exact versions, so perhaps I should assume some common ones.

The function is a class method, as indicated by the 'cls' parameter. So the function is part of a class, and it's a class method. The docstring says it returns different handlers based on protocol_version. So the function probably checks the protocol_version and returns the appropriate handler.

But what are the possible handlers? Maybe there are different classes or functions for each protocol version. For example, maybe there's a Bolt1Handler, Bolt2Handler, etc. The function would return the correct one based on the input.

But the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details. So the tests would need to cover different protocol versions and ensure the correct handler is returned. Also, what if protocol_version is None? The docstring says the function returns different forms based on the value, so maybe if it's None, it defaults to a certain version.

So for the tests, I should create test cases for different protocol versions. Let's say:

- protocol_version is None: returns default handler (maybe Bolt1Handler)
- protocol_version is 1: returns Bolt1Handler
- protocol_version is 2: returns Bolt2Handler
- protocol_version is 3: returns Bolt3Handler
- invalid protocol version: maybe raises an error or returns a default?

But the docstring doesn't mention error handling. So perhaps the function assumes that protocol_version is a valid version. Or maybe it's supposed to handle invalid ones. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the tests should check for valid versions and ensure the correct handler is returned.

Now, the actual code. The function is a class method. So inside the class, the method would be defined as @classmethod. But the function signature given is def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):, so it's a class method.

Wait, in Python, a class method is defined with @classmethod. So the code would have that decorator. But the user's function signature doesn't include it. So perhaps the function is a class method, and the code should include the @classmethod decorator.

So the code would look something like:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    # logic here

But the user's function signature doesn't have the decorator. Wait, the user provided the function signature as def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):, so the code should have that. But in Python, the @classmethod decorator is needed for it to be a class method. So the code must include that.

But the user's function signature doesn't show the decorator. Hmm. Maybe the user is using a different approach. Or perhaps the function is a static method. Wait, the function is called protocol_handlers, which is a class method. So the code should have the @classmethod decorator.

So the code would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    # implementation

Now, the implementation. The function needs to return different handlers based on protocol_version. Let's assume that the handlers are classes within the same class. For example, maybe the class has attributes like Bolt1Handler, Bolt2Handler, etc. So the code would check the protocol_version and return the corresponding handler.

But how to structure that? For example:

if protocol_version is None:
    return cls.Bolt1Handler()
elif protocol_version == 1:
    return cls.Bolt1Handler()
elif protocol_version == 2:
    return cls.Bolt2Handler()
else:
    raise ValueError("Unsupported protocol version")

But the user hasn't provided the actual handler classes. So perhaps the code is supposed to return instances of these handlers. Alternatively, maybe the function returns a function or a class.

But since the user hasn't provided specifics, I need to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the idea that the class has handler classes as attributes, and the function returns an instance of the appropriate handler.

So the code would look like:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is None:
        protocol_version = 1  # default
    if protocol_version == 1:
        return cls.Bolt1Handler()
    elif protocol_version == 2:
        return cls.Bolt2Handler()
    elif protocol_version == 3:
        return cls.Bolt3Handler()
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")

But the user's docstring says "Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version." So the function returns the handler instances.

But the actual implementation depends on the class structure. However, since the user hasn't provided that, the code must be written in a way that assumes the existence of these handler classes.

Now, for the unit tests. The tests should check that for different protocol versions, the correct handler is returned. Also, check that the default is handled correctly.

So the tests would be:

import unittest

class TestProtocolHandlers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_default_protocol_version(self):
        # Assume the class has a handler for version 1
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers()
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt1Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_1(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(1)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt1Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_2(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(2)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt2Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_3(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(3)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt3Handler)

    def test_invalid_protocol_version(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            MyClass.protocol_handlers(4)

But the actual class name isn't known. So in the tests, the class would be something like 'MyClass', and the handlers are attributes of that class.

But the user hasn't provided the actual class structure. So the tests need to be written in a way that assumes the existence of these handlers.

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So the code for the function and the tests.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

The function with the @classmethod decorator, checking the protocol_version and returning the appropriate handler.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual handler classes, the code must be written in a way that assumes they exist. So the code would be as follows.

Now, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written with the function and the tests.

But the user said to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So the code should be in triple backticks, with the function and the tests.

But the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the code should include the tests first, then the implementation.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, but to follow TDD by first generating tests. But the user's initial message says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. But the tips say to generate tests first.

So perhaps the code should include both the tests and the implementation. But the user's example shows that the code is the function, and the tests are separate.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are generated as part of the process.

But the user wants the code generated, which includes the function and the tests. However, the user's example shows that the code is the function, and the tests are written as part of the process.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So the code would be the function and the tests.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me proceed.

So, the code would be:

First, the function:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        protocol_version = 1  # default to version 1
    if protocol_version == 1:
        return cls.Bolt1Handler()
    elif protocol_version == 2:
        return cls.Bolt2Handler()
    elif protocol_version == 3:
        return cls.Bolt3Handler()
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")

Then, the unit tests:

import unittest

class TestProtocolHandlers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_default_protocol_version(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers()
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt1Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_1(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(1)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt1Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_2(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(2)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt2Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_3(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(3)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt3Handler)

    def test_invalid_protocol_version(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            MyClass.protocol_handlers(4)

But the class name 'MyClass' is arbitrary. However, the user hasn't provided the actual class name. So perhaps the tests should be written in a way that assumes the class has the protocol_handlers method.

But the user's function is part of a class, so the tests would be written against that class.

But the user's code may not have the class defined. So the tests would need to be written with the assumption that the class exists.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual class, the tests are written as part of the code.

Putting it all together, the code would include the function and the tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, which includes the function and the tests.

But the user's initial message says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is the function, and the tests are generated as part of the process.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as the function and the tests.

But the user may not have provided the actual class structure, so the code is written with placeholders.

So the final code would be:

The function with the @classmethod decorator, checking the protocol_version and returning the appropriate handler, and the unit tests that check each case.

But the user's function is part of a class. So the code would need to have the class definition. However, the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the code is written with the assumption that the class exists, and the function is part of it.

But the user's function is called protocol_handlers, which is a class method. So the code would be:

class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        """
        Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
        """
        if protocol_version is None:
            protocol_version = 1  # default to version 1
        if protocol_version == 1:
            return cls.Bolt1Handler()
        elif protocol_version == 2:
            return cls.Bolt2Handler()
        elif protocol_version == 3:
            return cls.Bolt3Handler()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")

Then the tests:

import unittest

class TestProtocolHandlers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_default_protocol_version(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers()
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt1Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_1(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(1)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt1Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_2(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(2)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt2Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_3(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(3)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt3Handler)

    def test_invalid_protocol_version(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            MyClass.protocol_handlers(4)

But the user hasn't provided the actual class name or the handler classes. So the code is written with placeholders.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So the code should include the function and the tests.

But the user's initial message says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is the function, and the tests are generated as part of the process.

But the user's tips say to follow TDD, so first generate the tests, then the code.

But the user wants the code generated, so the code includes both the tests and the function.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code would be written as:

```python
class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        """
        Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
        """
        if protocol_version is None:
            protocol_version = 1  # default to version 1
        if protocol_version == 1:
            return cls.Bolt1Handler()
        elif protocol_version == 2:
            return cls.Bolt2Handler()
        elif protocol_version == 3:
            return cls.Bolt3Handler()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")

import unittest

class TestProtocolHandlers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_default_protocol_version(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers()
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt1Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_1(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(1)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt1Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_2(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(2)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt2Handler)

    def test_protocol_version_3(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(3)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, MyClass.Bolt3Handler)

    def test_invalid_protocol_version(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            MyClass.protocol_handlers(4)
```

But the user may not have provided the actual class structure, so the code assumes that the class has the necessary handler classes. However, this is a reasonable assumption for the purpose of the exercise.

So the final code is as above. But the user's function is part of a class, so the code includes the class definition with the method, and the tests.
