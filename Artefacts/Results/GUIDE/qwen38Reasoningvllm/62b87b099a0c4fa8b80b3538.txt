Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_fill_request_el(obj) based on the given docstring. The docstring says to check if the obj class has the 'fill' and 'request' attributes. 

First, I should understand what the function is supposed to do. The function takes an object 'obj' and checks whether this object has both 'fill' and 'request' attributes. But wait, the docstring mentions the class, not the instance. Wait, the function is called is_fill_request_el, which might be a typo? Or maybe it's checking if the class has those attributes? Or maybe the object's class? Hmm.

Wait, the docstring says "Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes." So the function is checking if the class of the object (obj.__class__) has the attributes 'fill' and 'request'. So, for example, if obj is an instance of a class that has those two attributes, then return True.

So the function needs to check if both 'fill' and 'request' are present in the class of obj. But how to check for attributes in a class? In Python, you can use hasattr() for that. So, the function would return True if both hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'request') are True.

Wait, but maybe the attributes are instance attributes? But the docstring says the class has them. So the function is checking if the class (not the instance) has those attributes. So, for example, if the class has a class attribute called 'fill' and 'request', then the function returns True.

So the code would be something like:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'request')

But wait, maybe the function is supposed to check if the object itself has those attributes, not the class. But the docstring says "obj class has the fill and request attributes". So the class of the object. So the code as above.

But maybe the function is supposed to check if the object has those attributes as instance attributes. But the wording is ambiguous. However, the docstring says "obj class has the fill and request attributes", so it's about the class.

So the code would be as above. But let me think again. Let's say obj is an instance of a class. The function checks if that class has the attributes. So, for example, if the class has a class variable 'fill' and 'request', then returns True.

So the code is straightforward. Now, the user wants me to generate the code, but also to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. Wait, the initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests. But perhaps the user wants the code, but the assistant is supposed to generate the code, but in the process, think about the tests. However, the final output should be only the code.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is the function as per the docstring. But maybe the user wants the code with the tests? Wait, the initial problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code is the function, but the tips mention TDD, but perhaps that's just for the assistant's thinking process. The actual output is just the code.

So the code would be:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'request')

But maybe the function should check for the presence of the attributes in the object's class. So that's the code.

But perhaps the function is supposed to check if the object has those attributes as instance attributes. But the docstring says the class. So the code is as above.

Now, considering possible edge cases. For example, if the class doesn't have the attributes, returns False. If the class has one but not the other, returns False. If both are present, returns True.

So the code is correct. Now, the user wants the code in python markdown format. So the code is written as a Python function, with the docstring. So the final code is as written.
