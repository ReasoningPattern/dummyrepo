Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _replace_register based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it replaces the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and then deletes flow_params[register_value]. Wait, so the register_number is the index of the register we want to replace, and register_value is the value that's currently in another register. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again.

Oh, wait, maybe flow_params is a list or a dictionary? The function is called _replace_register, so maybe flow_params is a list where each element represents a register. So, for example, if flow_params is a list, then register_number is the index of the register we want to replace, and register_value is the value that's in another register. Wait, but the docstring says "replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value]". So, the value at register_number is replaced by the value at register_value. Then, delete flow_params[register_value]. Wait, but if register_value is a value, not an index, then maybe flow_params is a dictionary? Or maybe register_value is an index?

Wait, the function parameters are flow_params, register_number, register_value. Let me think. Suppose flow_params is a list of registers. Let's say register_number is the index of the register we want to replace. And register_value is the index of the register whose value we want to copy. So, for example, if flow_params is [A, B, C], and we call _replace_register(flow_params, 1, 2), then flow_params[1] becomes C, and then we delete flow_params[2]. Wait, but after replacing, the list would be [A, C, C], then delete index 2, resulting in [A, C]. But that seems odd. Or maybe the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, and then remove the register_value's entry. But if flow_params is a list, then register_value would be an index. But the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. Maybe register_value is the value, not the index. Wait, that would be confusing. Let me think again.

The docstring says: Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]. So, the function is taking the value at register_value and putting it into register_number, then deleting the entry at register_value. But how is flow_params structured? If flow_params is a dictionary, then register_number and register_value are keys. For example, if flow_params is a dictionary like {'reg1': 5, 'reg2': 10}, then replacing register_number 'reg1' with the value of register_value 'reg2' would set flow_params['reg1'] = 10, then delete flow_params['reg2'].

But the function parameters are named register_number and register_value. Maybe the function is intended to work with a list where each element is a register, and register_number and register_value are indices. But then the docstring says "flow_params[register_value]" which would be the value at that index. Wait, but if flow_params is a list, then flow_params[register_value] would be the value at index register_value. So, for example, if flow_params is [10, 20, 30], and register_number is 1, register_value is 2, then flow_params[1] becomes 30 (the value at index 2), then delete flow_params[2]. So the list would become [10, 30], since after replacing index 1 with 30, the list is [10, 30, 30], then delete index 2, resulting in [10, 30].

But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe flow_params is a dictionary where the keys are register numbers, and the values are the register values. For example, flow_params could be {'reg0': 5, 'reg1': 10}. Then, if register_number is 'reg0' and register_value is 'reg1', then flow_params['reg0'] becomes 10, and then delete flow_params['reg1'].

But the function parameters are named register_number and register_value. So perhaps register_number is the key (like 'reg0') and register_value is another key (like 'reg1'). But the function's parameters are called register_number and register_value, which might imply that register_value is the value, not the key. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to work with a list where each element is a register's value, and register_number is the index of the register to replace, and register_value is the index of the register whose value to take. So, for example, flow_params is a list, and the function replaces the value at register_number with the value at register_value, then deletes the value at register_value. But that would require that register_value is an index. However, the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. So perhaps register_value is the value, not the index. Wait, but then how do you get the value from flow_params? Maybe flow_params is a dictionary where the keys are register numbers, and the values are the register values. For example, flow_params is a dictionary like {0: 5, 1: 10}. Then, register_number is 0, and register_value is 1. So, replace flow_params[0] with flow_params[1], then delete flow_params[1]. So the dictionary becomes {0: 10}.

That makes sense. So the function is taking a dictionary (flow_params) where the keys are register numbers (like integers), and the values are the register values. Then, the function replaces the value at register_number with the value at register_value, then deletes the entry at register_value.

But the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. So, register_number is the key (like 0) of the register to replace, and register_value is the key (like 1) of the register whose value to take. So the function would do:

flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
del flow_params[register_value]

But then, what if register_value is not present in flow_params? That would raise a KeyError. So the function may need to handle that, but the docstring doesn't mention it. The user probably expects that the keys exist.

So, the function is supposed to take a dictionary (flow_params), and two keys (register_number and register_value). It replaces the value at register_number with the value at register_value, then deletes the entry at register_value.

But the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. So, perhaps the function is intended to work with a list, but that seems less likely. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe flow_params is a list, and register_number and register_value are indices. For example, flow_params is a list of register values. Then, the function replaces the value at index register_number with the value at index register_value, then deletes the value at index register_value. But that would require that register_value is an index. For example, if flow_params is [10, 20, 30], and register_number is 1, register_value is 2. Then, flow_params[1] becomes 30, and then delete flow_params[2]. The list would become [10, 30], since after replacing index 1 with 30, the list is [10, 30, 30], then deleting index 2 gives [10, 30].

But in this case, the function's parameters would be register_number and register_value as indices. However, the docstring says "flow_params[register_value]" which would be the value at that index. So, the function is taking the value from register_value's index and putting it into register_number's index, then deleting the register_value's index.

But the function's name is _replace_register, which suggests that it's replacing a register's value. So perhaps flow_params is a list of registers, and the function is replacing the value of a register (at register_number) with the value of another register (at register_value), then removing the latter.

But how to handle the case where register_value is the same as register_number? For example, if register_number and register_value are the same. Then, we would be replacing the value with itself, then deleting it. That would result in the register_number's value being replaced with itself, then deleting it. Which would leave the list with that register removed. But that's probably an error. However, the function may not need to handle that case, assuming that register_value is a different index.

But the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. So, perhaps the function is intended to work with a dictionary where the keys are register numbers (like integers), and the values are the register values. So, the function is replacing the value of register_number with the value of register_value, then deleting register_value.

In that case, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But then, what if register_value is not in flow_params? That would raise a KeyError. But the docstring doesn't mention error handling. So perhaps the function assumes that register_value exists in flow_params.

But the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. So, perhaps the function is intended to work with a dictionary where the keys are register numbers (like strings or integers), and the values are the register values.

Alternatively, maybe flow_params is a list, and register_number and register_value are indices. So, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But in this case, if register_value is the same as register_number, then after replacing, we delete the same index, which would cause an error because the list has already been modified. For example, if flow_params is [10, 20], and register_number is 0, register_value is 0. Then, flow_params[0] becomes 10 (same as before), then del flow_params[0], which would leave the list as [20]. But that's probably not intended. However, the function may not need to handle that case.

But given the docstring, the function is supposed to replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value], then delete flow_params[register_value]. So, the code would be as above.

But what if flow_params is a dictionary? Then, the code would work as well. So, the function is generic and works with both lists and dictionaries? Or perhaps the function is intended to work with a dictionary.

But the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. So, perhaps the function is intended to work with a dictionary where the keys are register numbers (like integers), and the values are the register values. So, the code would be as above.

Now, the user wants me to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function's parameters are flow_params, register_number, register_value. The docstring says to replace flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value], then delete flow_params[register_value].

So, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, what if flow_params is a list? Then, register_number and register_value are indices. But if register_value is an index, then flow_params[register_value] is the value at that index. So, the code would work.

But what if flow_params is a dictionary? Then, register_number and register_value are keys. So, the code would work as well.

But the function's name suggests that it's replacing a register's value, which implies that flow_params is a collection of registers. So, the code would work for both lists and dictionaries. However, the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value, which might imply that they are keys (like in a dictionary), but that's not clear.

But given the information, the code is straightforward. So, the code would be as above.

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. Wait, the initial instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So, perhaps the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. But the tips say to generate unit tests first. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So maybe the user wants the code for the function, not the tests.

But the initial problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So, the answer is the code for the function.

But the tips mention test-driven development, but perhaps that's just a suggestion, and the user wants the code.

So, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But I need to make sure that this code works. Let's think of some test cases.

For example, if flow_params is a list:

flow_params = [10, 20, 30]
_replace_register(flow_params, 1, 2)
After this, flow_params[1] should be 30, and the element at index 2 should be deleted. So the list becomes [10, 30].

Another test case: flow_params is a dictionary.

flow_params = {0: 10, 1: 20}
_replace_register(flow_params, 0, 1)
After this, flow_params[0] is 20, and the key 1 is deleted. So the dictionary becomes {0: 20}.

But what if register_value is not present in flow_params? For example, if flow_params is a list and register_value is out of bounds, it would raise an IndexError. Similarly for a dictionary, KeyError.

But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling these cases, so the code assumes that register_value exists in flow_params.

So the code is correct as per the given docstring.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
