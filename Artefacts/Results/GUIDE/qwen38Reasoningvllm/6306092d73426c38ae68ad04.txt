Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_parser_option_specs based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

First, let me understand the function's purpose. The function is supposed to return a list of all command options for a specified command name. The parameters are command_name, which can be things like 'main', 'virsh', 'ospd', etc. The return value is a list of options.

But what exactly constitutes an option here? Since the function is part of a class (as it's using self), maybe this is related to parsing command-line arguments. Perhaps the options are defined as dictionaries with keys like 'name', 'help', 'default', etc. For example, each option might have a name, a help string, a default value, and maybe a type.

So, the function needs to return a list of such dictionaries based on the command_name. But how does the class store these options? Maybe there's a data structure in the class that maps command names to their options. For example, a dictionary like self.command_options where each key is a command name and the value is a list of option specs.

But the user hasn't provided any existing code, so I need to make assumptions. Let's proceed.

For the unit tests, I should test different command names and ensure that the function returns the correct list of options. For example, if command_name is 'main', it might return a list with options like --help, --version, etc. For 'virsh', maybe different options.

But since the actual implementation isn't provided, the tests need to be based on expected behavior. Let's think of possible test cases.

Test case 1: command_name is 'main' → returns a list of options for the main command.

Test case 2: command_name is 'virsh' → returns options for virsh.

Test case 3: command_name is not recognized → returns an empty list or raises an exception? The docstring says it returns a list, so maybe empty.

But the function's docstring says it returns the list of all command options. So, the actual code would need to have some way to retrieve these options based on the command name.

Now, writing the code. Let's assume that the class has a dictionary called self.command_options that maps command names to their options. So, the function would check if the command_name exists in this dictionary and return the corresponding list. If not, return an empty list.

So, the code would be something like:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    return self.command_options.get(command_name, [])

But then, how is self.command_options initialized? Maybe in the class's __init__ method, or through some setup.

But since the user hasn't provided that, the code would need to have that structure.

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would need to have the function, and perhaps the self.command_options is a dictionary in the class.

But since the user hasn't provided any existing code, perhaps the code is part of a class that manages command-line options for different commands.

Now, writing the unit tests. Let's think of a test class that mocks the self.command_options.

For example, in the tests, we can create an instance of the class, set self.command_options, and then call get_parser_option_specs with different command names.

So, the unit tests would look like:

class TestGetParserOptionSpecs(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.instance = MyClass()

    def test_main_command(self):
        self.instance.command_options = {'main': [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}, ...]}
        result = self.instance.get_parser_option_specs('main')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--help', ...}])

But since the actual options are not provided, the tests would need to be generic. However, without knowing the actual options, the tests can't be specific. So perhaps the tests are more about checking the structure and existence of the options.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate the options dynamically based on some logic. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a command-line parser setup, and the options are defined in a way that depends on the command. For example, for 'main', there are certain options, and for 'virsh', others.

But again, without more info, I need to make assumptions.

So, the code would be as follows:

The function checks the command_name and returns the corresponding list of options from self.command_options. If the command isn't found, returns an empty list.

Now, writing the code.

But the user wants the code generated, so the code would be:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    """
    Gets all the options for the specified command

    :param command_name: the command name (main, virsh, ospd, etc...)
    :return: the list of all command options
    """
    return self.command_options.get(command_name, [])

But then, the class must have self.command_options as a dictionary. So, in the class's __init__ method, perhaps:

def __init__(self):
    self.command_options = {
        'main': [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}, ...],
        'virsh': [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}, ...],
        # etc.
    }

But since the user hasn't provided that, the code would need to have that structure.

But the user's request is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code for the function would be as above.

Now, the unit tests. Let's write them.

Assuming that the class has a command_options attribute, the tests can check that the function returns the correct options for different commands.

So, the unit tests would be:

import unittest

class TestGetParserOptionSpecs(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.instance = MyClass()

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_main(self):
        # Setup command_options for 'main'
        self.instance.command_options = {
            'main': [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}],
            'virsh': [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}]
        }
        result = self.instance.get_parser_option_specs('main')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_virsh(self):
        self.instance.command_options = {
            'main': [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}],
            'virsh': [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}]
        }
        result = self.instance.get_parser_option_specs('virsh')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_unknown_command(self):
        self.instance.command_options = {
            'main': [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}],
            'virsh': [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}]
        }
        result = self.instance.get_parser_option_specs('ospd')
        self.assertEqual(result, [])

But wait, the user said to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So, the user wants the code for the function and the unit tests.

But the original question says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the user wants the code for the function, and perhaps the unit tests as part of the code.

But the initial instruction says to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

So, the answer should include the unit tests and the actual code.

But the user might expect the code for the function and the tests.

So, putting it all together.

But the user's initial code is a function inside a class. So, the code would be part of a class, perhaps called CommandParser or something similar.

So, the code would be:

class CommandParser:
    def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
        """
        Gets all the options for the specified command

        :param command_name: the command name (main, virsh, ospd, etc...)
        :return: the list of all command options
        """
        return self.command_options.get(command_name, [])

    def __init__(self):
        self.command_options = {
            'main': [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}, {'name': '--version', 'help': 'Show version'}],
            'virsh': [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}, {'name': '--debug', 'help': 'Enable debug mode'}],
            'ospd': [{'name': '--timeout', 'help': 'Set timeout in seconds'}, {'name': '--retry', 'help': 'Retry on failure'}]
        }

But then, the unit tests would test this.

So, the unit tests would be:

import unittest

class TestCommandParser(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.parser = CommandParser()

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_main(self):
        result = self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('main')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}, {'name': '--version', 'help': 'Show version'}])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_virsh(self):
        result = self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('virsh')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}, {'name': '--debug', 'help': 'Enable debug mode'}])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_ospd(self):
        result = self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('ospd')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--timeout', 'help': 'Set timeout in seconds'}, {'name': '--retry', 'help': 'Retry on failure'}])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_unknown_command(self):
        result = self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('unknown')
        self.assertEqual(result, [])

But the user wants the code generated, so the code would include both the function and the tests.

But the original question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated.

So, the answer would be the code for the function and the unit tests.

But the user might have intended for the code to be the function, and the tests as part of the code.

So, putting it all together in Python markdown format.

But the user might not want the __init__ method, but the function. However, the function relies on self.command_options, which must be defined somewhere. So, perhaps the code includes the __init__ method.

So, the final code would be:

class CommandParser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.command_options = {
            'main': [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}, {'name': '--version', 'help': 'Show version'}],
            'virsh': [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}, {'name': '--debug', 'help': 'Enable debug mode'}],
            'ospd': [{'name': '--timeout', 'help': 'Set timeout in seconds'}, {'name': '--retry', 'help': 'Retry on failure'}]
        }

    def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
        """
        Gets all the options for the specified command

        :param command_name: the command name (main, virsh, ospd, etc...)
        :return: the list of all command options
        """
        return self.command_options.get(command_name, [])

And the unit tests:

import unittest

class TestCommandParser(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.parser = CommandParser()

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_main(self):
        result = self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('main')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--help', 'help': 'Show help'}, {'name': '--version', 'help': 'Show version'}])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_virsh(self):
        result = self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('virsh')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--connect', 'help': 'Connect to hypervisor'}, {'name': '--debug', 'help': 'Enable debug mode'}])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_ospd(self):
        result = self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('ospd')
        self.assertEqual(result, [{'name': '--timeout', 'help': 'Set timeout in seconds'}, {'name': '--retry', 'help': 'Retry on failure'}])

    def test_get_parser_option_specs_unknown_command(self):
        result = self.parser.get_parser_option_specs('unknown')
        self.assertEqual(result, [])

But the user wants the code generated, so including both the function and the tests.

But the original question says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the main code is the function, and the tests are part of the code.

So, the answer should include the code for the function and the tests.

But the user might have intended for the code to be the function, and the tests as part of the code.

So, the final answer would be the code for the function and the tests, formatted in Python markdown.
