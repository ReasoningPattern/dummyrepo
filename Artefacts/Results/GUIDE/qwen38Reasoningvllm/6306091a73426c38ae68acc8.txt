Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function list_of_file_names based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring mentions creating and returning a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). Hmm, but the function's purpose isn't entirely clear from the docstring. Wait, maybe there's more context needed here. 

Wait, the function is supposed to create a list of file names based on settings_dirs and spec_option. But the docstring says IniType complex type. Maybe IniType is a class that represents some configuration or structure? Or perhaps the function is supposed to generate a list of file names according to certain specifications, and the IniType is part of that structure?

But the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details. The function's parameters are settings_dirs (probably a list of directories) and spec_option (maybe a specification option that determines how files are selected). The docstring mentions returning an IniType via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So maybe the function is supposed to use the cli.ListOfFileNames() method, which returns an IniType instance, and the function's job is to generate the appropriate parameters for that method.

Wait, but the function's name is list_of_file_names, which suggests it's supposed to return a list of file names. However, the docstring says it returns an IniType complex type. That seems conflicting. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-read the problem.

The user says: "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() and return the result. But what parameters does that method take? The function's parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option. So perhaps the function is supposed to pass these parameters to cli.ListOfFileNames(), which then returns the IniType instance.

But the function's name is list_of_file_names, which is confusing because the return type is IniType, not a list of strings. Maybe there's a mistake in the docstring? Or perhaps IniType is a class that contains a list of file names? Or maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names and then wrap them into an IniType object?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to create a list of file names based on the settings directories and the spec option, and then return that list as an IniType. But without knowing the structure of IniType, it's hard to say.

Since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, I need to make some assumptions. Let me think about possible approaches.

First, the function's parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option. The function is supposed to return an IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So perhaps the function is a wrapper around cli.ListOfFileNames(), which takes some parameters. But what parameters? Maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names based on the directories and spec option, and then pass that list to cli.ListOfFileNames().

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate the parameters for cli.ListOfFileNames() using the settings_dirs and spec_option. For example, if cli.ListOfFileNames() requires a list of file names, then the function would generate that list based on the directories and spec option, and then call the method.

But without knowing what cli.ListOfFileNames() does, it's challenging. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with some parameters derived from settings_dirs and spec_option.

Wait, the function's name is list_of_file_names, which suggests that it's supposed to return a list of file names. But the docstring says it returns an IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So maybe the IniType is a class that wraps a list of file names? Or perhaps the function is supposed to create an IniType instance that contains the list of file names.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate a list of file names and then return that list as an IniType. But again, without knowing the structure of IniType, it's hard to proceed.

Since the user hasn't provided more information, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's proceed under the assumption that the function is supposed to generate a list of file names based on the settings directories and the spec option, and then return that list as an IniType instance. Or perhaps the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with the settings_dirs and spec_option as parameters, and return the result.

But the function's name is list_of_file_names, so maybe the actual list is generated and then passed to cli.ListOfFileNames(), which returns an IniType. For example, maybe cli.ListOfFileNames() is a method that takes a list of file names and returns an IniType object. So the function would generate the list of file names, pass them to cli.ListOfFileNames(), and return that.

But how to generate the list of file names from settings_dirs and spec_option? The spec_option could be a parameter that determines which files to include. For example, maybe it's a filter like 'all', 'config', etc.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to collect all files in the settings_dirs that match a certain pattern based on spec_option. For example, if spec_option is 'ini', then collect .ini files.

But without knowing the exact logic, it's hard to code. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says to return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). So perhaps the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with some parameters, and return the result.

But what parameters? The function's parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option. So maybe the function is supposed to pass those parameters to cli.ListOfFileNames(). For example, if cli.ListOfFileNames() is a function that takes settings_dirs and spec_option, then the function would call that.

But the function's name is list_of_file_names, which suggests that it's supposed to return a list of file names. However, the docstring says it returns an IniType. This is confusing. Maybe the IniType is a class that represents a list of file names, and the function is supposed to create an instance of that class.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to generate a list of file names and then return that list as an IniType. But again, without knowing the structure of IniType, it's hard to proceed.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to write code that uses the parameters settings_dirs and spec_option to generate a list of file names, then create an IniType instance with that list, and return it. Or perhaps the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with the settings_dirs and spec_option as parameters.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the function is supposed to generate a list of file names based on the directories and spec option, then return that list as an IniType. For example:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    # generate list of file names
    file_names = generate_files(settings_dirs, spec_option)
    return IniType(file_names)

But without knowing what IniType is, this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with the settings_dirs and spec_option, and return the result. For example:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But the docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()", which suggests that the function is using cli.ListOfFileNames() to create an IniType instance. So perhaps the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with some parameters, and return the result.

But what parameters? The function's parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option, so maybe those are passed to cli.ListOfFileNames(). So the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But then the function's name is list_of_file_names, which might not align with returning an IniType. However, the docstring says to return an IniType, so that's possible.

But without knowing the actual implementation of cli.ListOfFileNames(), it's hard to be certain. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should call cli.ListOfFileNames() with the provided parameters and return the result.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to generate the parameters for cli.ListOfFileNames() based on settings_dirs and spec_option. For example, if cli.ListOfFileNames() requires a list of file names, the function would generate that list using the directories and spec option, then call the method.

But again, without knowing the exact logic, it's challenging. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should be as follows:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But this assumes that cli.ListOfFileNames() is a function that takes settings_dirs and spec_option as parameters and returns an IniType instance. However, the function's name is list_of_file_names, which might not match the purpose. But given the docstring, this seems plausible.

But the user mentioned that they want to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user hasn't provided the actual code to test. So perhaps the user expects that the code should be written with the assumption that cli.ListOfFileNames() exists and takes the parameters.

In any case, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to write the code that calls cli.ListOfFileNames() with the provided parameters, assuming that it returns an IniType instance. The function's name might be misleading, but based on the docstring, that's the intended behavior.

So the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But I should also consider that the user might have intended for the function to generate a list of file names. For example, maybe the function is supposed to collect all files in the settings_dirs that match a certain pattern based on spec_option, then return that list as an IniType. In that case, the code would involve traversing directories and filtering files.

But without knowing the exact logic, it's impossible to code accurately. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring mentions returning an IniType via cli.ListOfFileNames(), so the code should probably call that method.

Therefore, the code is as above. However, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven approach. So I should generate unit tests first. But the user hasn't provided the actual code to test, so perhaps the tests would be based on the function's parameters and expected behavior.

For example, if the function is supposed to return an IniType instance, the tests would check that the function returns an instance of IniType. But without knowing what IniType is, it's hard to write meaningful tests. However, assuming that IniType is a class, the tests could be:

import unittest
from your_module import list_of_file_names

class TestListOfFileNames(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_returns_ini_type(self):
        result = list_of_file_names([], "")
        self.assertIsInstance(result, IniType)

But again, without knowing the actual implementation, this is speculative.

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, the code would be as follows, assuming that cli.ListOfFileNames() is a function that takes settings_dirs and spec_option and returns an IniType instance.
