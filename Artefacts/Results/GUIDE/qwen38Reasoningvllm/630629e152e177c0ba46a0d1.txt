Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function try_retrieve_webfinger_document. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The function takes a handle string and returns an optional string, which I assume is the content of the webfinger document. If it fails, it shouldn't raise an exception, so the function should handle errors gracefully.

First, I should think about how to retrieve a webfinger document. Webfinger uses the format "https://<domain>/well-known/webfinger?resource=<handle>". So the function needs to construct the URL based on the handle. Wait, but the handle might include the domain? Or is the handle just the username part? Hmm, the RFC7033 says that the handle is the resource, so maybe the function should construct the URL by appending the handle to the well-known endpoint. For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", the URL would be "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com".

Wait, the handle is passed as a parameter. So the function should take that handle and construct the URL. But maybe the handle is already in the correct format. So the function's job is to take the handle and make the request to the webfinger endpoint.

So the steps would be:

1. Construct the URL using the handle. The base is "https://<domain>/well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:<handle>". Wait, but how do I get the domain from the handle? Oh, maybe the handle is supposed to be in the format "acct:username@domain", but the function's parameter is just the handle. Wait, the function's parameter is called 'handle', which according to RFC7033 is the resource. So the handle could be something like "acct:user@example.com" or just "user@example.com". Wait, the RFC says that the resource is the handle, which is typically in the form "acct:username@domain".

But maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the username part, and the domain is determined from the handle. Or perhaps the function is supposed to assume that the domain is part of the handle. Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to take the handle as the full resource, like "acct:user@example.com", and then construct the URL as "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com".

But how to extract the domain from the handle? For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", then the domain is example.com. But if the handle is "acct:user@example.com", then the domain is still example.com. So maybe the function should parse the handle to extract the domain, then construct the URL.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to assume that the handle is the username part, and the domain is determined from the handle. Wait, but that's not clear. Maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the full resource, and then the domain is derived from the handle. For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", then the domain is example.com. So the URL would be "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com".

But how to parse the handle? Let's think. The handle is a string, and according to RFC7033, the resource is the handle. So the handle could be in the form "acct:username@domain" or just "username@domain". So the function needs to parse the handle to extract the domain. For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", then the domain is example.com. If the handle is "acct:user@example.com", then the domain is example.com. So the function can split the handle on '@' to get the domain.

Wait, but the handle could be in the form "acct:username@domain" or "username@domain". So the function can split the handle on '@' and take the part after the last '@' as the domain. For example:

handle = "user@example.com" → domain = "example.com"
handle = "acct:user@example.com" → domain = "example.com"

So the function can split the handle into parts. Let me think about that. So the code would be something like:

parts = handle.split('@')
if len(parts) < 2:
    # invalid handle, maybe return None or raise an error? But the function is supposed to not raise, so maybe return None.
else:
    domain = parts[-1]

But wait, the handle could have multiple '@' signs. For example, if the handle is "user@sub.domain@example.com", then the domain would be example.com. So splitting on '@' and taking the last part is correct.

So the code would extract the domain from the handle. Then, construct the URL as "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}".

Wait, but the resource parameter in the webfinger request is the handle. So the URL would be:

https://domain/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:handle

But the handle may already include the 'acct:' prefix. For example, if the handle is "acct:user@example.com", then the resource is "acct:user@example.com".

So the function would construct the URL as:

url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={handle}"

Wait, but the handle could be "user@example.com", so the resource would be "user@example.com". But according to RFC7033, the resource should be in the form "acct:username@domain". So perhaps the function should prepend 'acct:' to the handle if it doesn't already have it. But the function's parameter is called 'handle', which according to the RFC is the resource. So maybe the handle is already in the correct format. For example, the function is called with the handle as "acct:user@example.com", and the URL is constructed as "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com".

But if the handle is "user@example.com", then the resource would be "user@example.com", which is not the correct format. So perhaps the function should prepend 'acct:' to the handle if it doesn't start with 'acct:'.

Wait, but the RFC says that the resource is the handle, which can be in the form of "acct:username@domain" or just "username@domain". So maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the resource, and the URL is constructed as "https://domain/.well-known/webfinger?resource={handle}".

But then, if the handle is "user@example.com", the resource is "user@example.com", which is not the correct format. So perhaps the function should prepend 'acct:' to the handle if it doesn't start with that. But how to determine that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the handle as the username part, and the domain is derived from the handle. For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", then the domain is example.com, and the resource is "acct:user@example.com".

But the function's parameter is called 'handle', which according to the RFC is the resource. So perhaps the handle is already in the correct format. Therefore, the function can extract the domain from the handle, then construct the URL.

So the steps are:

1. Parse the handle to extract the domain. Split on '@' and take the last part.

2. Construct the URL as "https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={handle}".

But wait, if the handle is "acct:user@example.com", then the domain is example.com, and the resource is "acct:user@example.com". So the URL would be correct.

But if the handle is "user@example.com", then the domain is example.com, and the resource is "user@example.com". But according to RFC7033, the resource should be in the form "acct:username@domain". So perhaps the function should prepend 'acct:' to the handle if it doesn't start with that. But how to know? The function's parameter is called 'handle', which is the resource. So maybe the handle is supposed to be in the correct format. But the function's responsibility is to retrieve the webfinger document, not to validate the handle.

So perhaps the function should not validate the handle, but just construct the URL based on the handle. So for example, if the handle is "user@example.com", the URL would be "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=user@example.com".

But that may not be correct according to RFC7033. However, the function's job is to retrieve the document, not to validate the handle. So the function can proceed with constructing the URL as described.

So the next step is to make an HTTP GET request to that URL. The function should handle possible errors, like network issues, invalid URLs, etc., and return None if it fails, or the content of the response if successful.

So the function would need to use the requests library to make the GET request. However, the user may not have requests installed. But since the user is a Python software engineer, it's reasonable to assume that requests is available.

But wait, the function is supposed to not raise exceptions. So any exceptions during the request (like network errors, invalid URLs, etc.) should be caught and the function should return None.

So the code would be:

import requests

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    # Extract domain from handle
    parts = handle.split('@')
    if len(parts) < 2:
        return None  # invalid handle
    domain = parts[-1]
    # Construct URL
    url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={handle}"
    # Make request
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except requests.RequestException:
        return None

Wait, but the handle may not have an '@' sign. For example, if the handle is "user", then splitting on '@' gives a list with one element. So len(parts) is 1, which is less than 2, so return None. That's correct.

But what if the handle is "user@domain"? Then parts is ["user", "domain"], so domain is "domain", and the URL is "https://domain/.well-known/webfinger?resource=user@domain".

But according to RFC7033, the resource should be "acct:username@domain". So perhaps the function should prepend 'acct:' to the handle. But the function's parameter is called 'handle', which is the resource. So if the handle is "user@domain", then the resource is "user@domain", which may not be correct. However, the function's responsibility is to retrieve the document, not to validate the handle. So the function proceeds as is.

But maybe the function should prepend 'acct:' to the handle. For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", then the resource should be "acct:user@example.com". But the function's parameter is called 'handle', which is the resource. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the handle as the username part, and the domain is derived from it. But that's not clear. The function's docstring says that it's supposed to retrieve the webfinger document for the given handle, which is the resource.

Alternatively, perhaps the handle is the username part, and the domain is determined from the handle. For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", then the domain is example.com, and the resource is "acct:user@example.com". So the URL would be "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:user@example.com".

In that case, the function needs to prepend 'acct:' to the handle. But how to know if the handle already has that? For example, if the handle is "acct:user@example.com", then the resource is already correct. But if the handle is "user@example.com", then the resource should be "acct:user@example.com".

So the function should check if the handle starts with 'acct:', and if not, prepend it. But how to handle that? For example:

if not handle.startswith('acct:'):
    handle = 'acct:' + handle

But then, if the handle is already 'acct:user@example.com', it remains the same. So the code would be:

handle = handle if handle.startswith('acct:') else 'acct:' + handle

But this is an assumption. However, according to RFC7033, the resource is the handle, which can be in the form of "acct:username@domain" or just "username@domain". So perhaps the function should prepend 'acct:' if it's not present. But the function's parameter is called 'handle', which is the resource. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the handle as the resource, which may or may not include 'acct:'.

But the function's responsibility is to retrieve the webfinger document. So regardless of the handle's format, it should construct the URL accordingly. So if the handle is "user@example.com", then the resource is "user@example.com", and the URL is "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=user@example.com".

But according to RFC7033, the resource should be in the form of "acct:username@domain". So perhaps the function should prepend 'acct:' to the handle if it doesn't start with that. However, this is an assumption. Since the function's docstring doesn't specify, perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approach, where the handle is the resource as given.

But this could lead to incorrect URLs. For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", the URL would be "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=user@example.com", which may not be correct. However, the function's job is to retrieve the document, not to validate the handle.

So the code would proceed as follows.

Now, the code uses the requests library. So the function makes a GET request to the constructed URL. If the request is successful (status code 200), returns the text. Otherwise, returns None.

But what about other HTTP status codes? For example, 404. The function should return None in that case. The 'raise_for_status()' method will raise an exception if the status code is 4xx or 5xx. So the code catches that exception and returns None.

So the code is:

import requests
from typing import Optional

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    # Extract domain from handle
    parts = handle.split('@')
    if len(parts) < 2:
        return None  # invalid handle
    domain = parts[-1]
    # Construct URL
    url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={handle}"
    # Make request
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except requests.RequestException:
        return None

But wait, the handle could have special characters that need to be URL-encoded. For example, if the handle contains spaces or other characters, they need to be properly encoded. So the 'handle' parameter should be URL-encoded when constructing the URL. For example, if the handle is "user@domain.com", then the resource parameter is "user@domain.com", but if the handle is "user@domain.com?query", then it needs to be encoded as "user%40domain.com%3Fquery".

So the code should URL-encode the handle. So using requests' params or urlencoding.

Alternatively, the code can use the 'urllib.parse' module to encode the handle.

So the code should construct the URL with the handle properly encoded. For example:

from urllib.parse import quote

resource = quote(handle)
url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={resource}"

But wait, the 'resource' parameter in the URL should be the handle as per RFC7033. So if the handle is "user@example.com", then the resource is "user@example.com", which is already properly encoded. However, if the handle contains special characters, they need to be encoded. For example, if the handle is "user@domain.com?query", then the resource should be "user%40domain.com%3Fquery".

So the code should encode the handle using quote.

So modifying the code:

from urllib.parse import quote

...

resource = quote(handle)
url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={resource}"

But then, the handle may already have 'acct:' prefix. For example, if the handle is "acct:user@example.com", then the resource is "acct:user@example.com", which is correct.

So the code would encode the handle properly.

So the updated code would include the quote function.

Another thing: the domain extraction. Suppose the handle is "user@sub.domain@example.com", then splitting on '@' gives ["user", "sub.domain", "example.com"], so the domain is "example.com". That's correct.

Now, the code should also handle cases where the handle is empty or invalid. For example, if the handle is empty, then parts is ["", ...], but len(parts) is 1, so returns None.

So the code seems to handle that.

Now, the unit tests. The user mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. However, the tips mention to generate unit tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code, not the tests. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips suggest generating tests first.

But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips suggest generating tests first. However, the user may have made a mistake in the tips. But given the user's instruction, I should generate the code.

But the user's original message says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the answer should be the code, not the tests. However, the tips mention to follow TDD, but perhaps that's just a suggestion. Since the user says to output only the code, I should proceed to generate the code.

So the code is as above, with the URL encoding.

But wait, the code uses 'requests' and 'urllib.parse.quote'. Also, the function returns Optional[str], so need to import Optional from typing.

So the code would be:

import requests
from urllib.parse import quote
from typing import Optional

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. Does not raise if it fails.
    """
    parts = handle.split('@')
    if len(parts) < 2:
        return None
    domain = parts[-1]
    resource = quote(handle)
    url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource={resource}"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except requests.RequestException:
        return None

But wait, what if the domain is invalid? For example, if the domain is "example.com", but the URL is "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=..." which is correct. However, the function doesn't validate the domain. It just uses whatever is in the handle.

Another thing: the handle could be something like "user@domain", and the domain is "domain", so the URL is "https://domain/.well-known/webfinger?resource=user@domain".

But according to RFC7033, the webfinger resource is the handle, which can be in the form of "acct:username@domain" or "username@domain". So the code is correct.

Now, testing this code. For example, if the handle is "user@example.com", the URL is "https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=user%40example.com".

But the actual webfinger endpoint may require the resource to be in the form "acct:username@domain". So in that case, the code would not construct the correct URL. So perhaps the function should prepend 'acct:' to the handle if it doesn't start with that. But again, this is an assumption.

But according to the RFC, the resource is the handle. So if the handle is "user@example.com", then the resource is "user@example.com". However, the webfinger endpoint may expect the resource to be in the form "acct:username@domain". So the code may not work correctly. But since the function's responsibility is to retrieve the document based on the given handle, which is the resource, the code is correct as per the function's specification.

Therefore, the code is as written.
