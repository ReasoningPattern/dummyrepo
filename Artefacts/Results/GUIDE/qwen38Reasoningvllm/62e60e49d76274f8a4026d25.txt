Okay, I need to generate Python code for the unit_of_work function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. So, the function unit_of_work is a decorator factory that takes metadata and timeout parameters and returns a decorator.

First, I should recall how decorators work in Python. A decorator is a function that wraps another function. So, the unit_of_work function is likely going to return a decorator that can be applied to other functions. The decorator should have attributes metadata and timeout, which are set based on the parameters passed to unit_of_work.

Wait, the function unit_of_work itself is supposed to return a decorator. So, when someone uses @unit_of_work(metadata=..., timeout=...), that's applying the decorator. The decorator needs to have metadata and timeout attributes. So, perhaps the decorator is a class or a function that holds these attributes.

Let me think about the structure. The unit_of_work function takes metadata and timeout, then returns a decorator. Let's consider that the decorator could be a function that wraps the target function and perhaps stores the metadata and timeout. But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes, so maybe the decorator is an object (like a class instance) that has those attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a function that, when called, applies the metadata and timeout to the wrapped function. But how to make the decorator have those attributes? Maybe the decorator is a class that has __call__ method, and the metadata and timeout are stored as instance variables.

Wait, perhaps the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that is a function which, when called, returns another function that wraps the original function. But the decorator itself needs to have metadata and timeout attributes. So maybe the decorator is a class instance that has those attributes.

Let me think of an example. Suppose I have:

@unit_of_work(metadata="test", timeout=10)
def my_function():
    pass

In this case, the decorator returned by unit_of_work is applied to my_function. The decorator should have metadata and timeout attributes. So, perhaps the decorator is a class that has those attributes. For example, the decorator could be an instance of a class that has __call__ method, and the metadata and timeout are stored as instance variables.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper function, and the wrapper function has those attributes. But that's less likely. The docstring says the decorator has those attributes, so it's more likely that the decorator itself is an object with those attributes.

So, perhaps the unit_of_work function returns a class instance. Let me think of how to structure that.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The unit_of_work function takes metadata and timeout parameters. These are optional, so default values might be None.

2. It returns a decorator. The decorator is an object that has metadata and timeout attributes. So, perhaps the decorator is a class instance.

So, the unit_of_work function could return an instance of a class that has __call__ method, and the metadata and timeout are stored as instance variables.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a function that wraps the target function and stores the metadata and timeout. But then, how to make the decorator have those attributes? Maybe the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a wrapper function, and the wrapper function has those attributes. But that's not the same as the decorator itself having them.

Wait, the docstring says "Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes." So, the decorator (the object returned by unit_of_work) has those attributes. So, perhaps the decorator is a class that has those attributes. For example:

class Decorator:
    def __init__(self, metadata, timeout):
        self.metadata = metadata
        self.timeout = timeout

    def __call__(self, func):
        # wrap func and return the wrapped function
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # do something with metadata and timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

Then, unit_of_work would return an instance of this Decorator class. But wait, the unit_of_work function is supposed to return the decorator, which is an instance of Decorator. So, when you call unit_of_work(metadata=..., timeout=...), it returns an instance of Decorator, which when called with a function, returns the wrapper.

But in that case, the unit_of_work function would be a factory function that creates instances of Decorator. So, the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    class Decorator:
        def __init__(self, metadata, timeout):
            self.metadata = metadata
            self.timeout = timeout
        def __call__(self, func):
            # wrap func
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                # maybe do something with metadata and timeout
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            return wrapper
    return Decorator(metadata, timeout)

But wait, the Decorator class is defined inside the unit_of_work function. So, each call to unit_of_work would create a new Decorator class. But that's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the Decorator is a class that is defined once, and the unit_of_work function returns an instance of it.

Alternatively, perhaps the decorator is a function that takes the metadata and timeout, and when applied to a function, stores them. But how to make the decorator have those attributes. Maybe the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper function, and the wrapper function has attributes. But that's not what the docstring says.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes. But again, the docstring says the decorator (the object returned by unit_of_work) has those attributes.

Hmm. Let me think again. The function unit_of_work is supposed to return a decorator. The decorator is an object that has metadata and timeout attributes. So, the decorator is an object (like a class instance) that has those attributes. So, perhaps the unit_of_work function returns an instance of a class that has those attributes, and when called, applies the decorator to the function.

So, the code could be structured as follows:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    class Decorator:
        def __init__(self, metadata, timeout):
            self.metadata = metadata
            self.timeout = timeout
        def __call__(self, func):
            # wrap func
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                # maybe do something with metadata and timeout
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            return wrapper
    return Decorator(metadata, timeout)

But then, when you use @unit_of_work(...), it's equivalent to calling the Decorator instance with the function. So, the Decorator instance is the decorator, and it has metadata and timeout attributes. That seems to fit the docstring.

But perhaps the Decorator class is not needed. Maybe the unit_of_work function returns a function that, when called, returns a wrapper function, and the wrapper function has metadata and timeout as attributes. But that would not make the decorator itself have those attributes. So, perhaps the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a wrapper function, and the wrapper function has those attributes. But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes, not the wrapper.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes. But again, that's not the same as the decorator itself having those attributes.

Wait, perhaps the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes. But the decorator itself (the function) doesn't have those attributes. So, that doesn't fit the docstring.

So, going back to the initial approach, the unit_of_work function returns an instance of a Decorator class, which has metadata and timeout attributes. When that instance is called with a function, it returns the wrapped function. That seems to fit.

So, the code would be as I outlined before. Let me test this logic.

For example:

@unit_of_work(metadata="test", timeout=10)
def my_func():
    pass

In this case, the Decorator instance is created with metadata="test" and timeout=10. Then, when the decorator is called with my_func, it returns the wrapper function. The Decorator instance has metadata and timeout attributes.

Yes, that seems to fit. So the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    class Decorator:
        def __init__(self, metadata, timeout):
            self.metadata = metadata
            self.timeout = timeout
        def __call__(self, func):
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            return wrapper
    return Decorator(metadata, timeout)

But wait, the wrapper function doesn't use the metadata or timeout. So, perhaps the actual decorator does something with them. But the problem statement doesn't specify what the decorator does, just that it has those attributes. So, maybe the actual implementation is left to the user, and the unit_of_work function just sets up the decorator with those attributes.

So, this code would satisfy the docstring. The unit_of_work function returns a decorator (an instance of Decorator) with metadata and timeout attributes.

But perhaps the Decorator class is not necessary. Maybe the unit_of_work function returns a function that, when called, returns a wrapper function, and the wrapper function has metadata and timeout as attributes. But then, the decorator itself (the function) doesn't have those attributes. So that's not matching the docstring.

Alternatively, perhaps the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes. But again, the decorator itself (the function) doesn't have them. So, the docstring says the decorator has those attributes, not the wrapper.

Therefore, the initial approach with the Decorator class is the way to go.

Now, considering the test-driven development approach. The user wants me to generate comprehensive unit tests first. But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. However, the tips mention to follow TDD, first generating tests before code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code, not the tests. Wait, the user says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the user's main request is to generate the code. But perhaps the user wants the code that implements the function, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code, not the tests. So perhaps the tests are just part of the thinking process, but the final output is only the code.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So, I need to write the code for the unit_of_work function as per the docstring.

So, the code would be as I outlined before. Let me write that.

But wait, maybe the decorator is supposed to be a function that returns a wrapper function, and the wrapper function has the metadata and timeout as attributes. But the docstring says the decorator has those attributes. So perhaps the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a function that has those attributes. But then, the decorator itself (the function) doesn't have them. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the decorator is a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes. For example:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # do something
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        wrapper.metadata = metadata
        wrapper.timeout = timeout
        return wrapper
    return decorator

In this case, the decorator function (returned by unit_of_work) has the metadata and timeout as attributes of the wrapper function. But the decorator function itself (the one returned by unit_of_work) doesn't have those attributes. So, this approach would not satisfy the docstring, which says the decorator has those attributes.

So, the initial approach with the Decorator class seems better.

But perhaps the user wants the decorator to be a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes. So, the unit_of_work function returns a decorator function, which has those attributes. How to do that?

Wait, the decorator function is the one that is returned by unit_of_work. So, for example:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # do something
        return wrapper
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator

In this case, the decorator function (returned by unit_of_work) has metadata and timeout as attributes. Then, when you apply @unit_of_work(...), the decorator is called with the function, and the decorator has those attributes.

Yes, this would satisfy the docstring. Because the decorator (the function returned by unit_of_work) has metadata and timeout attributes.

So, this approach would be better. Let me think.

In this case, the unit_of_work function returns a decorator function (decorator) that has metadata and timeout as attributes. The decorator function is then called with the target function, and returns the wrapper function.

So, the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # maybe do something with metadata and timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator

This way, the decorator function (returned by unit_of_work) has metadata and timeout attributes. This seems to fit the docstring.

Yes, this is a more straightforward approach. The decorator function is returned by unit_of_work, and it has the metadata and timeout attributes. So, when you use @unit_of_work(...), the decorator is applied to the function, and the decorator has those attributes.

This seems to be the correct approach. So, the code would be as above.

Now, let me test this logic. For example:

@unit_of_work(metadata="test", timeout=10)
def my_func():
    pass

The decorator is the function returned by unit_of_work, which has metadata and timeout attributes. So, decorator.metadata is "test", decorator.timeout is 10. The decorator is then called with my_func, returning the wrapper function.

Yes, this fits the docstring.

So, this code should be the correct implementation.

Now, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. So, this code satisfies that.

Therefore, the final code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    decorator.metadata = metadata
    decorator.timeout = timeout
    return decorator

But wait, the decorator function is assigned metadata and timeout as attributes. So, when the decorator is called with a function, it returns the wrapper. The wrapper doesn't have those attributes, but the decorator function does.

Yes, this matches the docstring.

So, this should be the correct code.
