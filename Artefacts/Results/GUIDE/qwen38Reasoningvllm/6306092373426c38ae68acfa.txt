Okay, I need to generate Python code for the get_spec_defaults method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so first I should think about what tests would be necessary.

The function's docstring says it resolves arguments' values from spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). So the method is probably supposed to call another method, _get_defaults, which handles the actual logic of retrieving default values. But the user hasn't provided the implementation for _get_defaults, so I need to assume that it's already defined somewhere else in the class.

Wait, the user is asking for the code for get_spec_defaults. So the actual code for this method would likely be straightforward. Let me think about what the method should do. The docstring mentions resolving arguments' values from spec and other sources, so maybe the method is supposed to return the default values by calling self._get_defaults().

But what's the return type? The method's name suggests it returns a dictionary of default values. So the code might look like:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the method needs to handle some processing or merging of defaults from different sources. However, the docstring says it uses self._get_defaults(), so the actual implementation might just delegate to that method.

But since the user hasn't provided the _get_defaults method, I need to make sure that the code for get_spec_defaults is correct. Let me think about possible test cases.

For test-driven development, I should write tests that check if get_spec_defaults returns the expected defaults. For example, if _get_defaults returns a certain dictionary, then get_spec_defaults should return that same dictionary.

But since the user wants the code first, maybe I should proceed to write the code for get_spec_defaults, assuming that _get_defaults is already implemented.

So the code would be as simple as returning the result of self._get_defaults(). But maybe there's a need to handle exceptions or ensure that _get_defaults is called properly. However, without more information, it's safe to assume that the method is just a wrapper.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """
    Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()
    """
    return self._get_defaults()

But wait, maybe the method is supposed to do more. For example, maybe it's supposed to merge defaults from different sources. However, the docstring says it uses self._get_defaults(), so the actual logic is in that method. Therefore, the get_spec_defaults method is just a facade.

So the code is straightforward. Now, considering the test cases. Let's imagine that _get_defaults returns a dictionary. The test would check that get_spec_defaults returns that dictionary.

But since the user asked for the code first, I should focus on writing the code. The user also mentioned to output only the code in Python markdown format. So the answer should be the code for get_spec_defaults, which is as simple as returning self._get_defaults().

But maybe there's a need to handle cases where _get_defaults is not implemented. However, that's beyond the scope here. The user probably expects the code to call self._get_defaults() and return its result.

So the final code is as I thought.
