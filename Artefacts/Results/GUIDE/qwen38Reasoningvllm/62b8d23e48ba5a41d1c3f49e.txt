Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says it should find, remove, and return a random (key, value) pair using __choice in the class. Wait, the user mentioned that the method uses __choice, but in Python, the __choice__ method is part of the collections.abc.Sequence abstract base class, which allows for random selection. However, the standard dict in Python doesn't have a __choice__ method. Hmm, maybe the user is referring to a custom class that has a __choice__ method, and the popitem method should use that.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so maybe the class has a __choice__ method that selects a random key. But the standard Python dict doesn't have that. So perhaps the user is creating a custom dictionary-like class that has this functionality. The popitem method needs to use the __choice__ method to select a random key, then remove and return that key-value pair.

Wait, the docstring says "via __choice in the class". So maybe the class has a __choice__ method that returns a random key. So the popitem method would call that __choice__ method to get the key, then pop it from the dictionary.

But in Python, the standard dict has a popitem method that removes and returns a (key, value) pair, but it's not random. However, in Python 3.7+, the insertion order is preserved, but popitem() removes and returns the last inserted item. So maybe the user is creating a custom class that extends dict and adds a popitem method that uses a __choice__ method to select a random key.

So the steps for the popitem method would be:

1. Use the __choice__ method of the class to get a random key.
2. Remove that key from the dictionary.
3. Return the (key, value) pair.

But wait, the __choice__ method is part of the Sequence ABC. So maybe the class is implementing __choice__ as part of a custom sequence. However, for a dictionary, the keys are not in a sequence. So perhaps the user is using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the __choice__ method is a helper method in the class that selects a random key from the dictionary.

So, the code for the popitem method would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

But then, the __choice__ method needs to be defined in the class. However, the user hasn't provided that. So the code for popitem would rely on the presence of __choice__ method in the class.

But the user's function signature is for the popitem method. So the code should be written assuming that the class has a __choice__ method that returns a random key.

But wait, in Python, the __choice__ method is part of the Sequence ABC. So if the class is a subclass of Sequence, then it can have a __choice__ method. However, a dictionary isn't a sequence. So maybe the user is creating a custom class that is a sequence of keys, and the __choice__ method selects a random key.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant to refer to the __random__ method or something else. But given the information, I have to proceed with the assumption that the class has a __choice__ method that returns a random key.

So, the code for popitem would be as follows. Also, the user mentioned test-driven development, so I should generate unit tests first. But the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. Wait, the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So maybe the user wants the code for the popitem method, not the tests. But the tips are just guidance. Let me recheck the original problem.

The user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." The tips mention TDD approach, but perhaps that's just for the assistant's thinking process. The actual answer should be the code for the popitem method.

So, the code for the popitem method would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

But wait, in Python, the __choice__ method is part of the Sequence ABC. So if the class is a subclass of Sequence, then it can have __choice__. However, if the class is a dictionary, then it's not a sequence. So perhaps the user is creating a custom class that is a sequence of keys, and the __choice__ method selects a random key. But that's a bit unclear. However, given the function signature and docstring, the code would be as above.

But perhaps the __choice__ method is supposed to be called on the class, not the instance. Wait, the docstring says "via __choice in the class", so maybe it's a class method. But the code would need to call self.__class__.__choice__ or something similar. But that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the __choice__ is a method of the class, and the popitem method uses it.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use the __choice__ method from the collections.abc.Sequence, but that's not directly applicable. So perhaps the code is as written, assuming that the class has a __choice__ method that returns a random key.

Another possibility is that the user made a mistake and meant to use the random module. But given the information, I'll proceed with the code that uses self.__choice__.

So the code for the popitem method is as above. Now, the user might also need to ensure that the class has the __choice__ method. But since the problem is only about the popitem method, the code is as written.

But wait, in Python, the __choice__ method is part of the Sequence ABC, so if the class is a subclass of Sequence, then it must implement __choice__. However, for a dictionary, that's not the case. So perhaps the user is creating a custom class that is a sequence of keys, and the __choice__ method returns a random key. But that's a bit of a stretch. However, given the problem statement, the code would be as written.

So the final code is:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

But I need to make sure that the __choice__ method is available. However, the user hasn't provided that, so the code assumes that the class has this method.

Another thing to consider: if the class is a dictionary, then the __choice__ method would need to select a random key. But in that case, perhaps the __choice__ method is a helper method that returns a random key. So the code would work as intended.

Therefore, the code for the popitem method is as above.
