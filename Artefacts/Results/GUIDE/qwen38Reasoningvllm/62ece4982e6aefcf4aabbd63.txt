Okay, I need to create a Python function called is_none_string that checks if a given value is a string that represents "None". Let me think about the requirements.

The function should take any type of value and return a boolean. The docstring says that it returns True if the type of val is a string and the lowercase version of val equals 'none'. Otherwise, it returns False.

So first, I need to check if the input is a string. Then, convert it to lowercase and compare to 'none'. But wait, what about cases where the input is not a string? Like if someone passes an integer, it should return False.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Check if the type of val is str. If not, return False.
2. Convert val to lowercase and check if it's equal to 'none'.

Wait, but what about leading or trailing whitespaces? For example, if the input is ' None ' (with spaces), converting to lowercase would be ' none ', which isn't equal to 'none'. So the function should return False in that case. So the check is exact, no trimming.

So the code would be something like:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

Wait, but what if val is a string that's empty? Like ''. Then val.lower() would be '', which isn't 'none', so it's handled correctly.

Testing some cases:
- Input 'none' → True
- Input 'NONE' → True (because lower())
- Input 'None' → True
- Input 'non' → False
- Input 123 → False
- Input None → False (since it's not a string)
- Input 'none ' (with space) → False

That seems correct.

Now, the user mentioned to follow test-driven development. So I should generate unit tests first. Let me think about possible test cases.

Test cases for is_none_string:

1. Test when val is 'none' → True
2. Test when val is 'NONE' → True
3. Test when val is 'None' → True
4. Test when val is 'non' → False
5. Test when val is not a string (e.g., 123, None, True) → False
6. Test when val is an empty string → False
7. Test when val is 'none ' (with trailing space) → False
8. Test when val is 'NONE' but with leading/trailing spaces → False
9. Test when val is a string that's exactly 'none' → True

So the tests would cover these scenarios.

Now, writing the code. The function is straightforward. But I need to make sure that the type check is done first to avoid errors. For example, if val is not a string, val.lower() would throw an error. So the code checks isinstance(val, str) first.

So the code should be:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a string represents a None value.
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of val is string and the lowercase of val is equal to 'none', otherwise return False
    """
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

Wait, but the docstring says "the type of val is string" which is the same as isinstance(val, str). So that's correct.

Now, writing the unit tests. Using assert statements or a testing framework like unittest. But since the user said to generate comprehensive unit tests, perhaps using assert statements for simplicity.

But the user wants the code generated, so maybe the tests are part of the code. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. But the tips mention to first generate unit tests. However, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps the code includes the function and the tests?

Wait, the original problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But the tips say to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

But the user might expect that the code includes both the function and the tests. However, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is just the function. But the tips suggest generating tests first. However, the user says to output only the code generated. Maybe the code includes the tests?

But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the code is just the function. However, the user's tips suggest that the assistant should generate tests first. But the final output is only the code generated. So perhaps the code includes the tests?

But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which implies the function itself. However, the tips mention test-driven development, so perhaps the code includes the tests. But the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are separate. But the user's instruction is a bit conflicting.

Wait, looking back: the user says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code is the function. But the tips say to generate unit tests first. However, the user might expect that the code includes the tests. But the original problem might be expecting just the function. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the function itself.

But perhaps the user wants the code to include the tests. However, the initial instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are part of the code. But how to structure that?

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the function and the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the function. The tests are part of the code generated as part of the TDD approach. So perhaps the code includes both the function and the tests.

But the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps the code includes the function and the tests. But how to present that?

Alternatively, maybe the user expects only the function. But given the tips, perhaps the code should include the tests. But I need to check the original problem again.

The original problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code is the function. However, the tips suggest generating tests first. But the user might be expecting that the code includes the tests. But perhaps the user is expecting only the function. But since the tips mention TDD, perhaps the code includes the tests.

But the user's example shows that the code is the function. However, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is the function. But the user's tips suggest generating tests first, which would be part of the code. However, the user says to output only the code generated. So maybe the code includes the tests. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the function and the tests. But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the function. So perhaps the code is just the function. However, the tips say to generate tests first. But the user might not want the tests in the output. This is a bit confusing.

But given the initial instruction, I think the code should be the function. However, since the user mentioned TDD, perhaps the code includes the tests. But the user says to output only the code generated. So maybe the code includes the function and the tests. But how to structure that?

In any case, the user's main request is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the function. So I'll proceed to write the function. However, the tips suggest generating tests first. But the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is just the function.

So the final code is the function as described.
