Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do. The docstring says it removes the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key-value tuple. 

Wait, this sounds familiar. Oh right, in Python's dict, the popitem() method was changed in Python 3.7 to remove and return an arbitrary (key, value) pair. But before that, it removed the last inserted item. Wait, the docstring here says "first inserted key"—so maybe this is for a data structure that maintains insertion order, like a custom dictionary or a list-like structure?

Wait, the user hasn't specified the class this method belongs to. The function is part of a class (since it's using 'self'). But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the rest of the class definition. So I need to make assumptions here. 

But the user is asking for the code for the popitem method. Let's think about how to implement this. The method should remove the first inserted key-value pair and return it as a tuple. But how do I track the first inserted key? 

If this is for a dictionary-like structure that maintains insertion order, perhaps the class has an underlying data structure that keeps track of insertion order. For example, maybe the class uses a list to track the order of insertion and a dictionary for the key-value pairs. 

Alternatively, maybe the class is a list where each element is a key-value pair, and the first inserted is the first element. But the method is called popitem, which is similar to dict's popitem. 

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the class structure. So perhaps the user expects a standard implementation, but given the docstring, maybe they want a custom implementation. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a data structure that maintains insertion order, like OrderedDict from Python's collections. However, in Python 3.7, the standard dict maintains insertion order. So perhaps the method is intended to mimic the behavior of dict.popitem(), which removes and returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair. But the docstring here says "first inserted key"—so maybe the user is referring to a different behavior. 

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the Python documentation. In Python 3.7+, the dict maintains insertion order, and dict.popitem() removes and returns the last inserted item. But the docstring here says "first inserted key"—so maybe the user wants to remove the first inserted item, which would be the first element in the insertion order. 

But how to track that? For example, if the class has a list that keeps track of the insertion order, then the first item is the first inserted. So, the popitem method would remove the first element from that list and return it. 

But without knowing the class structure, it's challenging. However, since the user is asking for code for the popitem method, perhaps they expect a standard implementation. But given that the docstring says "first inserted key", maybe the method is intended to remove the first inserted item. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant the last inserted key. But I have to follow the docstring as given. 

Assuming that the class maintains insertion order, and the popitem method should remove the first inserted key-value pair. So, for example, if the class has a list that tracks insertion order, then the first element in the list is the first inserted. 

But how to implement this? Let's think of a possible class structure. Suppose the class has a dictionary for the key-value pairs and a list that tracks insertion order. Then, when a key is inserted, it's added to the list. When popitem is called, we remove the first element from the list, get the key from it, and then delete the entry from the dictionary. 

But then, if the key is already present, maybe we need to handle that. Wait, but the method is supposed to remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key. So perhaps the first inserted key is the one that was added first, regardless of whether it's still present. 

Wait, but if the key was deleted earlier, then the first inserted key might not be present. But the method is supposed to remove the first inserted key. So maybe the class tracks all inserted keys, even if they are deleted. Or perhaps the method removes the first key that was inserted, regardless of whether it's still present. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the user expects a standard implementation, but given the docstring, perhaps they want to mimic the behavior of dict.popitem(), which removes and returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair. However, the docstring says "first inserted key", which is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a data structure where the first inserted key is the one that should be removed. For example, a queue-like structure. 

But without more context, I need to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the assumption that the class maintains insertion order, and the popitem method removes the first inserted key-value pair. 

So, for example, if the class has an insertion_order list that keeps track of the order in which keys were inserted. Then, the first element in insertion_order is the first inserted key. 

So, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.insertion_order:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    key = self.insertion_order[0]
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    self.insertion_order.pop(0)
    return (key, value)

But this would be O(n) time complexity because popping from the front of a list is O(n). 

Alternatively, if the insertion_order is a deque, then popping from the front is O(1). 

But again, without knowing the class structure, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe the class is a list of key-value pairs, and the first element is the first inserted. Then, popitem would remove the first element and return it. 

But the method is called popitem, which is similar to dict's popitem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a standard dict, but the docstring is incorrect. 

But given the docstring, I need to proceed. 

Another approach: perhaps the method is supposed to remove and return the first key-value pair in the order they were inserted, which for a standard dict in Python 3.7+ is the first inserted. However, the standard dict.popitem() removes the last inserted item. 

So, perhaps the user wants a method that removes the first inserted item. 

In that case, for a standard dict, how would that be done? Well, you can't directly do that, but if the class maintains insertion order, then the code would need to track that. 

But since the user hasn't provided the class structure, perhaps they expect a standard implementation. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using a data structure that's a list, and each element is a tuple of (key, value), and the first element is the first inserted. Then, popitem would remove the first element and return it. 

But the method is called popitem, which is more like a dictionary method. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a custom dictionary-like class that maintains insertion order. 

In that case, the code would need to track insertion order. 

But since the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, perhaps I should proceed with writing the code that assumes that the class has a way to track insertion order. 

But how to implement this? 

Let me think of a possible class structure. Suppose the class has a dictionary and a list that tracks insertion order. 

For example:

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
        self.insertion_order = []

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if key in self.data:
            # Maybe handle updating, but the problem is about popitem
            # For simplicity, let's assume that setting a key again doesn't affect insertion order
            # Or maybe we need to handle it differently
            # But for the purpose of popitem, perhaps the insertion order is only for keys that are inserted for the first time
            # So, if the key is already present, we don't add it to insertion_order again
            # But this is getting complicated
            # For the sake of this problem, let's assume that insertion_order contains all keys in insertion order, even if they are updated
            # Or perhaps not. This is unclear.

But given that the problem is about popitem, which removes the first inserted key, perhaps the insertion_order list contains all keys in the order they were inserted, and when a key is inserted, it's added to the list. 

So, for the popitem method, we need to remove the first element from insertion_order, get its value from data, delete it from data, and return the tuple. 

But in this case, if the key was deleted earlier, then the insertion_order list might have entries that are no longer in the data. So, perhaps the insertion_order list should only contain keys that are currently in the data. 

But this complicates things. 

Alternatively, perhaps the insertion_order list contains all keys ever inserted, even if they are deleted. But then, when a key is deleted, it's still in insertion_order. 

But then, when we call popitem, we need to find the first key in insertion_order that is still present in data. 

This is getting too complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a standard dict, and the docstring is incorrect. For example, in Python 3.7+, dict.popitem() removes and returns the last inserted item. So maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring. 

But since the user provided the docstring, I have to follow it. 

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to write code that removes and returns the first key-value pair in the order they were inserted, assuming that the class maintains insertion order. 

But how to implement that? 

Let me think of a possible implementation. 

Assuming that the class has a list called 'items' that stores the key-value pairs in insertion order. Then, popitem would remove the first element from this list and return it. 

But then, the class would need to manage this list. 

Alternatively, if the class is a list of tuples, then popitem would pop the first element. 

But the method is called popitem, which is more like a dictionary method. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a data structure that's a list, and the popitem method removes the first element. 

But the method's name is popitem, which is more like a dictionary's popitem. 

Given all this confusion, perhaps the user intended to have a standard dict.popitem() method, but the docstring says "first inserted key". 

In that case, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the correct behavior is to remove the last inserted key. 

But since the user provided the docstring, I need to proceed with that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is using a data structure that's a list, and the popitem method removes the first element. 

But without knowing the class structure, it's hard to proceed. 

Perhaps the user is expecting a standard implementation of popitem for a dictionary-like class that maintains insertion order. 

In that case, the code would need to track insertion order. 

Let me proceed with writing code that assumes the class has a list called 'insertion_order' that tracks the order of insertion, and a dictionary called 'data' that holds the key-value pairs. 

So, the popitem method would:

1. Check if the insertion_order is empty. If so, raise KeyError.
2. Get the first key from insertion_order.
3. Get the value from data.
4. Remove the key from data.
5. Remove the key from insertion_order.
6. Return the tuple (key, value).

But this would require that the insertion_order list contains all keys in insertion order, and that when a key is removed, it's also removed from insertion_order. 

But this approach would have O(n) time complexity for popping from the front of the list. 

Alternatively, using a deque for insertion_order would allow O(1) time for popping from the front. 

So, the code would be:

from collections import deque

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}
        self.insertion_order = deque()

    def popitem(self):
        if not self.insertion_order:
            raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
        key = self.insertion_order.popleft()
        value = self.data[key]
        del self.data[key]
        return (key, value)

But this assumes that the insertion_order deque contains all keys in insertion order. 

But how is the insertion_order maintained when keys are added? For example, when a key is added via __setitem__, it should be added to insertion_order. 

But the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, so I can't write that. 

However, the user is only asking for the popitem method. So, given that, perhaps the code for popitem is as above. 

But since the user hasn't provided the class structure, perhaps they expect a different approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a standard dict, and the docstring is incorrect. 

In that case, the code would be similar to the standard dict.popitem(), which removes and returns the last inserted item. 

But the docstring says "first inserted key". 

This is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a data structure where the first inserted key is the one that should be removed, and the method is supposed to return that. 

But without knowing the class structure, it's impossible to write accurate code. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the class maintains insertion order, and the popitem method removes the first inserted key. 

Thus, the code would be as I outlined earlier. 

But since the user hasn't provided the class structure, perhaps the code should be written in a way that assumes that the class has a way to track insertion order. 

But since the user is asking for the code for the popitem method, and not the entire class, I'll proceed with writing the code that assumes the class has a list or deque that tracks insertion order. 

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self.insertion_order:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    key = self.insertion_order[0]
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    self.insertion_order.pop(0)
    return (key, value)

But this would be O(n) time for popping from the front of a list. 

Alternatively, using a deque:

from collections import deque

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self.insertion_order:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    key = self.insertion_order.popleft()
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    return (key, value)

But again, this requires that the class has an insertion_order attribute. 

Since the user hasn't provided the class structure, I can't be sure. 

However, the user is asking for the code for the popitem method, so I'll proceed with writing the code that assumes the class has an insertion_order attribute, which is a deque, and a data attribute which is a dictionary. 

Thus, the code would be:

from collections import deque

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self.insertion_order:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    key = self.insertion_order.popleft()
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    return (key, value)

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. 

However, the user might not have provided the rest of the class, so this code would be part of a larger class. 

But since the user is asking for the code for the popitem method, this is acceptable. 

But the user might also expect that the method is part of a standard data structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a list, and the popitem method removes the first element. 

But the method is called popitem, which is more like a dictionary's method. 

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code that assumes the class has an insertion_order deque and a data dictionary, and implements the popitem method as described.
