Okay, I need to write a Python function called size_to_bytes that converts a human-readable file size string into bytes. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a string like '500K' and returns the equivalent in bytes. The common units are K (kilobytes), M (megabytes), G (gigabytes), etc. But wait, what's the exact conversion? Like, is 1K 1024 bytes or 1000? Hmm, the problem statement doesn't specify, but maybe I should assume the standard SI units where K is 1000, M is 1,000,000, etc. Or maybe it's using binary prefixes like KiB (1024), MiB (1,048,576), etc. But the examples given in the docstring use '500K', which might imply the SI units. Wait, but in programming, sometimes K is 1024. Hmm. Maybe I should check common conventions. For example, in Python's os.path.getsize, it's in bytes, but when converting from human-readable, it's often using 1024 for K, M, etc. But the problem says 'human readable', which could be either. However, the docstring example is '500K', which could be 500 * 1000 or 500 * 1024. 

Wait, perhaps the function should handle both cases? Or maybe the problem expects the standard SI units. Let me think. The problem says 'human readable file size', which is often in SI units. For example, 1KB is 1000 bytes, 1MB is 1,000,000 bytes, etc. But sometimes, especially in computing, K is 1024. So maybe the function should handle both possibilities? Or maybe the problem expects the binary prefixes. 

Wait, maybe the function should handle the common cases. Let me check the problem again. The example given is '500K' which is probably 500 * 1024 bytes. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the function should accept units like 'K', 'M', 'G' and multiply by 1000 each time. 

Alternatively, maybe the function should handle both, but the problem doesn't specify. Since the problem says 'human readable', perhaps the standard is to use 1000 for K, M, G. But I'm not certain. 

Wait, maybe the function should handle the following units: K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y. Each representing 10^3, 10^6, etc. So for example, '500K' would be 500 * 10^3 = 500,000 bytes. But if it's '500KiB', then it's 500 * 1024. But the problem's example is '500K', so maybe the function should use the SI units. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function should use the binary prefixes. For example, K is 1024, M is 1024^2, etc. 

This is a bit ambiguous. However, perhaps the problem expects the standard SI units. But I need to make sure. Let me think about how to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the function should handle both cases. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention that. So perhaps I should proceed with the standard SI units. 

So, the steps for the function would be:

1. Parse the string to extract the numeric part and the unit. For example, '500K' would have 500 as the number and 'K' as the unit.

2. Convert the unit to the corresponding multiplier. For example, K is 1000, M is 1,000,000, etc.

3. Multiply the number by the multiplier to get bytes.

But how to handle cases where the unit is not present? Like '123' would be 123 bytes. Also, what about units like 'KB' (kilobytes) versus 'K'?

Wait, the problem says the input is a string like '500K', so perhaps the unit is a single character. So the function needs to parse the string into a number and a unit. 

So, the code would need to:

- Check if the string ends with a unit (K, M, G, etc.)

- Extract the number and the unit.

- Multiply the number by the appropriate factor based on the unit.

So, first, the code can split the string into the numeric part and the unit. For example, using regular expressions. 

Let me think about possible patterns. The string can be something like '123', '123K', '123M', etc. So a regex that matches a number followed by an optional unit. 

So, the regex could be something like ^(\d+)([KMGTPEZY])?$ 

Wait, but the unit could be uppercase or lowercase? Probably, the function should handle both, but the problem's example uses uppercase. So perhaps the function should normalize the unit to uppercase. 

So, the steps:

- Use a regex to match the number and unit. For example, match the entire string against a pattern that captures the number and the unit.

- If there's no unit, return the number as is.

- If there's a unit, multiply by the corresponding factor.

Now, the factors. Let's define the units and their multipliers. For example:

- K: 10^3 (1000)
- M: 10^6 (1,000,000)
- G: 10^9 (1,000,000,000)
- T: 10^12 (1,000,000,000,000)
- P: 10^15
- E: 10^18
- Z: 10^21
- Y: 10^24

But wait, some systems use binary prefixes (like KiB, MiB, etc.), but the problem's example uses 'K', which could be either. However, since the problem says 'human readable', perhaps it's using the SI units. 

So, the code would have a dictionary mapping units to their multipliers. For example:

unit_map = {
    'K': 10**3,
    'M': 10**6,
    'G': 10**9,
    'T': 10**12,
    'P': 10**15,
    'E': 10**18,
    'Z': 10**21,
    'Y': 10**24,
}

But what if the unit is lowercase? The function should probably handle that by converting to uppercase. 

So, the code would first check if the string has a unit. For example, '500k' would be converted to 'K' and then multiplied by 10^3.

Now, the code can use a regular expression to extract the number and unit. 

For example, the regex pattern could be r'^(\d+)([KMGTPEZY])?$' â€” but this would match numbers followed by optional units. However, the string could also be just a number, like '123'.

So, the regex would capture the number and the unit (if present). 

Once the number and unit are extracted, multiply the number by the corresponding factor. 

But what if the unit is not in the unit_map? For example, 'X'? Then, the function should raise an error. 

So, the function should handle invalid units by raising a ValueError. 

Now, the code steps:

1. Check if the input string is valid. 

2. Use regex to extract the number and unit.

3. Convert the unit to uppercase.

4. Multiply the number by the corresponding factor.

But how to handle the regex? Let's think. 

In Python, using re.match, for example. 

So, the code could be:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    # Check if the input is valid
    # Use regex to extract number and unit
    match = re.fullmatch(r'(\d+)([KMGTPEZY])?$', size)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid size format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    num = int(num_str)
    if unit:
        unit = unit.upper()
        # Check if unit is in the map
        if unit not in unit_map:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
        num *= unit_map[unit]
    return num

Wait, but what about cases where the unit is not present? Like '123' would have unit as None. So, the code would return num as is. 

But what about cases where the string is '123.45K'? The problem says the input is a string representing a human-readable size. But the function expects a string like '500K', which is an integer. However, the function's parameters say 'size: str', but the example is '500K'. So perhaps the function should handle numbers with decimal points? But the problem's docstring says the input is a string like '500K', so maybe it's only integers. 

But the function's current code would not handle decimal points. However, the problem's example uses '500K', which is an integer. So perhaps the function should handle only integer values. 

But the problem says the input is a string representing a human-readable size. So perhaps the function should handle cases where the number is a float, like '1.5K' which would be 1.5 * 1000 bytes. 

But the function's current code uses int(num_str), which would fail for decimal numbers. So, perhaps the code should convert num_str to a float. 

Wait, but the function's return type is int. So, if the input is '1.5K', the function would return 1500 bytes (assuming K is 1000). But how to handle decimal points? 

This is a problem. The original function's docstring says the input is a string like '500K', which is an integer. However, perhaps the function should handle decimal numbers. 

But the problem's function signature says the input is a string, and the return is an integer. So, perhaps the function should accept decimal numbers. For example, '1.5K' would be 1.5 * 1000 = 1500 bytes. 

So, the code should parse the number as a float, then convert to integer. But wait, the function returns an int. So, perhaps the function should handle decimal points, but then the result would be a float. However, the function returns an int. So, perhaps the function should round to the nearest integer? Or truncate? 

But the problem's example uses '500K', which is an integer. So maybe the function should handle only integer values. However, the problem's docstring says 'human readable file size', which can include decimal points. 

This is a bit ambiguous. But given that the problem's example uses an integer, perhaps the function should handle only integer values. 

But to be safe, perhaps the function should allow decimal numbers. 

So, the code should parse the number part as a float, then multiply by the unit's factor, then convert to integer. 

But how to handle that? 

For example, '1.5K' would be 1.5 * 1000 = 1500.0, which can be converted to int. 

So, the code should parse the number as a float. 

So, modifying the code:

num = float(num_str)

But then, when multiplied by the unit's factor, the result could be a float. However, the function returns an int. So, perhaps we can cast it to int. 

But what if the number is something like '1.5K' and the unit is 'K'? Then, 1.5 * 1000 = 1500.0, which is an integer. But if the number is '1.2K', then 1.2 * 1000 = 1200.0, which is an integer. However, if the number is '1.3K', then it's 1300.0, which is integer. Wait, no. 1.3 * 1000 = 1300.0. So, in that case, it's an integer. 

But if the number is '1.5K', then 1.5 * 1000 = 1500.0. So, converting to int would be 1500. 

But what if the number is '1.5K' and the unit is 'M'? Then 1.5 * 1,000,000 = 1,500,000.0. 

So, perhaps the code can parse the number as a float, multiply by the unit's factor, then cast to int. 

But what about cases where the number is not a valid float? Like 'abcK'? Then, the regex would not match, and the code would raise ValueError. 

So, the code should first check that the number part is a valid integer or float. 

But the regex as written (r'(\d+)([KMGTPEZY])?$') would only match numbers that are integers. So, if the input is '1.5K', the regex would not match, because the first part is \d+ which matches only digits. 

Ah, right. So, the regex is not handling decimal points. 

So, the function needs to handle numbers that can have decimal points. 

So, the regex should be adjusted to match numbers with optional decimal points. 

So, the regex pattern should be something like r'^(\d+(\.\d*)?)([KMGTPEZY])?$' â€” but this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, the regex could match a number that is either an integer or a float. 

So, the regex pattern could be:

r'^(\d+\.?\d*) ([KMGTPEZY])?$' â€” but that's not correct. 

Wait, the regex should capture the entire number part. 

Let me think. The number part can be:

- An integer: like '123'
- A decimal number: like '123.45' or '123.4' or '.45' (but perhaps the function should not handle leading or trailing decimals?)

But for the purpose of this function, perhaps the number can be a valid float, including optional decimal points. 

So, the regex pattern for the number part could be r'(\d+\.?\d*)' â€” but this would match numbers like '123', '123.45', '123.', '.45', etc. However, the function may need to handle cases where the number is a valid float. 

But the problem's example uses '500K', which is an integer. So, perhaps the function should handle both integers and floats. 

So, the regex pattern would need to match numbers with optional decimal points. 

So, the regex could be:

r'^(\d+\.?\d*)([KMGTPEZY])?$'

But this would match numbers like '123', '123.45', '123.', '.45', etc. However, the function may need to validate that the number is a valid float. 

But for the purpose of this function, perhaps the code can parse the number as a float. 

So, modifying the regex to capture the number part as a float. 

So, the code would use a regex like:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    # Match the entire string against the pattern
    match = re.fullmatch(r'(\d+\.?\d*)([KMGTPEZY])?$', size)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid size format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    num = float(num_str)
    if unit:
        unit = unit.upper()
        if unit not in unit_map:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
        num *= unit_map[unit]
    return int(num)

But what about cases where the number is something like '123.45K'? The code would parse it as 123.45, multiply by the unit's factor, then cast to int. 

But the problem says the function returns an int. So, perhaps the function should round to the nearest integer? Or truncate? 

But the problem's example is '500K' which is an integer. So, perhaps the function should handle decimal numbers and convert them to integers by truncating or rounding. However, the problem's docstring doesn't specify. 

But given that the function returns an int, perhaps the code should cast the result to int, which would truncate the decimal part. 

But this is a problem. For example, '1.5K' would be 1500.0, which is 1500. But if the number is '1.5K' and the unit is 'K', then 1.5 * 1000 = 1500.0. So, converting to int is fine. 

But if the number is '1.2K', then 1.2 * 1000 = 1200.0, which is 1200. 

But if the number is '1.25K', then 1.25 * 1000 = 1250.0, which is 1250. 

But if the number is '1.25K' and the unit is 'M', then 1.25 * 1,000,000 = 1,250,000.0. 

So, the code can safely cast to int. 

But what about numbers like '123.456K'? The code would parse that as 123.456, multiply by the unit's factor, then cast to int. So, it would truncate the decimal part. 

But perhaps the function should round to the nearest integer? 

But the problem's docstring doesn't specify. So, perhaps the function should handle decimal numbers as floats and then cast to int, which would truncate. 

But this is a design decision. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function should only accept integer values. 

But the problem's example uses '500K', which is an integer. 

But the problem says the input is a string representing a human-readable size. Human-readable sizes can include decimal points, like '1.5K'. 

So, perhaps the function should handle decimal numbers. 

So, the code would parse the number as a float, multiply by the unit's factor, and then cast to int. 

But how to handle cases where the number is not a valid float? For example, '123.45.67K' â€” the regex would not match, and the code would raise ValueError. 

So, the regex should ensure that the number part is a valid float. 

But the regex pattern I wrote earlier (r'(\d+\.?\d*)') would match '123', '123.45', '123.', '.45', etc. However, '123.45.67' would not match. 

So, the regex is okay. 

Now, the unit_map. Let me define it. 

unit_map = {
    'K': 10**3,
    'M': 10**6,
    'G': 10**9,
    'T': 10**12,
    'P': 10**15,
    'E': 10**18,
    'Z': 10**21,
    'Y': 10**24,
}

But what about units like 'KB' (kilobytes)? The problem's example uses 'K', so perhaps the function should only accept single-letter units. 

So, the code would check for the unit being one of the keys in the unit_map. 

Now, the code. 

But first, the function needs to import re. 

So, the code would be:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert human readable file size to bytes

    Args:
        size: str, a string representing a human readable file size (eg: '500K')
    Returns:
        int: file size in bytes
    """
    unit_map = {
        'K': 10**3,
        'M': 10**6,
        'G': 10**9,
        'T': 10**12,
        'P': 10**15,
        'E': 10**18,
        'Z': 10**21,
        'Y': 10**24,
    }
    match = re.fullmatch(r'(\d+\.?\d*)([KMGTPEZY])?$', size)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid size format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    num = float(num_str)
    if unit:
        unit = unit.upper()
        if unit not in unit_map:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
        num *= unit_map[unit]
    return int(num)

Wait, but what about cases where the unit is not present? Like '123' â€” then, num is 123.0, which is cast to 123. 

But what about if the input is '123.45' â€” the code would return 123.45 as an int? No, because num is a float, and then cast to int. So, 123.45 would become 123. 

But this is a problem. For example, '123.45K' would be 123.45 * 1000 = 123450.0, which is 123450. But if the input is '123.45', then it's 123.45 bytes, which would be 123. But that's not correct. 

Wait, but the function's docstring says the input is a human-readable file size. So, if the input is '123.45', it's not a valid size, because it's not followed by a unit. 

Wait, the regex is r'(\d+\.?\d*)([KMGTPEZY])?$' â€” so the entire string must match this pattern. So, for '123.45', the regex would match, and the unit is None. Then, the code would return 123.45 as an int, which would be 123. But that's not correct. 

But the function's docstring says the input is a string like '500K'. So, perhaps the function should require that the input has a unit. But that's not specified. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function should allow for numbers without units, which would be treated as bytes. 

But the problem's example uses '500K', but the function's docstring says the input is a string like '500K'. So, perhaps the function should allow for numbers without units, which would be treated as bytes. 

But then, the code would return 123.45 as an int, which is 123. 

But this is not correct. For example, '123.45' should be treated as 123.45 bytes, but the function returns an int, which would truncate. 

But the problem says the function returns an int. So, perhaps the function should only accept integer values. 

But the problem's example uses '500K', which is an integer. 

So, perhaps the function should only accept integer numbers. 

In that case, the regex should match only integers. 

So, the regex pattern would be r'^(\d+)([KMGTPEZY])?$' â€” which matches integers followed by optional units. 

So, the code would be:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    """
    Convert human readable file size to bytes

    Args:

    """
    unit_map = {

        'T': 10**12,
        'P': 10**15,
        'E': 10**18,
        'Z': 10**21,
        'Y': 10**24,
    }
    match = re.fullmatch(r'(\d+)([KMGTPEZY])?$', size)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid size format")
    num_str, unit = match.groups()
    num = int(num_str)

        if unit not in unit_map:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown unit: {unit}")
        num *= unit_map[unit]
    return num

This would handle '500K' as 500 * 1000 = 500000. 

But what about '123' â€” it would return 123. 

But what if the input is '123.45K'? The regex would not match, since the first part is \d+ which only matches integers. So, the code would raise ValueError. 

So, this code would only handle integer values. 

But the problem's docstring says the input is a string like '500K', which is an integer. 

So, this code would work for that case. 

Now, testing the code. 

Test cases:

Test case 1: '500K' â†’ 500 * 1000 = 500000. 

Test case 2: '1M' â†’ 1 * 1e6 = 1,000,000. 

Test case 3: '1G' â†’ 1e9. 

Test case 4: '123' â†’ 123. 

Test case 5: '123K' â†’ 123 * 1000 = 123000. 

Test case 6: '1.5K' â†’ invalid, since the regex would not match. 

But what if the input is '1.5K'? The regex would not match, so the code raises ValueError. 

But the problem's example uses '500K', which is an integer. 

So, the code is correct for the given example. 

Now, what about units that are not in the unit_map? Like 'X'? The code would raise ValueError. 

So, the code seems to handle the cases. 

Now, the code should be written. 

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. 

Now, the code is written. 

But the problem also says to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. 

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. 

But the initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips say to follow TDD approach, first generating unit tests. 

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. 

So, perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. 

But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. 

So, the code I wrote earlier is the correct code. 

But I should make sure that the code handles all possible cases. 

Another thing to consider: the regex may not match if the unit is lowercase. For example, '500k' â†’ the regex would match, and unit is 'k', which is converted to uppercase. 

Yes, the code converts the unit to uppercase. 

So, the code is correct. 

Now, the code is written. 

So, the final code is:

import re

    return num

But wait, the regex is r'(\d+)([KMGTPEZY])?$' â€” this matches the entire string. 

For example, '500K' would match, and groups would be ('500', 'K'). 

If the input is '123', then groups would be ('123', None). 

Yes. 

So, the code is correct. 

Now, the code should be written in Python markdown format. 

The user says to output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. 

So, the code is as above. 

But the code may have some issues. For example, what if the input is '0K'? It would return 0. 

Another test case: '1K' â†’ 1000. 

What about '1000K' â†’ 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. 

Yes. 

So, the code should work.
