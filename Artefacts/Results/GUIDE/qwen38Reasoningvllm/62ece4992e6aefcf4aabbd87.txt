Okay, I need to generate Python code for the build_app_logger function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is supposed to create and return a logger object. The parameters are name, logfile, and debug. The docstring mentions it's for debugging, so probably the logger should write to a file and have debug level enabled if debug is True.

I remember that in Python, the logging module is used for logging. So I'll need to use that. The steps would be:

1. Create a logger with the given name.
2. Set the logging level based on the debug parameter. If debug is True, set to DEBUG, else INFO or something else? Wait, the default for debug is True, so maybe when debug is True, the level is DEBUG, otherwise, maybe INFO? Or maybe the default is DEBUG, but the user can set it. Wait, the function's args say debug is a boolean, so perhaps when debug is True, the logger is set to DEBUG level, otherwise, maybe WARNING or something else. But the docstring says it's useful mainly for debugging, so maybe the default is DEBUG. But the function's args have debug=True as default. So the logger's level should be set to DEBUG if debug is True, else maybe INFO? Or perhaps the user can set the level via the debug parameter. Wait, the function's parameters are name, logfile, debug. So the debug parameter probably controls whether debug logs are enabled. So maybe the logger's level is set to DEBUG if debug is True, else INFO. Or maybe the logger's level is set to DEBUG regardless, but the debug parameter is used to control whether the logger is in debug mode. Wait, perhaps the debug parameter is used to set the logging level. For example, if debug is True, set the level to logging.DEBUG, else logging.INFO. That makes sense.

But I need to check the standard practice. Typically, the logging level is set to DEBUG when debugging, and INFO for normal operation. So the function's debug parameter probably controls the logging level. So if debug is True, set the level to DEBUG, else INFO.

Next, the logger should write to a file. So I need to add a FileHandler to the logger. The logfile parameter is the filename. So create a FileHandler with that filename, and add it to the logger.

Also, the logger should output to the console as well? Or just the file? The docstring says it's for debugging, so maybe it's better to have both console and file output. But the function's parameters don't mention console output. Wait, the docstring says "useful mainly for debugging", so maybe the logger should output to the console as well. But the function's parameters don't have a parameter for that. Hmm. Wait, the function's parameters are name, logfile, debug. So perhaps the logger should write to the file and also output to the console. But how to do that?

Alternatively, maybe the logger is only writing to the file. But that's not very helpful for debugging. So perhaps the function should configure the logger to output to both console and file. But how to do that? Let me think.

In Python's logging module, you can add multiple handlers. So, for example, create a FileHandler and a StreamHandler (for console), and add both to the logger. But the function's parameters don't mention console output. However, the docstring says it's for debugging, so maybe the logger should output to the console as well. But the function's parameters don't have a parameter for that. So maybe the function is supposed to write to the file, and perhaps also to the console. But how to decide?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls whether the logger is in debug mode. So the logger's level is set to DEBUG if debug is True, else INFO. Then, the handler is a FileHandler. But then, the logs would only be written to the file. But for debugging, it's useful to have them in the console as well. So perhaps the function should add both a FileHandler and a StreamHandler. But how to handle that?

Wait, the function's docstring says "useful mainly for debugging", so maybe the logger should output to the console. But the parameters don't have a parameter for that. So maybe the function is intended to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls the logging level. So, for example, if debug is True, the logger will output DEBUG messages to the file. But the user might want to see those in the console as well. However, the function's parameters don't allow for that. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls the level. So the code would create a FileHandler, set the level based on debug, and add it to the logger.

But then, the logger would not output to the console. So maybe the function should also add a StreamHandler. But how to decide? Well, the user can choose to have the logger output to the console by adding a StreamHandler. But the function's parameters don't have that. So perhaps the function is supposed to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls the logging level. So, for example, if debug is True, the logger will output DEBUG messages to the file. But the user might want to see those in the console. However, the function's parameters don't allow for that. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls the level. So the code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    return logger

Wait, but that would only write to the file. But maybe the user wants to see logs in the console as well. However, the function's parameters don't mention that. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls the level. So the code would be as above.

But then, the logger would not output to the console. So maybe the function should also add a StreamHandler. But how to decide? Well, the function's docstring says it's useful mainly for debugging, so maybe the logs should be output to the console. But the function's parameters don't have that. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file and also to the console. So the code would add both handlers.

But then, the user can choose to have the logger output to the console. However, the function's parameters don't have a parameter for that. So perhaps the function is supposed to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls the level. So the code would be as above.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to write to the file and also to the console. So the code would add both handlers. But how to handle that? Let's think. For example:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    # Add file handler
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
    # Add console handler
    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    console_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    logger.addHandler(console_handler)
    return logger

But then, the user can see logs in both console and file. However, the function's parameters don't mention console output. But the docstring says it's for debugging, so maybe that's acceptable.

But the problem is that the function's parameters don't have a way to disable console output. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file and also to the console. But the user can choose to have the logger output to the console. However, the function's parameters don't allow for that. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file and also to the console. So the code would include both handlers.

But then, the user can't disable console output. But maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls the level. So the code would be as the first example.

But the user might want to have logs in the console for debugging. So perhaps the function should include both. But the function's parameters don't have a way to disable console output. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file and also to the console. So the code would include both handlers.

But then, the user can't disable console output. However, the function's parameters don't have a way to do that. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file and also to the console. So the code would add both handlers.

So, the code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    """
    General purpose application logger. Useful mainly for debugging
    Args:
        name: The name of logger
        logfile: The log file need to save
        debug: is need to debug

    Returns:
        Returns an instantiated logger object
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    # Create file handler
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
    # Create console handler
    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    console_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    logger.addHandler(console_handler)
    return logger

But wait, the default for debug is True. So when debug is True, the level is DEBUG. So the logger will output DEBUG and higher messages. But if debug is False, the level is INFO, so only INFO and higher messages.

But in this code, both handlers (file and console) are set to the same level. So that's correct.

But what about the format of the logs? The default format may not be very informative. So perhaps the code should set a formatter for the handlers. For example, adding a formatter that includes the timestamp, logger name, log level, and message.

So, adding formatters to the handlers:

file_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
file_handler.setFormatter(file_formatter)

console_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_handler.setFormatter(console_formatter)

But the function's parameters don't mention formatting, so perhaps the user can assume that the default format is acceptable. However, it's better to set a formatter for clarity.

So, including that in the code.

So the code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    """
    General purpose application logger. Useful mainly for debugging
    Args:
        name: The name of logger
        logfile: The log file need to save
        debug: is need to debug

    Returns:
        Returns an instantiated logger object
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    # Create file handler
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    # Set formatter for file handler
    file_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    file_handler.setFormatter(file_formatter)
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
    # Create console handler
    console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    console_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    # Set formatter for console handler
    console_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    console_handler.setFormatter(console_formatter)
    logger.addHandler(console_handler)
    return logger

But then, the user can have logs in both console and file. But the function's parameters don't allow disabling console output. However, the function's docstring says it's for debugging, so maybe that's acceptable.

But the problem is that if the user wants to have the logger write only to the file, this code would also write to the console. But since the function's parameters don't allow for that, perhaps the function is intended to write to both. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to write only to the file. But the docstring says it's useful mainly for debugging, which often involves seeing logs in the console. So perhaps the code should include both.

But I'm not sure. However, the user's function signature and docstring don't mention console output, so maybe the function is intended to write only to the file. So perhaps the code should only add the FileHandler. But then, the logs would only be written to the file. However, for debugging, it's useful to see them in the console. So perhaps the function should include both.

But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the safest approach is to write to the file and also to the console, as that's more helpful for debugging.

So the code would include both handlers.

Now, the function returns the logger object. So when the user uses this logger, they can call logger.debug(), logger.info(), etc.

Now, considering test-driven development. The user wants comprehensive unit tests. But the user hasn't provided any test cases. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown format.

So the code should be written as per the above reasoning.

But perhaps the function is intended to write only to the file. Let me check the function's parameters again. The function's args are name, logfile, debug. The docstring says it's useful mainly for debugging, so maybe the logger should write to the file and have debug level enabled. So the code would create a FileHandler, set the level based on debug, and add it to the logger.

But then, the logs would only be written to the file. So the code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    """
    General purpose application logger. Useful mainly for debugging
    Args:
        name: The name of logger
        logfile: The log file need to save
        debug: is need to debug

    Returns:
        Returns an instantiated logger object
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    return logger

But then, the logs would only be written to the file. However, the user might want to see them in the console. But since the function's parameters don't mention console output, perhaps that's not required.

But the function's docstring says it's useful mainly for debugging. So perhaps the logs should be output to the console. But again, the parameters don't allow for that. So perhaps the function is intended to write to the file, and the debug parameter controls the level. So the code would be as above.

But I'm not sure. However, given the information provided, I'll proceed with the code that writes to the file and sets the level based on the debug parameter.

So the code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    """
    General purpose application logger. Useful mainly for debugging
    Args:
        name: The name of logger
        logfile: The log file need to save
        debug: is need to debug

    Returns:
        Returns an instantiated logger object
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    return logger

But perhaps the function should also set a formatter. For example, to make the logs more readable. So adding a formatter to the handler.

So:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    """
    General purpose application logger. Useful mainly for debugging
    Args:
        name: The name of logger
        logfile: The log file need to save
        debug: is need to debug

    Returns:
        Returns an instantiated logger object
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    return logger

This way, the logs have a standard format.

Now, considering the test-driven approach. The user wants comprehensive unit tests. But since the user hasn't provided specific test cases, I'll have to think about what tests would be needed.

For example, tests could check that the logger is created with the correct name, that the handler is a FileHandler, that the level is set correctly, and that the formatter is set.

But since the user wants the code first, and then the tests, but the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code.

So the code is as above.

But I think the correct approach is to have the logger write to the file and set the level based on the debug parameter. So the code would be as above.

Therefore, the final code is as written.
