Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the validate_from_content method based on the given function signature and docstring. They also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it validates that the spec (YAML) content has all required fields. If mandatory data is missing, it raises an IRValidatorException. It returns a dictionary with data loaded from the YAML file.

So, the function's main tasks are:
1. Load the YAML content into a dictionary.
2. Check for the presence of required fields.
3. If any required fields are missing, raise an exception.
4. Return the validated dictionary.

But wait, the function is a class method (cls is the first parameter), so it's part of a class. The spec_content is the content of the spec file, which is a YAML string. The function needs to parse that YAML content into a Python dictionary.

First, I need to handle the YAML parsing. Python has the PyYAML library for that. So, I'll need to import yaml and use yaml.safe_load to parse the spec_content. But I should handle any exceptions that might occur during parsing, like if the content isn't valid YAML. However, the docstring doesn't mention handling invalid YAML, just missing required fields. So maybe the function assumes that the input is valid YAML, but perhaps the tests should check for that.

Next, the required fields. The problem is that the required fields aren't specified in the function signature. The function is supposed to validate that the spec has all required fields, but the required fields are not given. Wait, maybe the required fields are defined in the class or somewhere else? The function is part of a class, but the docstring doesn't mention any specific required fields. This is a bit ambiguous. How can the function know which fields are required?

Hmm, maybe the required fields are determined by the class or some other configuration. But the function as given doesn't have that information. Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a predefined list of required fields. For example, maybe the class has a class-level attribute like REQUIRED_FIELDS that lists all the mandatory keys. So the validate_from_content method would check that all those keys are present in the parsed YAML.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided that information. So perhaps the function is supposed to be generic, but without knowing the required fields, it's impossible to write the code. Wait, maybe the required fields are part of the spec_content itself? Like, maybe there's a 'required' key in the YAML that lists the mandatory fields. But that's not specified in the docstring either.

This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the docstring. The docstring says "validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields". The parameters are spec_content, which is the content of the spec file. The function raises an exception if mandatory data is missing. But how does it know which fields are required?

Ah, maybe the required fields are defined in the class. For example, the class might have a class attribute like REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2'] and the function checks that all those fields are present in the spec_content. But since the user hasn't provided that information, perhaps the function is supposed to be part of a class where the required fields are defined elsewhere.

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the function is supposed to be a generic one, but that's not possible. So perhaps the required fields are determined by the class, and the function is supposed to check for them. But without knowing what those fields are, how can I write the code? Maybe the function is part of a class that has a predefined list of required fields, and the code should check for those.

Alternatively, maybe the required fields are part of the spec_content itself. For example, the spec might have a 'required' key that lists the mandatory fields. But again, the docstring doesn't mention that.

This is a problem. Without knowing the required fields, I can't write the code. However, perhaps the user expects that the required fields are determined by the class, and the function is supposed to check for them. For example, the class might have a list of required fields, and the function checks that all of them are present in the parsed YAML.

So, assuming that the class has a class-level attribute called REQUIRED_FIELDS, the function would check that all those fields are present in the parsed data. If any are missing, it raises an exception.

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe I should proceed with that assumption. Let me proceed with that approach.

So, the steps for the function would be:

1. Parse the spec_content into a dictionary using PyYAML.
2. Check that all required fields (from the class's REQUIRED_FIELDS) are present in the dictionary.
3. If any are missing, raise IRValidatorException with an appropriate message.
4. Return the parsed dictionary.

But first, I need to handle the YAML parsing. Also, the function is a class method, so it's called as cls.validate_from_content(...). So, the code would be:

import yaml

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        # parse spec_content into a dict
        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            # handle parsing error? But the docstring doesn't mention this.
            # Maybe the function assumes that the input is valid YAML.
            # So perhaps we don't handle it here, but the tests would check for that.
            # However, the user hasn't specified, so maybe we proceed without handling.
            # But for the purpose of the code, perhaps we should raise an exception.
            # But the docstring says to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing.
            # So maybe parsing errors are not handled here, but the tests would check for that.
            # So, proceed without handling, but perhaps the code should handle it.
            # But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we proceed.
            # For now, assume that spec_content is valid YAML.
            # So, data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        # Check required fields
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        return data

But then, what about the IRValidatorException? The user hasn't provided the definition of that exception. So, perhaps it's a custom exception class that needs to be defined. But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code should assume that it's already defined.

So, the code would need to import IRValidatorException, but since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps it's part of the same module or a known exception.

But the user's code is supposed to generate the function. So, the code would need to include the necessary imports and exception handling.

But the user's code is supposed to generate the function, so perhaps the code is part of a class that has the required fields and the exception is already defined.

Now, considering the test-driven approach, I need to write unit tests first. Let's think about possible test cases.

Test case 1: spec_content has all required fields. Should return the data.

Test case 2: spec_content is missing a required field. Should raise IRValidatorException.

Test case 3: spec_content is invalid YAML. Should raise an exception (but the docstring doesn't mention this, so maybe the function doesn't handle it, but the tests should check for that).

But the user's docstring says that the function raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, the tests should check that when required fields are missing, the exception is raised. Also, when the YAML is invalid, perhaps the function should raise a different exception, but the docstring doesn't mention that. So perhaps the tests should check for that.

But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should handle YAML parsing errors, but the docstring doesn't mention it. So, perhaps the code should handle that, but the user's docstring doesn't mention it. Hmm.

But the user's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, the code should raise that exception for missing fields, but other errors (like invalid YAML) might be handled differently. However, the function's responsibility is to validate the content, so perhaps it's up to the caller to handle invalid YAML. But that's unclear.

In any case, the code should parse the YAML content, check for required fields, and raise the exception if any are missing.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think about writing them.

First, the tests would need to import the class and the exception. Assuming that the class is named, say, SpecValidator, and the exception is IRValidatorException.

But since the user hasn't provided the class name, perhaps the function is part of a class, and the tests are written accordingly.

So, the unit tests would be:

import unittest
from your_module import SpecValidator, IRValidatorException

class TestValidateFromContent(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_spec(self):
        spec_content = "key1: value1\nkey2: value2"
        result = SpecValidator.validate_from_content(spec_content)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'})

    def test_missing_required_field(self):
        spec_content = "key1: value1"
        with self.assertRaises(IRValidatorException):
            SpecValidator.validate_from_content(spec_content)

    def test_invalid_yaml(self):
        spec_content = "invalid: yaml"
        with self.assertRaises(yaml.YAMLError):
            SpecValidator.validate_from_content(spec_content)

But wait, the function's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, the invalid YAML case would raise a different exception (YAMLError), which is not handled by the function. So, the tests should check for that.

But the user's docstring doesn't mention handling invalid YAML, so the function may not handle it. However, the function's responsibility is to validate the content, so perhaps it's up to the caller to handle invalid YAML. But the tests should check that the function raises the correct exceptions for missing fields and other errors.

But the user's code is supposed to generate the function, so the code should handle the required fields and raise the specified exception.

Now, putting it all together, the code for the function would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SpecValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['key1', 'key2']

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            spec_content = ''
        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise ValueError("Invalid YAML content") from e  # Or handle differently
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        return data

Wait, but the user's function is a class method, and the code is supposed to generate the function. But the user's function signature is def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):, so the code should have that.

But the user's code may not have the IRValidatorException defined. So, perhaps the code should include that exception.

But the user's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException, so the code should have that exception defined.

So, the code would need to define IRValidatorException, or assume it's already defined.

But the user's code is supposed to generate the function, so including the exception definition is necessary.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in python markdown format. So, the code should include the necessary imports and the exception.

But the user's original code may not have the exception, so the code should include it.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            spec_content = ''
        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise ValueError("Invalid YAML content") from e
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        return data

But the user's function is part of a class, but the class name isn't specified. So, perhaps the code should use a placeholder class name, like 'SpecValidator'.

But the user's code may have a different class name. However, since the user hasn't provided that, the code should use a generic class name.

But the user's function is a class method, so the code should have the class with the required fields.

Now, considering the test cases, the code should be written with the assumption that the required fields are defined in the class.

But the user's function doesn't have the required fields specified. So, perhaps the function is supposed to be generic, but that's not possible. Therefore, the code must assume that the required fields are defined in the class.

In conclusion, the code should include the necessary imports, define the IRValidatorException, and the class with the required fields and the validate_from_content method.

But the user's original code may not have the IRValidatorException, so the code should define it.

Now, putting all this into the code, the final code would be as above.

But the user's function may have a different class name. However, since the user hasn't provided that, the code uses a placeholder.

So, the final code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SpecValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['key1', 'key2']

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            spec_content = ''
        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise ValueError("Invalid YAML content") from e
        for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
        return data

But the user's function may not have the 'spec_content is None' check. However, the function's parameter is spec_content=None, so the code should handle that.

But in the code above, if spec_content is None, it's set to an empty string. That's a reasonable default.

But the user's docstring says that spec_content is the content of the spec file. So, if it's None, perhaps it's better to raise an error, but the code sets it to an empty string. However, that's up to the implementation.

In any case, the code should handle that.

Now, the unit tests would be written as:

import unittest
import yaml
from your_module import SpecValidator, IRValidatorException

class TestValidateFromContent(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_spec(self):
        spec_content = "key1: value1\nkey2: value2"
        result = SpecValidator.validate_from_content(spec_content)
        self.assertEqual(result, {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'})

    def test_missing_required_field(self):
        spec_content = "key1: value1"
        with self.assertRaises(IRValidatorException):
            SpecValidator.validate_from_content(spec_content)

    def test_invalid_yaml(self):
        spec_content = "invalid: yaml"
        with self.assertRaises(yaml.YAMLError):
            SpecValidator.validate_from_content(spec_content)

But the user's code may not have the 'your_module' import, so the tests would need to adjust accordingly.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code for the function, so the code should include the necessary parts.

In conclusion, the code for the function is as written above, with the class and the method, and the unit tests as described.
