Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the get_versions function based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to obtain version information, and if it can't, return a default value. But the problem is, the actual implementation isn't specified. So I need to figure out what the default value is and how to get the version info.

First, the docstring says that if version info can't be obtained, the default is returned. But what's the default? The function's return type isn't specified. Maybe it's a string or a dictionary? Hmm. Well, maybe the default is an empty string or something. But since the user hasn't provided specifics, perhaps I should make some assumptions.

Wait, maybe the function is intended to retrieve version information from some source, like a file, environment variables, or a package. For example, in Python, sometimes version info is stored in a file like __version__.py or in environment variables. Alternatively, it could be using a package's metadata.

But without more context, I need to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the version information is stored in a file called 'version.py' in the same directory. The file might have a variable like __version__ = '1.0.0'. So the function would try to import that file and return the __version__ variable. If that's not possible, return a default, maybe an empty string or 'unknown'.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check for environment variables, like VERSION or something similar. But again, without knowing, I have to choose a common approach.

Let me think about test-driven development. The user mentioned generating comprehensive unit tests first. So I need to write tests that check the function's behavior when version info is available and when it's not.

For example, a test case where the version file exists and has a valid version, and another where it doesn't. But how to simulate that? Maybe using a temporary directory with a version file, or mocking imports.

But since the user wants the code first, maybe I should proceed with the code that tries to import a version module, and if that fails, returns a default. Let's say the default is '1.0.0' or something. Wait, the docstring says "the default value is returned" but doesn't specify what. Maybe the default is an empty string, or maybe it's a specific value. Since it's not specified, perhaps the default is an empty string.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary with version info. But again, without knowing, I need to make assumptions. Let me proceed with the following approach:

The function will try to import a module named 'version' (maybe from a file called version.py) and retrieve the __version__ attribute. If that fails (e.g., module not found), return a default value, say, an empty string.

So the code would be something like:

def get_versions():
    try:
        import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return ''

But then, the docstring says "version information" which could be a string. However, maybe the version info is more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary with multiple version fields, like major, minor, etc. But again, without more info, I need to make a choice.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a package and uses the package's metadata. For example, using importlib.metadata or pkg_resources to get the version. But that would require the package to be installed, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, the function could check for environment variables. For example, checking os.environ.get('APP_VERSION', 'default'). But again, without knowing, it's hard.

But given the lack of information, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the version info is stored in a module called 'version' with a __version__ attribute. So the code would try to import that module and return the version. If it can't, return a default.

So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return ''

But then, the default value is an empty string. However, maybe the default should be a specific value, like '1.0.0' or 'unknown'. The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the default is an empty string.

But the user wants the code to be generated. So I need to write that code. Also, the user mentioned test-driven development, so I should generate tests first. Let me think about the tests.

For the tests, I need to test two scenarios: when the version module is present and when it's not. For example:

Test case 1: version module exists with __version__ = '1.0.0' → returns '1.0.0'

Test case 2: version module does not exist → returns default (empty string)

But how to simulate the absence of the module? Using mocking. For example, in the test, we can mock the import to raise ImportError.

So the tests would look like:

import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
import your_module

class TestGetVersions(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('your_module.importlib.import_module')
    def test_version_exists(self, mock_import):
        mock_import.return_value.__version__ = '1.0.0'
        self.assertEqual(your_module.get_versions(), '1.0.0')

    @patch('your_module.importlib.import_module')
    def test_version_not_exists(self, mock_import):
        mock_import.side_effect = ImportError
        self.assertEqual(your_module.get_versions(), '')

But wait, the actual code uses import version, which is a top-level import. So to mock that, perhaps the patch should be on the import statement. However, in Python, the import is handled by the importlib module. So mocking importlib.import_module would be necessary.

Alternatively, using a patch on the import statement. For example:

@patch('your_module.version')
def test_version_exists(self, mock_version):
    mock_version.__version__ = '1.0.0'
    self.assertEqual(get_versions(), '1.0.0')

But that's if the code is importing 'version' as a module. So in the code, the line is 'import version', so the module is called 'version'. So to mock that, we can patch 'your_module.version' (assuming the function is in your_module).

But this is getting complicated. However, the user wants the code first, then the tests. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and then generate the tests. But the user's initial request says to generate the code, and then the tests. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Then, the tips say to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "You should follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code." So the user wants the tests first, then the code. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the user wants the code, but with the tests generated first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. Wait, the user says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps the code is to be generated, but the tests are part of the code? Or maybe the user wants the code, and the tests are part of the code as well?

Wait, the initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Then the tips say to follow test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So perhaps the user wants the code, but the code should be written with TDD in mind, meaning that the tests are written first, then the code. But the user's output is only the code. So maybe the code includes the tests? Or perhaps the user wants the code and the tests as separate parts. But the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are separate. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is the function itself, and the tests are not part of the code. But the tips say to generate the tests first. But the user's output is only the code. So perhaps the user wants the code, and the tests are part of the code. Or maybe the user is confused.

This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the user's instructions.

The user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Then the tips say to follow TDD, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So perhaps the user wants the code (the function) and the tests. But the output is only the code. Or perhaps the user wants the code, and the tests are part of the code. But the user says to output only the code. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are not included. However, the tips suggest that the code should be written with tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code. So maybe the user wants the code, and the tests are part of the code. But the user says "output only the code generated", which may imply that the code is the function, and the tests are separate. But the user's tips say to generate the tests first. This is a bit conflicting.

But given the user's instruction to output only the code, I think the code is the function itself. So I need to write the function based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to obtain version info, returning a default if it can't. So the code would need to handle that. But without knowing the source of the version info, I have to make assumptions. Let's proceed with the assumption that the version info is in a module called 'version' with a __version__ attribute. So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return ''

But then, what is the default value? The docstring says "the default value is returned", but doesn't specify. Maybe the default is an empty string, or perhaps it's a specific value like '1.0.0'. But since it's not specified, I'll assume an empty string.

But perhaps the default should be a specific value. For example, if the function is part of a package, maybe the default is the package's version. But without knowing, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the default is None. But again, without knowing, I have to choose.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with version info, and the default is an empty dict. But again, without knowing, it's hard. So I think the safest assumption is that the version info is a string, and the default is an empty string.

So the code would be as above. Now, the user's tip says to generate comprehensive unit tests first. But since the user says to output only the code, perhaps the tests are not part of the code. But the user might have intended to have the code and the tests. However, the instruction says to output only the code. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are not included. But the user's tips suggest that the code should be written with TDD, implying that the tests are part of the process. However, the final output is only the code. Therefore, I think the user wants the code for the function, and the tests are part of the development process but not included in the output.

So the final code would be the function as written above. However, I need to make sure that the function's docstring is as provided. The docstring says "Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned." So the code should handle that. The code above does that by trying to import the version module and returning __version__, else returning an empty string.

But perhaps the default should be a specific value. For example, if the function is part of a package, maybe the default is the package's version. But again, without knowing, it's hard. So I'll proceed with the code as written.
