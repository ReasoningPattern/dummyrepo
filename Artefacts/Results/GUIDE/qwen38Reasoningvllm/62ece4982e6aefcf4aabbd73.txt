Okay, I need to generate Python code for the split function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function split takes a string s and a platform parameter. The platform can be 'this' (auto-detect current platform), 1 (POSIX style), or 0 (Windows/CMD style). The function should return a list of split strings based on the platform's path separator.

First, I need to figure out how to determine the platform. For 'this', I should check the current operating system. In Python, I can use the os module's name attribute. If os.name is 'posix', then it's POSIX, else it's Windows. But wait, os.name returns 'posix' for Unix-like systems and 'nt' for Windows. So, for platform 'this', I need to check os.name and decide accordingly.

Next, the splitting logic. For POSIX, the path separator is '/', and for Windows/CMD, it's '\'. However, in Python, the os module provides os.sep which is the correct separator for the current platform. But when the platform is specified as 1 or 0, I need to use the respective separators.

Wait, the function's docstring says that if platform is 1, use POSIX style, which would mean splitting on '/'. If platform is 0, use Windows/CMD style, splitting on '\'. But when platform is 'this', auto-detect. So, the splitting is based on the platform's path separator.

But wait, the function's purpose is to split a string into parts based on the platform's path separator. For example, splitting a path string like 'a/b/c' into ['a', 'b', 'c'] for POSIX, or 'a\b\c' into ['a', 'b', 'c'] for Windows.

So the function should split the input string s using the appropriate separator. But how to handle cases where the separator might be escaped or part of the string? The problem statement doesn't mention handling such cases, so perhaps it's a simple split on the separator.

Wait, but in Python, the split method with a separator would split on every occurrence. For example, 'a/b/c'.split('/') would give ['a', 'b', 'c'], which is correct. Similarly for backslashes. However, in Windows paths, backslashes are escape characters in strings, so maybe the input string is properly escaped. But the function's responsibility is to split based on the platform's separator, regardless of how the string is passed.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the separator based on the platform parameter.
2. Split the input string s using that separator.
3. Return the list of split parts.

But how to handle the platform parameter:

- If platform is 'this', determine the current platform's separator.
- If platform is 1, use '/'.
- If platform is 0, use '\'.

Wait, but in Python, the backslash is an escape character. So, when passing a string with backslashes, they need to be escaped. However, the function's input is a string s, which may or may not have proper escaping. But the function's job is to split based on the separator, so perhaps we should treat the separator as a literal. For example, if the platform is 0 (Windows), then the separator is '\', but in a Python string, that would be written as '\\'.

Wait, but when the user passes a string like 'a\\b\\c' (with two backslashes), then splitting on '\' would split into ['a', 'b', 'c']? Wait, no. Because in a Python string, a single backslash is an escape character. So if the input string is 'a\\b\\c', then in Python, it's stored as 'a\b\c' (with two backslashes in the string). Wait, no. Let me think: when you write a string like 'a\\b\\c' in Python, it's stored as 'a\b\c' (each backslash is escaped, so two backslashes in the source code become one in the string). So when splitting on '\', the actual separator is a single backslash. So, for example, if the input string is 'a\b\c', splitting on '\' would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'].

But how does the function handle this? The function's input is a string s. So, if the user passes a string that contains backslashes, they need to ensure that they are properly escaped. But the function's responsibility is to split based on the platform's separator. So, regardless of how the string is passed, the function will split on the correct separator.

So, the code steps:

First, determine the separator:

if platform is 'this':

   check current platform. For example, if os.name is 'posix', then separator is '/', else '\'.

But wait, os.name returns 'posix' for Unix-like systems, and 'nt' for Windows. So, for 'this', we can check os.name. But perhaps the user wants to use the platform's path separator. For example, on Windows, the path separator is '\', but in Python, os.sep is '\', so using os.sep would be correct.

But the function's platform parameter is 'this', which auto-detects the current platform. So, for 'this', the separator is os.sep.

But for platform 1 (POSIX), the separator is '/', and for platform 0 (Windows/CMD), the separator is '\'.

Wait, but in Python, the os.sep for Windows is '\', and for POSIX it's '/'. So, perhaps the function can use os.sep when platform is 'this', and for 1 and 0, use '/' and '\' respectively.

So, the code can be structured as follows:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        sep = os.sep
    elif platform == 1:
        sep = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        sep = '\\'
    else:
        # invalid platform? Maybe raise an error?
        # but the docstring says platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So perhaps assume that the input is valid.
        # but maybe need to handle invalid cases. However, the docstring doesn't mention it, so perhaps assume that the input is correct.

    # split the string s using sep
    return s.split(sep)

Wait, but the split method in Python splits on every occurrence of the separator. For example, 'a/b/c'.split('/') gives ['a', 'b', 'c'], which is correct. Similarly, 'a\\b\\c'.split('\\') would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'] if the string is properly escaped. But in Python, when you write 'a\\b\\c' as a string, it's stored as 'a\b\c', so splitting on '\' would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'].

But wait, in Python, the split method uses the separator as a string. So, if the separator is '\', then the split is done on each occurrence of that character. However, in Python, a single backslash in a string is represented as two backslashes in the source code. So, when the platform is 0, the separator is '\\', which in the code is a single backslash. So, when the function is called with platform 0, the separator is a single backslash. So, when splitting, the code uses s.split('\\'), which would split on each backslash in the string.

But wait, in Python, if you have a string like 'a\\b\\c', then the actual string is 'a\b\c', and splitting on '\\' would split on each backslash. Wait, no. Let me think: the string 'a\\b\\c' in Python is stored as 'a\b\c' (each backslash is escaped). So, when you split on '\', which is represented as '\\' in the code, then splitting on '\\' would split on each backslash in the string. Wait, no. Let me take an example:

If the string is 'a\\b\\c', which in Python is stored as 'a\b\c'. Then, if we split on '\', which is the separator, then the split would be done on each occurrence of '\'. So, 'a\b\c'.split('\\') would split into ['a', 'b', 'c']? Wait, no. Because in Python, the split method uses the separator as a string. So, if the separator is '\', then the split is done on each occurrence of that character. However, in Python, a single backslash in a string is represented as two backslashes in the source code. So, when we write sep = '\\', that's a single backslash in the string. So, when we call s.split(sep), it's splitting on each occurrence of that single backslash.

But in the example where the string is 'a\\b\\c' (source code), which becomes 'a\b\c' in the string. Then, splitting on '\', which is the separator, would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'].

So, the code for platform 0 would use sep = '\\', which is correct.

But wait, in Python, when you do s.split('\\'), it's splitting on each occurrence of the backslash in the string. So, if the string is 'a\\b\\c', then splitting on '\\' would split into ['a', 'b', 'c']? Wait, no. Let me test this in Python.

Let me take a string s = 'a\\b\\c' (which is stored as 'a\b\c'). Then, sep = '\\' (which is a single backslash). Then, s.split(sep) would split on each backslash. So, the result would be ['a', 'b', 'c'].

Yes. Because the string is 'a\b\c', and splitting on '\' gives ['a', 'b', 'c'].

So the code seems correct.

But what about when platform is 'this'? Then, sep is os.sep. For example, on Windows, os.sep is '\', so the code would split on that. On POSIX, it's '/', so split on that.

So the code seems to handle that.

But what about the case when the platform is not 'this', 1, or 0? The docstring says that platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So perhaps the function should handle those cases, and for other values, maybe raise an error. However, the docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps we can assume that the input is valid.

But to be safe, maybe add a check for platform. However, the problem statement says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So perhaps the code can proceed without error checking.

So the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        sep = os.sep
    elif platform == 1:
        sep = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        sep = '\\'
    else:
        # Assuming platform is valid as per docstring, but maybe raise an error?
        # However, the docstring doesn't mention it, so perhaps proceed with default?
        # But the default is 'this', so maybe the else is not needed.
        # Wait, the function's default is platform='this', so the else case would only be if platform is something else. But according to the docstring, platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So perhaps the code can proceed without handling else.

    return s.split(sep)

Wait, but in the code above, if platform is not 'this', 1, or 0, then the code would not have a default. For example, if platform is 2, then the code would not have a sep variable. So, that's an error. But according to the docstring, the platform parameter is either 'this', 1, or 0. So, perhaps the code can assume that the input is valid. However, in practice, it's better to handle invalid inputs. But since the problem statement doesn't mention it, perhaps proceed as per the docstring.

But the function's default is platform='this', so the code should handle that. For other values, perhaps the code will raise an error. But the docstring says that platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So, the code can proceed as written.

But wait, in the code, if platform is not 'this', 1, or 0, then the code would not assign sep, leading to a NameError. So, perhaps the code should handle that. However, the problem statement says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, which don't mention error handling. So perhaps proceed without handling it, assuming that the input is valid.

So the code as written would work.

But let's test some examples.

Example 1: platform is 'this', on Windows.

s = 'a\\b\\c' (stored as 'a\b\c'), sep is os.sep which is '\', so split on '\', returns ['a', 'b', 'c'].

Example 2: platform is 1 (POSIX), s is 'a/b/c', split on '/', returns ['a', 'b', 'c'].

Example 3: platform is 0 (Windows), s is 'a\b\c', split on '\', returns ['a', 'b', 'c'].

But wait, in Python, when you split on a string, consecutive separators are treated as a single separator. For example, 'a//b'.split('/') gives ['a', '', 'b'].

But the function's purpose is to split the path, so perhaps that's acceptable. However, the problem statement doesn't mention handling such cases, so the code should proceed as per the split method.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. However, the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention to generate unit tests first. But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention to generate tests first. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention to generate tests first. But the user's final instruction says to output only the code. So perhaps the code is to be written, and the tests are not required. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips say to generate tests first. However, the user says to output only the code. So perhaps the code is to be written, and the tests are not part of the output. Therefore, the code is as written above.

But the user's initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention to generate unit tests first. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is to be written, and the tests are not part of the output. Therefore, the code is as written.

But the user might have intended that the code includes the tests. However, the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention to generate tests first. But the user says to output only the code generated. Therefore, the code is to be written as per the function signature and docstring, and the tests are not part of the output. Therefore, the code is as written above.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is as written.

But wait, the code as written may have an error. For example, when platform is 0, the separator is '\\', but in Python, when you write sep = '\\', that's a single backslash. So when you split on that, it's correct. But in the code, when platform is 0, sep is set to '\\', which is correct.

Another thing: the function's return is a list of splitting str. So the code returns s.split(sep), which is correct.

But what about empty strings? For example, if s is empty, then split returns [''], which is correct.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the code needs to be written in Python markdown format, which is triple backticks with python as the language. So the code would be:

```python
import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        sep = os.sep
    elif platform == 1:
        sep = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        sep = '\\'
    return s.split(sep)
```

Wait, but what if the platform is not 'this', 1, or 0? For example, if platform is 2. Then, the code would not have a sep variable, leading to a NameError. However, according to the docstring, the platform parameter is either 'this', 1, or 0. So the code can assume that the input is valid. Therefore, the code is correct.

But perhaps the code should handle the case where platform is not one of the allowed values. However, the problem statement does not mention this, so the code proceeds as written.

So the final code is as above.
