Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_choices_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

First, let me understand the function's purpose. The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is one of the available choices. So the function probably takes a list of arguments and verifies each argument against a predefined set of choices. But wait, the function is part of a class (since it's using self), so maybe the choices are defined elsewhere in the class. But the function signature doesn't show any parameters for choices. Hmm, maybe the choices are determined by some other means, like a method or attribute in the class. Or perhaps the function is supposed to check each argument against a list of allowed choices, which might be passed in somehow. Wait, the function's parameters are 'args', which is the received arguments. But how does it know the allowed choices? Maybe the function is part of a class that has a predefined set of choices, like a list or a dictionary. Or perhaps the 'args' is a list of arguments, and each argument needs to be checked against some choices. 

Wait, the function's docstring says "Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices." So maybe 'args' is a single argument, and the function checks if it's in the allowed choices. But the parameter is called 'args' plural, which might suggest multiple arguments. But the function's name is validate_choices_args, which might imply that the arguments are supposed to be choices. Maybe the function is supposed to validate that each argument in 'args' is one of the allowed choices. But how does it know what the allowed choices are? 

This is a bit unclear. Let me think again. Since the function is part of a class, perhaps the allowed choices are stored as an attribute of the class. For example, maybe the class has an attribute like self.choices, and the function checks each argument in 'args' against that. But the function's parameters don't include 'choices', so it must be using some other way to get the allowed choices. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a command-line argument parser, and 'args' refers to the command-line arguments, and the function checks if each argument is one of the allowed choices. But without more context, it's hard to tell. 

Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's proceed with the following assumptions:

1. The function is part of a class that has a predefined list of allowed choices, perhaps stored as self.choices.
2. The 'args' parameter is a list of arguments that need to be validated.
3. The function should check each argument in 'args' to see if it is present in self.choices. If any argument is not found, it raises an exception.

But wait, the function's docstring says "Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices." So maybe 'args' is a single argument, not a list. But the parameter is named 'args' (plural), which is confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 'arg'? Or perhaps 'args' is a list of arguments, and each one needs to be checked. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the 'args' parameter (which is a single value) is one of the allowed choices. But again, the name 'args' is plural. 

This is a bit ambiguous. To proceed, I'll assume that 'args' is a list of arguments, and each argument needs to be checked against the allowed choices. Also, the allowed choices are stored in self.choices. 

So the function would iterate over each argument in 'args', check if it's in self.choices, and if not, raise an error. 

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think about possible test cases. 

Test case 1: All arguments are valid. Should not raise an error.
Test case 2: One argument is invalid. Should raise an error.
Test case 3: Empty args list. Maybe allowed, but depends on the logic.
Test case 4: Args contains None. Depending on the choices, maybe invalid.

But since the function is part of a class, the tests would need to mock or set up the class with the choices. 

For example, in the test, we can create an instance of the class, set self.choices, then call the method with different args.

So, the code for the function would be something like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")
    return True

But wait, the function's docstring says "Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices." So perhaps the function is supposed to return a boolean indicating whether all args are valid. Or maybe it's supposed to raise an exception if any arg is invalid. 

The original function's docstring doesn't specify return value, but in Python, functions can raise exceptions. So the function might raise a ValueError if any argument is not in the allowed choices. 

But the user's example code may vary. 

Now, considering the test cases, let's write them. 

For example, a test where args is valid, and one where it's invalid. 

But since the user wants the code first, perhaps I should proceed to write the code, then the tests. 

But the user said to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So I need to write the tests first. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and to output only the code in python markdown format. But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, but the tips suggest generating tests first. 

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the tests are part of the code. But the user says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. 

But the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips suggest to follow TDD, so first generate tests. However, the user might be expecting the code, not the tests. 

But the user's instruction says to generate the code, but the tips suggest generating tests first. So perhaps the user wants the code, but the assistant is to think through the process, including writing tests. 

But the final output is only the code. 

So perhaps the user wants the code for the function, and the tests are part of the code. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. 

But the user's initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips say to follow TDD. 

This is a bit confusing. However, the user's main request is to generate the code, so I'll proceed to write the code for the function, assuming that the allowed choices are stored in self.choices. 

So the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    
    :param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")
    return True

But wait, the function's name is validate_choices_args, which might imply that it's validating that the arguments are choices. 

But what if the 'args' is a single argument? Then the code would check if it's in self.choices. 

Alternatively, maybe 'args' is a single argument, and the function checks if it's in the choices. 

But the parameter is named 'args', which is plural. 

This is a bit ambiguous. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' parameter (a single value) is one of the allowed choices. 

In that case, the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    
    :param args: The received arguments.
    """
    if args not in self.choices:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {args}")
    return True

But again, the parameter name is 'args', which is plural. 

This is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a method to get the choices, and the 'args' is a single argument. 

But without more context, it's hard to tell. 

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the assumption that 'args' is a single argument, and the function checks if it's in self.choices. 

So the code would be as above. 

But the user's docstring says "Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices." So perhaps 'args' is a single argument. 

But the parameter is named 'args' (plural), which might be a mistake. 

In any case, the code would need to check if the argument is in the allowed choices. 

So the code would be as follows. 

Now, for the unit tests. 

Assuming that the class has an attribute self.choices, the tests would create an instance of the class, set self.choices, and call the method with different arguments. 

For example:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, choices):
        self.choices = choices
    
    def validate_choices_args(self, args):
        # code here

Then, the tests would be:

import unittest

class TestValidateChoicesArgs(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_args(self):
        obj = MyClass(choices=['a', 'b', 'c'])
        obj.validate_choices_args('a')  # should pass
    
    def test_invalid_args(self):
        obj = MyClass(choices=['a', 'b', 'c'])
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            obj.validate_choices_args('d')
    
    def test_multiple_args(self):
        obj = MyClass(choices=['a', 'b', 'c'])
        obj.validate_choices_args(['a', 'b'])  # should pass
    
    def test_invalid_multiple_args(self):
        obj = MyClass(choices=['a', 'b', 'c'])
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            obj.validate_choices_args(['a', 'd'])

But wait, in the initial code, if 'args' is a single argument, then the test_multiple_args would pass if 'args' is a list. But if the function expects a single argument, then passing a list would be invalid. 

This depends on how the function is intended to be used. 

This is getting a bit too ambiguous. 

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the function is supposed to validate that each argument in 'args' (a list) is in the choices. 

So the code would iterate over each argument in the list. 

In that case, the tests would include cases where args is a list. 

But the function's name is validate_choices_args, which might imply that the arguments are choices. 

In any case, the code would need to check each argument. 

So, the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    
    :param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")
    return True

But then, the function returns True if all are valid. 

But the user's docstring doesn't mention return value. 

But the function's purpose is to validate, so it's common to raise an exception on invalid input. 

So the code would raise an error if any argument is invalid. 

Now, for the unit tests, assuming that the function is part of a class with self.choices. 

But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I'll have to assume that. 

So the code would be as above. 

Now, the user wants the code generated, in python markdown format. 

So the final code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    
    :param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")
    return True

But wait, the function's name is validate_choices_args, which might imply that it's validating the arguments against choices. 

But if 'args' is a single argument, then the code would check if it's in self.choices. 

But the code as written would iterate over each element in 'args' if it's an iterable. 

So, for example, if 'args' is a list, it checks each element. If 'args' is a single value, it would check that value. 

This seems flexible. 

So, the code would handle both cases. 

Now, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. 

So the final answer is the code as written above.
