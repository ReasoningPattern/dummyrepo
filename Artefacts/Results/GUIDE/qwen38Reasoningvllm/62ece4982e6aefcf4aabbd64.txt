Okay, I need to create a Python function called strip_root that takes a path and a root, and removes the root from the path. If it fails, it should throw an exception. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to remove the root directory from a given path. For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', the result should be 'user/docs'. But how do I handle different operating systems? Oh, maybe the function should handle both Unix and Windows paths, but the problem doesn't specify. Maybe I should assume that the paths are normalized, or perhaps use os.path to handle the path manipulations.

Wait, the function needs to throw an exception if it fails. So I need to check if the root is a prefix of the path. If not, raise an exception. Also, what if the root is not a directory? Or if the path is not absolute? Hmm, the problem says "if fails, throw exception", but what are the failure conditions?

Let me think about possible failure scenarios. For example, if the root is not a prefix of the path, or if the root is empty, or if the path is empty. Also, maybe the root is not a valid directory. Wait, but the function's parameters are just strings. So maybe the function doesn't check if the root exists as a directory, just checks if it's a prefix.

So the steps for the function:

1. Check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception.
2. Remove the root from the path. But how? For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and root is '/home', then the result is 'user/docs'. But if the path is 'home/user/docs' and root is '/home', then it's not a prefix, so raise an error.

Wait, the problem says "remove root from path". So the root must be a prefix of the path. So the first thing is to check if the path starts with the root. But how to handle cases where the root is a directory? For example, if the path is '/home/user' and the root is '/home', then the result is 'user'. But if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', then the result is 'user/docs'.

But what if the root is not a prefix? Like, path is '/home/user' and root is '/usr'? Then it's invalid. So the function should raise an exception in that case.

So the function should:

- Check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise ValueError or something.

But how to handle cases where the root is empty? Like, if root is an empty string, then the path is just the path. But maybe the root is supposed to be a directory. But the problem says "if fails, throw exception", so maybe we need to handle that.

Wait, the function's parameters are path and root. So the root could be any string. Let me think about possible cases:

Case 1: path is '/home/user/docs', root is '/home' → result is 'user/docs'.

Case 2: path is 'home/user/docs', root is '/home' → path does not start with root → exception.

Case 3: root is empty string → then the path is returned as is. But maybe that's considered a failure? Or is it allowed? The problem says "if fails, throw exception". So perhaps if the root is empty, it's considered invalid? Or maybe it's allowed. Hmm, the problem's docstring says "If fails, throw exception", but it's not clear what constitutes a failure. So perhaps the function should check that the root is a valid prefix of the path. So if the root is empty, then the path is considered to start with it. But maybe that's not intended. Alternatively, maybe the root is supposed to be a directory, and the path is supposed to be under that directory. But the function's parameters don't specify that. So perhaps the function should check that the path starts with the root, and if not, raise an exception.

So, the first step is to check if the path starts with the root. But how to handle cases where the root is a directory. For example, if the path is '/home/user/docs' and the root is '/home', then it's valid. But if the root is '/home/', then the path starts with that? Well, in Python, the startswith method checks for a prefix. So if the root is '/home/', then the path '/home/user/docs' starts with '/home/'? No, because '/home' is not the same as '/home/'. So perhaps the function should normalize the paths. For example, using os.path.normpath or something.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about normalizing the paths. So perhaps the function should treat the path and root as strings, and check if the path starts with the root. But then, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user', then the result is 'user'. But if the root is '/home/' (with a trailing slash), then the path starts with that? Well, no. Because '/home' is not the same as '/home/'.

So perhaps the function should normalize the paths by removing trailing slashes. Or maybe the function should check if the root is a prefix of the path, regardless of trailing slashes. But that's unclear. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the function should assume that the root is a prefix of the path, and if not, raise an exception.

So, the function's code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is empty? Then, path starts with empty string, so it returns the entire path. But maybe that's considered a failure? The problem says "if fails, throw exception". So maybe the root cannot be empty. Or maybe the function should check that the root is not empty. So, perhaps adding checks for root being empty or path being empty.

But the problem's docstring says "If fails, throw exception". So perhaps the function should raise an exception if the root is empty, or if the path is empty, or if the root is not a prefix of the path.

So, possible checks:

- If root is empty string → raise ValueError.

- If path is empty string → raise ValueError.

- If path does not start with root → raise ValueError.

But what about if the root is a directory that's not a prefix? Like, path is '/home/user' and root is '/usr' → then it's invalid.

So, the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not root:
        raise ValueError("Root cannot be empty")
    if not path:
        raise ValueError("Path cannot be empty")
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, what if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home'? Then, the result is an empty string. But maybe that's acceptable. The function returns a path without the root. So, in that case, it's empty.

But perhaps the function should also check that the root is a valid directory. But the problem doesn't mention that. The function's parameters are just strings. So, perhaps the function doesn't need to check if the root exists as a directory. It's just a string operation.

So, the code would be as above. But what about cases where the root is a prefix but not exactly? Like, path is '/home/user' and root is '/home/user'? Then, the result is empty string. Which is acceptable.

But what about if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs'? Then, the code returns 'user/docs'.

But what if the path is '/home/user' and the root is '/home'? Then, the code returns 'user'.

But what about if the root is '/home/' (with a trailing slash) and the path is '/home/user'? Then, path.startswith(root) would be False, because '/home' is not the same as '/home/'. So, the code would raise an error. But maybe the user expects that the root is normalized. So perhaps the function should normalize the paths by removing trailing slashes before checking.

But the problem doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the function should not do that. However, in practice, when dealing with file paths, it's common to normalize them. So maybe the function should normalize both the path and the root by removing trailing slashes. But how to do that?

For example, in Python, you can use os.path.normpath, but that may also handle other OS-specific path separators. However, the problem doesn't specify whether the paths are Unix-style or Windows-style. So perhaps the function should handle them as strings, and not use os.path functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should normalize the paths by removing trailing slashes. For example, if the root is '/home/', then the code would check if the path starts with '/home/'.

But perhaps the user expects that the root is a directory, and the path is under that directory. So, for example, if the root is '/home', then the path should start with '/home', and the function returns the rest. But if the root is '/home/', then the path must start with '/home/'.

But this depends on how the root is provided. Since the function's parameters are just strings, perhaps the function should not normalize them. So, the code as written earlier would work.

But then, the function may raise an error when the root has a trailing slash, but the path doesn't. For example, root is '/home/', path is '/home/user' → starts with? No. So the code raises an error. But maybe the user intended that the root is '/home', and the path is '/home/user', which is valid.

So, perhaps the function should normalize the root by removing trailing slashes. But how to do that? For example, in Python, you can check if the root ends with a slash, and if so, remove it. But that's not foolproof. For example, if the root is '/home', then it's fine. If the root is '/home/', then we can remove the trailing slash. So, perhaps the function should normalize the root by stripping trailing slashes.

But again, the problem doesn't specify this. So maybe the function should not do that. However, the problem says that the function should throw an exception if it fails. So perhaps the function should check that the root is a prefix of the path, and if not, raise an exception.

So, the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not root:
        raise ValueError("Root cannot be empty")
    if not path:
        raise ValueError("Path cannot be empty")
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

But what if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user'? Then, the code returns 'user'.

But what if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home'? Then, the code returns an empty string. Which is correct.

But what if the path is '/home/user' and the root is '/home/user'? Then, the code returns an empty string. Which is correct.

But what if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs'? Then, the code returns 'user/docs'.

But what if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs' but the root is actually a directory that doesn't exist? Well, the function doesn't check for that. It just checks if the path starts with the root. So, the function doesn't validate the existence of the root directory. That's probably correct, as the function's parameters are just strings.

So, the code seems to handle the cases. But perhaps the function should also check that the root is a directory. But again, the problem doesn't mention that. So, perhaps not.

Now, the user wants to generate unit tests first. So, following test-driven development.

Let me think about the test cases.

Test case 1: path starts with root. For example, path='/home/user', root='/home' → returns 'user'.

Test case 2: path is exactly the root. For example, path='/home', root='/home' → returns empty string.

Test case 3: path does not start with root. For example, path='/usr', root='/home' → raises ValueError.

Test case 4: root is empty string → raises ValueError.

Test case 5: path is empty string → raises ValueError.

Test case 6: root has trailing slash. For example, path='/home/user', root='/home/' → path does not start with root → raises ValueError.

Test case 7: root is '/home', path is '/home/' → returns '/'.

Wait, in this case, path is '/home/', root is '/home' → path starts with root, so returns '/'. Which is correct.

But if the root is '/home/', and the path is '/home/', then returns empty string.

But if the root is '/home/' and the path is '/home/user', then the code raises an error, because the path does not start with the root.

So, the code handles that.

Now, writing the unit tests. Let's think about using Python's unittest module.

But the user wants the code to be generated, and the tests first. So, first, generate the tests, then the code.

So, the tests would be:

import unittest

class TestStripRoot(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_case(self):
        self.assertEqual(strip_root('/home/user', '/home'), 'user')

    def test_path_equal_to_root(self):
        self.assertEqual(strip_root('/home', '/home'), '')

    def test_invalid_root(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            strip_root('/usr', '/home')

    def test_empty_root(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            strip_root('/home/user', '')

    def test_empty_path(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            strip_root('', '/home')

    def test_root_with_trailing_slash(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            strip_root('/home/user', '/home/')

    def test_path_with_trailing_slash(self):
        self.assertEqual(strip_root('/home/', '/home'), '/')

But wait, in the test_path_with_trailing_slash, the path is '/home/', root is '/home', so the code returns '/', which is correct.

But what about if the root is '/home/' and the path is '/home/'? Then, the code returns empty string.

So, the tests cover these cases.

Now, the code for the function would be as discussed earlier.

But wait, what about if the path is 'home/user' (without leading slash) and the root is '/home'? Then, path.startswith(root) would be False, so it raises an error. Which is correct.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Now, the user wants the code generated, but the assistant is supposed to output only the code, in Python markdown format. But the user also said to follow a test-driven approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests.

But the user's main request is to generate the code. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the tips suggest generating tests first. However, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, perhaps the user wants the code, but the assistant is supposed to generate the code, but the thinking process includes generating tests. However, the final answer should only be the code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. So, perhaps the code is as follows:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not root:
        raise ValueError("Root cannot be empty")
    if not path:
        raise ValueError("Path cannot be empty")
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

But wait, the docstring says "If fails, throw exception". So, the function should raise an exception if any of the conditions are not met. The code does that.

But what about cases where the root is not a prefix? For example, path is '/home/user', root is '/usr' → raises ValueError.

But what about if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs'? Then, the code returns 'user/docs'.

But what if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/docs' but the root is not a directory? Well, the function doesn't check that. It just checks if the path starts with the root. So, the function is correct as per the problem's description.

So, the code is as above.

But the user's docstring says "If fails, throw exception". So, the code raises exceptions in cases where the root is empty, path is empty, or the path does not start with the root.

So, that's the code.
