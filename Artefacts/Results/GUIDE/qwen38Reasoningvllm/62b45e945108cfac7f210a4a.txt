Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_hierarchy function based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

Let me start by understanding the function's purpose. The function is supposed to validate a storage root hierarchy. The parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings. The return values are num_objects (number of objects checked) and good_objects (number that were valid).

First, I need to think about what the function might do. It probably checks the hierarchy structure, maybe verifying that objects exist, their digests are correct, etc. But since the actual implementation isn't provided, I need to make assumptions.

For the unit tests, I should create test cases that cover different scenarios. For example:

1. Test when validate_objects is False, so it skips object validation.
2. Test when check_digests is False, so it skips digest checks.
3. Test when show_warnings is True, expecting warnings to be printed.
4. Test cases with different numbers of objects, some valid and some not.
5. Edge cases, like empty hierarchy or no objects.

But since the actual code isn't written yet, the tests need to be written in a way that they can be run against the implementation. However, since the code isn't there yet, maybe the tests can be stubbed or use mocks.

Wait, but the user wants me to generate the code first, then the tests. Wait no, the user said to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the initial step is to write the tests, then the code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but also to follow TDD by generating tests first. However, the user's message says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So maybe the user wants the code, but the thinking process includes considering TDD.

But perhaps the user wants the code, but the assistant is supposed to think through how to approach writing the code, considering TDD. However, the final output is just the code, not the tests. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But the tips mention to follow TDD approach, first generating tests. However, the user says to output only the code. So maybe the tests are not required in the output, but the code is.

But perhaps the user is confused. Let me recheck the original problem.

The user provided a function signature and docstring, and says to generate Python code based on that, following TDD approach (so first generate tests, then code). But the output should be only the code. So maybe the tests are part of the code, but the user wants the code for the function, not the tests. Or maybe the user wants the code and the tests. But the instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So perhaps the user wants the code for the validate_hierarchy function. But the thinking process includes considering TDD, but the output is only the code.

So I need to write the code for the function. Let's think about what the function does.

The function is part of a class (since it's a method with self). It validates the storage root hierarchy. The parameters are:

- validate_objects: if True, check if objects exist.
- check_digests: if True, check if digests are correct.
- show_warnings: if True, display warnings.

The return values are num_objects and good_objects.

So, the function probably traverses the hierarchy, checks each object, and counts how many were checked and how many were valid.

But without knowing the actual structure of the storage hierarchy, it's hard to implement. So perhaps the function is part of a class that has a storage structure, like a tree or some data structure.

Assuming that the class has a method or attribute that allows accessing the storage hierarchy, like a root node or a list of objects.

But since the code isn't provided, I need to make assumptions. Let's think of a possible implementation.

For example, the class might have a root directory, and each object has a path, a digest, etc. The function would traverse the hierarchy, check each object's existence (if validate_objects is True), check their digests (if check_digests is True), and count the valid ones.

But to implement this, the function would need to access the storage structure. Since the function is part of a class, perhaps the class has a method to get all objects in the hierarchy.

But without knowing the actual structure, I have to make some assumptions. Let's proceed.

Let me outline the steps the function might take:

1. Initialize counters: num_objects = 0, good_objects = 0.

2. Traverse the storage hierarchy (e.g., starting from the root).

3. For each object in the hierarchy:

   a. Increment num_objects by 1.

   b. If validate_objects is True, check if the object exists. If not, mark as invalid.

   c. If check_digests is True, check if the digest matches expected. If not, mark as invalid.

   d. If the object is valid, increment good_objects.

   e. If show_warnings is True, and the object is invalid, print a warning.

4. Return num_objects and good_objects.

But how to traverse the hierarchy? The class might have a method like get_objects() that returns all objects, or perhaps the hierarchy is represented as a tree structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a root directory, and the function traverses all files in that directory and its subdirectories.

But again, without knowing the actual structure, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a storage root, and the function checks the hierarchy by verifying that all objects are present and their digests are correct.

But to proceed, I need to write code that can be tested. Let's think of a simple implementation.

Let me assume that the class has a list of objects, each with a 'valid' attribute, and a 'digest' attribute. Or perhaps the function checks if the object's path exists, and if the digest matches.

But for the sake of writing code, perhaps the function can be implemented as follows:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    # Assume self.storage is a list of objects to check
    for obj in self.storage:
        num_objects += 1
        is_valid = True
        if validate_objects:
            # Check if object exists
            if not obj.exists():
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj.path} does not exist.")
        if check_digests:
            # Check if digest is correct
            if obj.digest != obj.expected_digest:
                is_valid = False
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for {obj.path}.")
        if is_valid:
            good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is a hypothetical implementation. However, the actual code would depend on the class's structure.

But since the user hasn't provided the class structure, this is a possible approach.

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should match the function signature, and the docstring.

So the code would be as follows, with the function as described.

But since the user wants the code, and the thinking process is about how to approach it, but the output is only the code, I'll proceed to write the code.

Now, considering that the function is part of a class, perhaps the class has a method to get all objects in the hierarchy. Let's assume that the class has a 'root' attribute, which is the root of the storage hierarchy, and that the root has a method to traverse all objects.

Alternatively, maybe the class has a 'objects' list.

But without knowing, I'll proceed with a sample implementation.

So the code would look like:

class StorageManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.objects = []  # Assume this is a list of objects to validate

    def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
        """
        Validate storage root hierarchy.

        Returns:
            num_objects - number of objects checked
            good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
        """
        num_objects = 0
        good_objects = 0
        for obj in self.objects:
            num_objects += 1
            is_valid = True
            if validate_objects:
                # Check if the object exists (hypothetical method)
                if not obj.exists():
                    is_valid = False
                    if show_warnings:
                        print(f"Warning: Object {obj.path} does not exist.")
            if check_digests:
                # Check if the digest matches (hypothetical attribute)
                if obj.digest != obj.expected_digest:
                    is_valid = False
                    if show_warnings:
                        print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for {obj.path}.")
            if is_valid:
                good_objects += 1
        return num_objects, good_objects

But this is a possible implementation. However, the actual code would depend on the class's structure. Since the user hasn't provided that, this is a plausible approach.

But the user's function is part of a class, and the code should be written accordingly.

So the final code would be as above, with the function inside the class.

But the user's function is called validate_hierarchy, and the parameters are as given.

So the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
        """
        Validate storage root hierarchy.

        Returns:
            num_objects - number of objects checked
            good_objects - number of objects checked that were found to be valid
        """
        num_objects = 0
        good_objects = 0
        # Assume self.storage is a list of objects to check
        for obj in self.storage:
            num_objects += 1
            is_valid = True
            if validate_objects:
                # Check if object exists
                if not obj.exists():
                    is_valid = False
                    if show_warnings:
                        print(f"Warning: Object {obj.path} does not exist.")
            if check_digests:
                # Check digest
                if obj.digest != obj.expected_digest:
                    is_valid = False
                    if show_warnings:
                        print(f"Warning: Digest mismatch for {obj.path}.")
            if is_valid:
                good_objects += 1
        return num_objects, good_objects

But since the actual class and object structure are not provided, this is a hypothetical implementation.

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So this code would fit.

So the final code is as written above.
