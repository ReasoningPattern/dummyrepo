Okay, I need to generate Python code for the pretty method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the docstring says.

The docstring mentions that the method returns a pretty formatted representation of self. The example shows that if self.obj is a string, it's enclosed in single quotes, else it's the repr of the object. Then, it's indented and formatted with the class name and debug details.

Wait, the return line seems to have a placeholder for debug_details. The original code in the docstring is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again.

The return statement is: (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})". So the debug_details is part of the string. But where does debug_details come from? The method has a debug parameter. Maybe when debug is True, it includes some debug information.

Wait, the original docstring might have a typo. Let me check again. The user provided the docstring as:

Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Ah, so the docstring is a bit broken. The actual code is supposed to generate the string. The obj is determined based on whether self.obj is a string. Then, the return is the indented string with the class name, debug_details, and obj.

But the debug_details part is unclear. Maybe when debug is True, it appends some debug info. For example, maybe if debug is True, it adds something like ", debug=True" or similar. But the original code in the docstring shows that debug_details is part of the format string.

Wait, the original code in the docstring is written as:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the debug_details is a variable that's part of the format. But where is debug_details defined? The method has a debug parameter. Perhaps debug_details is a string that includes the debug parameter's value. For example, if debug is True, maybe it adds something like ", debug=True".

But the original docstring doesn't explain this. Maybe the user intended that when debug is True, the debug_details is something like ", debug=True", and when False, it's empty. Or maybe it's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a placeholder for some debug information. But since the user hasn't provided more details, I need to make an assumption based on the given information.

Wait, looking back at the original function signature: the method is part of a class (since it's using self). The method is called pretty, and it's supposed to return a pretty representation. The example in the docstring shows that obj is either a quoted string or repr of self.obj. Then, the return is the class name, followed by debug_details and obj, indented.

But the debug_details part is unclear. Maybe the user intended that when debug is True, it includes some debug information. For example, perhaps the debug_details is a string that includes the debug parameter's value. Let me think: maybe the debug_details is something like ", debug={debug}".

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that is empty unless debug is True, in which case it adds something. But without more info, I need to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the original code in the docstring was meant to have debug_details as a variable that's computed based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is something like ", debug=True", else empty. But how to implement that.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is part of the format string. Let me try to reconstruct the code.

The original code in the docstring is:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So, the debug_details is a variable that is part of the format string. But where is it defined? The method has a debug parameter. So perhaps debug_details is a string that includes the debug parameter's value. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is ", debug=True", else empty. But how to handle that.

Wait, maybe the user intended that when debug is True, the debug_details is something like ", debug=True", and when False, it's empty. So the code would generate something like ClassName(obj) with debug info if needed.

But how to implement that. Let me think. The method has a debug parameter. So, perhaps:

debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""

But then, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But wait, the original docstring's return line is:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the debug_details is part of the format string. So, if debug is True, then debug_details is something like ", debug=True", else empty. Then, the class name is followed by debug_details and obj.

But perhaps the debug_details is not just the debug parameter. Maybe the user intended that when debug is True, it includes some debug information, like the object's attributes or something else. But without more info, I have to go with the given.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that is empty unless debug is True, in which case it adds something. But how to know. Since the user provided the docstring, perhaps the original code was intended to have debug_details as a variable that is computed based on the debug parameter.

So, given that, I'll proceed with that assumption. So, the code would generate the debug_details string based on the debug parameter.

But then, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But wait, the original docstring's return line has debug_details and obj. So, for example, if debug is True, then the string would be ClassName(debug=True, obj), but that might not be correct. Wait, the original code in the docstring shows that the format is ClassName(debug_details)obj. So, maybe the debug_details is something like ", debug=True" and then the obj is the object's representation.

But perhaps the debug_details is supposed to include the debug parameter's value. So, the code would include that.

But then, the user's example in the docstring may have a typo. For example, the original code in the docstring shows:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So, the debug_details is part of the format string. So, if debug_details is ", debug=True", then the entire string would be ClassName(debug=True, obj), but that's not correct. Wait, no. Let's say the class name is MyObject, and obj is some value. Then the string would be MyObject(debug=True, obj). But that's not the usual way to format objects. Usually, it's MyObject(obj), and if debug is True, maybe it adds something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that includes the debug parameter's value. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is ", debug=True", else empty. Then, the code would generate something like MyObject(debug=True, obj), but that's not standard. But given the user's docstring, that's what the code would do.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that is empty unless debug is True, in which case it adds something like ", debug=True".

But without more information, I'll proceed with that approach.

So, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return " " * indent + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But wait, the original docstring's return line has the debug_details and obj. So, the code would generate a string like ClassName(debug_details)obj. For example, if debug is True, then it's ClassName(debug=True, obj). But that would be the case.

But perhaps the user intended that debug_details is something else. For example, maybe when debug is True, it includes the object's attributes or something else. But without more info, I can't know. So, I'll proceed with the assumption that debug_details is ", debug=True" when debug is True, else empty.

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So, I need to create test cases for this method.

Let me think about possible test cases.

First, the method is part of a class. Let's assume that the class has an attribute called obj. For example, let's say the class is called MyObject, and it has an obj attribute.

Test case 1: obj is a string. So, when pretty is called, the obj should be quoted. For example, if self.obj is "hello", then the output should be "MyObject('hello')".

Test case 2: obj is not a string. For example, an integer. Then, repr(obj) is used. So, if obj is 42, then the output is "MyObject(42)".

Test case 3: debug is True. Then, the debug_details is added. So, the output would be "MyObject(debug=True, 42)".

Test case 4: indent is non-zero. For example, indent=2, so the string is indented with two spaces.

Test case 5: combining all parameters. For example, indent=2, debug=True, obj is a string.

But to write the tests, I need to create a class with the pretty method. So, perhaps the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.obj = obj

    def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
        # code here

Then, the tests would test this class.

So, the unit tests would need to create instances of MyClass and call the pretty method with various parameters.

But the user's original code is part of a class, but the exact class isn't given. However, the method is part of a class, so the tests would need to be written against that class.

So, the unit tests would look like:

import unittest

class TestPrettyMethod(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_string_obj(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty()
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass('hello')")

    def test_non_string_obj(self):
        obj = MyClass(42)
        result = obj.pretty()
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass(42)")

    def test_debug_true(self):
        obj = MyClass(42)
        result = obj.pretty(debug=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass(debug=True, 42)")

    def test_indent(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty(indent=2)
        self.assertEqual(result, "  MyClass('hello')")

    def test_all_parameters(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty(indent=2, debug=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, "  MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')")

But wait, in the case of debug=True, the debug_details is ", debug=True", so the format would be "MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')".

But in the code, the debug_details is added before the obj. So, the code would generate "MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')".

But in the test case, the expected result is "MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')".

But in the code, the obj is f"'{self.obj}'" if it's a string. So for the test case where obj is "hello", the obj is "'hello'". So the code would generate "MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')".

But in the test case, the expected result is "MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')", which matches.

So, the tests would be written accordingly.

But the user's original code may have different behavior. For example, maybe the debug_details is not ", debug=True", but something else. But given the information, I proceed with that.

Now, the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So, I need to generate the code for the pretty method, and the unit tests.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code for the pretty method, and the unit tests.

Wait, the user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the function signature is given as:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    """
    Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
    """

So, the code for the pretty method is to be generated. But the docstring is a bit broken. The user's docstring has a line that says "return ...", but it's not properly formatted. So, the actual code is to be written based on that.

So, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
    return " " * indent + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But the user's docstring says that the return line is:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So, the code would be as above.

But the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven approach, so I need to generate the unit tests first. However, the user says to output only the code generated. So, perhaps the code includes both the method and the tests.

But the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the code generated is the pretty method, and the unit tests. But the user might expect the code for the method and the tests.

But the original question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code for the method. However, the user also said to follow a test-driven approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So, perhaps the answer should include both the tests and the code.

But the user says to output only the code generated. So, perhaps the code includes the method and the tests.

But the user's original function signature is part of a class. So, the code would be part of a class. For example:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.obj = obj

    def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
        obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
        debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
        return " " * indent + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Then, the unit tests would be as I wrote before.

But the user's original function is part of a class, but the class name isn't given. So, perhaps the code is part of a class with a generic name, like 'MyClass'.

But the user's docstring mentions self.obj, so the class must have an obj attribute.

So, the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.obj = obj

    def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
        obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
        debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
        return " " * indent + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Then, the unit tests would be written as:

import unittest

class TestPrettyMethod(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_string_obj(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty()
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass('hello')")

    def test_non_string_obj(self):
        obj = MyClass(42)
        result = obj.pretty()
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass(42)")

    def test_debug_true(self):
        obj = MyClass(42)
        result = obj.pretty(debug=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass(debug=True, 42)")

    def test_indent(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty(indent=2)
        self.assertEqual(result, "  MyClass('hello')")

    def test_all_parameters(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty(indent=2, debug=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, "  MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')")

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So, the code would include both the class and the tests.

But the user's original function is part of a class. So, the code generated should include the class and the method, and the tests.

But the user's question says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code for the method. However, the user also said to follow a test-driven approach, so the code should include the tests.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So, perhaps the code includes the method and the tests.

But the user's original function signature is part of a class. So, the code would be part of a class. Therefore, the code generated would be the class with the pretty method and the unit tests.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Now, let me check the code again. For example, when debug is True, the debug_details is ", debug=True", so the format is ClassName(debug=True, obj). But what if the obj is a string? For example, if obj is "hello", then the obj is "'hello'", so the result would be "MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')".

But in the test case, that's what is expected.

Another test case: if obj is a list, like [1, 2, 3], then repr(obj) would be '[1, 2, 3]', so the result would be "MyClass([1, 2, 3])".

But in the case of debug=True, it would be "MyClass(debug=True, [1, 2, 3])".

So, the code seems correct.

Now, the user's docstring says that the return line is:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So, the code uses the debug_details and obj in the format string.

Thus, the code should be as written.

Now, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So, the code should be enclosed in triple backticks.

So, the final code would be:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.obj = obj

    def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
        obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
        debug_details = ", debug=True" if debug else ""
        return " " * indent + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

import unittest

class TestPrettyMethod(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_string_obj(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty()
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass('hello')")

    def test_non_string_obj(self):
        obj = MyClass(42)
        result = obj.pretty()
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass(42)")

    def test_debug_true(self):
        obj = MyClass(42)
        result = obj.pretty(debug=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, "MyClass(debug=True, 42)")

    def test_indent(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty(indent=2)
        self.assertEqual(result, "  MyClass('hello')")

    def test_all_parameters(self):
        obj = MyClass("hello")
        result = obj.pretty(indent=2, debug=True)
        self.assertEqual(result, "  MyClass(debug=True, 'hello')")
```

But wait, the user's original function signature is part of a class, but the class name isn't given. So, the code uses MyClass as the class name. That's acceptable for the purpose of the example.

So, this should be the code generated.
