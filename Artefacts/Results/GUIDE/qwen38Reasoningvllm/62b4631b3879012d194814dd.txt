Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function fix_namespace_prefix_w. The function's purpose is to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=" in the given content. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a string 'content' as input. The task is straightforward: replace all occurrences of "w:st=" with "w-st=". But wait, maybe there are edge cases? Like overlapping occurrences or other parts of the string that might have similar patterns. But according to the docstring, it's just a direct replacement.

So the simplest way is to use the string's replace method. Like content.replace("w:st=", "w-st="). But maybe I should check if there's any possibility of partial matches. For example, if there's a substring like "w:st=another", replacing "w:st=" would correctly change it to "w-st=another". So the replace method should handle that.

Wait, but what if the content is None? The function might need to handle that. However, the problem statement doesn't mention handling None, so perhaps we can assume that 'content' is a string. But to be safe, maybe add a check. However, the original function signature doesn't have any error handling, so maybe it's expected to just process the input as is.

So the code would be:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

But wait, the user mentioned test-driven development. So I should first write unit tests. Let me think about possible test cases.

Test case 1: content is "w:st=example", expected output "w-st=example".

Test case 2: content has multiple occurrences, like "w:st=abc w:st=def", should become "w-st=abc w-st=def".

Test case 3: content doesn't have the substring, so returns the same.

Test case 4: content is empty string, returns empty.

Test case 5: content has other similar parts, like "w:st=xyz", which should be replaced.

But how to write these tests? Using Python's unittest framework.

So the tests would be:

import unittest

class TestFixNamespacePrefixW(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_replacement(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=example"), "w-st=example")
    
    def test_multiple_replacements(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=abc w:st=def"), "w-st=abc w-st=def")
    
    def test_no_replacement(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("no match here"), "no match here")
    
    def test_empty_string(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w(""), "")
    
    def test_partial_match(self):
        self.assertEqual(fix_namespace_prefix_w("w:st=xyz"), "w-st=xyz")

But wait, the original function is supposed to replace "w:st=" exactly. So the test cases should cover these scenarios.

Now, the actual code is simple. But maybe the user wants the code to be written with some considerations. For example, if the content is not a string, but the function is supposed to handle it. However, since the function's docstring says it's replacing in the content, perhaps it's intended that content is a string. So the code is straightforward.

So the final code is just the replace method. But the user wants the code generated, and the tests. But the user said to output only the code generated in python markdown format. Wait, the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The tips mention to follow TDD, generating tests first. But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So perhaps the user wants the actual function code, not the tests. But the tips say to generate tests first. However, the user's main request is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the tests are part of the code? Or perhaps the user wants the function code, and the tests are part of the code.

But the initial problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code to generate is the function itself. The tips mention TDD, but perhaps the user wants the function code, not the tests. However, the user might have intended to have the tests as part of the code. But the original problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the function code is the main thing.

But the user's example shows that the function is to be written. So the answer should be the function code. However, the tips say to generate tests first. But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the function code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is the function.

But the user's example shows that the function is to be written. So the answer is the function code. However, the user's tips mention TDD, but perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. So the answer is the function code.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is the function. So the code is:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    """
    Replace "w:st=" in content with "w-st=".
    """
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

But wait, maybe there's a case where the replacement could have overlapping or other issues. For example, if the content is "w:st=w:st=", replacing once would turn it into "w-st=w:st=". But the function is supposed to replace all occurrences. The replace method in Python replaces all occurrences by default. So that's correct.

So the code is as simple as that. Therefore, the generated code is the function with the replace method.
