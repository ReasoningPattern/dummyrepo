Okay, I need to generate Python code for the to_csv method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is part of a class, probably a Graph class. The method converts the graph's points into a CSV format. The parameters are separator (default comma) and header (optional). The docstring mentions that it's deprecated in Lena 0.5, so maybe it's not supposed to be used anymore, but the code still needs to be written.

First, the function should take each point in the graph. Each point has coordinates and values. The coordinates are converted to strings separated by the separator. Then each part of the value is added. Wait, the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So, the coordinates are split by the separator, then the value parts are added. But how exactly?

Wait, maybe the coordinates are a list of values, and each coordinate is converted to a string, then joined with the separator. Then, the value parts are added. For example, if a point has coordinates (x, y) and value (a, b), then the CSV line would be x_str+separator+y_str+separator+a_str+separator+b_str?

But the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So the coordinate part is converted to a string with the separator, then the value parts are added. So the coordinate part is split into parts, converted to strings, joined with the separator, then the value parts are added. Wait, maybe the coordinate is a tuple, and each element is converted to a string, then joined with the separator. Then the value is also a tuple, each element converted to string, joined with the separator. Then the entire line is coordinate_str + separator + value_str?

But the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinate is converted to a string with the separator, then the value parts are added. But how are the value parts structured? Maybe the value is a list or tuple of parts, each converted to string and joined with the separator. So the entire line is coordinate_str + separator + value_str?

Wait, the example in the docstring isn't given, but the description says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted to string (split by separator), then each part of its value. So perhaps the coordinate is a list of values, and each is converted to string, joined by the separator. Then the value is also a list of values, each converted to string, joined by the separator. Then the entire line is coordinate_str + separator + value_str?

But the function's purpose is to convert the graph's points to CSV. So the method should iterate over all points in the graph, and for each, generate a line in CSV format.

Now, the header parameter: if not None, it's the first line. So if header is provided, it's added as the first line, followed by a newline. So the header is a single string, and then each point's line is added.

But the docstring says that the header is the first string of the output, with a new line added automatically. So, for example, if header is "x,y,value", then that line is written, then each point's line.

Now, the function is deprecated, but the code still needs to be written. So the code should generate the CSV as per the description.

Now, considering that the Graph class has points. Let's assume that the Graph has a 'points' attribute, which is a list of points. Each point has 'coordinates' and 'value' attributes. For example, a point might have coordinates (x, y) and value (a, b). So for each point, we need to convert coordinates to strings separated by the separator, then the value parts.

Wait, but how are the coordinates and values structured? For example, if the coordinates are a tuple, then each element is converted to a string, joined with the separator. Then the value is also a tuple, each element converted to string, joined with the separator. Then the entire line is coordinate_str + separator + value_str?

But the docstring says "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value." So maybe the coordinate is split into parts, converted to strings, joined by the separator, then the value parts are added. But the value parts are also split into parts, converted to strings, joined by the separator. So the entire line would be coordinate_str + separator + value_str?

But the separator is the same for both. So the code would be something like:

for each point in self.points:
    coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coordinates)
    value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
    line = coord_str + separator + value_str
    add to the output

But then, the header is optional. If header is provided, it's added as the first line.

Wait, but the docstring says "header, if not None, is the first string of the output (new line is added automatically)." So if header is provided, it's written as the first line, then each point's line.

So the function should generate a CSV string, with the header (if provided) followed by the lines for each point.

But how is the CSV structured? For example, if the header is "x,y,value", then each line would be x_str,y_str,value_str.

But the code needs to generate that.

Now, the function is part of a class, so the 'self' refers to the Graph instance.

But the problem is, the code needs to be written. Let's think about the code structure.

The function to_csv is supposed to return a string (or maybe write to a file?), but the docstring doesn't specify. However, the note says that for converting Graph to CSV inside a Lena sequence, use ToCSV. So perhaps the to_csv method is meant to generate a string, which can then be written to a file or processed further.

So the function should return a string with the CSV content.

So, the steps are:

1. If header is provided, add it as the first line.

2. For each point in the graph's points:

   a. Convert coordinates to strings, joined by separator.

   b. Convert value parts to strings, joined by separator.

   c. Combine them with the separator.

3. Collect all lines and return as a single string, with newlines.

But how are the points structured? Let's assume that each point has 'coordinates' and 'value' attributes. For example, a point might have coordinates (x, y) and value (a, b). So for each point, the coordinates are a list or tuple, and the value is a list or tuple.

So, in code:

lines = []
if header is not None:
    lines.append(header)
for point in self.points:
    coord_parts = [str(c) for c in point.coordinates]
    coord_str = separator.join(coord_parts)
    value_parts = [str(v) for v in point.value]
    value_str = separator.join(value_parts)
    line = coord_str + separator + value_str
    lines.append(line)
return '\n'.join(lines)

Wait, but the docstring says that the header is added with a new line automatically. So if header is provided, it's added as the first line, then each point line. So the code above would do that.

But what if the header is None? Then, the lines are just the point lines.

But the function's parameters are separator (default comma) and header (default None). So the code should handle that.

Now, the function is deprecated, but the code is still needed. So the code should be written as per the description.

But what about the case where the graph is multidimensional? The docstring says that the graph can be multidimensional, so each point's coordinates and value can have multiple parts.

Now, the code needs to handle that.

But what if the point's coordinates or value are not iterable? Well, assuming that the Graph's points are properly structured, with coordinates and value as iterables.

Now, the code for the function would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coordinates)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(f"{coord_str}{separator}{value_str}")
    return '\n'.join(lines)

Wait, but the separator is used to join the coordinates and the value parts. Then, the coordinate string and value string are joined with the separator again. For example, if the separator is comma, and coordinates are [1, 2], value is [3, 4], then the line would be "1,2,3,4".

But the docstring says that for each point, first the coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value. So the coordinate parts are joined with separator, then the value parts are joined with separator, and then the two are joined with separator? Or is the value parts added after the coordinate parts, separated by the same separator?

Yes, that's what the code does. So the code seems correct.

But the docstring says that the header is the first string of the output, with a new line added automatically. So the header is added as a line, then each point line.

Now, the function is deprecated, but the code is written as per the description.

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, generating comprehensive unit tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the tests are not needed here, but the code is to be written.

Wait, the initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the user wants the code for the to_csv method. The tips mention to follow TDD, but the output is only the code. So perhaps the code is to be written as per the function signature and docstring.

So the code would be as I outlined above. But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

But what about the case where the graph has no points? Then, the lines list would be empty (if header is None) or contain just the header. But that's handled.

Another thing: the header is a string, and the code appends it as is. So if the header is "x,y,value", then that's the first line.

But what if the header is None? Then, the header is not added.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the function is part of a class, so the code would be inside the class.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code is written as part of the class.

So the final code would be:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    """
    .. deprecated:: 0.5 in Lena 0.5 to_csv is not used.
      Iterables are converted to tables.

    Convert graph's points to CSV.

    *separator* delimits values, the default is comma.

    *header*, if not ``None``, is the first string of the output
    (new line is added automatically).

    Since a graph can be multidimensional,
    for each point first its coordinate is converted to string
    (separated by *separator*), then each part of its value.

    To convert :class:`Graph` to CSV inside a Lena sequence,
    use :class:`lena.output.ToCSV`.
    """
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coord_str = separator.join(str(c) for c in point.coordinates)
        value_str = separator.join(str(v) for v in point.value)
        lines.append(f"{coord_str}{separator}{value_str}")
    return '\n'.join(lines)

But wait, the separator is used to join the coordinates and the value parts. Then, the coordinate string and value string are joined with the separator again. For example, if separator is ',', coordinates are [1, 2], value is [3, 4], then the line is "1,2,3,4".

But according to the docstring, the coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value. So the coordinate parts are joined with separator, then the value parts are joined with separator, and then the two are joined with separator? Or is the value parts added after the coordinate parts, separated by the same separator?

Yes, that's what the code does. So the code is correct.

But what if the value is a single value? For example, if the value is a single number. Then, the value_str would be that number as a string, and the line would be coordinate_str + separator + value_str.

So the code handles that.

Now, the code is written. But the function is deprecated. Should the code include a deprecation warning? The docstring says it's deprecated, but the code may not need to handle that. However, the user hasn't specified that, so perhaps it's not required.

So the code is as written.
