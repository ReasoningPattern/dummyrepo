Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the status_str method based on the given function signature and docstring. They also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

The function is part of a class, probably. The method takes a 'prefix' parameter, which is optional and defaults to an empty string. The docstring says it returns a string representation using self.log.status_str with the optional prefix. So, the method is likely concatenating the prefix with the result of self.log.status_str.

Wait, but what's the structure of the class? Since the method is called status_str and refers to self.log.status_str, I assume there's a log attribute in the class that has a status_str method. So the actual code would be something like returning prefix + self.log.status_str(), but maybe with some formatting?

But the user hasn't provided the full class structure. However, the task is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So maybe the method is simply combining the prefix with the status string from the log.

So the code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return string representation with self.log.status_str, with optional prefix.
    """
    return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str()}"

Wait, but maybe the prefix is added in a different way. Like, maybe the prefix is added before the status string, but perhaps with a separator? The docstring doesn't specify, so I should assume that the prefix is just prepended. The example in the docstring might not have any examples, so I have to go by the description.

But since the user wants unit tests first, let's think about possible test cases. For example, if the log's status_str returns "OK", then with prefix "Status: ", the result should be "Status: OK". Also, if prefix is empty, it should just return the log's status_str.

But how to test this? The tests would need to mock the log's status_str method. So in the tests, we can create a mock object for the log, set its status_str to return a known value, then check that the method returns the correct combination.

So the unit tests would involve:

1. Testing that the method returns the log's status_str without a prefix.
2. Testing that the prefix is added correctly.
3. Testing edge cases, like empty prefix or empty status_str.

But since the actual code isn't provided, the tests would need to be written in a way that assumes the existence of self.log.status_str. So, using a mock or a test double for the log.

So, the code for the method is straightforward. But the user wants the code generated, so I need to write that.

Wait, but the user said to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the code is just the method implementation. But the user also mentioned test-driven development, so maybe I should include the tests as well?

Wait, the initial instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But the tips say to follow TDD approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

But the user's main request is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. However, the tips suggest that the assistant should first generate the tests. However, the final output should be only the code generated. So perhaps the user expects the code for the method, but the thinking process includes considering the tests.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the answer should be the code for the status_str method, and the tests are part of the thinking process but not the final output.

But the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be the method's implementation. Let me think again.

The function signature is:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):

The docstring says it returns a string with self.log.status_str and optional prefix. So the code is likely:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return string representation with self.log.status_str, with optional prefix.
    """
    return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str()}"

But maybe the prefix is added with a newline or some separator? The docstring doesn't specify, so the simplest implementation is to concatenate the prefix and the status string.

So the code would be as above. However, perhaps the log's status_str is a property, not a method. Wait, the docstring says "with self.log.status_str", which suggests that status_str is an attribute, not a method. Wait, maybe it's a property. So perhaps self.log.status_str is a property that returns a string. So the code would be:

return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str}"

But then, if status_str is a method, it would need parentheses. But the docstring says "self.log.status_str", which could be either. However, in Python, if it's a property, you don't need parentheses. So perhaps the code is:

return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str}"

But the user's function is called status_str, which might be a method. So maybe the log's status_str is a method that returns a string. So the code would call self.log.status_str().

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the docstring says "with self.log.status_str", which could be a method or a property. But given that the method is called status_str, perhaps the log's status_str is a method. So the code would be:

return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str()}"

But perhaps the prefix is added with a space? Like, maybe the prefix is a label. For example, if the prefix is "Status: ", then the result is "Status: OK".

But again, without more info, the code should be as simple as possible. So the code would be as above.

So the final code is:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return string representation with self.log.status_str, with optional prefix.
    """
    return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str()}"

But wait, what if self.log is None? But that's probably handled by the class's design. The user hasn't mentioned error handling, so we can assume that self.log exists and has a status_str method.

So the code is as written. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format. So the code would be enclosed in triple backticks.

But the user also mentioned test-driven development. However, the final output should be only the code generated. So perhaps the tests are part of the thinking process but not the final answer. Therefore, the answer is the code for the method.
