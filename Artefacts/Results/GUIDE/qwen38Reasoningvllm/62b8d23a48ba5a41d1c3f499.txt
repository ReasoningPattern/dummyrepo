Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says it should remove and return the least recently used (LRU) key-value pair. Hmm, this sounds like it's part of an LRU cache implementation. 

First, I should think about the data structures involved. Typically, an LRU cache uses a combination of a dictionary for O(1) lookups and a doubly linked list or something similar to keep track of the order of usage. But maybe the user expects a simpler approach, like using a list to track usage order. Wait, but for efficiency, using a linked list is better. However, implementing a linked list might be complex. Alternatively, maybe the user is using a OrderedDict from Python's collections module, which automatically keeps track of insertion order. Oh right, in Python 3.7+, regular dicts maintain insertion order, but OrderedDict is more reliable for this purpose.

Wait, the popitem method in OrderedDict has a parameter 'last' which determines whether to pop the last (most recently used) or first (least recently used) item. So maybe the user is expecting to use OrderedDict and the popitem method with last=False. But the problem says to generate the code for the popitem method. So perhaps the user is implementing an LRU cache from scratch, not using OrderedDict.

But the question says to generate code based on the given function signature. So the method is part of a class, probably a cache. Let me think about how to implement popitem for an LRU cache.

In an LRU cache, when an item is accessed, it's moved to the end of the order. The least recently used item is the one at the beginning. So when popitem is called, it should remove the first item in the order. So the data structure needs to track the order of insertion and access.

So, for the implementation, I need to have a way to track the order. Let's say the class has a dictionary for storing key-value pairs and a list or something similar to track the order. But for efficiency, using a linked list would be better. However, implementing that might be complicated. Alternatively, using an OrderedDict, which is designed for this purpose. 

Wait, if the user is using OrderedDict, then the popitem method can be implemented by calling the OrderedDict's popitem method with last=False. But the problem is that the user might not be using OrderedDict, and the code is supposed to be part of a class. So perhaps the user is implementing their own LRU cache.

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting to use a list to track the order. Let me think about the steps.

Let's outline the steps for the popitem method:

1. Find the least recently used item. That's the one that hasn't been accessed in the longest time.
2. Remove it from the data structure.
3. Return the (key, value) pair.

But how to track the order? Let's assume that the class maintains a dictionary and a list that keeps track of the order of insertion and access. For example, when an item is accessed (like in get or set), it's moved to the end of the list. The least recently used is the first element of the list.

So, for the popitem method, we would remove the first element of the list and return it. But how to handle the dictionary? Let's say the class has a self._data dictionary and a self._order list. When we popitem, we take the first element from _order, say key, then remove it from _data and return (key, value).

But this approach has a problem: when the same key is accessed again, it should be moved to the end of the order. So, for example, when we do a get or set, we need to check if the key exists, and if so, move it to the end of the order list.

But implementing this requires that whenever a key is accessed, it's moved to the end. So, for the popitem method, we just remove the first element.

So, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self._order:
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
    key = self._order.pop(0)
    value = self._data.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But then, how does the order list get maintained? For example, when a key is accessed, it's moved to the end. So, for example, in a get method, when you retrieve a value, you need to move the key to the end of the order list.

But the user hasn't provided the rest of the code, so maybe the popitem method is part of a larger class that handles the order. However, the user's task is to generate the code for popitem based on the given function signature and docstring.

But the problem says to generate the code for the popitem method. So, perhaps the user is implementing an LRU cache from scratch. Therefore, the code would need to manage the order of keys.

But without knowing the rest of the class's structure, it's a bit challenging. However, given that the user provided only the function signature and docstring, I need to make assumptions.

Another approach: perhaps the class is using a list to track the order, and the popitem method removes the first element. But then, the code would need to have a way to track the order. So, the class would have a dictionary and a list. For example:

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self._data = {}
        self._order = []

    def popitem(self):
        # remove and return the least recently used item
        if not self._order:
            raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
        key = self._order.pop(0)
        value = self._data.pop(key)
        return (key, value)

But then, when a key is accessed, it needs to be moved to the end of the order list. For example, in a get method:

def get(self, key):
    if key in self._data:
        self._order.remove(key)
        self._order.append(key)
        return self._data[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError

But this approach has issues with the order list. For example, if the same key is accessed multiple times, the remove and append would move it to the end. However, the remove method is O(n), which could be inefficient for large caches.

Alternatively, using a linked list structure with a head and tail pointer, but that's more complex.

But given that the user hasn't provided the rest of the code, perhaps the popitem method is supposed to be implemented with the assumption that the order is maintained elsewhere. However, the user's task is to generate the code for popitem based on the given function signature and docstring.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that it removes and returns the least recently used pair. So, the code needs to remove the LRU item.

Assuming that the class uses an OrderedDict, which is designed for this purpose. In Python's OrderedDict, the popitem method can take a parameter 'last' which, if False, removes the first item (LRU), and if True, removes the last item (MRU). So, perhaps the user is using OrderedDict and the popitem method is simply calling the OrderedDict's popitem with last=False.

But the user's code is supposed to be part of a class. Let's assume that the class is using OrderedDict. So, the code would be:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self._cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self._cache:
            raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
        key, value = self._cache.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)

But this would work if the class is using OrderedDict. However, the user's function signature is part of a class, but the code isn't provided. However, the user's task is to generate the code for the popitem method. So, perhaps the user is expecting to use OrderedDict.

But the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, not to use any external libraries. However, the user might be okay with using OrderedDict. But the problem says "you are a Python software engineer" and to generate code, so perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, if the user is not using OrderedDict, then the code would need to manage the order manually. But without knowing the rest of the class structure, it's hard to say.

But given the docstring, the most straightforward implementation would be using OrderedDict. So, the code would be as above.

But the user's function signature is part of a class, and the code needs to be generated. However, the user hasn't provided the rest of the class. So, perhaps the user is expecting to implement the popitem method for an LRU cache, and the code would use OrderedDict.

So, the code would be:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self._cache = OrderedDict()
        self.maxsize = maxsize

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self._cache:
            raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
        key, value = self._cache.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)

But the user's function signature is part of a class, but the code isn't provided. However, the user's task is to generate the code for the popitem method. So, the code would be as above.

But the user might not be using OrderedDict. So, perhaps the code needs to be implemented without relying on OrderedDict. In that case, the code would need to manage the order manually.

But given that the user hasn't provided the rest of the code, perhaps the correct approach is to use OrderedDict. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code for the popitem method would be as above.

But the user might not have imported OrderedDict. So, the code should include the necessary imports.

But the user's code is supposed to be in Python markdown format, and the output should be only the code generated.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self._cache = OrderedDict()
        self.maxsize = maxsize

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self._cache:
            raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
        key, value = self._cache.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)

But the user's function signature is part of a class, but the code is for the popitem method. However, the user hasn't provided the class name. The function signature starts with 'def popitem(self):', so the class is not specified. But the code would be part of a class, so the code would need to be inside a class.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
    """
    if not self._data:
        raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
    key = self._data.popitem(last=False)
    return key

Wait, but the function is part of a class. So, the code would need to be inside a class. But the user hasn't provided the class name. However, the function signature is given as 'def popitem(self):', so it's part of a class.

But the user's code is supposed to be generated. So, perhaps the class is named something like LRUCache, and the code would be:

class LRUCache:
    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self._data:
            raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
        key, value = self._data.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)

But then, the _data attribute needs to be initialized in the __init__ method. However, the user hasn't provided that. So, the code would need to assume that the class has a _data attribute that is an OrderedDict or similar.

But since the user hasn't provided the rest of the code, perhaps the correct approach is to use OrderedDict and implement the popitem method as such.

So, the final code would be:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self._cache = OrderedDict()
        self.maxsize = maxsize

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self._cache:
            raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
        key, value = self._cache.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)

But the user's function signature is for a method called popitem, which is part of a class. The code above includes that method.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So, the code would be:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, maxsize):
        self._cache = OrderedDict()
        self.maxsize = maxsize

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self._cache:
            raise KeyError("popitem from empty cache")
        key, value = self._cache.popitem(last=False)
        return (key, value)
```

But the user might not have the OrderedDict import. However, since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the popitem method is supposed to remove the LRU item, using OrderedDict's popitem with last=False is the correct approach.

So, this should be the code.
