Okay, I need to create a Python function called 'on' that returns a decorator to add a new handler to a "hook" in a class's registry. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function 'on' takes a 'hook' parameter. The purpose is to register a handler for that hook. So, the decorator should allow users to add methods to the class that are associated with a specific hook.

Wait, the docstring says it returns a decorator function. So, the 'on' function itself is a decorator factory. For example, when someone uses @obj.on('some_hook'), it should register the method as a handler for 'some_hook'.

So, the decorator needs to take a function and add it to the registry. But how is the registry stored? Probably, the class has an attribute that holds the registry, maybe something like '_hooks' or similar.

Let me think about the structure. The 'on' method is part of a class, right? Because it's called as a method. So, the class probably has a registry, maybe a dictionary, where each key is a hook name, and the value is a list of handler functions.

So, the 'on' method would need to access that registry. Let's assume the class has an attribute like '_hooks' which is a dictionary. Then, when the decorator is applied, it adds the function to the corresponding hook's list.

But how to handle the decorator? Let's outline the steps:

1. The 'on' function takes a hook name and returns a decorator.
2. The decorator takes a function (the handler) and adds it to the registry under the given hook.

So, the code for the 'on' method would look something like this:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to self's hook registry
        if not hasattr(self, '_hooks'):
            self._hooks = {}
        if hook not in self._hooks:
            self._hooks[hook] = []
        self._hooks[hook].append(func)
        return func
    return decorator

Wait, but the docstring says it returns a decorator function. So, the 'on' method is a decorator factory. But how does the class have the registry? Maybe the class has an attribute that's initialized when the class is defined. For example, in the class, maybe there's an __init__ method that initializes _hooks as a dictionary.

But the user hasn't provided the class structure. So, I need to make assumptions here. Let's proceed with the assumption that the class has an attribute '_hooks' which is a dictionary. So, the 'on' method is part of a class, and when the decorator is applied, it adds the function to that dictionary.

But wait, the 'on' method is part of the class, so 'self' refers to an instance of the class. So, when the decorator is applied, it's adding the handler to the instance's _hooks. But maybe the registry is per class, not per instance. Hmm, that's a possible ambiguity. But the problem statement says "registry in the class", so perhaps it's per class. Wait, but the 'on' method is part of the class, so maybe the registry is stored in the class, not the instance. Or maybe it's stored in the instance. The wording is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the registry is a class-level attribute. For example, the class has a '_hooks' attribute that's a dictionary. So, when the 'on' method is called on the class, it adds the handler to that class's registry. But then, the 'on' method is a class method? Or instance method?

This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The function signature is def on(self, hook):, which suggests that 'on' is an instance method. So, the registry is probably per instance. For example, each instance of the class has its own registry of hooks. That makes sense if the handlers are instance-specific.

So, the code for the 'on' method would be as I outlined earlier. Let's proceed with that.

Now, the user also mentioned that they want to follow a test-driven development approach. So, I need to generate unit tests first. Let's think about what tests would be needed.

First, test that the 'on' method returns a decorator. Then, test that when the decorator is applied, the handler is added to the registry. Also, test that multiple handlers can be added to the same hook.

But since the user wants the code first, maybe I should generate the code first and then the tests. Wait, the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but also to follow TDD by generating comprehensive unit tests first. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. Wait, the original problem says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow TDD approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code. So perhaps the user wants the code for the 'on' method, but the assistant is supposed to think through the TDD approach, but the final output is only the code.

Wait, the user's instruction says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow TDD approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user might have intended that the assistant should generate the code, but the thinking process includes considering TDD. However, the final output is only the code.

So, perhaps the assistant should generate the code for the 'on' method, and the tests are part of the thinking process but not the output.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code. So, the answer should be the code for the 'on' method. However, the user might have intended that the code is written with TDD in mind, but the actual code is the implementation.

So, the code for the 'on' method would be as follows:

The 'on' method is part of a class. Let's assume the class has an attribute '_hooks' which is a dictionary. The 'on' method returns a decorator that adds the function to the registry.

So, the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        if not hasattr(self, '_hooks'):
            self._hooks = {}
        if hook not in self._hooks:
            self._hooks[hook] = []
        self._hooks[hook].append(func)
        return func
    return decorator

But wait, the 'on' method is part of a class. So, the class would have an __init__ method that initializes _hooks? Or maybe the _hooks are initialized when the first handler is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the class has a registry that is a class-level attribute. But the 'on' method is an instance method, so it's probably per instance.

But the problem statement says "registry in the class", which might imply that it's a class-level registry. But that's ambiguous. However, given the function signature, it's an instance method, so the registry is likely per instance.

So, the code above should work.

But perhaps the 'on' method is a class method? Or maybe the registry is a class-level attribute. Let me think again.

If the registry is a class-level attribute, then the code would be different. For example:

class MyClass:
    _hooks = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            if hook not in MyClass._hooks:
                MyClass._hooks[hook] = []
            MyClass._hooks[hook].append(func)
            return func
        return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is an instance method, but it's modifying the class-level _hooks. That's possible.

But the problem statement says "registry in the class", which could mean that it's a class-level registry. However, the function signature is for an instance method. So, perhaps the registry is per instance.

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that the 'on' method is an instance method, the registry is likely per instance.

So, the code I wrote earlier is correct.

Now, considering that, the code for the 'on' method would be as follows.

But wait, the user's function signature is part of a class. So, the code would be inside a class. For example:

class SomeClass:
    def on(self, hook):
        ...
        
But the user hasn't provided the class, so the code is just the 'on' method.

So, the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        if not hasattr(self, '_hooks'):
            self._hooks = {}
        if hook not in self._hooks:
            self._hooks[hook] = []
        self._hooks[hook].append(func)
        return func
    return decorator

But perhaps the 'on' method is part of a class, and the _hooks are stored as an instance attribute. So, when the 'on' method is called, it adds the function to the instance's _hooks.

This seems correct.

Now, considering that, the code should be written as such.

But perhaps the 'on' method is a class method? Or maybe the registry is a class attribute. But given the function signature, it's an instance method.

So, the code should be as above.

Now, the user also mentioned to generate comprehensive unit tests. But the user says to output only the code. However, the initial instruction says to follow TDD approach, but the output is only the code. So perhaps the code is the implementation, and the tests are part of the thinking process but not the output.

Thus, the final code is as written.
