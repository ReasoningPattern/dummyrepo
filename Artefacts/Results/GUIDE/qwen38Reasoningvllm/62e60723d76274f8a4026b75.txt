Okay, I need to generate Python code for the round_half_to_even function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to round a floating-point number using the "round half to even" strategy. That's also known as banker's rounding. So, I need to implement that logic.

Wait, what's the difference between regular rounding and banker's rounding? Oh right, when the number is exactly halfway between two integers, it rounds to the nearest even number. For example, 2.5 rounds to 2, 3.5 rounds to 4, etc.

So, how to implement this in Python? Well, Python's built-in round function already uses banker's rounding. Wait, does it? Let me check. For example, round(2.5) is 2, round(3.5) is 4. Yes, that's correct. So maybe the function can just use the built-in round function. But wait, the problem says to generate the code for round_half_to_even. So perhaps the user wants an implementation that does exactly that, maybe to understand how it works or for educational purposes.

But the user might be expecting me to implement it from scratch. Let me think. If I just return round(n), would that suffice? Let me check the examples.

Wait, the function's docstring is empty, but the user provided a docstring. Oh, the original function has a docstring that says "Round a floating-point number". So maybe the user wants the function to be implemented with that docstring.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to be implemented, and the docstring is provided. But the original docstring is empty. Wait, looking back:

The user provided:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    #

So the docstring is just "Round a floating-point number". So perhaps the user wants the function to be implemented with that docstring. But the actual implementation needs to do the rounding.

But if Python's built-in round function already does banker's rounding, then the function can just return round(n). However, perhaps the user wants to implement it manually, perhaps for learning purposes.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the user expects the code to use the built-in round function. However, maybe there's a catch. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the user is not aware that Python's round function already does this. So maybe the task is to implement the banker's rounding manually. Let me consider that.

So, how to implement banker's rounding manually. Let's think about the steps.

First, we need to determine the decimal part of the number. For example, if n is 2.5, we need to check if the decimal part is exactly 0.5. Then, we check the integer part's parity (even or odd) to decide whether to round up or down.

But how to handle numbers that are exactly halfway between two integers. Let's outline the steps:

1. Take the number n.
2. Split it into integer and fractional parts. For example, 2.5 becomes 2 and 0.5.
3. Check if the fractional part is exactly 0.5.
4. If it is, check if the integer part is even or odd. If even, round down; if odd, round up.
5. Otherwise, round normally (using standard rounding rules).

But how to handle negative numbers? For example, -2.5 would round to -2 (since -2 is even), and -3.5 would round to -4 (since -3 is odd). Wait, but how does the banker's rounding handle negatives? Well, the same logic applies: when the fractional part is exactly 0.5, round to the nearest even integer, regardless of sign.

So, to implement this, perhaps we can use the decimal module or perform mathematical operations.

Alternatively, we can use the built-in round function, which already does this. So, perhaps the function can simply return round(n). But let me check with some examples.

Testing round(2.5) gives 2, round(3.5) gives 4, round(4.5) gives 4, round(5.5) gives 6. So yes, that's banker's rounding.

But maybe the user wants the function to be implemented manually. However, given that the user hasn't specified any particular constraints, perhaps using the built-in function is acceptable.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is just a placeholder. So perhaps the user expects the function to be implemented using the built-in round function.

But let me think again. The problem says to generate the code. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the built-in round function. However, maybe the user wants to ensure that the function is implemented correctly, even if the built-in function already does it.

But perhaps there's a case where the built-in round function isn't sufficient. For example, due to floating-point precision issues. However, in most cases, the built-in round function should work.

So, given that, the function can be as simple as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But perhaps the user wants more detailed code. Let me think again. The user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is empty except for the placeholder. So perhaps the user expects the function to be implemented with the correct logic.

But if the user is expecting the code to be written from scratch, then I need to implement the banker's rounding manually.

So, let's proceed with implementing it manually.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the integer part and the decimal part of the number.
2. Check if the decimal part is exactly 0.5.
3. If yes, check if the integer part is even or odd. If even, round down; else, round up.
4. Else, round normally.

But how to handle negative numbers? For example, -2.5 would round to -2 (since -2 is even), and -3.5 would round to -4 (since -3 is odd). So the parity check is based on the absolute value?

Wait, no. Let's think: For -2.5, the integer part is -2 (if we take the floor?), or perhaps we need to split into integer and fractional parts properly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the decimal module to handle the rounding.

Alternatively, here's a way to do it:

We can use the math.floor function to get the integer part, then check the fractional part.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the decimal module with ROUND_HALF_EVEN as the rounding mode.

Yes, that's a possibility. Let me think.

Using the decimal module:

import decimal

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return float(decimal.Decimal(n).quantize(decimal.Decimal('1'), rounding=decimal.ROUND_HALF_EVEN))

But wait, converting the float to a Decimal might have precision issues. For example, if the input is a float that can't be represented exactly as a decimal, there could be errors. However, for the purposes of this function, perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, using the built-in round function is simpler and more efficient.

But perhaps the user wants to ensure that the function is implemented correctly, even if the built-in function already does it. However, given that the user hasn't specified any constraints, perhaps using the built-in function is acceptable.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is just a placeholder. So perhaps the user expects the function to be implemented with the correct logic.

But given that the built-in round function already does this, perhaps the correct code is simply to return round(n).

But let me check the examples.

For example:

round_half_to_even(2.5) should return 2.

round_half_to_even(3.5) should return 4.

round_half_to_even(4.5) should return 4.

round_half_to_even(5.5) should return 6.

Using the built-in round function, these examples would work.

But what about numbers that are not exactly halfway? For example, 2.4 rounds to 2, 2.6 rounds to 3.

So, in that case, the built-in round function would work.

Therefore, the function can be implemented as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But perhaps the user wants more detailed code. However, given that the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the docstring is minimal, this seems acceptable.

But maybe the user wants to ensure that the function is implemented correctly, even if the built-in function already does it. However, without further information, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is testing the ability to write unit tests first. The initial instruction says to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

So, perhaps I should first write the unit tests, then implement the function.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. However, the initial instruction also says to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial tips say to generate the unit tests first.

Wait, the user's instruction says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say: "You should follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code."

So, perhaps the user wants the code to include the unit tests, but the instruction says to output only the code generated. However, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the function itself. But the tips suggest writing tests first.

But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are not part of the output. But the tips are just guidance.

This is a bit confusing. Let me recheck the user's message.

The user says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Then the tips say to follow TDD, generate tests first, then code.

But the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are not part of the output. However, the user might have intended to have the code include the tests. But the instruction says to output only the code generated, which implies the function code, not the tests.

But given that, perhaps the user wants the function code, and the tests are part of the thinking process but not the output.

So, given that, I need to generate the function code.

But the initial tips suggest that the assistant should generate unit tests first. However, the user's final instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are not part of the output.

Therefore, the code for the function is as simple as returning round(n).

But perhaps the user wants the function to be implemented manually. For example, if the user is testing the understanding of banker's rounding.

But given that the user hasn't specified any particular constraints, the simplest solution is to use the built-in round function.

So, the code would be:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But perhaps the user wants more detailed code. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to handle edge cases, such as numbers that are exactly halfway between two integers. But the built-in round function already handles that.

Another possibility is that the user is using a version of Python where the round function doesn't behave as expected. But that's unlikely.

In conclusion, the correct code is to return round(n), with the provided docstring.

So, the final code is:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number
    """
    return round(n)

But I need to make sure that the function is properly documented. The docstring is as given, so it's acceptable.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
