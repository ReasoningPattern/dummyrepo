Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called cachedmethod that uses a cache. The function signature is given, and the docstring says it returns a decorator that can call a result in the cache. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the decorator should check if the result is already in the cache. If it is, return it. If not, compute it, store it in the cache, and then return it. But how to handle the key? The key parameter is set to hashkey by default. Wait, maybe hashkey is a function that generates a key based on the arguments? Or maybe it's a function that takes the method's arguments and returns a key.

Wait, the key parameter is a function. So the user can pass a different key function if needed. The default is hashkey, which I assume is a function that takes the arguments and returns a hashable key. But I need to make sure that the key is generated correctly based on the method's arguments.

Also, there's a lock parameter. Maybe it's for thread safety. So when multiple threads try to compute the same key, they should lock to prevent redundant computations. But how to handle that? The lock is probably a threading.Lock or similar.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The cachedmethod function takes a cache (probably a dictionary or similar structure), a key function (default hashkey), and a lock (optional).

2. The decorator function (returned by cachedmethod) will wrap the method.

3. When the method is called, the decorator will generate a key using the key function and the method's arguments.

4. Check if the key exists in the cache. If yes, return the cached value.

5. If not, acquire the lock (if provided) to prevent concurrent computations.

6. Check again if the key exists in the cache (since another thread might have added it while waiting for the lock). If yes, return it.

7. Otherwise, compute the method's result, store it in the cache, and return it.

Wait, but how do I get the method's arguments? Since the decorator is applied to a method, the arguments are passed to the method. So when the decorated method is called, the arguments are available. But how to generate the key? The key function should take the arguments and return a hashable key. But how to pass the arguments to the key function?

Wait, the key function is supposed to generate a unique key based on the method's arguments. So the key function should take the method's arguments and return a key. But how to get the arguments? The decorator needs to capture the arguments when the method is called.

Wait, the key function is probably supposed to take the arguments of the method. For example, when the method is called with certain arguments, the key function is called with those arguments to generate a key. But how to pass those arguments to the key function?

Wait, the key function is a parameter to cachedmethod. So when the decorator is created, the key function is fixed. Then, when the method is called, the key is generated by applying the key function to the method's arguments.

But how to get the method's arguments? Because when the method is called, the arguments are passed to the method. So the decorator needs to capture those arguments when the method is invoked.

Wait, the key function is supposed to take the arguments of the method. For example, if the method is called with args and kwargs, the key function is called with those args and kwargs. But how to pass them? Because the key function is a function that is called with the arguments of the method.

Wait, maybe the key function is supposed to take the same arguments as the method. So when the method is called, the key is generated by passing the arguments to the key function.

But how to handle that? Let me think. The key function is a function that takes the same arguments as the method. So when the method is called, the key is generated by calling the key function with the arguments of the method. But how to pass those arguments to the key function?

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the method's arguments as a tuple and a dictionary. For example, the key function could be something like:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But how to get args and kwargs when the method is called? Because when the method is called, the arguments are passed to the method. So the decorator needs to capture those arguments and pass them to the key function.

Wait, the key function is part of the decorator. So when the method is called, the decorator will call the key function with the arguments of the method. But how to get the arguments? Because the method is being called, and the decorator is wrapping it.

So, the decorator function (the one returned by cachedmethod) will take the method's arguments. Let's think about the structure.

The cachedmethod is a decorator factory. So when you use @cachedmethod(cache, key=...), it returns a decorator that wraps the method.

So, for example:

@cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey)
def mymethod(self, a, b):
    ...

When mymethod is called, the decorator will generate a key based on the arguments a and b. So the key function needs to take those arguments and return a hashable key.

But how to pass those arguments to the key function? The key function is a function that is called with the arguments of the method. So when the method is called, the decorator will call the key function with the arguments passed to the method.

Wait, but the key function is supposed to generate a unique key for the method's arguments. So the key function is called with the same arguments as the method. So, for example, if the method is called with args and kwargs, the key function is called with those args and kwargs.

But how to handle that? Because the key function could be any function that takes the method's arguments. So, the decorator needs to pass the method's arguments to the key function.

But how to get the method's arguments? Well, when the method is called, the decorator is called with the arguments. So, for example, the decorator is a function that takes *args and **kwargs. So, when the method is called, the decorator function is called with the arguments. So the key can be generated by passing those args and kwargs to the key function.

Wait, but the key function is supposed to generate a key based on the method's arguments. So the key function is called with the same arguments as the method. So, for example, if the method is called with args and kwargs, then the key function is called with those args and kwargs. But how to pass them? Because the key function could be a function that takes args and kwargs, or maybe it's a function that takes the method's parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the key function is supposed to take the same parameters as the method. But that's not possible because the method's parameters can vary. So perhaps the key function is supposed to take the args and kwargs of the method.

So, in the decorator, when the method is called, the decorator will call the key function with the args and kwargs passed to the method. Then, that key is used to look up in the cache.

But how to handle that? Let me think of the code structure.

The decorator function (returned by cachedmethod) will be something like:

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        key = key_function(args, kwargs)
        if key in cache:
            return cache[key]
        # else compute and cache
    return wrapper

But wait, the key function is supposed to take the arguments of the method. So the key function is called with args and kwargs. But how to pass them? Because the key function could be any function. For example, the default key function could be hashkey, which perhaps takes the args and kwargs and returns a hashable key.

But how to implement hashkey? Well, maybe the default key function is something like:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But that's just an example. The user can provide their own key function.

So, putting it all together, the cachedmethod decorator would generate a key based on the method's arguments, check the cache, and if not present, compute it.

Now, the lock parameter. If a lock is provided, then when multiple threads try to compute the same key, they should acquire the lock to prevent redundant computations. So, when the key is not in the cache, the decorator should acquire the lock, check again if the key is in the cache (since another thread might have added it while waiting for the lock), and if not, compute it, store it, and release the lock.

But how to handle the lock? The lock is probably a threading.Lock instance. So, when the key is not in the cache, the decorator would acquire the lock, check again, and proceed.

So, the code structure would be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Generate key
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if key_val in cache:
                return cache[key_val]
            # Acquire lock if provided
            if lock:
                lock.acquire()
                try:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    # Compute result
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
                finally:
                    lock.release()
            else:
                # No lock, just compute and cache
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but this code has a problem. If the lock is not provided, then multiple threads could compute the same key simultaneously, leading to redundant computations. But if the lock is provided, then the code acquires the lock before checking the cache again. However, this code may not handle the case where another thread has already computed the result while waiting for the lock. So, the code acquires the lock, checks again, and if the key is present, returns it. Otherwise, computes and stores.

But what if the lock is not provided? Then, there's no synchronization, and multiple threads could compute the same key, leading to redundant computations. However, the cache would still store the result, so subsequent calls would hit the cache. But the first call would compute it once, and others would hit the cache. So, without a lock, it's possible that multiple threads compute the same key, but the cache would store the result once, so subsequent calls would be fast. However, the first computation would be done multiple times. But that's acceptable if the computation is expensive and the cache is hit once.

But the lock is optional. So, the code above handles that.

But what about the key function? The key function is supposed to take args and kwargs. So, the default key function is hashkey, which is probably a function that takes args and kwargs and returns a hashable key. But how is hashkey defined? The user might have to provide it, or it's a helper function.

Wait, the problem says that the key parameter is set to hashkey by default. So, perhaps hashkey is a function that takes args and kwargs and returns a key. But in the code, the key function is called with args and kwargs. So, the default key function is hashkey, which is probably a helper function that generates a key based on the method's arguments.

But the user is supposed to provide the key function. So, the code for the cachedmethod decorator would use the key function passed to it. So, the code above is correct.

Now, considering the test-driven development approach. Let's think about writing unit tests first.

But the user said to generate the code first, then the tests. Wait, the initial instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, following a test-driven approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user wants the code generated, not the tests. Wait, the user says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So, the user wants the code, not the tests. But the tips say to follow TDD, first generate tests, then code. But the user's instruction says to output only the code. So maybe the user wants the code, but the thinking process includes considering the tests.

But regardless, the code needs to be written. Let me proceed.

But wait, the code I outlined earlier may have some issues. For example, the key function is called with args and kwargs. But in Python, when a method is called, the first argument is the instance (self), and then the other arguments. So, when the method is called, the args would include self. So, the key function should include self in the key. But that's handled by the key function. For example, if the key function is hashkey, which takes args and kwargs, then the key would include self.

But what if the method is called with different instances? Then the key would be different, which is correct.

Another thing: the cache is passed to the cachedmethod function. So, the cache is a mutable object (like a dictionary) that is shared between all calls to the decorated method. So, the decorator is supposed to use that cache.

Now, considering the code structure again. The code for cachedmethod is a function that returns a decorator. The decorator wraps the method, and when the method is called, it uses the cache, key function, and lock.

Now, what about the lock? The lock is passed to cachedmethod. So, if a lock is provided, it's used to synchronize access to the cache. But how to handle the lock? The code above uses the lock in the wrapper function.

But perhaps the lock is a threading.Lock instance. So, when the lock is acquired, other threads are blocked from entering the critical section.

Now, the code for the cachedmethod function:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if key_val in cache:
                return cache[key_val]
            if lock:
                lock.acquire()
                try:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
                finally:
                    lock.release()
            else:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the key function is called with args and kwargs. But the key function may need to process the arguments. For example, the default key function could be something like:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But this is just an example. The user may have their own key function.

But in the code, the key function is passed as a parameter to cachedmethod. So, the code is correct.

But what about the default key function? The problem says that the key parameter is set to hashkey. So, the user must have a hashkey function defined elsewhere. However, in the code, the default key is hashkey, which is not defined here. So, perhaps the hashkey is a helper function that is part of the code. But since the user hasn't provided it, maybe it's assumed that hashkey is a function that takes args and kwargs and returns a hashable key.

But in the code, the key function is called with args and kwargs. So, the code is correct.

Now, possible issues:

- The key function may not be hashable. But the cache is supposed to store the key, so the key must be hashable. So, the key function must return a hashable value.

- The lock may not be properly handled. For example, if the lock is not provided, the code proceeds without it. But if the lock is provided, it's acquired and released properly.

Another thing: when the lock is acquired, the code checks again if the key is in the cache. This is important because another thread may have added the key while waiting for the lock. So, the code checks again after acquiring the lock.

Now, the code seems correct. Let me write it in Python.

But the code needs to be in Python markdown format. So, the code would be:

```python
def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    """
    Returns a decorator function that can call a result in the cache.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_val = key(args, kwargs)
            if key_val in cache:
                return cache[key_val]
            if lock:
                lock.acquire()
                try:
                    if key_val in cache:
                        return cache[key_val]
                    result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    cache[key_val] = result
                    return result
                finally:
                    lock.release()
            else:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                cache[key_val] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

But wait, the hashkey function is not defined here. So, perhaps the user is supposed to have it defined elsewhere. But the problem says that the key parameter is set to hashkey by default. So, the code assumes that hashkey is a function that takes args and kwargs and returns a hashable key.

But in the code, the key function is called with args and kwargs. So, the code is correct.

Another thing: the key function may need to process the arguments. For example, if the method has parameters that are not hashable, the key function should convert them into hashable types. But that's up to the key function.

Now, possible test cases:

- Test that the cached result is returned on subsequent calls.

- Test that the key is generated correctly based on arguments.

- Test that the lock is used to prevent redundant computations when multiple threads are involved.

But the user wants only the code, not the tests. So, the code above is the correct implementation.

But wait, the code uses 'hashkey' as the default key function. But in the code, 'hashkey' is not defined. So, perhaps the user is supposed to have a hashkey function defined elsewhere. However, the problem may expect that the hashkey is a helper function. But since the user hasn't provided it, maybe it's better to define it within the code. Or perhaps the default key function is something else.

Wait, the problem says that the key parameter is set to hashkey. So, perhaps the hashkey is a function that is part of the code. But since the user hasn't provided it, maybe the code should include it. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code may assume that hashkey is available.

Alternatively, maybe the default key function is something like:

def hashkey(args, kwargs):
    return (args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should include it. However, the problem says that the key parameter is set to hashkey, so perhaps the code should not define it. So, the code as written is correct.

Thus, the final code is as written above.
