Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element based on the given function signature and docstring. The user mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

First, let's understand what the function is supposed to do. The function takes an 'issue' parameter and returns possible values of 'number' and 'supplement' from its contents. The docstring says it returns the possible values, which suggests that the function might parse some text to extract these numbers. But what's the structure of the 'issue' element? Since it's called 'issue_element', maybe it's an XML element or some structured data like a dictionary or a string.

Wait, the function name suggests that 'issue' could be an XML element, perhaps from an XML document. For example, in some document formats, an issue might have elements like <issue> with sub-elements like <number> and <supplement>. But the function is named _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element, so maybe the 'issue' is an XML element, and the function is supposed to extract the number and supplement from it.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual structure of the 'issue' element. So I need to make assumptions here. Let me think: perhaps the 'issue' is an XML element, and the function is supposed to extract the text content of the 'number' and 'supplement' elements. Alternatively, maybe the 'issue' is a string that contains some text, and the function needs to parse that text to find the number and supplement.

But given that the function is named with 'issue_element', it's more likely that 'issue' is an XML element. For example, in some contexts, an issue might have a 'number' attribute or a child element, and a 'supplement' element. So the function would extract those values.

But without knowing the exact structure, I need to make some assumptions. Let me think of possible scenarios.

Scenario 1: The 'issue' is an XML element. The function should extract the text of the 'number' element and the text of the 'supplement' element. For example:

<issue>
  <number>123</number>
  <supplement>456</supplement>
</issue>

In this case, the function would return (number, supplement) as (123, 456).

Scenario 2: The 'issue' is a string that contains the number and supplement in some format. For example, the text might be "Number: 123, Supplement: 456". Then the function would parse this string to extract the numbers.

But the function's name suggests that it's dealing with an element, so Scenario 1 seems more likely.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, I need to make assumptions. Let me proceed with Scenario 1, where 'issue' is an XML element. However, since the user hasn't specified, maybe the function is supposed to handle a string that represents the issue's content, and extract the number and supplement from it.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'issue' is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'supplement'. But that's also possible.

Wait, the function is named _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element. The underscore suggests that it's a helper function. So maybe the 'issue' is an XML element, and the function is supposed to parse it.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to write the code. However, the user wants me to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to extract the number and supplement from the 'issue' element's text content, perhaps by splitting on certain delimiters.

Alternatively, maybe the 'issue' element has attributes. For example, the 'number' could be an attribute, and the 'supplement' could be another attribute.

But again, without more information, I need to make assumptions. Let me think of possible test cases.

Test case 1: The 'issue' element has a 'number' child element with text "123" and a 'supplement' child element with text "456". The function should return (123, 456).

Test case 2: The 'issue' element has a 'number' attribute with value "123" and a 'supplement' attribute with value "456". The function should return (123, 456).

Test case 3: The 'issue' element's text contains "Number: 123, Supplement: 456". The function should parse this and return (123, 456).

But since the function is named with 'issue_element', perhaps it's dealing with XML elements. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, assuming that 'issue' is an XML element, perhaps from the ElementTree module. The function would need to find the 'number' and 'supplement' elements within it.

But how to handle cases where those elements are not present? The function's docstring says it returns the possible values, so maybe it returns None for missing elements, or maybe it returns the values if present, else something else.

But the function's return type isn't specified. The docstring says it returns the possible values of number and sup. So perhaps it returns a tuple (number, supplement), where each can be None if not found.

But without knowing the exact structure, I need to make assumptions. Let me proceed with the assumption that 'issue' is an XML element, and the function is supposed to extract the text of the 'number' and 'supplement' elements.

So, the code would look something like:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    number = issue.find('number').text if issue.find('number') is not None else None
    supplement = issue.find('supplement').text if issue.find('supplement') is not None else None
    return (number, supplement)

But wait, the function's name is _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element. The parameters are 'issue', which is the element. But the function returns the possible values. However, the code above would return the text of the elements, but perhaps they need to be converted to integers? Or maybe they are strings.

But the function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the function returns the raw strings. However, the function's name suggests that it's extracting numbers, so maybe the numbers are integers.

Alternatively, maybe the 'number' is an attribute, not a child element.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'issue' element has a 'number' attribute and a 'supplement' attribute.

In that case, the code would be:

number = issue.get('number')
supplement = issue.get('supplement')

But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the 'issue' element's text contains the number and supplement. For example, the text is "123-456", and the function splits it into number and supplement.

But again, without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Given that the user hasn't provided any examples, I need to make assumptions. Let me proceed with the assumption that 'issue' is an XML element, and the function is supposed to extract the text of the 'number' and 'supplement' elements. Also, perhaps the function should return the numbers as integers, or maybe as strings.

But the function's return type is not specified. The docstring says it returns the possible values of number and sup. So maybe the function returns a tuple of two elements, which could be strings or integers.

But since the function is named with 'number' and 'supplement', perhaps the numbers are integers.

But again, without knowing, I need to proceed with an example.

Let me think of test cases for the function.

Test case 1: issue is an XML element with <number>123</number> and <supplement>456</supplement>. The function should return (123, 456).

Test case 2: issue has no number element. The function returns (None, ...).

But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a tuple of (number, supplement), where each is a string, or None if not found.

But again, without knowing, I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'issue' is a string that contains the number and supplement in a specific format. For example, the string could be "Issue 123, Supplement 456", and the function extracts 123 and 456.

But again, without knowing the format, it's hard to write the code.

Since the user hasn't provided any examples, but wants me to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps the function is supposed to parse the 'issue' element's text content, looking for a number and a supplement. For example, the text might contain something like "Number: 123, Supplement: 456".

In that case, the function would parse the text, extract the numbers, and return them.

But again, without knowing the exact format, it's hard to write the code.

Alternatively, maybe the 'issue' element has a 'number' attribute and a 'supplement' attribute. For example, the element could be <issue number="123" supplement="456">. In this case, the function would extract the attributes.

But again, without knowing, it's challenging.

Given that the function's name includes 'issue_element', I think it's more likely that 'issue' is an XML element, and the function is supposed to extract the number and supplement from it. So, assuming that, I'll proceed with that approach.

So, the code would look like:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    number = None
    supplement = None
    # Check for number element
    number_elem = issue.find('number')
    if number_elem is not None:
        number = number_elem.text
    # Check for supplement element
    supplement_elem = issue.find('supplement')
    if supplement_elem is not None:
        supplement = supplement_elem.text
    return (number, supplement)

But this code would return the text of the elements as strings. However, the function's name suggests that it's extracting numbers, so maybe the numbers should be converted to integers. But the docstring says "possible values", which could include None if not found.

But perhaps the function is supposed to return integers. So, the code would convert the text to integers, but handle cases where conversion is not possible.

But again, without knowing, it's hard to say. However, the user wants me to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. Since the docstring says "return the possible values of number and sup", perhaps the function returns the values as strings, or maybe as integers.

Alternatively, maybe the 'number' is an attribute, and the 'supplement' is another attribute.

But given the lack of information, I'll proceed with the assumption that 'issue' is an XML element with child elements 'number' and 'supplement', and the function returns their text content as strings.

But the user wants me to generate unit tests first. So, I should write tests for this function.

Let me think of test cases.

Test case 1: issue has number and supplement elements.

Test case 2: issue has only number.

Test case 3: issue has only supplement.

Test case 4: issue has neither.

Test case 5: issue has number and supplement, but their text is empty.

But how to represent the 'issue' element in tests? For example, using XML strings.

So, for test case 1, the XML could be:

<issue>
  <number>123</number>
  <supplement>456</supplement>
</issue>

In this case, the function should return ('123', '456').

But if the function is supposed to return integers, then it would return (123, 456).

But again, without knowing, it's hard to decide.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the number as an integer and supplement as a string, but that's just a guess.

But given the function's name and the lack of information, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function returns the text of the elements as strings.

Now, writing the unit tests.

For example:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def test_extract_number_and_supplement():
    # Test case 1: both elements present
    issue_xml = '<issue><number>123</number><supplement>456</supplement></issue>'
    issue = ET.fromstring(issue_xml)
    number, supplement = _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue)
    assert number == '123'
    assert supplement == '456'

    # Test case 2: only number present
    issue_xml = '<issue><number>789</number></issue>'
    issue = ET.fromstring(issue_xml)
    number, supplement = _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue)
    assert number == '789'
    assert supplement is None

    # Test case 3: only supplement present
    issue_xml = '<issue><supplement>101</supplement></issue>'
    issue = ET.fromstring(issue_xml)
    number, supplement = _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue)
    assert number is None
    assert supplement == '101'

    # Test case 4: neither present
    issue_xml = '<issue></issue>'
    issue = ET.fromstring(issue_xml)
    number, supplement = _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue)
    assert number is None
    assert supplement is None

    # Test case 5: empty elements
    issue_xml = '<issue><number></number><supplement></supplement></issue>'
    issue = ET.fromstring(issue_xml)
    number, supplement = _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue)
    assert number == ''
    assert supplement == ''

But the function's return type is not specified. The user's docstring says it returns the possible values, which could be None or the actual values.

But the code I wrote earlier returns the text of the elements, which could be None if the elements are not found, or the text content.

Wait, in the code I wrote earlier, if the elements are not found, the variables are set to None. So, for example, if the 'number' element is not present, number is None. Similarly for supplement.

But in the test cases, the code would return None for missing elements.

But in the test case 2, the code would return '789' and None for supplement.

But the user's function is supposed to return possible values. So, perhaps the function returns a tuple of (number, supplement), where each can be None if not found.

But the user's function is called _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element, and the parameters are 'issue'.

Now, considering that, the code would be as I wrote earlier.

But the user wants me to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should be written with the assumption that 'issue' is an XML element, and the function extracts the text of the 'number' and 'supplement' elements.

But the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, so I should first write the tests, then write the code.

But the user wants me to generate the code, not the tests. Wait, the user said:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

But the user wants me to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants me to generate the code, but the thinking process includes considering the tests.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So perhaps the code is to be written, and the tests are not part of the output.

But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, following test-driven development. So perhaps the code should be written with the tests in mind.

But the user wants only the code generated, not the tests. So perhaps the code is to be written, and the tests are part of the thinking process, but not the output.

So, given that, I'll proceed to write the code, assuming that 'issue' is an XML element with 'number' and 'supplement' child elements, and the function returns their text content as strings, or None if not present.

So the code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    number = issue.find('number').text if issue.find('number') is not None else None
    supplement = issue.find('supplement').text if issue.find('supplement') is not None else None
    return (number, supplement)

But wait, the code above uses 'issue.find('number')' which returns the first matching element. If there are multiple elements, it would take the first one. But the function's docstring says "possible values", implying that there may be multiple, but perhaps the function is supposed to extract the first occurrence.

But given that, the code is as above.

But perhaps the 'number' and 'supplement' are attributes, not child elements. In that case, the code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    number = issue.get('number')
    supplement = issue.get('supplement')
    return (number, supplement)

But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard to decide.

Alternatively, maybe the 'issue' is a string that contains the number and supplement in a specific format. For example, the string could be "Number: 123, Supplement: 456", and the function would parse this.

In that case, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    match = re.search(r'Number:\s*(\d+),\s*Supplement:\s*(\d+)', issue)
    if match:
        return (int(match.group(1)), int(match.group(2)))
    return (None, None)

But again, without knowing the format, it's hard to say.

But given the function's name and the lack of information, I think the most plausible assumption is that 'issue' is an XML element with 'number' and 'supplement' child elements.

So, the code would be as I wrote earlier.

But the user's docstring says "possible values", which could mean that there might be multiple values, but the function returns the first occurrence.

But the function's return type is a tuple of two elements. So, the code would return the text of the elements, or None if not found.

So, the code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    number_elem = issue.find('number')
    number = number_elem.text if number_elem is not None else None
    supplement_elem = issue.find('supplement')
    supplement = supplement_elem.text if supplement_elem is not None else None
    return (number, supplement)

But this code assumes that 'issue' is an XML element, and uses the ElementTree module's find method.

But the user hasn't imported ElementTree, so the code would need to import it. However, the function is supposed to be part of a larger codebase, so maybe the 'issue' is already an ElementTree element.

But the code as written would require that 'issue' is an ElementTree element.

But since the user hasn't provided any context, I'll proceed with this code.

So, the final code is as above.
