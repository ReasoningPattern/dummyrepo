Okay, I need to generate Python code for the next_version function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it should return the next version identifier following an existing pattern. But the problem is, the versioning pattern isn't specified. Common versioning schemes include semantic versioning (like 1.2.3), semantic with pre-release (like 1.2.3-alpha), or maybe something else like date-based versions.

Wait, the user didn't specify the exact pattern. Hmm. But since the function is called next_version, maybe it's about incrementing the version number according to a standard scheme. Let me think. For example, if the input is "1.2.3", the next version would be "1.2.4". If it's "1.2.3-alpha", maybe the next is "1.2.3-beta", or perhaps increment the patch version and reset the pre-release. Or maybe the pre-release part is handled differently.

Alternatively, maybe the version is in the format of major.minor.patch, and the next version increments the patch. But without more info, I need to make assumptions. Let me check the problem again. The user says "following existing pattern", so maybe the function should handle semantic versioning, where the version is split into major, minor, patch, and possibly pre-release identifiers.

So, the approach would be to parse the version string into its components, increment the appropriate part, and then reassemble it. For example, given "1.2.3", increment the patch to "1.2.4". If the version has a pre-release part like "1.2.3-alpha", then maybe increment the patch and keep the pre-release, or increment the minor and reset the pre-release. But the exact behavior depends on the rules.

Wait, the problem says "next version identifier following existing pattern". So perhaps the function should handle semantic versioning, where the next version is determined by incrementing the patch version, and if the pre-release is present, it's handled accordingly. But I need to think about how to handle different cases.

Let me think of some examples. For example:

- next_version("1.0.0") → "1.0.1"
- next_version("1.0.0-alpha") → "1.0.1-alpha"
- next_version("1.0.0-alpha.1") → "1.0.1-alpha.1"
- next_version("1.0.0") → "1.1.0" if the next is minor?
Wait, but that's not clear. Maybe the function is supposed to increment the patch version by 1, unless the version is a pre-release, in which case it's handled differently. Or perhaps the function is supposed to follow the semantic versioning rules where the next version is determined by the current version's components.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to handle versions in the format of major.minor.patch, and the next version is the next patch. But if the version is something like "1.0.0", then next is "1.0.1". If the version is "1.0.0", and the next is a minor, then "1.1.0". But how to determine which increment to do?

Wait, the function's name is next_version, which suggests that it's the next version in sequence. But without knowing the current version's type (like whether it's a patch, minor, or major increment), it's ambiguous. However, perhaps the problem is expecting the standard semantic versioning where the next version is the next patch version. For example, "1.2.3" becomes "1.2.4".

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle versions with pre-release tags, and when incrementing, the pre-release part is considered. For example, "1.2.3-alpha" would become "1.2.4-alpha", but if the patch is at max, then increment minor, etc.

But without more info, I need to make assumptions. Let me look for similar functions. For example, in semantic versioning, the next version after "1.2.3" is "1.2.4". If the version is "1.2.3-alpha", the next would be "1.2.4-alpha". However, if the version is "1.2.3", and the next is a minor, then "1.3.0".

But how does the function determine which increment to do? The problem statement is unclear. Maybe the function is supposed to increment the patch version, regardless of the pre-release part. Or perhaps it's supposed to increment the patch, and if there's a pre-release, it's kept as is.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to handle versions in the format of major.minor.patch, and the next version is the next patch. So, for example:

next_version("1.0.0") → "1.0.1"

next_version("1.0.1") → "1.0.2"

But if the version is "1.0.0", and the next is a minor, then "1.1.0". However, the function's name is next_version, which might imply that it's the next in sequence, but without knowing the current version's type, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to increment the version according to the standard semantic versioning rules, where the next version is determined by the current version's components. For example, if the version is "1.2.3", the next is "1.2.4". If it's "1.2.3-alpha", then the next is "1.2.4-alpha". But if the version is "1.2.3", and the next is a minor, then "1.3.0".

But how to determine which increment to do? The problem statement doesn't specify. Therefore, perhaps the function is supposed to increment the patch version by 1, regardless of any pre-release tags. So, the function would split the version into parts, increment the last part, and then reassemble the version string.

But how to handle cases where the version has pre-release parts? For example, "1.2.3-alpha" would become "1.2.4-alpha".

So, the approach would be:

1. Split the version string into the core version (major, minor, patch) and the pre-release part.

2. Increment the patch version by 1.

3. If there's a pre-release part, append it to the new version.

But how to split the version string? For example, the version string can be split into parts using the '-' delimiter. The first part is the core version (major.minor.patch), and the rest are pre-release identifiers.

So, for example, "1.2.3-alpha.1" would be split into ["1.2.3", "alpha.1"], and the core version is "1.2.3".

So, the steps would be:

- Split the version into core and pre-release parts.

- Split the core into major, minor, patch.

- Increment the patch by 1.

- Reassemble the core as major.minor.patch, then append the pre-release part if present.

But what if the core version is something like "1.2.3", and the next version is "1.2.4".

So, the code would need to parse the version string into these components.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Python.

First, split the version string into the core and pre-release parts. The core is everything before the first '-', and the pre-release is the rest. For example, "1.2.3-alpha" → core is "1.2.3", pre-release is "alpha".

Then, split the core into major, minor, patch. Split by '.'.

Then, increment the patch by 1.

Then, reassemble the core as major.minor.(patch+1), and append the pre-release part if it exists.

So, for example:

version = "1.2.3-alpha.1"

core, pre = "1.2.3", "alpha.1"

split core into [1, 2, 3], increment patch to 4 → core becomes "1.2.4"

new version is "1.2.4-alpha.1"

Another example: version = "1.2.3" → core is "1.2.3", pre is None → new core is "1.2.4", no pre → "1.2.4".

Another example: version = "1.2.3-beta" → new version is "1.2.4-beta".

But what if the version is "1.2.3" and the next is a minor? Like, the next version after "1.2.3" is "1.3.0". But according to the current approach, it would be "1.2.4". So this approach would increment the patch version, not the minor. But maybe that's what the function is supposed to do.

But the problem statement says "next version identifier following existing pattern". So perhaps the function is supposed to increment the patch version, not the minor or major. So, the function is to generate the next patch version.

But how to handle cases where the version is a pre-release? For example, "1.2.3-alpha" → next is "1.2.4-alpha".

So, the code would need to handle splitting the version into core and pre-release parts.

Now, let's think about the code.

First, split the version into core and pre-release. We can split on the first '-'.

So:

parts = version.split('-', 1)

core = parts[0]

pre = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None

Then, split core into major, minor, patch.

core_parts = core.split('.')

major = int(core_parts[0])

minor = int(core_parts[1])

patch = int(core_parts[2])

Then, increment patch by 1.

new_core = f"{major}.{minor}.{patch + 1}"

If pre is not None, then new_version = f"{new_core}-{pre}"

Else, new_version = new_core.

But what if the core has more than 3 parts? For example, "1.2.3.4" → but according to semantic versioning, the core is major.minor.patch. So, perhaps the function assumes that the core is exactly three parts.

But what if the version is something like "1.2.3.4"? Then, splitting into core and pre-release would be problematic. But according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to handle existing patterns, so perhaps the input is always in the format of major.minor.patch[pre-release].

So, assuming that the core is always three parts.

But what if the version is "1.2.3-alpha"? Then core is "1.2.3", pre is "alpha".

So, the code would work.

Now, what about edge cases?

Case 1: version is "0.0.0" → next is "0.0.1".

Case 2: version is "1.0.0" → "1.0.1".

Case 3: version is "1.0.0-alpha" → "1.0.1-alpha".

Case 4: version is "1.0.0-alpha.1" → "1.0.1-alpha.1".

Case 5: version is "1.0.0-rc.2" → "1.0.1-rc.2".

Case 6: version is "1.0.0" → "1.0.1".

Case 7: version is "1.0.0-1" → "1.0.1-1".

Now, what about if the core has more than three parts? Like "1.2.3.4" → split into core "1.2.3.4" and pre-release None. Then, splitting core into parts would give 4 parts, which would cause an error. But according to semantic versioning, the core is major.minor.patch. So perhaps the function assumes that the core is exactly three parts.

So, the code would need to split the core into exactly three parts. If not, it would raise an error. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling invalid versions, so perhaps the function assumes that the input is valid.

So, the code would proceed as follows.

Now, let's think about the unit tests. The user mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, generating comprehensive unit tests first.

So, the tests would cover various cases:

Test 1: version is "1.0.0" → returns "1.0.1".

Test 2: version is "1.0.0-alpha" → returns "1.0.1-alpha".

Test 3: version is "1.0.0-alpha.1" → returns "1.0.1-alpha.1".

Test 4: version is "1.0.0-rc.2" → returns "1.0.1-rc.2".

Test 5: version is "1.0.0" → returns "1.0.1".

Test 6: version is "1.0.0-1" → returns "1.0.1-1".

Test 7: version is "1.2.3" → returns "1.2.4".

Test 8: version is "1.2.3.4" → but this would split core into 4 parts, which would cause an error. But according to the problem statement, the input is valid, so perhaps the function is supposed to handle only valid versions. So, the code would raise an error if the core has more than three parts.

But the problem statement doesn't specify handling invalid versions, so perhaps the function assumes that the input is a valid semantic version.

Now, writing the code.

So, the code would:

- Split the version into core and pre-release.

- Split core into three parts.

- Increment the patch.

- Reassemble.

Now, code:

def next_version(version):
    # Split into core and pre-release
    parts = version.split('-', 1)
    core = parts[0]
    pre = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None
    
    # Split core into major, minor, patch
    core_parts = core.split('.')
    if len(core_parts) != 3:
        raise ValueError("Invalid version format")
    major, minor, patch = map(int, core_parts)
    
    # Increment patch
    new_patch = patch + 1
    
    # Reassemble core
    new_core = f"{major}.{minor}.{new_patch}"
    
    # Add pre-release if present
    if pre:
        return f"{new_core}-{pre}"
    else:
        return new_core

But wait, what if the pre-release part has multiple hyphens? For example, "1.0.0-alpha.beta" → the split on '-' would split into ["1.0.0", "alpha.beta"], which is correct.

Yes, because the split is done on the first '-', so the pre-release part is everything after the first '-'.

But what if the version is "1.0.0-alpha-beta"? Then, the split would be ["1.0.0", "alpha-beta"], which is correct. The pre-release part is "alpha-beta".

So, the code handles that.

Now, the unit tests.

Testing the function with the examples.

Test 1: next_version("1.0.0") → "1.0.1".

Test 2: next_version("1.0.0-alpha") → "1.0.1-alpha".

Test 3: next_version("1.0.0-alpha.1") → "1.0.1-alpha.1".

Test 4: next_version("1.0.0-rc.2") → "1.0.1-rc.2".

Test 5: next_version("1.0.0-1") → "1.0.1-1".

Test 6: next_version("1.2.3") → "1.2.4".

Test 7: next_version("1.2.3-alpha") → "1.2.4-alpha".

Test 8: next_version("1.2.3-alpha.1") → "1.2.4-alpha.1".

But also, what about versions with leading zeros? Like "0.0.1" → next is "0.0.2".

Another test case: version is "0.0.0" → returns "0.0.1".

What about versions with more than three parts in the core? For example, "1.2.3.4" → core_parts would be 4 elements, which would raise ValueError. So, the code would raise an error for invalid versions.

So, the code is written as above.

Now, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format, and only the code, no explanations.

So, the code would be:

def next_version(version):
    """
    Given next version identifier following existing pattern
    """
    parts = version.split('-', 1)
    core = parts[0]
    pre = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None
    
    core_parts = core.split('.')
    if len(core_parts) != 3:
        raise ValueError("Invalid version format")
    major, minor, patch = map(int, core_parts)
    
    new_patch = patch + 1
    new_core = f"{major}.{minor}.{new_patch}"
    
    if pre:
        return f"{new_core}-{pre}"
    else:
        return new_core

But wait, the docstring is empty. The original function has a docstring, but the user provided the function signature with the docstring. So, the docstring should be filled in.

Wait, the original function signature is:

def next_version(version):
    """
    Given next version identifier following existing pattern
    """
    ...

So, the docstring is as given. But perhaps it should be more detailed. However, the user says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code should have the same docstring.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should have the same docstring.

So, the code would have the given docstring.

So, the final code is as written above.

Now, the user wants the code output in Python markdown format. So, the code is enclosed in triple backticks.

So, the answer is:

```python
def next_version(version):
    """
    Given next version identifier following existing pattern
    """
    parts = version.split('-', 1)
    core = parts[0]
    pre = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None
    
    core_parts = core.split('.')
    if len(core_parts) != 3:
        raise ValueError("Invalid version format")
    major, minor, patch = map(int, core_parts)
    
    new_patch = patch + 1
    new_core = f"{major}.{minor}.{new_patch}"
    
    if pre:
        return f"{new_core}-{pre}"
    else:
        return new_core
```

But the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So, perhaps the unit tests are not required in the output. The initial instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the answer is the code as above.
