Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the status_str method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so first I should think about writing unit tests, then the actual code.

The function is part of a class, probably, since it's using self. The method takes a prefix parameter, which defaults to an empty string. The docstring says it returns a string by visiting the sorted self.messages list. Each visit adds the prefix and the element. So, I need to sort self.messages, then iterate over them, adding the prefix to each element, and concatenate all those into a single string.

Wait, what's the structure of self.messages? The problem says it's a list, but I don't know the exact type. Maybe it's a list of strings or some objects that can be converted to strings. The method should process each element in the sorted list.

So, the steps for the method would be:

1. Sort the self.messages list. But how? The default sort? Or maybe the list is already sorted? The docstring says "sorted self.messages list", so I need to sort it first.

2. For each element in the sorted list, prepend the prefix and the element's string representation.

3. Join all these strings with newlines or some separator? The docstring isn't specific. Wait, the example in the docstring isn't given, but the function returns a string. Let me think: if the messages are ["msg1", "msg2"], and prefix is "Prefix: ", then the output would be "Prefix: msg1\nPrefix: msg2"?

But the docstring says "each visit add prefix and the element". So maybe each element is prefixed and then concatenated with some separator. The default might be newlines, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. The user might expect that each element is prefixed and joined with newlines. But perhaps the actual code should join with newlines. Alternatively, maybe the elements are joined with a separator, but the docstring isn't clear.

Wait, the function's docstring says "return a string with visiting the sorted self.messages list, each visit add prefix and the element". So, for each element in the sorted list, we add prefix + element. Then combine all those into a single string. How? Probably joined with newlines. For example, if the sorted messages are [msg1, msg2], then the result is prefix + msg1\nprefix + msg2.

But the exact separator isn't specified. Maybe the user expects that each element is prefixed and then joined with newlines. So the code would be something like:

sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
result = '\n'.join([f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted_messages])
return result

But I need to make sure that the messages are sorted. Wait, the problem says "sorted self.messages list", so the method should sort them. So the code would sort the list first.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think about possible test cases.

Test case 1: self.messages is empty. Then the result should be an empty string.

Test case 2: self.messages has elements. For example, messages = ["b", "a"], sorted becomes ["a", "b"], with prefix "Prefix: ", the result is "Prefix: a\nPrefix: b".

Another test case: prefix is empty, messages are ["hello", "world"], sorted, so the result is "hello\nworld".

Another case: messages are numbers, but when converted to strings. For example, messages = [3, 1, 2], sorted becomes [1,2,3], prefix is "Num: ", result is "Num: 1\nNum: 2\nNum: 3".

But how to test this? The code would need to have the messages attribute. So the class must have a messages list. So the unit tests would need to create an instance of the class, set self.messages, and then call status_str.

But since the code isn't provided, the tests would have to assume that the class has a messages attribute. So the tests would be for the method, not the class.

So, writing the unit tests first. Let's think about the test cases.

Test 1: Empty messages. Expected output is empty string.

Test 2: Messages with elements, sorted. Check that the prefix is added and elements are sorted.

Test 3: Different prefix.

Test 4: Messages with different types, but when converted to strings.

But how to handle the messages? For example, if messages are integers, then str(msg) would be used.

So the code would handle any elements that can be converted to strings.

Now, writing the code. The method is part of a class. The code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    return '\n'.join(f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted_messages)

But wait, the docstring says "each visit add prefix and the element". So for each element in the sorted list, we add prefix and the element. So the code above does that.

But what if the messages list is not sortable? Well, the problem says that the method is supposed to sort self.messages, so the code assumes that the list is sortable. So the code would raise an error if the elements are not comparable. But that's beyond the scope of the current problem.

Now, the unit tests. Let's write them using pytest style.

Test case 1:

def test_status_str_empty_messages():
    class TestClass:
        def __init__(self):
            self.messages = []
        def status_str(self, prefix=''):
            sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
            return '\n'.join(f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted_messages)
    obj = TestClass()
    assert obj.status_str() == ''

Test case 2:

def test_status_str_sorted_messages():
    class TestClass:
        def __init__(self):
            self.messages = ["b", "a"]
        def status_str(self, prefix=''):
            sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
            return '\n'.join(f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted_messages)
    obj = TestClass()
    assert obj.status_str("Prefix: ") == "Prefix: a\nPrefix: b"

Test case 3: Check with different prefix.

def test_status_str_with_prefix():
    class TestClass:
        def __init__(self):
            self.messages = [3, 1, 2]
        def status_str(self, prefix=''):
            sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
            return '\n'.join(f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted_messages)
    obj = TestClass()
    assert obj.status_str("Num: ") == "Num: 1\nNum: 2\nNum: 3"

But wait, the code for the method is part of the class. So the tests would need to have the method defined in the class. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition. So the tests are for the method, assuming that the class has the messages attribute.

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature. So the code would be the method, and the tests would be for that method.

But the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the answer should include the code for the method and the unit tests.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the answer should include the unit tests and the code.

But the user might expect that the code is the method, and the tests are separate. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code includes both the method and the tests?

But the original function is part of a class. So the code would be the method, and the tests would be separate.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code is the method. The tests are part of the TDD approach, but the user might want the code for the method, not the tests. Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So maybe the code is the method, and the tests are part of the generated code? Or perhaps the user wants the code for the method, and the tests are part of the answer?

But the initial instruction says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So the code is the method. The tests are part of the TDD approach, but the user might not want them in the output. Wait, the user's tips say to generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the final output is only the code generated. So perhaps the code includes the method and the tests?

But the user's example shows that the code is the method. Let me recheck the original problem.

The user provided a function signature and a docstring. They want the code generated based on that. The tips mention TDD, but the output is only the code generated. So perhaps the code is the method, and the tests are not part of the output. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So maybe the code is the method, and the tests are not part of the output. But the user's tips say to generate the tests first. However, the user might have intended that the code includes the method, and the tests are part of the answer. But the problem is ambiguous.

But looking at the example, the user provided a function signature and wants the code generated. The answer should be the code for the method. However, the user's tips mention TDD, so perhaps the answer should include the unit tests and the code. But the user says "Output ONLY the code generated", which might mean the code for the method. But the user might have intended to have the code and the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which is the method.

So perhaps the answer is just the code for the method, with the docstring. Let me proceed with that.

So the code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return a string with visiting the sorted self.messages list, each visit add prefix and the element in the sorted self.messages list.
    """
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    return '\n'.join(f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted_messages)

But wait, the docstring says "each visit add prefix and the element". So the code is correct.

But what about if the messages list is not sorted? The code sorts it, so that's handled.

Now, the user might want the code with the docstring. So the code includes the docstring as given.

So the final code is as above.

But the user's initial instruction says to output only the code generated. So the answer is the code for the method, including the docstring.
