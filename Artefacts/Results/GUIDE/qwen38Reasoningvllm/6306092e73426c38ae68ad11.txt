Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the merge_extra_vars function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to extend vars_dict with extra_vars. Hmm, the docstring says that extra_vars is a list of extra-vars. Wait, but how are they structured? Like, maybe each item in the list is a dictionary that needs to be merged into vars_dict?

Wait, the function's purpose is to merge extra variables into the existing vars_dict. So, if extra_vars is provided, it should merge those into vars_dict. But how exactly? Let me think. Maybe each element in extra_vars is a dictionary, and we need to merge them into vars_dict. Or perhaps extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs? Or maybe it's a list of dictionaries, each representing some variables to merge.

Wait, the parameter description says "List of extra-vars". The term "extra-vars" might be a term from a specific context, like Ansible, where extra-vars are often provided as a list of dictionaries. For example, in Ansible, when you pass --extra-vars, it can be a list of key-value pairs. But in Python, maybe the extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, each containing variables to merge into vars_dict.

Wait, the function's name is merge_extra_vars, so perhaps the idea is to take the vars_dict and merge the extra_vars into it. So, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, each of which has key-value pairs, we need to merge them into vars_dict. But how to handle overlapping keys? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe we should overwrite existing keys in vars_dict with those from extra_vars.

So, the steps would be:

1. Check if extra_vars is provided. If not, default to None.
2. If extra_vars is not None, iterate through each item in the list.
3. For each item in extra_vars, merge its key-value pairs into vars_dict. If there's a key conflict, the extra_vars value should overwrite the existing one.

But wait, how is extra_vars structured? Let me think again. The parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list. So maybe each element in the list is a dictionary. For example, if extra_vars is [{'a': 1}, {'b': 2}], then merging into vars_dict would add a:1 and b:2.

Alternatively, maybe extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs, like [('a', 1), ('b', 2)], but that's less common. The docstring says "List of extra-vars", so perhaps each element is a dictionary.

So, the function would take vars_dict and merge each dictionary in extra_vars into it. So, for each dict in extra_vars, update vars_dict with that dict's items. That would mean using the update method for each dictionary.

So, the code would look something like:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for item in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(item)
    return vars_dict

Wait, but the function is supposed to extend vars_dict. However, in Python, dictionaries are mutable, so modifying them in place would change the original. But maybe the function is supposed to return a new dictionary instead? Or perhaps it's intended to modify the existing one. The docstring says "Extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which suggests modifying it in place.

But the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. So, the code would take vars_dict and merge the extra_vars into it. So, the code would loop through each item in extra_vars and update vars_dict with those items.

But wait, what if extra_vars is not a list of dictionaries? For example, if someone passes a single dictionary instead of a list. But according to the function's parameters, extra_vars is a list. So perhaps the function expects that.

But the function's parameters say that extra_vars is a list. So the code should handle that. However, the function's docstring says "List of extra-vars", but maybe each element is a dictionary. So the code would iterate through each element in the list and update vars_dict with that element.

But let's think about the test cases. Let's imagine some test cases.

Test case 1: vars_dict is empty, extra_vars is a list of dictionaries. After merging, vars_dict should have all the keys from the extra_vars.

Test case 2: vars_dict has some keys, and extra_vars has overlapping keys. The extra_vars should overwrite.

Test case 3: extra_vars is None. Then, no merging is done.

But the function's code would need to handle that. Also, what if extra_vars is not a list? Well, the function's parameters say that extra_vars is a list, so perhaps the code assumes that. But maybe the function should handle cases where extra_vars is not a list, but that's not specified. The docstring says "List of extra-vars", so perhaps the function expects that.

Now, considering the test-driven development approach, I need to write unit tests first. Let me think about the tests.

First, test when extra_vars is None. Then, the function should return the original vars_dict.

Second, test when extra_vars is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary is merged into vars_dict.

Third, test overlapping keys. For example, if vars_dict has a key 'a' and extra_vars has a dictionary with 'a' as well. The extra_vars value should overwrite.

Fourth, test when extra_vars is an empty list. Then, no changes.

But how to write these tests? Using Python's unittest framework.

But the user wants me to generate the code first, then the tests. Wait, the user says to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. But the tips say to follow TDD approach, first generating tests then code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code. However, the tips say to generate the tests first. So perhaps the user wants me to generate the tests first, then the code. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in python markdown format. Wait, the user says:

"Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

But the tips say to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the tips are just tips, and the actual instruction is to generate the code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is to be written, and the tests are part of the process but not the output. However, the user says to output only the code generated. So maybe the code is to be written, and the tests are not part of the output.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code. So perhaps the code is to be written, and the tests are part of the thought process but not the output.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So I need to write the code for the function merge_extra_vars.

So, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for item in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(item)
    return vars_dict

Wait, but what if extra_vars is not a list? For example, if someone passes a single dictionary. But according to the function's parameters, extra_vars is a list. So perhaps the function expects that. However, the code as written would handle it if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries. But if someone passes a single dictionary, it would be treated as a list with one element. Wait, no. If extra_vars is a single dictionary, then the code would iterate through it as a list, but that's not correct. Wait, no. If extra_vars is a single dictionary, then the code would loop through each item in that dictionary. Wait, no. Because if extra_vars is a dictionary, then for item in extra_vars would iterate over the keys. But that's not correct. So perhaps the function expects that extra_vars is a list of dictionaries. So the code is correct under that assumption.

But the function's docstring says that extra_vars is a list of extra-vars. So the code is correct.

But perhaps the function should handle the case where extra_vars is not a list. But according to the function's parameters, it's a list. So the code is correct.

Another thing: the function returns vars_dict. Since dictionaries are mutable, the original dictionary is modified. But maybe the function is intended to return a new dictionary instead. However, the docstring says "Extend vars_dict", which suggests modifying it in place. But the function returns it. So perhaps the code is correct.

But maybe the function should not modify the original vars_dict. For example, if the user wants to keep the original dictionary unchanged. But the docstring says "Extend vars_dict", which implies modifying it. However, in Python, the function would modify the original dictionary because it's passed by reference. So the code is correct.

So, the code is as above.

But let me think again. Suppose vars_dict is {'a': 1}, and extra_vars is [{'b': 2}, {'a': 3}]. Then, after merging, vars_dict would be {'a':3, 'b':2}.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, so the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with python as the language.

So the final code would be:

```python
def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for item in extra_vars:
        vars_dict.update(item)
    return vars_dict
```

But wait, the function's parameters say that extra_vars is a list. However, the code assumes that each item in extra_vars is a dictionary. So if someone passes a list of key-value pairs (like a list of tuples), this code would fail. But according to the docstring, extra_vars is a list of extra-vars. So perhaps each element in the list is a dictionary. Therefore, the code is correct.

So that's the code.
