Okay, I need to generate Python code for the deep_merge_nodes function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that the function should merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. Hmm, so the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes, which are probably dictionaries or some kind of mapping structures. The merging should be deep, meaning that nested structures should be merged recursively.

Wait, but the term "MappingNode" is mentioned. Maybe the nodes are instances of a class called MappingNode, which is a custom data structure. But the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps I should assume that the nodes are dictionaries, or maybe they are objects that have a 'values' attribute or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the nodes are dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge them recursively.

Wait, the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that each node is a structure that can have nested nodes. So maybe each node is a dictionary, and the function merges all the dictionaries in the nodes list, combining their keys. For example, if two dictionaries have the same key, the value from the latter one is kept. But if the values are also dictionaries, they should be merged recursively.

But the docstring says "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So, for keys that are present in multiple nodes, if the values are not MappingNodes (like lists or other non-mapping types), the last one in the list is kept. But if they are MappingNodes (like dictionaries), then they should be merged recursively.

So the approach would be to process each node in the list, and for each key, if the key exists in multiple nodes, merge their values. But how to handle the merging?

Let me think of an example. Suppose we have two nodes:

node1 = {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2}}
node2 = {'a': 3, 'b': {'d': 4}}

The merged result should be {'a': 3, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 4}}.

Another example: if a key has values that are not MappingNodes, like node1 has 'x': 5 and node2 has 'x': 6, then the merged result would have 'x': 6.

So the function needs to recursively merge the nodes. The challenge is to handle nested structures.

Now, how to implement this in Python. Let me think of the steps:

1. The function takes a list of nodes. Each node is a mapping (like a dictionary) that may contain other mappings as values.

2. For each key in all nodes, we need to collect all values associated with that key from each node. Then, if the values are mappings, we need to merge them recursively. If not, the last one is kept.

Wait, but the nodes are in a list. So for each key, we need to process all the nodes and collect their values. For example, for key 'a', collect all the values from each node. Then, if any of those values are mappings, merge them. Otherwise, take the last one.

But how to handle the merging process. Let me think of the algorithm:

- Initialize a result dictionary.
- Iterate through each node in the nodes list.
- For each node, iterate through its key-value pairs.
- For each key in the current node:
   - If the key is already in the result:
      - If the current value is a mapping (like a dict) and the existing value in the result is also a mapping, then recursively merge them.
      - Else, replace the existing value with the current value (since the last one is kept).
   - Else:
      - Add the key-value pair to the result.

Wait, but this approach would not handle nested merges properly. For example, if the existing value in the result is a dict, and the current node's value is also a dict, then we need to merge them. But how to do that recursively.

Alternatively, the function could process each node in order, and for each key, if it's present in the result, check if both the existing value and the current value are mappings. If so, merge them. Otherwise, take the current value.

But how to handle multiple nodes. For example, if there are three nodes with the same key, each with different values. The last one should be kept, but if they are mappings, they need to be merged.

Wait, the docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So for keys that are present in multiple nodes, the merging depends on whether the values are MappingNodes.

So the process would be:

For each key in all nodes:

- Collect all the values from each node for that key.

- If any of the values are not MappingNodes, then the last one in the list is kept.

- If all values are MappingNodes, then merge them recursively.

But how to handle this. Let's think of the steps again.

Let me think of the function as merging all nodes in the list, where each node is a mapping. The merging is done such that for each key, the values from all nodes are merged, with the last value taking precedence if they are not mappings. If they are mappings, they are merged recursively.

So, the approach could be:

- Initialize a result as an empty dictionary.

- For each node in the nodes list:

   - For each key in the node:

      - If the key is already in the result:

         - Check if both the existing value and the current node's value are mappings.

         - If both are mappings, recursively merge them.

         - Else, replace the existing value with the current node's value.

      - Else:

         - Add the key-value pair to the result.

But this approach may not handle all cases. For example, if a key is present in multiple nodes, and some of the values are mappings and others are not. For instance, node1 has 'a': {'b': 1}, node2 has 'a': 2. Then, the merged result would have 'a': 2, because the last value is not a mapping. But if node1 has 'a': {'b': 1}, node2 has 'a': {'c': 2}, then the merged result would be {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}.

But how to determine if a value is a mapping. In Python, we can check if it's an instance of dict, or perhaps a custom MappingNode class. However, since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the function is intended to work with dictionaries, assuming that any value that is a dict is a MappingNode.

So, for the purpose of this code, I'll assume that the nodes are dictionaries, and that a MappingNode is a dictionary. So, the code can check if a value is a dict.

So, the function deep_merge_nodes takes a list of nodes (each being a dict), and returns a merged dict.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

But wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the nodes are passed as a list. So, perhaps the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list. But how to handle the merging of multiple nodes. For example, if there are three nodes, each with the same key, the last one's value is kept, but if they are dicts, they are merged.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list, and for each key, the values from all nodes are merged. For example, if two nodes have the same key, their values are merged. But if the values are not dicts, then the last one is kept.

So, the function is similar to the standard dictionary merge, but with deep merging for nested dictionaries.

But how to implement this. Let me think of writing a helper function that merges two dictionaries, and then apply it recursively.

The helper function would take two dictionaries and merge them. For each key in the second dictionary, if the key is present in the first, then:

- If both values are dicts, merge them recursively.

- Else, take the value from the second dict.

But this approach would not handle multiple nodes. For example, if there are three nodes, the helper function would merge the first two, then merge the result with the third.

But the problem is that the original function is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. So, perhaps the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in sequence, with each subsequent node overriding previous values where possible.

So, the approach would be:

Initialize the result as the first node.

Then, for each subsequent node in the list, merge it into the result.

But how to merge two nodes. So, the helper function would take two dictionaries and merge them, with the second one taking precedence for conflicting keys.

So, the code could look like this:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    if not nodes:
        return {}
    result = nodes[0].copy()
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        result = deep_merge(result, node)
    return result

But then, the helper function deep_merge would handle merging two dictionaries.

But how to implement deep_merge. Let's think:

def deep_merge(d1, d2):
    for key, value in d2.items():
        if key in d1:
            if isinstance(d1[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                deep_merge(d1[key], value)
            else:
                d1[key] = value
        else:
            d1[key] = value
    return d1

Wait, but this approach would modify d1 in place. However, if we want to avoid modifying the original dictionaries, perhaps we should create a new dictionary. Alternatively, we can make a copy.

But in the case of the helper function, perhaps we should create a new dictionary to avoid modifying the original. Let me adjust that.

Wait, the helper function would take two dictionaries and return a new merged dictionary. So:

def deep_merge(d1, d2):
    merged = d1.copy()
    for key, value in d2.items():
        if key in merged:
            if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                merged[key] = deep_merge(merged[key], value)
            else:
                merged[key] = value
        else:
            merged[key] = value
    return merged

But then, in the main function, we would start with the first node, and then merge each subsequent node into the result.

Wait, but the initial code for deep_merge_nodes would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    if not nodes:
        return {}
    result = nodes[0].copy()
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        result = deep_merge(result, node)
    return result

But this approach would work for merging all nodes, with each subsequent node overriding previous values where possible, and merging nested dictionaries.

But what if a node is not a dictionary? Well, according to the docstring, the nodes are supposed to be MappingNodes, which I'm assuming are dictionaries. So, perhaps the function expects that all nodes are dictionaries.

But the function's parameters are nodes, which is a list. So, perhaps the function is supposed to handle a list of nodes, each of which is a mapping (like a dict), and merge them all.

But what if the nodes list is empty? The function returns an empty dict.

Now, let's test this approach with some examples.

Example 1:

nodes = [{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2}}, {'a': 3, 'b': {'d': 4}}]

The merged result should be {'a': 3, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 4}}.

Let's see:

result starts as the first node: {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2}}.

Then, merge with the second node:

For key 'a', existing value is 1, new value is 3. Since they are not dicts, replace. So 'a' becomes 3.

For key 'b', existing value is {'c': 2}, new value is {'d':4}. Both are dicts, so merge. The merged 'b' becomes {'c': 2, 'd':4}.

So the final result is correct.

Another example:

nodes = [{'x': 5}, {'x': 6}]

The merged result is {'x': 6}.

Another example:

nodes = [{'x': {'y': 1}}, {'x': {'z': 2}}]

Merged result is {'x': {'y': 1, 'z': 2}}.

Another example with conflicting types:

nodes = [{'x': 5}, {'x': {'y': 1}}]

The merged result would have 'x' as {'y': 1}, since the second node's value is a dict, and the first is not. So, the second value takes precedence.

But according to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, in this case, the first node's 'x' is 5 (non-MappingNode), and the second node's 'x' is a dict (MappingNode). So, since the second is a MappingNode, we need to merge them. Wait, but the docstring says that if the values are non-MappingNode, the last one remains. But if they are MappingNodes, then they are merged.

Wait, the docstring says: "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So, if the values are non-MappingNodes, take the last one. But if they are MappingNodes, then merge them.

So, in the case where a key has values that are a mix of MappingNode and non-MappingNode, how to handle?

For example:

node1 has 'x': 5 (non-MappingNode), node2 has 'x': {'y': 1} (MappingNode). The merged result would be {'x': {'y': 1}}? Or is the non-MappingNode considered as a value that is not a MappingNode, so the last one (node2's value) is kept. But node2's value is a MappingNode. So, perhaps the rule is: for a colliding key, if all values are non-MappingNodes, take the last one. If any value is a MappingNode, then merge them.

Wait, the docstring says "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So, if the colliding keys have values that are non-MappingNodes, then the last one is kept. If any of the values are MappingNodes, then they are merged.

So, in the example where node1 has 'x': 5 (non-MappingNode) and node2 has 'x': {'y': 1} (MappingNode), the colliding key 'x' has a mix of non-MappingNode and MappingNode. How to handle this?

The docstring says that if the colliding keys have non-MappingNode values, then the last one remains. But in this case, there's a mix. So perhaps the rule is that if any of the values is a MappingNode, then we need to merge them. Otherwise, take the last one.

But how to determine that. For example, if the first value is a non-MappingNode, and the second is a MappingNode, then the second is a MappingNode, so we need to merge them. But how? Because the first value is not a MappingNode. So, perhaps the merging process would take the second value (the MappingNode) and replace the first value. But that would not be correct. Because the first value is a non-MappingNode, and the second is a MappingNode. So, according to the docstring, if the colliding keys have non-MappingNode values, then the last one remains. But in this case, one is a non-MappingNode and the other is a MappingNode. So, perhaps the function should treat the non-MappingNode as a value that is not a MappingNode, and the MappingNode as a MappingNode. So, the presence of a MappingNode in the values would require merging. But how to handle that.

This is a bit ambiguous. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, if all the values for a key are non-MappingNodes, then the last one is kept. If any of the values is a MappingNode, then they are merged. But how to determine that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge all values for a key, treating them as MappingNodes if they are, and otherwise taking the last one. For example, if a key has values that are a mix of MappingNodes and non-MappingNodes, then the non-MappingNodes are treated as their own values, and the MappingNodes are merged. But that's unclear.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended behavior is that for a key, if all the values are non-MappingNodes, then the last one is kept. If any of the values is a MappingNode, then they are merged. So, for example, if the first value is a non-MappingNode and the second is a MappingNode, then the second value is a MappingNode, so the first value is replaced by the second. But that would not be merging. So perhaps the function is supposed to merge all values, treating them as MappingNodes if they are, and otherwise taking the last one. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge all the values for a key, treating them as MappingNodes. So, for example, if the first value is a non-MappingNode, then it is converted into a MappingNode (like a dict), and then merged with the subsequent values. But this is not clear.

Given that the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the function is supposed to merge all the nodes, and for each key, if the values are dictionaries, merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last one.

So, in the helper function, for each key in the second dictionary, if the key exists in the first, then check if both values are dictionaries. If yes, merge them. Otherwise, take the value from the second dictionary. This way, if one value is a dict and the other is not, the second one (the one from the second dictionary) is taken. But this would not merge the dict with the non-dict. For example, if the first value is a dict and the second is a non-dict, the second is taken. But if the first is a non-dict and the second is a dict, the second is taken. But this would not merge them. However, according to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, in this case, if one is a dict (MappingNode) and the other is not, then the last one (the dict) is kept. But perhaps the function is supposed to merge them. But this is unclear.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the function should treat all values as MappingNodes, and merge them recursively. However, the docstring says that if the values are non-MappingNodes, the last one remains. So, perhaps the correct approach is:

For each key, collect all the values from the nodes. Then:

- If any of the values is a non-MappingNode, then the last one is kept.

- Else, merge them recursively.

But how to determine if a value is a non-MappingNode. For example, if a value is a list, it's a non-MappingNode. If it's a dict, it's a MappingNode.

So, the process for a key would be:

Collect all values for that key from all nodes.

If all values are MappingNodes (dicts), then merge them recursively.

Else, take the last value.

But how to implement this. For example, for a key, we have a list of values. We need to check if all are dicts. If yes, merge them. Else, take the last one.

But how to handle multiple nodes. For example, if the first node has a key with a dict, the second node has the same key with a non-dict. Then, since not all values are dicts, take the last one (non-dict). But if the first node has a non-dict and the second has a dict, then take the last one (dict).

But how to implement this. This complicates the merging process. Because for each key, we have to check all the values from all nodes.

This suggests that the initial approach of merging node by node, and for each key, checking if the existing value and the new value are both dicts, and merging them, would not handle cases where there are multiple nodes with the same key and mixed types.

But perhaps the initial approach is sufficient for the problem, given the ambiguity in the docstring.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to merge all the nodes in sequence, and for each key, the last value is kept, but if the value is a dict, then it is merged with the existing value. But this is not clear.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the nodes are dictionaries, and that the merging is done recursively for nested dictionaries, with the last value taking precedence if they are not dictionaries.

So, the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    if not nodes:
        return {}
    result = nodes[0].copy()
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        result = deep_merge(result, node)
    return result

def deep_merge(d1, d2):
    merged = d1.copy()
    for key, value in d2.items():
        if key in merged:
            if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                merged[key] = deep_merge(merged[key], value)
            else:
                merged[key] = value
        else:
            merged[key] = value
    return merged

But this code would handle the cases where the values are dictionaries, merging them recursively, and for non-dictionary values, taking the last one.

But what about if there are multiple nodes with the same key, and some of their values are not dictionaries. For example:

nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'a': {'b': 3}}]

The merged result would be {'a': {'b': 3}}.

Because the first two nodes have 'a' as 1 and 2 (non-dicts), so the last one (third node) has 'a' as a dict. Since the third node's value is a dict, the existing value (2) is replaced with the dict. So the merged result is {'a': {'b': 3}}.

But according to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains. So, in this case, the first two values are non-MappingNodes, and the third is a MappingNode. So, the third value is kept. But how does the code handle this? The code would check if the existing value (2) is a dict. It is not, so it replaces it with the third value (dict). So, the code would correctly keep the third value.

Another example:

nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': {'b': 2}}]

The merged result would be {'a': {'b': 2}}.

Yes, because the second node's value is a dict, so it replaces the first value.

Another example:

nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 3}, {'a': {'b': 4}}]

The merged result would be {'a': {'b': 4}}.

Yes, because the third node's value is a dict, so it replaces the previous value (3).

So, the code seems to handle this case.

Now, what about if there are multiple nodes with the same key, and some of their values are dicts and others are not. For example:

nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': {'b': 2}}, {'a': 3}]

The merged result would be {'a': 3}.

Because the third node's value is 3 (non-dict), so it replaces the previous value (dict). So, the code would take the last value, which is a non-dict.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, this approach seems to handle the cases as per the docstring.

Now, the next step is to write the code for this function, and also generate unit tests.

But the user asked to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and to output only the code in Python markdown format. However, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. However, the tips mention to generate unit tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code. However, the initial instruction says to generate the code, but the tips suggest to generate tests first.

But the user says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. However, the tips mention to follow TDD, which would imply generating tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code. So, perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring.

So, I'll proceed to write the code as per the earlier analysis.

Now, the code:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    if not nodes:
        return {}
    result = nodes[0].copy()
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        result = deep_merge(result, node)
    return result

def deep_merge(d1, d2):
    merged = d1.copy()
    for key, value in d2.items():
        if key in merged:
            if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                merged[key] = deep_merge(merged[key], value)
            else:
                merged[key] = value
        else:
            merged[key] = value
    return merged

But wait, the function deep_merge is not part of the original function signature. The original function is deep_merge_nodes. So, the code should not include the deep_merge function as a separate function. Instead, it should be implemented within deep_merge_nodes, perhaps using a helper function.

Alternatively, the code can be written with the helper function inside deep_merge_nodes, or as a nested function.

But in Python, functions can be nested. However, for code clarity, perhaps it's better to have the helper function inside.

But the user's function signature is only for deep_merge_nodes. So, the code should be written as a single function.

Alternatively, the code can be written with the helper function inside.

But the user may expect that the code is written as a single function. However, the helper function is needed for the recursive merging.

So, the code would look like this:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    if not nodes:
        return {}
    result = nodes[0].copy()
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        result = _deep_merge(result, node)
    return result

def _deep_merge(d1, d2):
    merged = d1.copy()
    for key, value in d2.items():
        if key in merged:
            if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                merged[key] = _deep_merge(merged[key], value)
            else:
                merged[key] = value
        else:
            merged[key] = value
    return merged

But this code assumes that the nodes are dictionaries, and that the _deep_merge function is a helper.

But the user's function signature is only for deep_merge_nodes, so the helper function is not part of the public API.

But the user's code may have to handle other cases. For example, if the nodes are not dictionaries, but the docstring mentions MappingNode. However, without knowing the exact structure of MappingNode, it's hard to proceed. So, assuming that the nodes are dictionaries, and that a MappingNode is a dictionary.

Thus, the code should be as above.

But the user may have expected that the nodes are objects, and that the function is supposed to handle them. However, without more information, it's impossible to know. So, proceeding with the assumption that nodes are dictionaries.

Now, the code should be written in Python, and the user wants the code in markdown format, only the code.

So, the final code would be:

```python
def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    if not nodes:
        return {}
    result = nodes[0].copy()
    for node in nodes[1:]:
        result = _deep_merge(result, node)
    return result

def _deep_merge(d1, d2):
    merged = d1.copy()
    for key, value in d2.items():
        if key in merged:
            if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                merged[key] = _deep_merge(merged[key], value)
            else:
                merged[key] = value
        else:
            merged[key] = value
    return merged
```

But the user may not want the helper function. Alternatively, the code can be written with the helper function inside deep_merge_nodes.

Alternatively, the code can be written as a single function with nested helper.

But for code clarity, it's better to have the helper function.

However, the user's function signature is only for deep_merge_nodes. So, the helper function is not part of the public API.

But the code as written is correct.

Now, considering that the user may have intended for the nodes to be objects (like a custom MappingNode class), but without that information, the code assumes they are dictionaries.

Thus, the code is as above.
