Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the pop method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so first I should think about writing unit tests for this method.

The pop method in Python's dict class removes a key and returns its value. If the key isn't found, it returns the default value if provided, otherwise raises KeyError. The parameters are key and default, with default defaulting to __marker. 

First, I need to create the unit tests. Let's think about different scenarios:

1. Test when the key exists. The method should return the value and remove the key.
2. Test when the key doesn't exist and default is provided. Should return the default.
3. Test when the key doesn't exist and default isn't provided. Should raise KeyError.
4. Maybe test with the __marker as the default. Since __marker is a special value, perhaps the default is not None but a specific object. Wait, in Python's dict, the default is __marker, which is a special object used to indicate that the default wasn't provided. So in the code, if the default is __marker, then we should raise KeyError.

Wait, the function signature shows default=__marker. So in the code, when the default is __marker, we need to check if the key exists. If not, raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the value. But how does the __marker work here? Because in Python, the default for dict.pop is actually not __marker. Wait, no, in Python's built-in dict, the default is None, but the __marker is used in the code to distinguish between the default being provided and not. Wait, maybe the __marker is a placeholder here. Let me think.

In the given function signature, the default parameter is set to __marker. So the user is probably expecting that if the default is __marker, then it's treated as not providing a default. Wait, but in Python's actual dict.pop, the default is None, and if you pass None as the default, it's allowed. But perhaps in this case, the __marker is a special value that's not None. So the code should check if the default is __marker. If so, then if the key is not present, raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the value. But how to handle the default parameter?

So, the code for the pop method would need to:

- Check if the key is in the dictionary.
- If it is, remove it and return the value.
- If not, check if a default was provided. If the default is __marker, then raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

Wait, but the default parameter is set to __marker. So when the user calls pop with no default, it's using __marker. So in the code, if the default is __marker, then we need to raise KeyError if the key is not present. Otherwise, return the default.

So the code would look something like:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        value = self[key]
        del self[key]
        return value
    else:
        if default is __marker:
            raise KeyError(key)
        else:
            return default

But wait, in Python, the __marker is not a built-in variable. So perhaps the user is using a custom __marker, maybe a sentinel object. So in the code, we need to define __marker as a special value. But in the given function signature, the default is set to __marker, which suggests that __marker is a predefined constant. So maybe in the code, __marker is a private variable, like _marker, or perhaps it's a specific object.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should define __marker as a sentinel. For example, in the code, we can define __marker as an object, like a special instance. But in Python, the standard way to handle this is to use a sentinel, like None, but in this case, the default is __marker. So perhaps the code should have a __marker variable.

Wait, but in the function signature, the default is __marker. So in the code, the default parameter is set to __marker, which is a variable. Therefore, the code should have __marker defined. So perhaps in the class, there's a __marker attribute. But since the function is part of a class (since it's a method), maybe the __marker is a class-level variable.

So, the code would need to have a __marker variable. For example:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        # code here

But the user's function is part of a class, so the __marker is probably a class-level variable. However, the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the code should define __marker as a private variable.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should include that. But the problem is that the user's function is part of a class, and the __marker is a parameter. So, the code for the pop method would need to check if the default is __marker. Therefore, the code would need to have __marker defined somewhere.

But the user's function signature shows that the default is __marker. So perhaps the code should have __marker as a sentinel. So, in the code, we can define __marker as an object, like a private variable.

So, putting this together, the code would be:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self:
            value = self[key]
            del self[key]
            return value
        else:
            if default is __marker:
                raise KeyError(key)
            else:
                return default

But wait, in Python, the default for the pop method in the built-in dict is None. However, in this case, the default is __marker. So perhaps the user is using a different approach, where __marker is a sentinel to indicate that the default wasn't provided. So, when the user calls pop with no default, it's using __marker, and if the key is not found, it raises KeyError. Otherwise, returns the default.

But how to handle the default parameter. For example, if the user passes default=None, then it should return None. But if the default is __marker, then it's treated as not providing a default. So, the code checks if the default is __marker. If so, raise KeyError. Otherwise, return the default.

So the code seems correct.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think about the test cases.

Test 1: Key exists. Check that the value is returned and the key is removed.

Test 2: Key does not exist, default provided. Return the default.

Test 3: Key does not exist, default not provided. Raise KeyError.

Test 4: Default is __marker. So, when the key is not present, raise KeyError.

But how to test that? Because in the code, the default is __marker. So, when the user calls pop with no default, it uses __marker. So, in the test, if we call pop without a default, and the key is not present, it should raise KeyError.

But how to test that? Let's think.

For example:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        # code

Then, in the test:

d = MyDict()
d['a'] = 1

# Test 1: key exists
assert d.pop('a') == 1
assert 'a' not in d

# Test 2: key not exists, default provided
assert d.pop('b', 'default') == 'default'

# Test 3: key not exists, default not provided
try:
    d.pop('c')
except KeyError:
    pass
else:
    assert False, "Expected KeyError"

# Test 4: default is __marker, key not present
try:
    d.pop('c', default=MyDict.__marker)
except KeyError:
    pass
else:
    assert False, "Expected KeyError"

Wait, but in the code, the default is set to __marker. So when the user calls pop with default=__marker, it's treated as the default. But in the code, if the default is __marker, then it's treated as the default. Wait no. Wait, in the code, the default is __marker. So when the user calls pop with no default, it uses __marker. But if the user passes default=__marker, then it's the same as the default. So in the code, the check is if default is __marker. So, if the user passes default=__marker, then it's treated as the same as not providing a default. So, in that case, if the key is not present, it raises KeyError.

But how to test that? For example, if the user passes default=__marker, then it's the same as not providing a default. So, in the test case where the key is not present and default is __marker, it should raise KeyError.

But in the code, the default is __marker. So, when the user calls pop with default=__marker, it's the same as the default parameter. So, in that case, the code would check if default is __marker, which it is, and raise KeyError.

So, the test case where the user passes default=__marker would raise KeyError.

But how to test that? Let's think. For example, in the test:

d = MyDict()
d['a'] = 1

# Test 4: key not present, default is __marker
try:
    d.pop('b', default=MyDict.__marker)
except KeyError:
    pass
else:
    assert False, "Expected KeyError"

But in this case, the code would raise KeyError because the key is not present and the default is __marker.

But what if the user passes default=None? Then, the code would return None.

So, the code seems correct.

Now, the unit tests. Let's write them.

But the user said to generate the code, but first generate the unit tests. Wait, the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but first generate comprehensive unit tests. So the user wants the code to be generated with the tests first.

But the user says to output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. So perhaps the user wants the code for the pop method, but the initial instruction says to follow TDD, so first generate the tests, then the code.

But the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. But the tips say to follow TDD, first generating tests.

But perhaps the user wants the code for the pop method, but the assistant is supposed to generate the code, but first think about the tests. However, the user's final instruction is to output only the code generated, in python markdown format.

So, perhaps the user wants the code for the pop method, but the assistant should first think about the tests, then write the code.

But the user's main request is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code for the pop method.

So, the code would be as I outlined earlier. But I need to make sure that the code uses __marker as a sentinel. So, in the code, the __marker is a class-level variable.

So, the code would look like:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self:
            value = self[key]
            del self[key]
            return value
        else:
            if default is __marker:
                raise KeyError(key)
            else:
                return default

But wait, in Python, the default parameter is set to __marker. So, when the user calls pop without a default, it uses __marker. So, in the code, the default is __marker. So, the code checks if the default is __marker, and if so, raises KeyError.

But in the code, the __marker is a class-level variable. So, in the code, the __marker is accessed as self.__marker? Or as MyDict.__marker?

Wait, in the code, the __marker is a class-level variable. So, in the method, to access it, we can use self.__marker or MyDict.__marker. But in the code, the default is set to __marker, which is the class-level variable.

So, in the code, the default is __marker, which is the class-level variable. So, when the user calls pop with no default, it uses the class's __marker.

But in the code, the check is if default is __marker. So, if the default is passed as __marker, then it's the same as the class's __marker.

But in Python, if the class has a __marker variable, then when you pass default=__marker, it refers to the class's __marker.

So, the code should be correct.

Now, the unit tests. Let's think about how to write them. But the user says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the code is the pop method, and the tests are not part of the code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD, so first generate tests, then code.

But the user says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the code is the implementation of the pop method, and the tests are not part of the code. But the user might expect the code to include the tests. However, the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code is the method itself.

So, the code is as written above. But the user's function is part of a class. So, the code would be part of a class, perhaps a dictionary-like class.

But the user's function is part of a class, as it's a method. So, the code for the pop method would be as written.

So, the final code would be:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self:
            value = self[key]
            del self[key]
            return value
        else:
            if default is __marker:
                raise KeyError(key)
            else:
                return default

But wait, in Python, the __marker is a class variable, so in the method, we can access it as self.__marker or MyDict.__marker. But in the code, the default is set to __marker, which refers to the class variable. So, when the user calls pop with default=__marker, it's the same as the class's __marker.

But in the code, the check is if default is __marker. So, if the default is passed as __marker, then it's the same as the class's __marker. So, the code would raise KeyError.

But how to handle cases where the user passes a different object that is the same as __marker? Well, in Python, the 'is' operator checks for identity, so if the default is the same object as __marker, then it's considered equal.

So, the code is correct.

Now, the user's function signature shows that the default is __marker. So, the code uses that.

So, the code is correct.
