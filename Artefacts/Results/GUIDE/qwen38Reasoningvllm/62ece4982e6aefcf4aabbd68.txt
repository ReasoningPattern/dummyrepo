Okay, I need to generate Python code for the int_to_string function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function converts an integer to a string using a custom alphabet. The output should have the most significant digit first. Also, there's an optional padding parameter. Let me recall how such conversions work.

So, the basic idea is to repeatedly divide the number by the length of the alphabet and take the remainder each time. The remainder gives the index in the alphabet for each character. But since the most significant digit comes first, I need to reverse the order of the characters collected.

Wait, right. For example, if the number is 123 and the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 123 divided by 3 (length of alphabet) would give 41 with remainder 0, then 41 divided by 3 is 13 rem 2, then 13 divided by 3 is 4 rem 1, then 4 divided by 3 is 1 rem 1, then 1 divided by 3 is 0 rem 1. So the digits are 1,1,2,0. But since the most significant digit is first, the order would be 1,1,2,0. Wait, but when you collect the remainders, you get them in reverse order. So you need to reverse the list of characters at the end.

Wait, let me think again. Let's take a simple example. Suppose the number is 4, and the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c']. The length is 3. So 4 divided by 3 is 1 with remainder 1. Then 1 divided by 3 is 0 with remainder 1. So the remainders are 1 and 1. So the digits are 1 and 1, but since the first remainder is the least significant digit, the actual order is reversed. So the correct string is 'aa' (since 1 corresponds to 'a' and 1 again). Wait, no. Wait, the first remainder is the least significant digit. So when you collect them in the order of remainders, you have to reverse them to get the correct order. For example, if the remainders are [1, 1], then the actual digits are 1 (most significant) and 1 (least significant), so the string is 'aa'.

So the process is:

- While the number is greater than zero:
   - Get the remainder when divided by the alphabet length.
   - Append the corresponding character from the alphabet.
   - Divide the number by the alphabet length.
- Reverse the collected characters to get the correct order.

But wait, what if the number is zero? Well, the problem says it's a short uuid, which probably doesn't have leading zeros. But the function should handle that. However, if the number is zero, the output should be the first character of the alphabet? Or maybe the function expects the number to be non-zero? Hmm, the docstring says the number represents a short uuid, so maybe it's possible for the number to be zero. But the function should handle that.

But let's proceed. Now, the padding parameter is optional. If provided, the output should be padded with leading characters from the alphabet to reach the specified length. For example, if padding is 5, and the resulting string is shorter than 5, add leading characters (the first character of the alphabet?) to make it 5 characters long.

Wait, the padding is optional. So, if the padding is provided, the output string should have a length of at least padding. If the generated string is shorter than padding, pad it with leading characters (probably the first character of the alphabet?), so that the total length is padding. But how to determine which characters to pad with? The problem says "padding" but doesn't specify. However, in UUIDs, padding is usually done with leading zeros, but since the alphabet is arbitrary, perhaps the padding is done with the first character of the alphabet. Or maybe the padding is done with the first character, but I need to check the docstring.

The docstring says: "The output has the most significant digit first." So padding would add leading characters. For example, if the generated string is 'abc' and padding is 5, then add two leading characters (probably the first character of the alphabet) to make it 'aabc'? Or maybe the padding is done with the first character, but the order is maintained. Let me think. Suppose the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], and the generated string is 'bc' (length 2), and padding is 5. Then the padding would add three leading 'a's, making the string 'aaabc'? Wait, but the most significant digit is first. So the padding would be added to the left. So the padding is done by adding the first character of the alphabet to the left until the desired length is reached.

So, the steps are:

1. Convert the number to the string using the alphabet, as described.
2. If padding is provided, check if the length of the generated string is less than padding. If so, prepend the first character of the alphabet (or maybe the first character of the alphabet?) to reach the desired length.

But wait, the padding could be zero. But the function's parameters say padding is optional. So, if padding is None, no padding is done. Otherwise, the output string is padded to the specified length with leading characters from the alphabet.

Now, let's think about the code.

First, handle the case when the number is zero. If the number is zero, the generated string would be the first character of the alphabet? Or empty? Wait, if the number is zero, then during the loop, the number is zero, so the loop doesn't run. So the generated string would be empty. But that's not correct. For example, if the number is zero, the output should be the first character of the alphabet? Or maybe the function expects the number to be non-zero. But the problem says it's a short uuid, which could be zero. So perhaps we need to handle zero.

Wait, let's think. Suppose the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], and the number is zero. How do we represent that? Well, in the conversion process, if the number is zero, then the loop doesn't run, so the generated string is empty. But that's not correct. So perhaps we need to handle zero as a special case. For example, if the number is zero, return the first character of the alphabet? Or maybe the function expects that the number is non-zero. But the problem statement doesn't specify. However, since it's a UUID, maybe zero is allowed. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function should return the first character of the alphabet if the number is zero. But that's an assumption. However, the problem says that the number represents a short uuid, which could be zero. But perhaps the function is designed to handle that. So perhaps the code should check if the number is zero, and if so, return the first character of the alphabet. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code should handle zero by adding a leading character. Wait, but the loop would not run. So, perhaps the code should check if the number is zero and handle it. Let me think of an example. Suppose the number is zero, and the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c']. Then, the generated string would be empty. But that's not correct. So, perhaps the code should check if the number is zero, and if so, return the first character of the alphabet. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the code should handle zero by adding a leading character. But that's not clear. Let me think again. Let's take the example where the number is zero. The code would generate an empty string. But that's not correct. So, perhaps the code should check if the number is zero and return the first character of the alphabet. But that's an assumption. However, the problem statement doesn't specify. So, perhaps the code should handle that case. For example, if the number is zero, the generated string is the first character of the alphabet. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code should not handle that case and let the user handle it. However, since the function is supposed to convert a number to a string, perhaps zero is a valid input. So, perhaps the code should handle it. Let me think: when the number is zero, the loop doesn't run, so the generated string is empty. So, perhaps we need to add a check for that. For example, if the generated string is empty, return the first character of the alphabet. But that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to work with numbers that are non-zero. However, since the problem says that the number represents a short uuid, which can be zero, perhaps the code should handle that.

But perhaps the code should handle zero by returning the first character of the alphabet. Let me proceed with that. So, in the code, after generating the characters, if the result is empty, return the first character of the alphabet. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the code should not handle zero and let the user handle it, but that's not ideal. Let me think of the code steps again.

Let me outline the steps for the code:

- Check if the alphabet is empty. Wait, the function's parameters say that alphabet is a list of strings. So, perhaps the code should handle that. But the problem says that the number represents a short uuid, so maybe the alphabet is non-empty. However, the code should handle cases where the alphabet is empty? Probably not, but perhaps the code should raise an error. However, the problem doesn't specify. So, perhaps the code should assume that the alphabet is non-empty.

So, proceed under the assumption that the alphabet is non-empty.

Now, the code steps:

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:

First, handle the case when the number is zero. If the number is zero, then the generated string would be empty. But that's not correct. So, perhaps the code should check if the number is zero and return the first character of the alphabet. Or maybe not. For example, if the number is zero, then the generated string is empty. But that's not correct. So, perhaps the code should handle that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should not handle that and let the user handle it. But that's not ideal. Let me think of an example. Suppose the number is zero, and the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c']. Then, the generated string is empty. But that's not correct. So, perhaps the code should return the first character of the alphabet in that case. So, adding a check:

if number == 0:
    return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)

Wait, but padding is optional. So, if padding is provided, then the string should be padded to that length. But if the number is zero, the generated string is empty, so we need to pad it. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the code should handle zero by adding the first character. Let me think. For example, if the number is zero, the generated string is empty. But perhaps the code should return the first character of the alphabet. But how to handle padding? For example, if padding is 3, then the generated string would be the first character repeated 3 times? Or the first character plus padding?

This is getting complicated. Let me think again. The function's purpose is to convert a number to a string using the given alphabet, with the most significant digit first. So, for zero, the representation would be the first character of the alphabet? Or perhaps zero is not allowed. But the problem says that the number represents a short uuid, which could be zero. So, perhaps the code should handle that.

But how to represent zero? Let me think of the conversion process. For example, if the number is zero, then during the loop, the number is zero, so the loop doesn't run. So, the generated string is empty. But that's not correct. So, perhaps the code should handle this case by adding the first character of the alphabet. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the code should treat zero as a special case. For example, if the number is zero, return the first character of the alphabet. But then, if padding is provided, pad it to the required length. For example, if the number is zero and padding is 3, then the string is the first character repeated three times.

But this is an assumption. However, given that the function is supposed to convert a number to a string, perhaps zero should be handled as a valid input. So, let's proceed with that.

So, the code steps:

- If the number is zero, then the generated string is the first character of the alphabet. But wait, that's not correct. Because the number is zero, which would be represented as the first character. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code should generate the string as follows: if the number is zero, return the first character of the alphabet. But then, if padding is provided, pad it with leading characters (the first character) to reach the desired length.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think of the code.

First, let's handle the conversion of the number to the string.

Initialize a list to hold the characters.

While the number is greater than zero:

   remainder = number % len(alphabet)

   char = alphabet[remainder]

   append char to the list

   number = number // len(alphabet)

Then, reverse the list to get the correct order.

But if the number is zero, the loop doesn't run, so the list is empty. So, in that case, we need to return the first character of the alphabet, or maybe an empty string? But that's not correct. So, perhaps the code should check if the list is empty, and if so, return the first character of the alphabet. But that would be the case when the number is zero.

So, code steps:

chars = []

if number == 0:

   chars = [alphabet[0]]

else:

   while number > 0:

      remainder = number % len(alphabet)

      chars.append(alphabet[remainder])

      number = number // len(alphabet)

   chars = chars[::-1]

But then, if the number is zero, the chars list is [alphabet[0]], which is correct. Then, after that, apply padding.

But what if the padding is provided? For example, if the generated string is shorter than padding, add leading characters (the first character of the alphabet) to reach the desired length.

So, after generating the chars list, if padding is provided and the length of chars is less than padding, then prepend (padding - len(chars)) copies of the first character of the alphabet.

Wait, but the padding is optional. So, for example, if padding is 5 and the generated string is length 3, then we need to add 2 leading characters (the first character of the alphabet) to make it length 5.

So, code steps after generating the chars:

if padding is not None:

   required_length = padding

   current_length = len(chars)

   if current_length < required_length:

       chars = [alphabet[0]] * (required_length - current_length) + chars

Then, join the chars list into a string.

But wait, the padding is supposed to be added to the left. So, for example, if the generated string is 'abc' and padding is 5, then we need to add two leading characters. So, the code would prepend (required_length - current_length) copies of the first character.

But what if the alphabet is empty? Well, the code should handle that, but perhaps the function assumes that the alphabet is non-empty.

So, putting it all together.

Now, let's think about the unit tests. The user said to follow a test-driven development approach, so first generate comprehensive unit tests. But since the user wants the code generated, perhaps the tests are part of the code. However, the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So, the code should be written, and the tests are part of the code.

But the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So, the code should be written, and the tests are part of the code. But the user's initial message says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should be written, and the tests are not required unless specified. Wait, the user's tip says to generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the code. But the user's instruction says to output only the code. So, perhaps the user wants the code, but the tests are not part of the output. But the initial instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention to follow TDD, but the output is only the code. So, the code should be written, and the tests are not part of the output. Therefore, the code is to be generated, and the tests are not needed in the output. So, proceed to write the code.

Now, code:

But first, handle the case when the number is zero. Let me code that.

But wait, what if the number is zero and the alphabet is empty? Well, the function's parameters say that alphabet is a list of strings. So, perhaps the code should assume that the alphabet is non-empty. But perhaps the code should raise an error if the alphabet is empty. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the code should proceed under the assumption that the alphabet is non-empty.

Now, code:

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    """
    Convert a number to a string, using the given alphabet.
    The number represents a short uuid.
    The output has the most significant digit first.
    @param number: Int value
    @param alphabet : List with letters
    @param padding : Optional with int value
    @return  string value corresponded to int
    """
    if not alphabet:
        raise ValueError("Alphabet cannot be empty")
    
    # Handle the case where number is zero
    if number == 0:
        chars = [alphabet[0]]
    else:
        chars = []
        while number > 0:
            remainder = number % len(alphabet)
            chars.append(alphabet[remainder])
            number = number // len(alphabet)
        # Reverse to get most significant digit first
        chars = chars[::-1]
    
    # Apply padding
    if padding is not None:
        required_length = padding
        current_length = len(chars)
        if current_length < required_length:
            # Prepend the first character of the alphabet
            chars = [alphabet[0]] * (required_length - current_length) + chars
    
    return ''.join(chars)

Wait, but what if the padding is less than the length of the generated string? For example, if padding is 3 and the generated string is 5 characters long. Then, the code does nothing. That's correct.

But what if the padding is zero? Well, the function's parameters say padding is optional. So, if padding is provided, it's an integer. But the code allows padding to be any integer. However, if padding is less than the length of the generated string, it does nothing. But what if padding is zero? Then, required_length is zero, and current_length is len(chars). But if current_length is zero (which would be the case if the number is zero and padding is zero?), but the code would have chars as [alphabet[0]] in that case. So, required_length is zero, current_length is 1. So, the code would do nothing. But that's not correct. However, the padding parameter is optional, and it's unclear what the expected behavior is when padding is zero. But perhaps the code should not allow padding to be zero. However, the problem statement doesn't specify. So, perhaps the code should assume that padding is a positive integer. But the code as written allows any integer. However, if padding is zero, then required_length is zero, and current_length is len(chars). So, if len(chars) is greater than zero, then the code does nothing. But that's not correct. However, perhaps the padding is intended to be a positive integer. So, the code may not handle that case. But since the problem statement doesn't specify, perhaps the code should proceed as written.

Another edge case: if the number is zero and padding is provided. For example, number=0, alphabet=['a'], padding=3. Then, the generated chars is ['a'], and padding is 3. So, required_length is 3, current_length is 1. So, prepend 2 'a's. The final string is 'aa a' → 'aaa'.

Another example: number=1, alphabet=['a', 'b'], padding=2. The generated chars would be [ 'a' ] (since 1 divided by 2 is 0 with remainder 1 → 'b'? Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, let's take number=1, alphabet=['a', 'b'].

len(alphabet) is 2.

number is 1.

Loop:

number > 0 → yes.

remainder = 1 % 2 → 1.

chars.append(alphabet[1] → 'b').

number = 1 // 2 → 0.

Loop ends.

chars is ['b'], then reversed → ['b'].

So, the string is 'b'.

If padding is 2, then required_length is 2. current_length is 1. So, prepend 1 'a's → ['a', 'b'] → 'ab'.

So, the code would return 'ab'.

But wait, the most significant digit first. So, the generated string is 'b', which is the least significant digit. Wait, no. Wait, the code for number=1:

The loop appends the remainder, which is 1 → 'b'. Then, the code reverses the chars list. So, chars is ['b'] → reversed is ['b'], so the string is 'b'.

But the number is 1, which is 1 in base 2. So, the representation is 'b' (since 1 is the remainder). But the most significant digit is first. So, the code is correct.

But if the number is 2, then:

number=2, len(alphabet)=2.

remainder = 2%2=0 → 'a', number becomes 1.

Then, remainder = 1%2=1 → 'b', number becomes 0.

chars is ['a', 'b'], reversed → ['b', 'a'] → 'ba'.

Which is correct, since 2 in base 2 is 10, which is 'ba' (since 1 is 'b' and 0 is 'a').

So, the code seems to handle that correctly.

Another example: number=0, alphabet=['a', 'b', 'c'], padding=3. Then, chars is ['a'], padding is 3. required_length is 3. current_length is 1. So, prepend 2 'a's → ['a', 'a', 'a'] → 'aaa'.

But if the number is zero, the generated string is 'a', and with padding 3, it becomes 'aaa'.

But what if the number is zero and padding is None? Then, it returns 'a'.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Now, what about when the number is zero and the alphabet has only one character? For example, alphabet=['x'], number=0 → returns 'x'. If padding is 2, returns 'xx'.

That seems correct.

Now, what about if the number is zero and the alphabet is empty? The code raises ValueError, which is correct.

Now, what about if the number is negative? The problem says that the number represents a short uuid, which is probably a non-negative integer. However, the code doesn't handle negative numbers. But the problem statement doesn't mention that, so perhaps the code should assume that the number is non-negative. However, the code may need to handle it. But since the problem says the number represents a short uuid, which is typically a positive integer, perhaps the code should assume that the number is non-negative. But if the code is called with a negative number, it would enter the loop, but since number is negative, the loop would not run (since number > 0 is false). So, the code would return an empty string (if number is zero) or the chars list would be empty. But that's not correct. However, the problem statement doesn't mention handling negative numbers, so perhaps the code should not handle it. But the function's parameters say that number is an int. So, perhaps the code should raise an error if the number is negative. But again, the problem statement doesn't specify. However, since the function is supposed to convert a number to a string representing a short uuid, it's likely that the number is non-negative. So, the code may not handle negative numbers, but that's an assumption.

So, the code as written handles the cases discussed.

Now, the code needs to be written. Also, the function uses List and Optional from typing. So, the code should import those.

But the user's code may not have those imports. However, the function signature includes them, so the code should include the necessary imports.

But the user's code may not have them. However, the code as written would need to import List and Optional from typing.

So, the code would start with:

from typing import List, Optional

But the user's code may not include that. However, since the function signature uses them, the code should include them.

So, the code:

from typing import List, Optional

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    """

    """
    if not alphabet:
        raise ValueError("Alphabet cannot be empty")
    
    # Handle the case where number is zero
    if number == 0:
        chars = [alphabet[0]]
    else:
        chars = []
        while number > 0:
            remainder = number % len(alphabet)
            chars.append(alphabet[remainder])
            number = number // len(alphabet)
        # Reverse to get most significant digit first
        chars = chars[::-1]
    
    # Apply padding
    if padding is not None:
        required_length = padding
        current_length = len(chars)
        if current_length < required_length:
            # Prepend the first character of the alphabet
            chars = [alphabet[0]] * (required_length - current_length) + chars
    
    return ''.join(chars)

But wait, what if the padding is less than the length of the generated string? For example, if the generated string is longer than padding, the code does nothing. That's correct.

Another edge case: if padding is zero. But the code allows it. However, if padding is zero, required_length is zero, and current_length is len(chars). So, if len(chars) is zero (which would only happen if the number is zero and the code didn't handle it, but in the code, if number is zero, chars is [alphabet[0]], so current_length is 1. So, required_length is zero, current_length is 1 → no padding. But that's not correct. However, the problem statement doesn't specify what to do in that case. So, perhaps the code should raise an error if padding is zero. But again, the problem statement doesn't mention it. So, the code as written allows it, but it's up to the user to handle that.

Another possible issue: if the padding is provided but the generated string is longer than padding. For example, generated string is 'abc' (length 3), padding is 2. The code does nothing. That's correct.

Now, testing the code.

Test case 1: number=0, alphabet=['a'], padding=3 → returns 'aaa'.

Test case 2: number=1, alphabet=['a', 'b'], padding=2 → returns 'ab'.

Test case 3: number=2, alphabet=['a', 'b', 'c'], padding=3 → 'baa' (since 2 in base 3 is 2 → 'c', but wait, let me calculate:

Wait, number=2, alphabet length is 3.

Loop:

number=2 >0 → remainder 2%3=2 → 'c', number becomes 0. chars is ['c'], reversed → ['c'] → string is 'c'. padding is 3 → required_length 3. current_length 1 → prepend 2 'a's → 'aaca'? Wait, no. Wait, the code says:

chars = [alphabet[0]] * (required_length - current_length) + chars.

So, required_length is 3, current_length is 1. required_length - current_length is 2. So, [alphabet[0]] * 2 → ['a', 'a'] + ['c'] → ['a', 'a', 'c'] → 'aac'.

So, the string is 'aac'.

But what is 2 in base 3? It's 2, which is 'c'. So, with padding 3, it becomes 'aac'.

Yes.

Another test case: number=4, alphabet=['a', 'b', 'c'] → 4 in base 3 is 11 (since 1*3 + 1 =4). So, the digits are 1 and 1 → 'bb'. So, the code would generate chars as [1, 1], reversed → [1, 1], so 'bb'.

Yes.

Another test case: number=5, alphabet=['a', 'b', 'c'] → 5 in base 3 is 12 → 1*3 + 2 =5. So, chars are [2, 1], reversed → [1, 2] → 'ba'.

Wait, let me see:

number=5.

len(alphabet) is 3.

Loop:

number=5 >0 → remainder 5%3=2 → 'c', number becomes 5//3=1.

number=1>0 → remainder 1%3=1 → 'b', number becomes 0.

chars is ['c', 'b'], reversed → ['b', 'c'] → 'bc'.

Wait, but 5 in base 3 is 12 → 1*3^1 + 2*3^0 = 5. So, the digits are 1 and 2. So, the code would generate the digits as 2 and 1, then reversed to 1 and 2 → 'bc'.

Yes. So, the code returns 'bc'.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Now, what about when the number is zero and the alphabet has multiple characters? For example, number=0, alphabet=['a', 'b', 'c'], padding=2 → returns 'aa'.

Yes.

Now, what about if the padding is less than the length of the generated string? For example, number=4, alphabet=['a', 'b', 'c'], padding=2 → generated string is 'bb' (length 2), so no padding. So, returns 'bb'.

Yes.

Now, what if the number is zero and padding is None? Returns 'a'.

Yes.

So, the code seems to handle these cases.

Now, the code is written. But the function's docstring says that the output has the most significant digit first. Which the code does by reversing the list of characters.

Thus, the code should be correct.
