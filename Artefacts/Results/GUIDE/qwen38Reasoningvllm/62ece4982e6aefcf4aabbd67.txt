Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function vertex3tuple based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function takes a list of vertices and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple represents three points: the current vertex and the two adjacent ones. But if the indices are out of bounds, like when the vertex is at the start or end of the list, I should wrap around. For example, for the first vertex, the previous one would be the last vertex. Similarly, for the last vertex, the next one would be the first.

Wait, the docstring says if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. Wait, does that mean if the index is out of bounds, use 0? Or maybe it's a typo and they mean wrap around? Because if the vertices list is empty, then using 0 would be invalid. But maybe the function expects the vertices list to have at least one element. Let me think.

The docstring says "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". Wait, that's a bit confusing. For example, if the vertices list has 3 elements, and the current index is 0, then the previous index would be -1. But according to the note, if the subscript is out of bounds, take the index as 0. Wait, maybe that's not the right interpretation. Maybe it's saying that when accessing the vertices list, if the index is out of bounds (like negative or beyond the list length), we should use 0 as the index. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. For example, if the vertices list has 3 elements, and the current index is 0, then the previous index would be -1. If that's out of bounds, then take index 0? Or maybe the note is saying that when the index is out of bounds (like negative or beyond the list length), we should take the index modulo the length of the list? Or perhaps it's a mistake and they meant to wrap around, like for the first element, the previous is the last, and for the last, the next is the first.

But the note says "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". Wait, maybe that's a mistake. For example, if the index is out of bounds, like negative or beyond the list length, then take the index as 0. But that would mean that for any index that's out of bounds, we use 0. That seems odd. Let me think of an example.

Suppose vertices is [A, B, C]. For the first vertex (index 0), the previous index would be -1. If that's out of bounds, take index 0. So the previous would be vertices[0], and the next would be vertices[1]. So the tuple would be (A, A, B)? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the note is supposed to say that if the index is out of bounds, wrap around. Like for index -1, use the last element. For index 3 (if the list has 3 elements), use index 0.

But the note says "take the value of index as 0". Maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the original problem again.

The original function's docstring says: "If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". So perhaps when accessing vertices, if the index is out of bounds (like negative or beyond the list length), we use index 0. For example, if the current index is 0, then the previous index is -1, which is out of bounds, so we take 0. So the previous vertex would be vertices[0], and the next would be vertices[1]. So for the first vertex, the three points would be (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1])?

But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the note is supposed to say that if the index is out of bounds, use the index modulo the length of the list. For example, for index -1, it would be len(vertices) -1. But the note says "take the value of index as 0", which is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the note is a mistake and the intended behavior is to wrap around. For example, for the first vertex, the previous is the last, and for the last, the next is the first. That would make sense for creating a looped list of vertices.

But given the note says "take the value of index as 0", perhaps the intended behavior is that if the index is out of bounds (like negative or beyond the list length), use 0 as the index. So for example, if the list has 3 elements, and the current index is 0, then the previous index is -1, which is out of bounds, so use 0. So the previous vertex is vertices[0], and the next is vertices[1]. So the tuple would be (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1]).

But that would mean that for the first vertex, the previous is the same as the current. That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the note is a mistake and the correct behavior is to wrap around. For example, for index i, the previous is i-1, but if i-1 is negative, use len(vertices)-1. Similarly, the next is i+1, but if i+1 >= len(vertices), use 0.

But the note says "take the value of index as 0". So maybe the intended behavior is that when accessing vertices, if the index is out of bounds, use 0. So for example, if the index is -1, use 0. If the index is len(vertices), use 0. So for the first vertex (index 0), the previous index is -1, which is out of bounds, so use 0. The next index is 1. So the three points would be vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1]. For the last vertex (index len(vertices)-1), the next index is len(vertices), which is out of bounds, so use 0. So the three points would be vertices[-1], vertices[0], vertices[0]. That seems odd, but perhaps that's what the note is saying.

But that would lead to some duplicates. For example, the first vertex's previous is itself, and the last vertex's next is the first. But maybe that's what the function is supposed to do.

Alternatively, perhaps the note is a mistake and the correct behavior is to wrap around. For example, for the first vertex, previous is last, next is second. For the last vertex, previous is second last, next is first. That would make sense for creating a looped structure.

But given the note says "take the value of index as 0", I have to follow that. So, for any index that's out of bounds (negative or beyond the list length), use 0. So for example, if the list is [A, B, C], then for index 0:

previous index is -1 → use 0 → A

current index 0 → A

next index is 1 → B

so the tuple is (A, A, B)

for index 1:

previous is 0 → A

current is B

next is 2 → C

so (A, B, C)

for index 2:

previous is 1 → B

current is C

next is 3 → which is out of bounds, so use 0 → A

so tuple is (B, C, A)

But then for the last vertex, the next is A. So that's the behavior.

But the problem says "get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon". So perhaps the function is supposed to create a list where each element is a tuple of three consecutive vertices, with wrap-around for the first and last elements.

But according to the note, if the index is out of bounds, take index as 0. So for example, for the first vertex, the previous is 0 (so same as current), and next is 1. For the last vertex, next is 0. So the tuples would be:

For vertex 0: (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1])

For vertex 1: (vertices[0], vertices[1], vertices[2])

For vertex 2: (vertices[1], vertices[2], vertices[0])

But that would be the case if the list is [A, B, C]. So the function returns a list of tuples where each tuple is (prev, current, next), with prev and next being adjusted according to the note.

So the function needs to process each vertex in the input list, and for each, get the previous and next vertices, using 0 as the index if out of bounds.

So the steps are:

1. For each vertex in vertices, create a tuple of three elements: previous, current, next.

2. The previous index is i-1. If i-1 is negative, use 0.

3. The next index is i+1. If i+1 >= len(vertices), use 0.

Wait, but the note says "if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". So for example, if i is 0, then previous index is -1 → out of bounds → take 0. Next index is 1 → valid.

If i is len(vertices)-1, then next index is len(vertices) → out of bounds → take 0.

So for each vertex at index i, the previous index is (i-1) if i-1 >=0 else 0. Wait, no. Because if i-1 is negative, then take 0. So previous index is max(i-1, 0)? No. Wait, the note says if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. So for example, if the index is -1 (out of bounds), use 0. So for previous index, it's (i-1) if it's within the list, else 0. Wait, but what if the list has 3 elements and i is 0. Then i-1 is -1, which is out of bounds. So previous index is 0. So the previous vertex is vertices[0].

Similarly, for i=2 (last element), next index is 3, which is out of bounds. So next index is 0. So next vertex is vertices[0].

So the code would be:

for each i in range(len(vertices)):

    prev_idx = i - 1

    if prev_idx < 0:

        prev_idx = 0

    next_idx = i + 1

    if next_idx >= len(vertices):

        next_idx = 0

    tuple = (vertices[prev_idx], vertices[i], vertices[next_idx])

But wait, the note says "take the value of index as 0" when out of bounds. So for example, if the index is out of bounds, use 0. So for prev_idx, if it's negative, use 0. For next_idx, if it's >= len(vertices), use 0. So that's how we calculate the indices.

But what if the vertices list is empty? Then len(vertices) is 0. So for any i, but since the loop is for i in range(len(vertices)), which would be 0 iterations. So the function would return an empty list. But maybe the function expects vertices to have at least one element. But the docstring doesn't specify that. So perhaps the code should handle empty lists.

But according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to return a list where each element is a tuple of three points. So if the input is empty, the output is empty.

Now, the function's code:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):

    result = []

    for i in range(len(vertices)):

        # calculate previous index

        prev_idx = i - 1

        if prev_idx < 0:

            prev_idx = 0

        # calculate next index

        next_idx = i + 1

        if next_idx >= len(vertices):

            next_idx = 0

        # append the tuple

        result.append( (vertices[prev_idx], vertices[i], vertices[next_idx]) )

    return result

Wait, but what if the vertices list is empty? Then len(vertices) is 0, so the loop doesn't run, and returns empty list. Which is correct.

But let's test with some examples.

Example 1: vertices = [A, B, C]

For i=0:

prev_idx = -1 → 0 → vertices[0] is A

next_idx = 1 → B

tuple is (A, A, B)

For i=1:

prev_idx 0 → A, current B, next 2 → C → (A, B, C)

For i=2:

prev_idx 1 → B, current C, next 3 → 0 → A → (B, C, A)

So the result is [(A, A, B), (A, B, C), (B, C, A)]

But according to the note, when the subscript is out of bounds, take index as 0. So this seems correct.

Another example: vertices = [A]

Then for i=0:

prev_idx = -1 → 0 → A

next_idx = 1 → 0 → A

so the tuple is (A, A, A)

So the result is [(A, A, A)]

Another example: vertices = [A, B]

For i=0:

prev_idx = -1 → 0 → A

next_idx = 1 → B → tuple (A, A, B)

For i=1:

prev_idx = 0 → A

next_idx = 2 → 0 → A → tuple (A, B, A)

So result is [(A, A, B), (A, B, A)]

So that's the code.

Now, the user wants to generate the code, but also to follow a test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. Wait, the original problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But the tips say to follow test-driven development approach, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user is asking to generate the code, not the tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated. So perhaps the user wants the code, not the tests. But the tips mention generating tests first. But the user's main request is to generate the code. So maybe the user is confused, but the main task is to write the code.

But the initial problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. So the code is as I wrote above.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Another thing to consider: the vertices could be a list of any elements (like integers, strings, etc.), but the function is supposed to return tuples of those elements.

So the code is as written.

Now, writing the code in Python:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    """
    Get 3 points for each vertex of the polygon.
    This will include the vertex and the 2 points on both sides of the vertex
    If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0
    Args:
        vertices: vertices to be converted

    Returns:
        A list where the elements of vertices represented by tuple
    """
    result = []
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        prev_idx = i - 1
        if prev_idx < 0:
            prev_idx = 0
        next_idx = i + 1
        if next_idx >= len(vertices):
            next_idx = 0
        result.append( (vertices[prev_idx], vertices[i], vertices[next_idx]) )
    return result

But wait, what if the vertices list is empty? Then len(vertices) is 0, so the loop doesn't run, and returns an empty list. Which is correct.

But what if vertices is not a list? Well, the function's argument is called vertices, but the code assumes it's a list. The docstring says "vertices to be converted", but the code uses list indexing. So perhaps the function expects vertices to be a list. But the code will raise an error if vertices is not a list, like a string. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling such cases, so the code is correct as per the given information.

So this should be the code.
