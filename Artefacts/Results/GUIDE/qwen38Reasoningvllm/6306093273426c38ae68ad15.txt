Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _run_playbook function based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned following a test-driven development approach, so I should first think about writing unit tests before the actual code.

First, let me understand the function's purpose. The function runs an Ansible CLI with provided variables. The parameters are cli_args (a list of command line arguments), vars_dict (a dictionary passed as extra-vars), ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. The return value is the ansible results.

So, the function needs to execute Ansible with those arguments and variables. But how exactly? Well, the user mentioned Infrared Workspace and Plugin objects. Maybe the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used to get the playbook path or other necessary info.

Wait, the function is part of a larger system, perhaps Infrared, which is a tool for testing OpenStack. So, the _run_playbook function might be part of a plugin that runs Ansible playbooks as part of a test suite.

But for the code, I need to figure out how to execute Ansible. The cli_args would be the arguments passed to the ansible CLI. For example, something like ['playbook', 'my_playbook.yml'].

But how to integrate the vars_dict into the CLI arguments? The vars_dict should be passed as --extra-vars. So, the code should convert the dictionary into a string format that Ansible can parse. For example, using the --extra-vars option followed by the JSON representation of the dictionary.

So, the steps would be:

1. Convert vars_dict into a JSON string.
2. Append the --extra-vars option with that JSON string to the cli_args list.
3. Execute the Ansible CLI command with the modified arguments.
4. Capture the results and return them.

But wait, the cli_args might already include some arguments. For example, the user might have passed ['--extra-vars', 'key=value'], but in this case, the function is supposed to add the vars_dict as extra-vars. So perhaps the function should ensure that the extra-vars are properly formatted and added.

Alternatively, maybe the cli_args is the list of arguments that the user wants to pass, and the function is responsible for adding the --extra-vars part. So the function should take the existing cli_args, add the --extra-vars option with the vars_dict, and then run the command.

But how to handle the existing cli_args? For example, if the user already included --extra-vars, should the function override it or merge? The docstring says that vars_dict will be passed as extra-vars, so perhaps the function is supposed to add the --extra-vars option with the vars_dict, regardless of what's in cli_args.

But maybe the cli_args already includes the playbook path, and the function is adding the extra-vars. So the function should modify cli_args to include the --extra-vars argument.

So, the code would need to:

- Take the cli_args list.
- Add the --extra-vars option with the JSON representation of vars_dict.
- Then execute the ansible command with those arguments.

But how to execute the command? Using subprocess module? Or maybe using the Ansible API? But the function is supposed to run the Ansible CLI, so probably using subprocess.

So, the code would look something like:

import json
import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    # Convert vars_dict to JSON string
    extra_vars = json.dumps(vars_dict)
    # Add --extra-vars to cli_args
    cli_args.append('--extra-vars')
    cli_args.append(extra_vars)
    # Execute the ansible command
    result = subprocess.run(cli_args, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the ansible results. The subprocess.run returns a CompletedProcess object, which has stdout and stderr. So maybe the function should return that, or parse it into a more structured format.

But the docstring says the return is "ansible results", which is vague. So perhaps the function returns the output of the Ansible command, including stdout and stderr.

But also, the ir_workspace and ir_plugin parameters are passed. How are they used? Maybe the ir_workspace provides the playbook path, or the ir_plugin has some methods to run the playbook. However, the function's parameters are cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. So perhaps the cli_args includes the playbook path, and the function is just adding the extra-vars.

Alternatively, maybe the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are used to get the playbook path. For example, the ir_plugin might have a method to get the playbook, or the ir_workspace has the playbook path.

But the function's parameters are cli_args, which is a list of command line arguments. So maybe the cli_args already includes the playbook path, and the function is adding the extra-vars.

But without knowing the exact structure of the Infrared code, it's hard to say. However, the user's docstring says that the function runs Ansible CLI with vars_dict. So the main task is to pass the vars_dict as extra-vars.

So, the code would need to append the --extra-vars option with the JSON string of vars_dict to the cli_args list, then run the command.

But wait, the cli_args is a list of arguments. For example, if the user wants to run 'ansible-playbook my_playbook.yml', then cli_args would be ['ansible-playbook', 'my_playbook.yml']. The function adds --extra-vars and the JSON string.

But in that case, the code would modify cli_args in place. However, modifying the input list might not be desired. So perhaps the code should create a new list, append the --extra-vars and the JSON string, then run the command.

Wait, but the function's parameters are cli_args, which is a list. So if the function appends to it, the original list outside the function would be modified. That's probably not desired. So the code should create a new list that includes the original cli_args plus the new arguments.

So, the code should do something like:

modified_args = cli_args.copy()
modified_args.append('--extra-vars')
modified_args.append(json.dumps(vars_dict))
result = subprocess.run(modified_args, ...)

But in Python, lists are mutable, so appending to cli_args would modify the original. So to avoid that, we should create a new list.

But the function's parameters are cli_args, which is a list. So the function should not modify the original list. Therefore, the code should create a new list that includes all the original cli_args plus the new arguments.

So, the code would be:

import json
import subprocess

def _run_playbook(cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, ir_plugin):
    """
    Runs ansible cli with vars dict

    :param vars_dict: dict, Will be passed as Ansible extra-vars
    :param cli_args: the list of command line arguments
    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :return: ansible results
    """
    # Convert vars_dict to JSON string
    extra_vars = json.dumps(vars_dict)
    # Create a new list of arguments
    modified_args = cli_args.copy()
    modified_args.append('--extra-vars')
    modified_args.append(extra_vars)
    # Execute the ansible command
    result = subprocess.run(modified_args, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result

But wait, what about the ir_workspace and ir_plugin parameters? The docstring mentions them, but the code above doesn't use them. So maybe they are used in some other way. For example, perhaps the ir_plugin has a method to run the playbook, or the ir_workspace provides the playbook path. However, the function's parameters include cli_args, which is a list of command line arguments. So perhaps the cli_args already includes the playbook path, and the function is just adding the extra-vars. So the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are not used here. But the docstring says that the function is part of the Infrared code, so maybe they are used for something else.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the ir_workspace to get the playbook path, and then construct the cli_args. But the function's parameter is cli_args, which is supposed to be the list of arguments. So perhaps the function is designed to take the cli_args as provided, and add the extra-vars.

But the presence of ir_workspace and ir_plugin in the parameters suggests that they might be used. However, without more context, it's hard to say. But the user's docstring doesn't mention using them, so maybe they are not needed. Or perhaps they are used in a different way, like for logging or error handling.

But given the information, the code should focus on the main task: passing the vars_dict as extra-vars. So the code above would be the core part.

Now, considering the unit tests. The user wants test-driven development. So first, write tests for the function.

But since the function uses subprocess, the tests would need to mock subprocess.run. Also, the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, which are objects. But in the tests, we can mock those.

So, for the unit tests, we can use unittest.mock to mock subprocess.run and the ir_workspace and ir_plugin.

But the user wants the code generated first, then the tests. Wait, the user says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. But the tips mention to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the user wants the code, but the tips are for the assistant's approach.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code, so the code should be written first. However, the assistant is supposed to think through the process, including writing tests first. But in the final answer, the user wants only the code generated, in Python markdown format.

So, the code I wrote earlier is the main function. But I need to make sure that it's correct.

Another thing: the cli_args may already include the --extra-vars option. For example, if the user passes ['--extra-vars', 'key=value'], then the function would append another --extra-vars, which would be incorrect. But the docstring says that vars_dict will be passed as extra-vars. So perhaps the function is supposed to override any existing extra-vars, or merge them? The docstring isn't clear. However, the function's purpose is to pass the vars_dict as extra-vars, so perhaps it's intended to add them, regardless of existing ones. But that could lead to conflicts. However, without more information, it's safer to assume that the function is supposed to add the extra-vars, even if there are existing ones.

But in practice, when using Ansible, multiple --extra-vars can be used, and they are merged. So perhaps the function should append the --extra-vars with the vars_dict, even if there are existing ones.

So the code as written would do that.

Another thing: the ir_workspace and ir_plugin parameters are not used in the code. But the function's docstring mentions them. So perhaps there's more to the function. For example, maybe the ir_plugin has a method to run the playbook, or the ir_workspace provides the playbook path. But the function's parameters include cli_args, which is a list of command line arguments. So perhaps the cli_args already includes the playbook path, and the function is just adding the extra-vars.

But without more context, it's hard to say. However, the user's function signature includes those parameters, so the code should include them. However, in the code I wrote, they are not used. That might be an issue. So perhaps the function is supposed to use the ir_workspace and ir_plugin to get the playbook path or other information.

Wait, maybe the cli_args is supposed to be the arguments passed to the Ansible CLI, but the function is supposed to construct them using the ir_workspace and ir_plugin. For example, the ir_plugin might have a method to get the playbook path, and the function constructs the cli_args accordingly.

But the function's parameter is cli_args, which is a list. So perhaps the function is designed to take the cli_args as provided, and add the extra-vars. But the presence of ir_workspace and ir_plugin in the parameters suggests that they are used. However, the docstring doesn't mention their usage. So maybe they are not used in this function, and the function is just a wrapper to add the extra-vars.

In that case, the code is correct as written.

So the final code would be as I wrote earlier.

Now, considering the unit tests. The user wants to generate them first, but the final answer should only have the code. But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code is the main focus.

So the code is as follows.
