Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called protocol_handlers and takes a cls parameter with an optional protocol_version. The docstring says it returns different handlers based on the protocol version.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions that different Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on protocol_version. So, the function is a class method that returns a handler depending on the version.

But wait, the function is defined as def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):. So, it's a class method. The cls parameter is the class itself, which is typical for such methods. The protocol_version is an optional parameter, so maybe it's a version like '1.0', '2.0', etc.

The challenge is to implement this method such that it returns the appropriate handler. But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details. The docstring is just a description. So, the code needs to be written in a way that handles different protocol versions.

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to return a function that handles the protocol. For example, maybe different versions have different handling logic. But without knowing the exact implementation, I need to make assumptions.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a class that handles different protocol versions. For example, a class that has methods for each version. But the function is supposed to return the correct handler.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a function that takes the protocol version and returns the appropriate handler. But the function is defined as taking protocol_version as an argument, which is optional.

Wait, the function is a class method. So, perhaps the class has multiple methods, each for a different protocol version. But the function is supposed to return the correct one based on the version.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a method that returns a handler, and the protocol_version is the version to use.

But without more information, I need to make some assumptions. Let's think about possible implementations.

One approach is to have a dictionary that maps protocol versions to handler functions. Then, the protocol_handlers method returns the appropriate handler based on the protocol_version.

For example:

class BoltHandler:
    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        handlers = {
            '1.0': cls.handle_version_1,
            '2.0': cls.handle_version_2,
            # ... more versions
        }
        return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.default_handler)

But then, the actual handling functions would be part of the class. However, the user's function signature is def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):, which is a class method. So, the code would need to return a function that is part of the class.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual implementation details. So, the code needs to be written in a way that covers possible protocol versions.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I need to generate code that can be extended with different handlers.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should include the implementation of the protocol_handlers method, which returns the appropriate handler based on the protocol_version.

But how to structure this? Let's think.

The function is a class method. So, the code would look something like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    # determine which handler to return based on protocol_version
    # return the appropriate handler function

But the actual implementation depends on the protocol versions. Since the user hasn't provided the details, perhaps the code should include a dictionary of handlers.

So, perhaps the code would have a class with a dictionary of handlers, and the protocol_handlers method returns the appropriate one.

But the function is supposed to return the handler, so maybe the code is structured as follows:

class BoltHandler:
    _handlers = {
        '1.0': lambda: handle_version_1(),
        '2.0': lambda: handle_version_2(),
        # ... more handlers
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        return cls._handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.default_handler)

But then, the actual handling functions would be part of the class. However, the user's function signature is just the method definition, so the code would need to include the actual handling logic.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation, perhaps the code should be written with placeholders for the handlers.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a function that takes the protocol version and returns the handler. But that's not clear.

Wait, the docstring says "Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version." So, the function returns a handler function that can be called with the protocol version.

But how to structure that. For example, maybe the function returns a function that takes the protocol version and returns the appropriate handler.

But without knowing the exact implementation, it's hard to say. However, the user's task is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring.

So, the code would need to implement the protocol_handlers method, which returns the appropriate handler based on the protocol_version.

Assuming that the handlers are stored in a dictionary, the code would look like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        '1.0': cls.handle_version_1,
        '2.0': cls.handle_version_2,
        # ... more versions
    }
    return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.default_handler)

But then, the actual handling functions would be part of the class. However, the user's function signature is just the method definition, so the code would need to include the actual handling logic.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation, perhaps the code should include a placeholder for the handlers.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a function that is a wrapper for the actual handler. But again, without knowing the exact details, it's hard to say.

Given that, the code would need to have the protocol_handlers method that returns the appropriate handler based on the protocol_version. The actual handling functions would be part of the class, but since the user hasn't provided them, the code would have to include them as placeholders.

So, the code would look like:

class BoltHandler:
    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # Dictionary mapping protocol versions to handler functions
        handlers = {
            '1.0': cls.handle_version_1,
            '2.0': cls.handle_version_2,
            # ... more versions
        }
        return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.default_handler)

    @staticmethod
    def handle_version_1():
        # Implementation for version 1
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def handle_version_2():
        # Implementation for version 2
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def default_handler():
        # Default handler
        pass

But the user's function signature is def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):, so the code would need to have that method.

However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass

But that's just the method definition. The actual implementation would need to be there.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual handlers, perhaps the code should include a dictionary of handlers, and the method returns that.

So, the final code would be:

class BoltHandler:
    _handlers = {
        '1.0': lambda: handle_version_1(),
        '2.0': lambda: handle_version_2(),
        # ... more versions
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        return cls._handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.default_handler)

But again, the actual handling functions are not provided.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to return a function that is a wrapper for the actual handler. But without knowing the exact details, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity, the best approach is to write the code that defines the protocol_handlers method, which returns a handler based on the protocol_version, and includes a dictionary of handlers.

So, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version.
    """
    # Dictionary to map protocol versions to handler functions
    handlers = {
        '1.0': cls.handle_version_1,
        '2.0': cls.handle_version_2,
        # Add more versions as needed
    }
    return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.default_handler)

But then, the actual handling functions would need to be defined in the class.

However, the user's function signature is just the method definition. So, the code would include the method and the handlers as part of the class.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would include the method definition and the handlers.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation, the code would have to be written with placeholders.

Therefore, the final code would be:

        handlers = {
            '1.0': cls.handle_version_1,
            '2.0': cls.handle_version_2,
            # Add more handlers as needed
        }
        return handlers.get(protocol_version, cls.default_handler)

    @staticmethod
    def handle_version_1():
        # Implementation for version 1
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def handle_version_2():
        # Implementation for version 2
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def default_handler():
        # Default handler
        pass
