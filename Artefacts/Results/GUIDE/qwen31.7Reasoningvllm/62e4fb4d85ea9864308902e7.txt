Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called normalize_cmd that takes a tuple of strings and returns a new tuple. The docstring says it's supposed to complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the task. Let me think.

Wait, the function's name is normalize_cmd, and the docstring mentions complementing the full path to exe. But the input is a tuple of strings. Maybe the function is supposed to handle command-line arguments, like normalizing paths or something similar.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a command (like a list of arguments) and normalize the paths. For example, if the command is something like ('python', 'script.py', 'dir/file.txt'), the function might normalize the paths by replacing '..' with '.' or something, but that's just a guess.

But the docstring says "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Oh, maybe the function is supposed to take a command and return the full path of the executable, but that doesn't make sense because the input is a tuple of strings. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to normalize the command line arguments, like removing redundant elements or handling paths properly.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command (like a list of arguments) and return a new tuple where each element is the full path of the executable. But how would that work? For example, if the input is ('script.exe', 'dir'), the function might return ('script.exe', 'dir') as is, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to normalize the paths in the command. Like, if the command has relative paths, convert them to absolute paths. But how would that work with the input being a tuple of strings?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command and return a normalized version of it, like removing duplicates or handling cases where the same path is given multiple times. But the docstring is a bit vague.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a command (like a list of arguments) and return a new tuple where each element is the full path of the executable. For example, if the input is ('python', 'script.py', 'dir/file.txt'), the function might return ('python', 'script.py', 'dir/file.txt') as is, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to normalize the paths by replacing any '..' with '.' or something, but that's not clear.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the function signature again. The function takes a tuple of strings (cmd: tuple[str, ...]) and returns a tuple of strings. The docstring says "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Oh, maybe "complement" here means something like making sure that the path is complete, like adding a trailing slash or something. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command and return a normalized version of it, like removing any redundant elements. For example, if the input is ('script.py', '.', 'script.py'), the function might return ('script.py', 'script.py').

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, since the user provided a docstring that says "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form", maybe the function is supposed to take a command and return a new tuple where each element is the full path of the executable. But how?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a command (like a list of arguments) and return a new tuple where each element is the full path of the executable. But how would that be done? For example, if the input is ('script.exe', 'dir'), the function might return ('script.exe', 'dir') as is. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command and return a normalized version of it, like removing any empty strings or duplicates. For example, if the input is ('', 'script.py', ''), the function might return ('script.py',).

But without more context, it's challenging. However, since the user wants me to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps the function is supposed to take a command and return a normalized version of it, like removing any redundant elements.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a command and return a tuple where each element is the full path of the executable, but the input is a tuple of strings that are already paths. For example, if the input is ('/home/user/script.py', '/home/user/dir'), the function returns the same as the input.

But that's just a guess. Since the user wants me to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the function is supposed to take a command and return a normalized version of it, like removing any redundant elements.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a command and return a tuple where each element is the full path of the executable, but that's not possible without knowing the executable's path.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for similar functions. For example, in Python, there's the os.path module which can handle path normalization. Maybe the function is supposed to normalize the paths in the command.

For example, if the input is ('script.py', 'dir/file.txt'), the function might return ('script.py', 'dir/file.txt').

But how to implement that? Well, perhaps the function is supposed to take the command and return a new tuple where each element is the full path of the executable, but that's not clear.

In that case, the code would be as simple as returning the input tuple. But that seems too trivial. However, given the docstring, maybe that's the case.

But the docstring says "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Maybe "complement" here means to make sure that the path is complete, like adding a trailing slash. For example, if the input is ('script.py', 'dir'), the function returns ('script.py', 'dir/').

But that's just a guess. However, without more context, I have to make an assumption.
