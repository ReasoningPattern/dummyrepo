Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function select_filenames_by_prefix. Let me look at the docstring again. The function takes a prefix and a list of files, and returns all files that match the given prefix. 

So, the task is to filter the files based on the prefix. The prefix could be anything, like "image_", and the files could be strings. The function should return a list of filenames that start with that prefix.

First, I need to think about how to check if a filename starts with the prefix. In Python, the string method startswith() can be used here. So for each file in the files list, I check if file.startswith(prefix). If yes, include it in the result.

Wait, but what if the prefix is empty? Well, the docstring doesn't mention handling that, but maybe the function is supposed to handle it. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe we don't need to handle that case. The function can assume that the prefix is valid.

So the code would be something like:

def select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files):
    return [file for file in files if file.startswith(prefix)]

But I need to make sure that the function is correctly implemented. Let me think about possible edge cases. For example, if the prefix is longer than the file name. Then startswith would return False. That's handled correctly.

Testing the function: if the prefix is "a", and files are ["apple", "banana", "a"], then the result should be ["apple", "a"]. If the prefix is empty, then all files would be included. But again, the docstring doesn't mention handling that, so maybe the function is expected to handle it as per the problem statement.

So the code seems straightforward. The test cases would involve checking that the function returns the correct list. For example, testing with different prefixes and different file lists.

But the user asked to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is as I wrote. The tests would be generated separately, but the user wants the code only.

Wait, the user said "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I need to write the code, not the tests. But the initial instruction said to follow a test-driven approach, but the user wants the code only. So maybe the tests are not required here.

So the final code is the list comprehension as mentioned. Let me write that.
