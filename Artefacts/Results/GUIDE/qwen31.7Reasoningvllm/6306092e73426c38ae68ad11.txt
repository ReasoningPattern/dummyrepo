Okay, I need to write the Python function merge_extra_vars based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function should do.

The docstring says it extends vars_dict with extra_vars. So, the function should take a dictionary and a list of extra variables, and merge them into the dictionary. But how exactly?

Wait, the parameters: vars_dict is the target dictionary, and extra_vars is a list. So, for each item in extra_vars, we need to add it to vars_dict. But what if the extra_vars have duplicates? The docstring doesn't mention handling that, so maybe we just add them as is, overwriting existing keys?

So the approach would be to iterate over each element in extra_vars and update vars_dict with those key-value pairs.

But wait, what if extra_vars is None? The docstring says extra_vars is a list, but maybe it's possible for it to be None. So in that case, we should handle it by checking if it's None and not adding anything. Or maybe the function is supposed to handle it by defaulting to an empty list?

Looking at the parameters again: the function has a parameter extra_vars with a default value of None. So, if extra_vars is not provided, it should use an empty list. So in the code, we should check if extra_vars is None and use an empty list otherwise.

So the steps are:

1. Initialize a list for extra_vars. If extra_vars is None, use an empty list.
2. Iterate through each item in extra_vars.
3. For each item, add the key-value pair to vars_dict.

But wait, the function is supposed to merge the extra-vars into vars_dict. So, if a key exists in vars_dict, it should be overwritten. So, for each entry in extra_vars, we add the key to vars_dict, overwriting any existing ones.

So the code would be something like:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[var] = var  # Wait, but what if the key is the same as the value? Like, if the extra_var is 'key=value'? Wait, no, the docstring doesn't specify the format of the extra_vars. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. But the docstring doesn't specify what the extra_vars are. For example, if extra_vars is a list of strings like 'key=value', then we need to split them into key and value. But the function's code as written would just add each element as a key-value pair, which would be incorrect.

Wait, but the function's docstring doesn't mention anything about the format of the extra_vars. So maybe the extra_vars are strings that are key-value pairs, like 'key=value', and the function needs to split them into key and value.

But the problem statement doesn't specify that. The user hasn't provided any examples, so maybe the function is supposed to take a list of strings where each string is a key-value pair, and the function should split them into key and value.

But the original function signature doesn't mention that. So perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of strings where each string is a key-value pair, and the function should merge them into vars_dict.

But the docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which could mean that the extra_vars are keys, but that's not clear.

Wait, maybe the extra_vars are a list of keys, and the function is supposed to add them to vars_dict. But that would be straightforward. For example, if extra_vars is ['a', 'b'], then vars_dict would have a and b added.

But then, the function's code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[var] = var  # Wait, but this would overwrite existing keys. But if the extra_vars are keys, then this is correct.

But the problem is that the function's parameters are not clear. However, given that the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the task is to generate the code based on that, perhaps the extra_vars are a list of strings where each string is a key-value pair, and the function needs to split them into key and value.

But since the docstring doesn't mention that, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of keys, and the code is as simple as adding each key to vars_dict.

But the user's example code would need to handle that. However, since the user hasn't provided examples, perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of strings where each string is a key, and the code is to add them to the dictionary.

But in that case, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[var] = var  # Assuming that each element in extra_vars is a key, and the value is the same as the key.

But this is a bit odd. However, given the lack of information, perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars are a list of key-value pairs, like 'key=value', and the function needs to split them into key and value. But without knowing that, it's hard to say.

But the user's docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which could mean that the extra-vars are keys, and the function is adding them to the dictionary.

So, proceeding with that assumption, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[var] = var

But wait, if the extra_vars are a list of strings like 'key=value', then this code would add the key as a string, but the value would be the same as the key. That's not correct. For example, if the extra_var is 'key=value', then the key is 'key' and the value is 'value'.

So, the function would need to split each extra_var into key and value. But since the docstring doesn't mention this, perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of strings where each string is a key, and the value is the same as the key.

But the user hasn't provided any examples, so perhaps the function is intended to take a list of keys, and the code is as above.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars are a list of key-value pairs, and the function is supposed to split them into key and value. But without knowing that, it's hard to code.

But given the function's parameters and the docstring, perhaps the function is intended to take a list of keys, and the code is as written.

So, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[var] = var

But wait, in Python, if you do vars_dict[var] = var, then if var is a key in the dictionary, it will overwrite the value. So, for example, if extra_vars is ['a', 'b'], then vars_dict will have a and b as keys with values a and b.

But the problem is that the function's docstring doesn't specify what the extra_vars are. So, perhaps the function is intended to take a list of strings where each string is a key, and the value is the same as the key. So, the code is as above.

But maybe the function is supposed to take a list of key-value pairs, like 'key=value', and split them into key and value. But without knowing that, it's hard to code.

But given the information, the code should be written as per the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars (default: None)
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[var] = var

But wait, in Python, if you have a dictionary and you do vars_dict[var] = var, then if var is a key in the dictionary, it will overwrite the value. So, for example, if extra_vars is ['a', 'b'], then vars_dict will have a: a, b: b.

But if the extra_vars are something else, like 'key=value', then this code would not work. However, since the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the function is intended to take a list of keys, and the code is as written.

So, the code is as above. But the user might expect that the extra_vars are a list of key-value pairs, and the function splits them. But without that info, the code can't be written correctly.

But given the problem statement, the code should be written as per the function signature and docstring. So, the code is as written.

Now, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format, and only the code. So, the final code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars (default: None)
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        vars_dict[var] = var

But wait, the docstring is part of the function, so the code should include that. However, the user's example shows the docstring as part of the function. So, the code would have the function with the docstring.

So, the final code is as above.
