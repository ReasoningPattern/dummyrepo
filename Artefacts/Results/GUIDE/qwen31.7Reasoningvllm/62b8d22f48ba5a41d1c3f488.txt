Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is called popitem and is part of a class. The docstring says it removes the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value as a tuple. So, the method is supposed to remove the first key-value pair and return them.

Wait, but in Python, dictionaries have a popitem() method which removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair. However, the docstring here says it should return the first inserted. Hmm, that's a bit conflicting. But the user provided the docstring as such, so I have to follow it.

So, the task is to implement a method that behaves like a dictionary's popitem but returns the first inserted key. But how does that work? Because in Python, the order of insertion is preserved in dictionaries, but the popitem() method removes the last one. So, if the user wants the first inserted, maybe the method should return the first key-value pair.

But how to track the first inserted? The class might have a way to track the order. Maybe the class maintains a list of inserted items, and popitem() removes the first one.

Wait, but the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class definition. So, I need to assume that the class has a way to track the inserted items.

Alternatively, maybe the class is a dictionary-like structure, and the popitem method is supposed to return the first inserted key. But in Python, dictionaries don't have a popitem method that returns the first inserted. So, perhaps the user is expecting a custom implementation.

So, the approach would be to have the class maintain a list of inserted items, and when popitem is called, it removes the first item and returns it as a tuple.

But how to implement that. Let's think.

Assuming the class has a __init__ method that adds items to a list, and popitem() removes the first item.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the class definition. So, the code needs to be written in a way that the class can have the necessary attributes.

So, the code would look something like this:

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def popitem(self):
        if not self.items:
            raise KeyError("Dictionary is empty")
        key, value = self.items[0]
        del self.items[0]
        return (key, value)

But wait, the docstring says that popitem returns the key and value in tuple format. So, the method returns a tuple of (key, value). But in Python, when you pop from a dictionary, the key is the first inserted, but the actual implementation would need to track the order.

However, the problem is that the user's docstring says that popitem returns the first inserted key and value. So, the code needs to return the first inserted key and value.

But in the code above, the items are stored in a list, and the first element is the first inserted. So, when popitem is called, it removes the first item and returns it as a tuple.

But wait, the problem is that the user's function signature is def popitem(self):, which implies that the method is part of a class. So, the code would need to have the class with the necessary attributes.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so I need to assume that the class has a way to track the inserted items. So, the code would be as above.

But maybe the class is a dictionary, and the user wants to implement a custom popitem that returns the first inserted. However, in Python, the standard dict's popitem() removes the last inserted. So, this is a custom implementation.

So, the code would be:

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def popitem(self):
        if not self.items:
            raise KeyError("Dictionary is empty")
        key, value = self.items[0]
        del self.items[0]
        return (key, value)

But wait, the problem says that the function is part of a class. So, the code would be written in a way that the class has the necessary attributes.

But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code needs to be written as a class with the method.

So, the generated code would be the class with the __init__ and popitem methods as above.

But the user's docstring says that the method returns the key and value in tuple format. So, the code returns (key, value) as a tuple.

But in Python, when you pop from a dictionary, the key is the first inserted, but the actual implementation would need to track the order. So, the code above assumes that the items are stored in a list, and the first element is the first inserted.

But the problem is that the user's docstring says that popitem returns the first inserted key and value. So, the code is correct.

Now, the user wants the code generated, and the output should be in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as a class with the method.

But the user's example shows that the output should be the code generated, not the test cases. Wait, the original problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code generated.

So, the code would be the class with the method.

But the user's example shows that the code is to be written in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as:

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def popitem(self):
        if not self.items:
            raise KeyError("Dictionary is empty")
        key, value = self.items[0]
        del self.items[0]
        return (key, value)

But maybe the class is supposed to be a subclass of dict, but the user hasn't specified that. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code would be as above.

But perhaps the class is supposed to be a dictionary-like structure, and the popitem method is implemented as such.

Another thing to consider: in Python, when you pop from a dictionary, the key is the last inserted. So, if the user wants the first inserted, the code needs to track the order. So, the code above is correct.

So, the final code would be the class with the __init__ and popitem methods as described.
