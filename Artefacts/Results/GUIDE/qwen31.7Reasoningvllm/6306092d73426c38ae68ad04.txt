Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_parser_option_specs and takes a command_name parameter. The docstring says it returns a list of all command options.

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions getting all the options for a specified command, like main, virsh, ospd, etc. So the function is probably part of a class that handles command-line options for different commands.

The function returns a list of options. But how is this list structured? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the actual implementation needs to return a list of dictionaries or some other data structure. But since the user hasn't provided any test cases or expected output, I need to think of a reasonable approach.

Wait, the user mentioned using a test-driven development approach. So maybe the code should include tests first. But the user wants me to generate the code, not the tests. However, the instructions say to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a class method that returns the options.

But the function is part of a class, and the parameters are self and command_name. So the function is likely part of a class like a CLI parser or something similar.

Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of dictionaries, each representing an option. For example, for the 'main' command, it might return a list of options like {'name': '--option1', 'description': 'Description of option1', 'type': 'str', 'required': True}.

But without knowing the exact structure, I need to make assumptions. Since the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the function is supposed to return a list of strings, each being an option. Or maybe a list of dictionaries with keys like 'name', 'description', 'type', etc.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that manages command-line options, and the get_parser_option_specs method is supposed to return the options for a specific command. For example, in a class like CLIParser, this method would return the options for the given command.

But since the user hasn't provided any specific details about the data structure, I need to make a reasonable assumption. Let's assume that the function returns a list of dictionaries, each with 'name' and 'description' keys. That's a common structure for command-line options.

So the code would look something like this:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    """Gets all the options for the specified command"""
    # Logic to retrieve options for the given command_name
    # For example, maybe a dictionary mapping command names to options
    # But since the actual data is not provided, this is just a placeholder
    return []

But wait, the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is given, so the code should follow that. The function returns a list of all command options. The parameter is command_name, which is a string like 'main', 'virsh', etc.

Maybe the actual implementation is to return a predefined list of options for each command. For example, for 'main', it returns a list of options, and for others, different lists. But without knowing the actual data, the code can't be written accurately. However, the user might expect that the function returns a list, perhaps as a list of dictionaries.

So the code would be:

def get_parser_option_specs(self, command_name):
    """
    Gets all the options for the specified command

    :param command_name: the command name (main, virsh, ospd, etc...)
    :return: the list of all command options
    """
    # Placeholder implementation
    # In a real scenario, this would retrieve the options from a data source
    # For example, a dictionary mapping command names to their options
    # Here, we'll return a sample list for demonstration
    if command_name == 'main':
        return [
            {'name': '--option1', 'description': 'Description for option1', 'type': 'str', 'required': True},
            {'name': '--option2', 'description': 'Description for option2', 'type': 'int', 'required': False}
        ]
    elif command_name == 'virsh':
        return [
            {'name': '--vm', 'description': 'Virtual machine name', 'type': 'str', 'required': True},
            {'name': '--cpu', 'description': 'CPU count', 'type': 'int', 'required': False}
        ]
    else:
        return []

But the user might want a more general approach. However, since the problem statement doesn't provide any specific data, this is a reasonable approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a static method or a data structure that holds the options for each command. But without that information, the code can't be written accurately.

So the final code would be the function as described, with a placeholder implementation that returns a list of dictionaries for different commands. The docstring is as given.
