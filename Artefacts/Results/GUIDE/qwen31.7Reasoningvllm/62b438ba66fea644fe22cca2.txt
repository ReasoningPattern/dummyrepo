Okay, I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that takes a list of nodes and merges their values based on duplicate keys. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So, the main task is to handle nested structures, maybe with dictionaries or other nodes, and merge them while preserving the last value for conflicting keys.

First, I need to think about how to represent the nodes. The function's parameters are nodes, which I assume are objects that have a 'value' attribute and possibly a 'children' attribute. But since the docstring doesn't specify, I'll have to make assumptions. Maybe each node is a dictionary, or perhaps a class with a value and children. But since the problem mentions "MappingNode", maybe each node is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to merge them recursively.

Wait, the function's docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So, the nodes could be dictionaries, and the function needs to merge them recursively. For example, if two nodes have the same key, their values are merged. But if the values are not dictionaries, the last one wins.

So, the approach would be to process each node recursively, merging their keys. For each key in the current node, check if it exists in the merged result. If it does, check if the values are both MappingNodes. If they are, merge them. If not, keep the last one.

But how to handle nested structures? For example, if a node has a child that is another node, we need to merge that as well.

So, the function needs to process each node, and for each key in the node, check if it's already in the result. If it is, and the values are both MappingNodes, then merge them. Otherwise, keep the last value.

Wait, the docstring says: "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So, if a key is present in the merged result and the value is not a MappingNode, then the last value (from the original nodes) remains. So, when merging, if the current value is not a MappingNode, we don't merge it further, but keep it as is.

So, the steps would be:

1. Initialize a result dictionary.
2. For each node in the input list:
   a. Recursively process the node's value.
   b. For each key in the node's value, check if it's already in the result.
   c. If it is, and the current value is a MappingNode, then merge them. If the existing value is not a MappingNode, then keep the current value (since the last one remains).
   d. If it's not in the result, add it with the current value.
3. Return the result.

But how to handle the merging of nested nodes? For example, if a node's value is another node, we need to recursively merge that node.

So, the function needs to be recursive. Let's think about the base case: if a node is a MappingNode, then we process its keys. If it's not a MappingNode, then we just add its value as is.

Wait, but the problem says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So, the nodes could be any objects that have a 'value' attribute and possibly 'children' attributes. But the function's docstring doesn't specify, so I need to make assumptions.

Assuming that each node is a dictionary, and the 'value' is the key-value pair. Wait, maybe each node is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to merge them. For example, if you have two nodes, each with a 'key' and 'value', then merge them.

But the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that the nodes are possibly nested structures. So, perhaps each node is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to merge them recursively.

Alternatively, maybe each node is a class with a 'value' and 'children' attribute. But since the docstring doesn't specify, I'll proceed with the assumption that each node is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to merge them.

So, the function will take a list of nodes, each of which is a dictionary. The function will merge them, recursively.

So, the code structure would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        # Process the current node's value
        # If the node is a MappingNode, process its children
        # Otherwise, add the value as is
        # But how to check if it's a MappingNode? Maybe the node has a 'value' and 'children' attribute.
        # Assuming that each node is a dictionary with 'value' and 'children' keys.
        # So, for each node in nodes:
        #   if the node has a 'value' key, process it
        #   else, maybe it's a leaf node
        # But the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys", so perhaps each node is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to merge them.

        # So, for each node, we need to process its value and children.
        # So, for the current node, we'll recursively merge its value.

        # So, let's process the node's value first.
        # Let's assume that each node is a dictionary with 'value' and 'children' keys.
        # So, for the current node, we'll process its value.

        # But how to handle the merging? For example, if the node's value is another node, we need to merge it.

        # So, the function will process each node's value recursively.

        # So, the code would be something like:

        # For each node in nodes:
        #   if the node is a MappingNode (has 'value' and 'children'), then process its value and children.
        #   else, add the value as is.

        # But how to check if a node is a MappingNode? Maybe the node has a 'value' and 'children' attribute.

        # So, for the current node, we'll process its value.

        # Let's assume that each node is a dictionary with 'value' and 'children' keys.

        # So, for the current node, we'll process its value.

        # So, let's create a helper function to merge a single node.

        # But since the function is supposed to merge all nodes, perhaps we need to process each node's value recursively.

        # So, perhaps the function is supposed to process each node's value, and for each key in the value, merge them.

        # So, the code would be:

        # Initialize the result as an empty dictionary.
        # For each node in nodes:
        #   process the node's value, and add to the result.

        # But how to process the node's value? For example, if the node's value is another node, we need to merge it.

        # So, perhaps the function is supposed to merge all nodes, and for each node, recursively merge its value.

        # So, the code could be:

        # For each node in nodes:
        #   if the node has a 'value' key, then process that value.
        #   else, add the node's value as is.

        # But how to handle the merging of the value?

        # Let me think of an example. Suppose we have two nodes:

        # node1: {'key1': 1, 'key2': 2}
        # node2: {'key1': 3, 'key2': 4}

        # The merged result should be {'key1': 3, 'key2': 4}.

        # So, the function needs to merge the values of the nodes, and for keys that are present in both, the last one is kept.

        # So, the approach is to process each node's value, and for each key, check if it's already in the result. If it is, and the current value is a MappingNode, then merge. Otherwise, keep the current value.

        # So, the code would be:

        # For each node in nodes:
        #   process the node's value, and add to the result.

        # But how to process the node's value? For example, if the node's value is another node, we need to recursively merge it.

        # So, perhaps the function is supposed to process each node's value recursively.

        # So, the code would be:

        # Create a helper function that takes a node and returns a merged dictionary.

        # But since the function is called deep_merge_nodes, perhaps the helper function is inside it.

        # So, the code could be:

        def merge_node(node):
            if not node:
                return {}
            # Check if the node is a MappingNode (has 'value' and 'children')
            # Assuming that each node is a dictionary with 'value' and 'children' keys.
            # So, for the current node, process its value and children.

            # Get the value of the node
            value = node.get('value')
            children = node.get('children', [])

            # If the value is None, return empty dict?
            # Or maybe the node is a leaf node.

            # For the value, we need to merge it with the existing result.

            # So, create a merged value for this node.
            merged_value = merge_value(value)
            # Then, process the children.

            # So, the merged_value is a dictionary, and we need to process its children.

            # So, the merged node is merged_value, and its children are processed.

            # But how to handle the merging of the children?

            # For example, if the node's value is a dictionary, then we need to merge it with the existing result.

            # So, the helper function merge_value would take a value and return a merged dictionary.

            # So, the helper function would be:

            def merge_value(val):
                if not val:
                    return {}
                # Check if val is a MappingNode (has 'value' and 'children')
                # Assuming that each node is a dictionary with 'value' and 'children' keys.
                # So, for the current val, process its value and children.

                # Get the value of the current node.
                current_val = val.get('value')
                children_val = val.get('children', [])

                # If current_val is None, return empty dict?
                # Or maybe the node is a leaf.

                # For the current_val, we need to merge it with the existing result.

                # So, create a merged current_val.
                merged_current_val = merge_value(current_val)
                # Then, process the children.

                # So, the merged node is merged_current_val, and its children are processed.

                # So, the merged node is a dictionary with merged_current_val and children processed.

                # But how to handle the merging of the children?

                # For example, if the children are a list of nodes, we need to process them recursively.

                # Or maybe the node is a leaf.

                # For the current_val, if it's not a dictionary, then return it as is.

                # So, the code:

                            # So, the approach is to process each node's value, and for each key, if it's already in the result, and the current value is a MappingNode, then merge. Otherwise, keep the current value.

                            # So, the code for deep_merge_nodes would be:

                            # Initialize the result as an empty dictionary.

                            #   process the node's value, and add to the result.

                            # So, the code for processing a node's value:

                            # For the current node's value, we need to merge it with the existing result.

                            # So, the code:
