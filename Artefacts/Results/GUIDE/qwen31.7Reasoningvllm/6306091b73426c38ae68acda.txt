Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called plugins_manager and is a class method. The docstring says it gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service().

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions that it's a class method, so it's part of a class. The function is supposed to retrieve the plugin manager service by calling cls._get_service() and then getting the PLUGINS_MANAGER service from that.

Wait, the ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER is probably a constant or a class attribute. But the problem doesn't specify what ServiceName is. Maybe it's a class that has a static method or attribute called PLUGINS_MANAGER. But since the user hasn't provided that, I need to assume that ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER is a valid constant in the class.

So, the function plugins_manager is a class method that returns the plugin manager service. The steps would be:

1. Call cls._get_service() to get the service instance.
2. Then, access the PLUGINS_MANAGER attribute of that service instance.

But how is _get_service implemented? The user hasn't provided that, so maybe it's a method that returns the service. So, the plugins_manager method would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    service = cls._get_service()
    return service.PLUGINS_MANAGER

But wait, the docstring says it's getting the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So maybe the _get_service() method returns the service, and then the PLUGINS_MANAGER is a attribute of that service.

So the code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    service = cls._get_service()
    return service.PLUGINS_MANAGER

But I need to make sure that ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER is a valid attribute of the service. Since the user hasn't provided the exact implementation, I'll assume that ServiceName is a class with a static method or attribute PLUGINS_MANAGER.

So the code would be as above. Now, the user wants the code generated, and the output should be in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as a Python function.

Wait, the function is a class method, so it's defined as def plugins_manager(cls):. The code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    service = cls._get_service()
    return service.PLUGINS_MANAGER

But I need to make sure that _get_service() is a method of the class. So the class would have a method _get_service() that returns the service instance.

But since the user hasn't provided the implementation of _get_service(), I can't include it. The problem is to generate the code for plugins_manager based on the given signature and docstring.

So the answer is the code for plugins_manager as described.
