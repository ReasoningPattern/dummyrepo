Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function check_digests_present_and_used. The function is part of a class, and it's supposed to check if all the digests in the manifest that are needed are present and used. If not, it should return an error.

First, I need to understand the parameters. The function takes two arguments: manifest_files and digests_used. The manifest_files probably contains the list of manifests, and digests_used is a list of digests that are currently used. The goal is to check that all required digests are present in the manifest_files and are used in digests_used.

Wait, but what exactly is the 'needed' digests? The docstring says "all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." Hmm, maybe the manifest_files contain the required digests, and we need to check that they are present in the manifests and used in digests_used.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to check that for each digest in the digests_used, it exists in the manifest_files. But maybe the manifest_files are the ones that contain the required digests. Or maybe the manifest_files are the ones that have the digests, and digests_used is the list of digests that are currently used. So the function needs to ensure that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So maybe the manifest_files contain the required digests, and the digests_used is the list of digests that are currently used. So the function needs to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files. But how are the manifest_files structured? Are they a list of manifests, each with their own digests?

Alternatively, maybe the manifest_files is a list of manifests, and each manifest has a list of digests. The digests_used is a list of digests that are currently used. The function needs to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files (i.e., in the manifests' digests).

But the problem is, the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So perhaps the manifest_files is a list of manifests, each of which has a list of digests. Then, the function needs to check that for each digest in digests_used, it exists in the manifests' digests.

But how to implement this? Let's think.

First, we need to collect all the digests from the manifest_files. Then, check that each digest in digests_used is present in that set.

But wait, the function is supposed to return error() in the class. So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error if any digest in digests_used is not present in the manifest_files.

So the steps would be:

1. Collect all digests from the manifest_files. Let's say manifest_files is a list of manifests, each with a list of digests. So, for each manifest in manifest_files, add all its digests to a set.

2. Check that every digest in digests_used is in that set.

If any digest in digests_used is not present, then return an error.

But how to handle the case where the manifest_files is empty? Well, the function probably expects that manifest_files is not empty, but maybe we need to handle that.

So, the code would look something like:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    # collect all digests from manifest_files
    all_digests = set()
    for manifest in manifest_files:
        all_digests.update(manifest.digests)
    # check each digest in digests_used is present
    for digest in digests_used:
        if digest not in all_digests:
            self.error(f"Digest {digest} not found in manifest files")
    # if all are present, return success
    return None  # or some indicator

But wait, the function is supposed to return error() in the class. So maybe the function is supposed to raise an error, but the actual implementation would need to handle that.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Return error() in the class." So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, but the exact implementation depends on the class's error handling.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as a function that returns error() (probably raising an error).

But how to represent that in Python? Maybe the function is supposed to raise an error, like self.error(...), but the actual implementation would depend on the class's error handling.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact error handling, perhaps the function is supposed to raise a ValueError or some other exception.

Alternatively, the function could return None or some indicator, but the docstring says to return error() in the class. So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, like self.error(...).

But the exact implementation would depend on the class's error handling. However, the user hasn't provided that, so perhaps the code should include the error raising.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    all_digests = set()
    for manifest in manifest_files:
        all_digests.update(manifest.digests)
    for digest in digests_used:
        if digest not in all_digests:
            self.error(f"Digest {digest} not found in manifest files")
    return None

But wait, the function's docstring says "Return error() in the class." So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, but the exact error type is not specified. So the code would raise an error, like a ValueError or some other exception.

But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should raise a ValueError with a message.

Alternatively, the function could return None, but the docstring says to return error(), which is a bit ambiguous. However, in Python, returning None is not the same as returning an error. So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so the code would include the error raising.

So, the code would be:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    all_digests = set()
    for manifest in manifest_files:
        all_digests.update(manifest.digests)
    for digest in digests_used:
        if digest not in all_digests:
            self.error(f"Digest {digest} not found in manifest files")
    return None

But perhaps the function is supposed to return an error object, but since the user hasn't specified, the code can raise an error.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a boolean indicating whether all digests are present. But the docstring says "Return error() in the class." So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Return error() in the class." So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, but the exact error type is not specified. So the code would raise an error.

Therefore, the code would be as above.

But wait, the function is part of a class. So the code would have the function inside the class. So the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
        all_digests = set()
        for manifest in manifest_files:
            all_digests.update(manifest.digests)
        for digest in digests_used:
            if digest not in all_digests:
                self.error(f"Digest {digest} not found in manifest files")
        return None

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, and the code should be generated as such.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code would be written as a function inside the class.

But the user's example shows that the function is written as def check_digests_present_and_used(self, ...):, so the code would be written with the function inside the class.

So the final code would be:

class MyClass:
    def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
        all_digests = set()
        for manifest in manifest_files:
            all_digests.update(manifest.digests)
        for digest in digests_used:
            if digest not in all_digests:
                self.error(f"Digest {digest} not found in manifest files")
        return None

But the user's docstring says "Return error() in the class." So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, but the exact error type is not specified. So the code would raise an error, like a ValueError.

But since the user hasn't specified, the code can raise a ValueError with a message.

Alternatively, the code could raise a CustomError, but since it's not specified, the code can raise a ValueError.

So the code would be as above.

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, and the code should be generated accordingly.

So the final code is as written.
