Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called remove_ending_os_sep that takes an input list and returns a new list after removing trailing OS separator characters. The docstring says that if the input is None, return an empty list. Also, each string in the list is checked if its length is greater than one and if the last character is a pathname separator. Then, we remove those trailing separators.

First, I need to figure out what the OS separators are. Oh right, in Python, the OS separators are usually the backslash \ and the slash /, but maybe the function is expecting to remove any trailing characters that are considered separators. Wait, the docstring says "pathname seperator", so maybe it's referring to the slash /, but maybe also backslashes? Or maybe it's considering both? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says to remove trailing OS separator characters. So perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are considered separators. But what's considered a separator here? The docstring says each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator. So maybe the separators are the slash / and backslash \? Or maybe just the slash?

Wait, the problem says "pathname seperator", which in Unix-like systems is the slash /, but in Windows it's the backslash \. But maybe the function is supposed to handle both? Or maybe the function is intended to remove any trailing characters that are considered separators, regardless of OS.

But the function is called remove_ending_os_sep, which suggests that it's for operating system-specific separators. So perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are considered OS separators, which could be either / or \. But how to determine which ones?

Wait, the docstring says that each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the last character is a separator, but what's considered a separator here? For example, in Unix, a slash is a separator, but in Windows, a backslash is. But maybe the function is intended to remove any trailing characters that are separators, regardless of OS. However, the function's name suggests that it's for OS-specific separators.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are considered OS separators. But how to determine which characters?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are not part of the filename, but that's not clear. Wait, the docstring says "remove trailing os seperator characters". So perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are considered OS separators. For example, if a string ends with a slash, then remove it. But if it ends with a backslash, also remove it? Or maybe just the slash?

But the problem says that each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the last character is a separator, and if so, remove it. But what's considered a separator here? For example, in Unix, a slash is a separator, but in Windows, a backslash is. However, the function's name suggests that it's for OS-specific separators. So perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are considered OS separators, which could be either / or \.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are not part of the filename, but that's not clear. The problem is a bit ambiguous.

But given the docstring, the function is supposed to check each string's length and if the last character is a separator. So perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are separators, which could be either / or \.

But how to check that? For example, in Python, the os.sep is '\', but maybe the function is supposed to check if the last character is either / or \.

Wait, the problem says "pathname seperator", which in Unix is /, but in Windows it's \. So maybe the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are considered separators, which could be either / or \.

But how to determine that. For example, in the function, for each string in the input list, check if the length is greater than one, and if the last character is either / or \. If so, remove it.

But the problem says "remove trailing os seperator characters". So perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are considered OS separators. So for each string in the input list, if the string's length is greater than one, and the last character is a separator (either / or \), then remove it.

But how to implement that. For example, for each string in the input list, we can check if the last character is a separator. If so, remove it. But we need to make sure that we don't remove characters that are not separators. Wait, but the docstring says that each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator. So perhaps the function is supposed to remove the trailing separator characters from each string, but only if the string's length is greater than one.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if the input list is None. If so, return an empty list.

2. Iterate over each string in the input list.

3. For each string, check if its length is greater than one. If not, leave it as is.

4. If the length is greater than one, check if the last character is a pathname separator (either / or \).

5. If it is, remove the last character.

6. Add the modified string to the result list.

So, for example, if the input list is ["a/b", "c\\d", "e"], then the first string is "a/b" (length 3, last character is /, so remove it → "a"). The second string is "c\\d" (length 3, last character is \, so remove it → "c"). The third string is "e" (length 1, so leave as is). So the result would be ["a", "c", "e"].

But wait, the problem says "remove trailing os seperator characters". So perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are OS separators, regardless of their position. For example, if a string ends with a slash, remove it. If it ends with a backslash, remove it. But how to handle that.

But the problem says that each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator. So perhaps the function is supposed to check for the last character being a separator, and if so, remove it. So, for example, if a string is "a/b/c", then the last character is 'c', which is not a separator, so it's left as is. But if the string is "a/b", then the last character is '/', so remove it → "a".

But how to determine what is considered a separator. The problem says "pathname seperator", which in Unix is /, but in Windows it's \. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the last character is either / or \.

So, in code, for each string in the input list:

if the string is None → return empty list.

else:

for each string in the list:

if len(string) > 1:

   if string[-1] in '/\\':

       new_string = string[:-1]

       add to result

   else:

       add to result

else:

   add to result

So, that's the logic.

Now, the code.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a list after removing trailing os separator characters. So, the code would be:

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):

    if input_list is None:

        return []

    result = []

    for s in input_list:

        if len(s) > 1:

            if s[-1] in '/\\':

                # remove the last character

                new_s = s[:-1]

                result.append(new_s)

            else:

                result.append(s)

        else:

            result.append(s)

    return result

Wait, but what about if the string is something like "a/b/c" → the last character is 'c', which is not a separator, so it's left as is. But if the string is "a/b", then the last character is '/', so it's removed.

But the problem says "remove trailing os seperator characters". So, the trailing part here would be the last character. So, for example, if the string is "a/b/c", the trailing separator is 'c'? No, because 'c' is not a separator. So, the code is correct.

But wait, maybe the function is supposed to remove any trailing separators, not just the last character. For example, if the string is "a/b/c/", then the trailing separator is '/'? But the code would check the last character, which is '/', so remove it. But if the string is "a/b/c", then the last character is 'c', so it's left as is.

But the problem says "trailing os seperator characters". So, the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are considered separators. So, the code is correct.

But what about if the string is "a\\b" (with a backslash), then the last character is '\', which is a separator. So, the code would remove it, resulting in "a".

So, the code seems to handle that.

Now, testing the function.

Test case 1: input_list is None → returns empty list.

Test case 2: input_list is ["a/b", "c\\d", "e"] → returns ["a", "c", "e"].

Another test case: input_list is ["a", "a/b/c", "a\\b/c"] → returns ["a", "a/b/c", "a\\b/c"].

Another test case: input_list is ["a/b/c/", "a"] → returns ["a/b/c", "a"].

Another test case: input_list is ["a/b/c/", "a\\b/c/", "a"] → returns ["a/b/c", "a\\b/c", "a"].

So, the code seems to handle these cases.

But wait, the problem says "remove trailing os seperator characters". So, perhaps the function is supposed to remove any trailing characters that are OS separators, regardless of their position. For example, if a string ends with a slash, remove it. If it ends with a backslash, remove it. But if the string ends with something else, leave it.

So the code is correct.

Therefore, the code would be as written above.
