Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called unit_of_work, and it takes metadata and timeout as parameters. The docstring says it returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes.

First, I need to understand what a decorator is in Python. A decorator is a function that adds functionality to another function. So, the unit_of_work function should return a decorator that can be applied to other functions to add metadata and timeout.

Wait, the docstring says it returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. So, the decorator will have attributes like metadata and timeout, which can be accessed by the decorated functions.

But how do I structure the decorator? Let me think. The decorator should take the metadata and timeout as parameters. Wait, the function unit_of_work is supposed to return the decorator. So, the decorator will have the metadata and timeout attributes.

Wait, maybe the decorator is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a decorated function. So, the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that can be used to add metadata and timeout to the decorated function.

So, the decorator will have attributes like metadata and timeout. But how to pass those parameters to the decorated function?

Let me think of an example. Suppose we have a function @unit_of_work(metadata='some_metadata', timeout=5). Then, the decorated function would have metadata and timeout attributes set.

But how to implement that. The decorator needs to capture the metadata and timeout parameters. So, the unit_of_work function would return a decorator that takes a function and adds the metadata and timeout to it.

Wait, the function unit_of_work is supposed to return the decorator. So, the decorator will have the metadata and timeout attributes. But how to pass them to the decorated function.

Wait, maybe the decorator is a higher-order function that takes the metadata and timeout as parameters and returns a function that can be used as a decorator.

Alternatively, perhaps the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that, when applied to a function, adds the metadata and timeout to that function.

So, the decorator would look something like this:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # some code here
        return func
    return decorator

But then, how to set the metadata and timeout attributes. Wait, maybe the decorator is supposed to set the metadata and timeout attributes on the decorated function. So, when the decorator is applied, the decorated function will have those attributes.

But how to do that. Let's think. The decorator would need to capture the metadata and timeout parameters. So, the decorator function would have the metadata and timeout as parameters, and then when the decorated function is called, it would have those attributes.

Wait, maybe the decorator is a function that takes metadata and timeout as parameters, and then returns a function that wraps the original function, setting those attributes.

So, the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # some code here
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        wrapper.metadata = metadata
        wrapper.timeout = timeout
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But then, the decorator would have the metadata and timeout attributes. But how does that work? Because when you apply the decorator, the wrapper function would have those attributes.

Wait, but the decorator is supposed to return the wrapper. So, when you do @unit_of_work(metadata='x', timeout=5), the wrapper function would have metadata and timeout set.

But in that case, the decorator would need to set those attributes on the wrapper. So, the wrapper function would have metadata and timeout as attributes.

But then, when the decorated function is called, it would have those attributes. But how does the decorator know to set them?

Yes, in the wrapper function, we can set the metadata and timeout attributes.

But then, the unit_of_work function would return the decorator, which is a function that returns a wrapper.

So, the code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Here, we can set the metadata and timeout attributes
            wrapper.metadata = metadata
            wrapper.timeout = timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but then the wrapper function would have the metadata and timeout attributes. But when the decorator is applied, the wrapper is the decorated function. So, the decorated function would have those attributes.

But in this case, the wrapper is the decorated function. So, when you apply the decorator, the wrapper is the function that is decorated. So, the wrapper would have the metadata and timeout attributes.

But then, the user's docstring says that the function returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. So, the decorator is a function that, when applied, adds those attributes to the decorated function.

But in this code, the wrapper is the decorated function, and it has the metadata and timeout attributes. So, when you use @unit_of_work, the decorated function will have those attributes.

But then, the unit_of_work function returns the decorator, which is the wrapper function.

So, this seems to fit.

But wait, the original function signature is def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None): ... So, the unit_of_work function is supposed to return a decorator. So, the code above would be correct.

But then, the user's docstring says that the function returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. So, the decorator is a function that, when applied, adds those attributes to the decorated function.

So, the code would be as above.

But perhaps there's a better way. Maybe the decorator is supposed to take the metadata and timeout as parameters, and then the wrapper function can access them.

But in the code above, the wrapper function has the metadata and timeout attributes set. So, when the decorated function is called, it would have those attributes.

But then, the unit_of_work function returns the decorator, which is the wrapper function.

So, the code seems correct.

But maybe the user wants the decorator to have the metadata and timeout as attributes, not the wrapper. Wait, the docstring says "Returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes." So, the decorator itself has those attributes. But how?

Wait, perhaps the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper, and the wrapper has the metadata and timeout attributes. So, the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper, which has the metadata and timeout attributes.

So, the code would be as above.

But then, the unit_of_work function is a decorator that returns a wrapper. So, the code is correct.

But maybe the user wants the decorator to have the metadata and timeout as attributes, not the wrapper. But that's not possible because the decorator is a function, and functions can have attributes.

So, the code would be as written.

But then, the user's example would be:

@unit_of_work(metadata='some', timeout=5)
def my_function():
    pass

Then, my_function would have metadata and timeout attributes.

But in the code above, the wrapper function has those attributes. So, when the decorator is applied, the wrapper is the decorated function, and it has those attributes.

So, the code seems correct.

But perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

The function unit_of_work is supposed to return a decorator. So, the code returns the decorator function. The decorator function is a function that takes a function and returns a wrapper.

So, the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            wrapper.metadata = metadata
            wrapper.timeout = timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the wrapper is the decorated function. So, when you apply the decorator, the wrapper is the function that is decorated. So, the wrapper has the metadata and timeout attributes.

But in this code, the wrapper is the decorated function, and it has those attributes. So, when you do @unit_of_work(...), the decorated function will have those attributes.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the code should be as above. But the user's docstring says that the function returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. So, the decorator is the wrapper function, which has those attributes.

Therefore, the code is correct.
