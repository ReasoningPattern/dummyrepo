Okay, I need to generate a Python function called gaussian that calculates a Gaussian function centered at u=0.2 with sigma=0.1. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the Gaussian function is usually defined as (1/(sigma * sqrt(2π))) * exp(-((x - u)^2)/(2*sigma^2)). So the parameters here are u=0.2 and sigma=0.1.

The function should take an input x and return the value of this Gaussian at x. So the code will need to compute that exponent part and then the rest.

Let me start by importing math because I'll need the sqrt function. Then, the function will calculate the exponent: -( (x - u)**2 ) / (2 * sigma^2). Then compute the denominator as sigma * sqrt(2π), and divide the exponent part by that denominator.

Wait, the formula is (1/(sigma * sqrt(2π))) * exp(...). So the denominator is sigma multiplied by sqrt(2π). So the code would be:

return (1/(sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp( - ( (x - u)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2) )

But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly assigned. The function signature is given as def gaussian(x):, so the parameters are just x. The docstring says it's centered at u=0.2 and sigma=0.1. So the function should use those values.

Wait, but in the docstring, it's written as "centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1." So the function should use those values. So the code will use u=0.2 and sigma=0.1.

So the code would be:

import math

def gaussian(x):
    u = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    return (1/(sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp( - ( (x - u)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2) )

Wait, but maybe the user wants the function to take u and sigma as parameters? But the function signature is given as def gaussian(x):, so the parameters are just x. So the function is fixed with u=0.2 and sigma=0.1. So the code as above should work.

Let me check the math. Let me compute the denominator: sigma * sqrt(2π). For sigma=0.1, that's 0.1 * sqrt(2 * π). Then the exponent is -( (x - 0.2)^2 ) / (2 * (0.1)^2 ). So the code is correct.

I should also make sure that the math module is imported. So the code will have import math at the top.

But the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should include the import statement and the function.

So the final code would be:

import math

def gaussian(x):
    u = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    return (1/(sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp( - ( (x - u)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2) )

Yes, that should do it. Let me test with some sample values. For example, when x is 0.2, the exponent is zero, so the result is 1/(0.1 * sqrt(2π)) ≈ 1/(0.1 * 2.5066) ≈ 1/0.25066 ≈ 3.99. Which makes sense.

Another test: x=0.3. Then (x - u) is 0.1. Squared is 0.01. Divided by 2*0.01 is 0.01/0.02=0.5. So exponent is -0.5. Then the calculation would be 1/(0.1 * 2.5066) * e^(-0.5) ≈ 3.99 * 0.6065 ≈ 2.42. Which seems correct.

So the code should be correct.
