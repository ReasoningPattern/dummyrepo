Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the build_app_logger function based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is supposed to create a logger object. The parameters are name, logfile, and debug. The docstring explains that it's a general-purpose application logger, useful for debugging. The return value is an instantiated logger object.

First, I need to figure out which logging library to use. The standard library has the logging module, so I'll use that. The logger is created using logging.getLogger, but maybe the user wants to set the name parameter. Wait, the name parameter is passed to the logger, so I should use logging.getLogger(name) and then set the logger's name to the provided name.

Wait, the function's name is 'app', but the argument is name. So the function should take the name as an argument and set the logger's name to that. But the default is 'app'. So the function will create a logger with the given name, and then set the log file and debug level.

But how to handle the debug parameter? If debug is True, maybe the logger should be set to debug level. But the logging module's Logger has a level parameter. So, when creating the logger, we can set the level to logging.DEBUG if debug is True, otherwise logging.INFO or something else. Wait, the docstring says "useful mainly for debugging", so maybe the default is to set the level to DEBUG. But the debug parameter is a boolean. So, if debug is True, the logger's level is set to DEBUG, otherwise, maybe INFO?

But the problem is that the function's parameters are name, logfile, debug. The return is a logger object. So the code should create a logger with the given name, set the log file to the provided logfile, and set the debug level based on the debug parameter.

Wait, but the logging module's Logger has a level parameter. So, when creating the logger, we can set the level. But how to determine the level? If debug is True, set to logging.DEBUG, else maybe logging.INFO. But the docstring says "useful mainly for debugging", so maybe the default is to set the level to DEBUG. But the function's debug parameter is a boolean. So, perhaps the function should set the level to DEBUG if debug is True, else INFO. But maybe the user wants to set the level based on the debug parameter. Let me think.

The function's docstring says "is need to debug" but the parameter is debug. So perhaps if debug is True, the logger is set to debug level. Otherwise, maybe it's set to info. But the exact behavior depends on the user's needs. However, the function's return is an instantiated logger object, so the code should create the logger with the given name, set the log file, and set the level based on the debug parameter.

So, the steps are:

1. Import the logging module.

2. Create a logger with the given name.

3. Set the log file to the provided logfile.

4. Set the logging level based on the debug parameter. If debug is True, set to logging.DEBUG, else maybe logging.INFO.

But wait, the logging module's Logger has a level parameter. So, when creating the logger, we can set the level. So, in the code:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(message)s')
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    return logger

Wait, but the default logging level for the root logger is WARNING. So, if the logger is created with a level of DEBUG, then it will log DEBUG and higher levels. But if the user wants to log at INFO level, then the logger's level is set to INFO. But the function's debug parameter is a boolean. So, if debug is True, set to DEBUG, else INFO.

But the docstring says "useful mainly for debugging", so maybe the default is to set the level to DEBUG. But the function's debug parameter is a boolean. So, perhaps the function should set the level to DEBUG if debug is True, else INFO. But the user might want to set it to DEBUG regardless. However, the function's parameters include debug, so the code should follow that.

But the problem is that the logging module's Logger has a level parameter. So, the code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(message)s')
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    return logger

But wait, the logger is created with the given name. But the default name is 'app', but the function allows passing a name. So, the code is correct.

But what about the log file? The function's argument is logfile, which is the log file to save. So, the code creates a FileHandler with that log file.

But what if the log file already exists? The handler will overwrite it, but that's up to the user. The function doesn't handle that, but the user is responsible.

So, the code should be as above.

But the function's return is an instantiated logger object. So, the code is correct.

Now, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format. So, the code should be written as a Python function.

But the user also mentioned that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should match the parameters and the docstring.

So, the final code would be:

import logging

def build_app_logger(name='app', logfile='app.log', debug=True):
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if debug else logging.INFO)
    handler = logging.FileHandler(logfile)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(message)s')
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(handler)
    return logger

But wait, the logger is created with the given name. But the default is 'app', but the function allows passing a name. So, that's correct.

But what if the logger already exists? The getLogger method will return the existing logger, but if it's not exists, it will create it. So, that's handled.

So, this should be the correct code.
