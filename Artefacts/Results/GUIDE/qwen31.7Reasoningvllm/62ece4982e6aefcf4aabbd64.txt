Okay, I need to write a Python function called strip_root that takes a path and a root, and removes the root from the path. If it fails, throw an exception. The function should return the path without the root.

First, I should think about what the root is. The root is probably a prefix that needs to be removed. For example, if the root is "http://", then any path starting with that would have it stripped. But how do I determine if the path starts with the root?

Wait, the function is supposed to remove the root from the path. So, if the path starts with the root, we remove it. But if the path doesn't start with the root, then we return the path as is. But what if the root is a substring that's not at the beginning? Like, if the root is "http://", but the path is "http://example.com/path", then stripping would remove the root. But if the path is "example.com/path", then the root isn't present, so we return it.

But the problem says "remove root from path". So maybe the root is a prefix. So the function should check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then remove the root and return the remaining part. Otherwise, raise an exception.

But wait, what if the root is empty? Or if the path is exactly the root? Like, if path is "http://" and root is "http://", then stripping would leave an empty string. But the function's docstring says to throw an exception if it fails. So maybe there's a case where the root is not present in the path, but the function is supposed to return the path as is. But according to the docstring, the function returns the path without root. So if the root is not present, then return the path.

But how to handle cases where the root is not a prefix? For example, if the root is "http://", but the path is "http://example.com/path", then stripping would remove the root. But if the path is "example.com/path", then the root isn't present, so return it.

So the steps are:

1. Check if the path starts with the root.
2. If it does, remove the root and return the remaining part.
3. If not, raise an exception.

But wait, what if the root is not a prefix? Like, if the root is "http://", but the path is "http://example.com/path", then the root is a prefix. But if the path is "example.com/path", then the root isn't a prefix. So the function should return the path as is.

But how to handle cases where the root is a substring that's not at the beginning? For example, if the root is "http://", but the path is "http://example.com/path", then stripping would remove the root. But if the path is "example.com/path", then the root isn't present, so return it.

So the function should check if the path starts with the root. If yes, remove it. Otherwise, raise an exception.

But what if the root is empty? Well, the function's parameters are path and root. If root is empty, then the function would remove nothing, but the docstring says to throw an exception if it fails. But maybe the root is supposed to be a valid prefix. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps we need to handle that.

But according to the problem statement, the function should throw an exception if it fails. So perhaps if the root is not present in the path, then it's considered a failure? Or maybe the function is supposed to return the path as is.

Wait, the docstring says "If fails, throw exception". So perhaps the function is supposed to throw an exception if the root is not present in the path. But how to determine that.

Alternatively, maybe the root is a prefix, and if the path does not start with the root, then it's considered a failure. But that's not clear. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous.

But given the function's purpose, the most logical approach is that the root is a prefix, and the function removes it if present. If not, then it's an error. So, the function should check if the path starts with the root. If yes, return the remaining part. If not, raise an exception.

So, in code:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if path.startswith(root):
        return path[len(root):]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Root {root} not found in path {path}")

But wait, what if the root is empty? For example, if root is an empty string, then path.startswith(root) would always be true, so the function would return path[len(root):], which is path. But that's probably not intended. However, the problem statement doesn't specify handling empty roots, so perhaps we can assume that the root is a non-empty string.

But the function's parameters are path and root. So, the code would need to handle cases where root is empty. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that, so maybe we can proceed under the assumption that root is a non-empty string.

But the docstring says "if fails, throw exception". So perhaps if the root is not present in the path, then it's considered a failure. So, the function would raise an exception in that case.

But how to handle the case where the root is not a prefix. For example, if the root is "http://", but the path is "http://example.com/path", then the function would remove the root. But if the path is "example.com/path", then the root is not present, so the function would raise an exception.

So the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if path.startswith(root):
        return path[len(root):]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Root {root} not found in path {path}")

But wait, what if the root is longer than the path? For example, if the path is "abc" and the root is "abcd", then path.startswith(root) is False, so the function raises an exception. That's correct.

But what if the root is empty? Then path.startswith(root) is True, so the function returns path[len(root):], which is path. But that's probably not intended. However, the problem statement doesn't specify handling empty roots, so perhaps we can proceed.

Now, the unit tests. The user said to generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the code. So, I need to write test cases.

The function should return the path without the root if it starts with the root. Otherwise, raise an exception.

Test cases:

Test case 1: path starts with root. Expected output is path without root.

Test case 2: path does not start with root. Expected to raise ValueError.

Test case 3: root is empty. Then, path starts with empty string, so returns path. But maybe the function is supposed to raise an exception? But the problem statement doesn't specify. However, according to the docstring, if it fails, throw exception. So if the root is empty, then the function would return path, but perhaps that's considered a success. But the problem statement isn't clear.

But according to the problem statement, the function is supposed to remove the root. So if the root is empty, then the function would return the path as is. But the docstring says to throw an exception if it fails. So perhaps when the root is empty, the function doesn't throw an exception, but returns the path. But that's not clear.

But given that the problem statement doesn't specify, perhaps the function is supposed to handle empty roots as a special case. However, the code as written would handle it.

So, the unit tests would include:

Test 1: path starts with root. Expected output is path[len(root):].

Test 2: path does not start with root. Expected to raise ValueError.

Test 3: root is empty. Expected to return path.

Test 4: root is longer than path. Expected to raise ValueError.

Test 5: root is a substring but not a prefix. For example, path is "example.com/path", root is "http://". Then, the function raises ValueError.

So, the unit tests would be:

Test 1: path = "http://example.com/path", root = "http://". Expected output is "example.com/path".

Test 2: path = "example.com/path", root = "http://". Expected to raise ValueError.

Test 3: path = "abc", root = "". Expected output is "abc".

Test 4: path = "abc", root = "abcd". Expected to raise ValueError.

Test 5: path = "http://example.com/path", root = "example.com/". Expected to raise ValueError.

But the function's code would handle these cases.

So, the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if path.startswith(root):
        return path[len(root):]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Root {root} not found in path {path}")

Then, the unit tests would be written as:

# Test case 1
assert strip_root("http://example.com/path", "http://") == "example.com/path"

# Test case 2
try:
    strip_root("example.com/path", "http://")
except ValueError:
    pass
else:
    assert False, "Expected ValueError"

# Test case 3
assert strip_root("abc", "") == "abc"

# Test case 4
try:
    strip_root("abc", "abcd")
except ValueError:
    pass
else:
    assert False, "Expected ValueError"

# Test case 5
try:
    strip_root("http://example.com/path", "example.com/")
except ValueError:
    pass
else:
    assert False, "Expected ValueError"

But the user wants the code generated, not the tests. So the answer is the code.

But the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code is the function.

So the final answer is the code for the function.
