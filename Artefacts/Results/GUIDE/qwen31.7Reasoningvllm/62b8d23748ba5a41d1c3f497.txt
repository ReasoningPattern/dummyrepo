Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that popitem removes and returns the (key, value) pair that's least frequently used. So, this is likely related to a cache or a dictionary that tracks the frequency of elements. But the problem is, the function is part of a class, and the user hasn't provided the class definition. So I need to assume that the class has some internal data structure to track the frequency of items.

In Python, the standard way to handle this is using a dictionary to track the frequency, and a separate data structure (like a priority queue or a heap) to keep track of the least frequent items. However, implementing a heap for this might be complex. Alternatively, maybe the class uses a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache, but the popitem method here is for the least frequently used, not the least recently used.

Wait, the problem says "least frequently used" which is different from LRU. So the class might have a frequency counter, and the popitem method needs to return the key with the lowest frequency.

But how to implement this? Let's think. The class might have a dictionary to store the keys and their frequencies. Then, the popitem method would need to find the key with the minimum frequency and remove it.

But how to efficiently find the key with the minimum frequency? If the frequencies are stored in a dictionary, then for each key, we can track their frequency. Then, to find the least frequent, we need to iterate through all keys and find the one with the minimum value.

However, this approach would be O(n) time complexity for each popitem call, which might not be efficient for large datasets. But given that the user hasn't provided the class structure, maybe this is acceptable for the purpose of this problem.

So, the steps would be:

1. Maintain a frequency dictionary that maps each key to its current frequency.
2. Maintain a data structure (like a heap) that allows efficient retrieval of the least frequent key.

But implementing a heap for this might be complicated. Alternatively, since the problem is to generate the code, maybe the class has a method that uses a simple approach.

Wait, the user's example shows that the function is part of a class. So perhaps the class has a dictionary called 'freq' that tracks the frequency of each key, and a 'cache' that stores the keys. Then, the popitem method would need to find the key with the minimum frequency.

But how to implement this in Python. Let's think of the code structure.

Assuming the class has a 'freq' dictionary and a 'cache' dictionary (or a set), the popitem method would:

- Iterate through all keys in the cache to find the one with the minimum frequency.
- Remove that key from the cache and decrement the frequency.
- Return the (key, value) pair.

But wait, the problem says that the function returns the (key, value) pair. So the cache must store both the key and the value. So the class might have a 'cache' dictionary where each key is the key in the original data, and the value is the corresponding value. Then, the frequency dictionary tracks how many times each key has been accessed.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to return the (key, value) pair. So the cache must store both. So, the class might have a 'cache' dictionary that maps keys to their values, and a 'freq' dictionary that maps keys to their frequencies.

So, the popitem method would:

- Iterate through all keys in the cache to find the one with the minimum frequency.
- Once found, remove it from the cache and decrement the frequency.
- Return the (key, value) pair.

But how to efficiently find the key with the minimum frequency. If the cache is a regular dictionary, then for each call to popitem, we have to iterate through all keys, which is O(n) time. That's acceptable for small datasets, but not efficient for large ones. However, the problem doesn't specify any constraints, so perhaps this is acceptable.

So, the code would look like:

def popitem(self):
    # Find the key with the minimum frequency
    min_freq = None
    min_key = None
    for key in self.cache:
        if min_freq is None or self.freq[key] < min_freq:
            min_freq = self.freq[key]
            min_key = key
    # Remove the key from the cache and decrement frequency
    if min_key is not None:
        value = self.cache.pop(min_key)
        self.freq[min_key] -= 1
        return (min_key, value)
    else:
        # Handle the case where no elements are present
        raise KeyError("Pop from empty cache")

But wait, the problem says that the function is part of a class. So the class must have the 'cache' and 'freq' attributes. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition, so I need to assume that the class has these attributes.

But the problem says that the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the function definition, and the class attributes.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as a Python function, possibly within a class.

But the function is called popitem, and the class is not provided. So perhaps the code is part of a class, and the function is defined within that class.

So, the code would be:

class MyCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.freq = {}

    def popitem(self):
        # Find the key with the minimum frequency
        min_freq = None
        min_key = None
        for key in self.cache:
            if min_freq is None or self.freq[key] < min_freq:
                min_freq = self.freq[key]
                min_key = key
        # Remove the key from the cache and decrement frequency
        if min_key is not None:
            value = self.cache.pop(min_key)
            self.freq[min_key] -= 1
            return (min_key, value)
        else:
            # Handle the case where no elements are present
            raise KeyError("Pop from empty cache")

But the problem says that the function is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class definition. So the code above is assuming that the class exists and has the necessary attributes.

However, the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, and the code should be generated based on that. So the code above is correct.

But the problem says that the user wants the code generated, and the output should be in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as a Python function, possibly within a class.

But the user's example shows that the function is called popitem, and the docstring is given. So the code should include the function definition with the docstring.

So, the final code would be:

class MyCache:
    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the (key, value) pair least frequently used.
        """
        # Implementation here

But the implementation needs to be written. So the code would be as I wrote earlier.

But the user wants the code generated, so the code should include the function definition with the implementation.

So the final code would be:

class MyCache:
    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the (key, value) pair least frequently used.
        """
        min_freq = None
        min_key = None
        for key in self.cache:
            if min_freq is None or self.freq[key] < min_freq:
                min_freq = self.freq[key]
                min_key = key
        if min_key is not None:
            value = self.cache.pop(min_key)
            self.freq[min_key] -= 1
            return (min_key, value)
        else:
            raise KeyError("Pop from empty cache")

But the problem is that the class may not have the 'cache' and 'freq' attributes. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code is written assuming that the class has these attributes.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must include the function definition with the implementation.

So the final code is as above.
