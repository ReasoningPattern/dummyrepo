Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called _replace_url_args that takes two arguments: url and url_args. The docstring says that if url_args has a value, it should iterate over the keys and values from url_args and replace the keys of the first parameter with the values. Then return the modified url.

Wait, the function's name is _replace_url_args, which starts with an underscore. Maybe it's a private method? But the user didn't mention that, so maybe it's just a regular function. Anyway, the main thing is to implement the logic as per the docstring.

So the function's purpose is to replace URL parameters. Let me think about how URL parameters are usually handled. Typically, a URL might have parameters like ?key1=value1&key2=value2. So the function needs to take the original URL and replace the parameters with those from url_args.

But the docstring says "replace the value in url with the value in url_args". Wait, maybe the url is a string, and url_args is a dictionary. So for each key in url_args, we replace the corresponding parameter in the URL.

But how to do that? For example, if the URL is "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2" and url_args is {"a": "new_value", "b": "new_value2"}, then the modified URL should be "https://example.com/?a=new_value&b=new_value2".

So the approach would be to parse the URL into its components, replace the parameters, and then reassemble the URL.

But how to parse the URL? Well, maybe split on the question mark. Let's think:

Split the URL into parts. For example, url.split('?') would give a list where the first element is the base URL and the second is the query string.

Then, for each key-value pair in url_args, replace the corresponding parameter in the query string.

But how to do that? Let's say the query string is "a=1&b=2". We need to replace 'a=1' with 'a=new_value' and 'b=2' with 'b=new_value2'.

So, for each key in url_args, we can replace the key's value in the query string.

But how to do that in Python? Maybe split the query string into parts, replace each part, then join them.

Alternatively, use a dictionary to map the keys to their new values, and then construct the new query string.

Wait, but the original URL might have parameters that are not in url_args. So, we need to keep the original parameters unless they are in url_args. But the docstring says "replace the value in url with the value in url_args". So perhaps, if a parameter is in url_args, replace it; otherwise, leave it as is.

So the steps would be:

1. Split the URL into the base part and the query part.
2. For each key in url_args, replace the corresponding parameter in the query part.
3. Combine the base part and the modified query part to form the new URL.

But how to split the query part? Let's think. For example, if the URL is "https://example.com/path?param1=value1&param2=value2", then the query part is "param1=value1&param2=value2".

So, splitting on '?' gives us the base URL and the query string. Then, splitting the query string on '&' gives us the individual parameters.

But maybe there's a better way. For example, using a dictionary to map the parameters.

So, let's think of the code:

def _replace_url_args(url, url_args):
    # Split the URL into base and query parts
    base, query = url.split('?')
    # Now, process the query part
    # Create a new query string by replacing each parameter
    new_query = {}
    for key, value in url_args.items():
        new_query[key] = value
    # Now, combine the base and new query
    return f"{base}?{'&'.join([f'{k}={v}' for k, v in new_query.items()])}"

Wait, but this code would replace all parameters in the query with those from url_args. However, if a parameter in the original URL is not in url_args, it would be left as is. But the docstring says "replace the value in url with the value in url_args". So perhaps, if a parameter is in url_args, replace it; otherwise, leave it as is.

But the code above would replace all parameters in url_args, which is correct.

Wait, but what if url_args has parameters that are already in the original URL? For example, if the original URL has a parameter 'a=1', and url_args has 'a': 'new_value', then the code would replace it. That's correct.

But what if the original URL has parameters that are not in url_args? They would be left as is. So the code seems to handle that.

But wait, the code splits the URL into base and query. Then, creates a new_query dictionary from url_args. Then, joins the parameters with '&' and adds them to the base.

But what if the original URL has parameters that are not in url_args? They would be left as is. So the code is correct.

But wait, the code is using the same key names as in url_args. For example, if the original URL has a parameter 'a=1', and url_args has 'a': 'new_value', then the code replaces 'a=1' with 'a=new_value'.

But what if the original URL has a parameter 'a=1', and url_args has 'a': 'new_value', and another parameter 'b=2' in url_args. Then the code would replace 'a=1' and 'b=2'.

But what if the original URL has a parameter 'a=1', and url_args has 'a': 'new_value', but the original URL also has 'a=2'? Then the code would replace 'a=1' with 'a=new_value', but the original 'a=2' would be left as is. But the docstring says "replace the value in url with the value in url_args". So perhaps, the function should replace all parameters in url_args, regardless of existing ones. So the code is correct.

But wait, the code as written would replace all parameters in url_args, but if a parameter in the original URL is not in url_args, it's left as is. So that's correct.

But what if the original URL has parameters that are not in url_args? For example, if the original URL is "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2", and url_args is {"a": "new_value"}, then the code would replace 'a=1' with 'a=new_value', and leave 'b=2' as is. So the new URL is "https://example.com/?a=new_value&b=2".

But the docstring says "replace the value in url with the value in url_args". So that's correct.

But what if url_args is empty? Then the code would return the original URL.

So the code seems to handle all cases.

But wait, the code splits the URL into base and query. But what if the URL does not have a query part? For example, if the URL is "https://example.com", then splitting on '?' would give base as the entire URL, and query as an empty string. Then, the new_query would be empty, so the returned URL is the same as the original.

Which is correct.

But what if the URL has a query part that is empty? Like "https://example.com?". Then, splitting would give base as "https://example.com" and query as empty. Then, new_query is empty, so the returned URL is the same as the original.

So that's correct.

But what if the URL is something like "https://example.com/path?param1=value1&param2=value2", and url_args is {"param1": "new_value"}? Then the code would replace param1 with new_value, and leave param2 as is.

So the code seems to handle that.

But wait, the code uses the same key names as in url_args. So if the original URL has a parameter with the same name as in url_args, it's replaced. That's correct.

So the code seems to be correct.

But let's test some edge cases.

Test case 1: url is "https://example.com", url_args is empty. Then, the code returns the same URL.

Test case 2: url is "https://example.com/?a=1", url_args is {"a": "new_value"}. The code returns "https://example.com/?a=new_value".

Test case 3: url is "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2", url_args is {"b": "new_value"}. The code returns "https://example.com/?a=1&b=new_value".

Test case 4: url is "https://example.com/path?param1=value1", url_args is {"param1": "new_value", "param2": "new_value2"}. The code returns "https://example.com/path?param1=new_value&param2=new_value2".

So the code seems to handle these cases.

But wait, the code uses the same key names as in url_args. So if the original URL has a parameter with the same name as in url_args, it's replaced. That's correct.

So the code seems to be correct.

But the docstring says "replace the value in url with the value in url_args". So the function is replacing the parameters in the URL with those from url_args. So the code is correct.

Therefore, the code should be as written.

But wait, the code uses the same key names as in url_args. So if the original URL has a parameter with the same name as in url_args, it's replaced. That's correct.

So the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as follows.
