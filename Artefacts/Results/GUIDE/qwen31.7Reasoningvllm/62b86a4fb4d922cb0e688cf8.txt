Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the validate_value function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is supposed to validate a value against a regular expression. But the docstring doesn't specify which regex to use. Wait, maybe the user expects me to implement a generic validator? Or perhaps there's a missing part in the problem statement?

Wait, looking back at the user's message, the function signature is def validate_value(value): and the docstring says "Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression." But there's no regex provided. Hmm. Maybe the user intended to include the regex in the problem, but it's missing here. Or maybe it's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the original problem had a regex that was omitted here. But since the user hasn't provided it, I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to be a placeholder, and the user wants me to generate a generic validator with a default regex?

Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to create a function that checks if the value is a string, or some other type, but that's not clear.

Wait, the function is called validate_value, and the docstring says "against the corresponding regular expression." So perhaps the actual regex is supposed to be part of the function, but it's missing here. But since the user hasn't provided it, maybe I should create a sample regex and implement the validation.

For example, maybe the function is supposed to validate email addresses, or phone numbers, but without knowing the exact regex, I can't proceed. However, since the user hasn't provided the regex, perhaps they expect me to generate a generic function that uses a default regex, or maybe the regex is part of the problem that was omitted.

Wait, looking at the initial problem again: the user provided the function signature and docstring, but the docstring doesn't include the regex. So perhaps the user intended to include the regex in the problem but forgot. But since I have to generate code based on the given info, I need to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate a value against a regex that's part of the problem, but the user hasn't provided it. In that case, perhaps I should create a sample regex and implement the validation.

For example, let's assume that the regex is for checking if the value is a valid email address. So the regex would be something like r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'.

But without knowing the exact regex, I can't be sure. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. Since the docstring doesn't include the regex, maybe the user expects me to create a generic validator with a default regex.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to be a placeholder, and the actual regex is part of the problem that's missing. But since I have to generate code, I need to proceed.

Perhaps the user intended to have a specific regex, but it's missing. However, since the problem is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, I have to assume that the regex is part of the problem but not provided here. Therefore, I need to create a sample regex and implement the validation.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate the value against a regex that's part of the problem, but the user forgot to include it. But since I can't ask for more information, I have to proceed with what's given.

Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check again.

The function is def validate_value(value): with a docstring that says "Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression." So the actual regex is not provided. Therefore, the code must be a function that takes a value and a regex, but the parameters are not given. Wait, the function signature is def validate_value(value):, which implies that the regex is part of the function's parameters. But the function signature as given doesn't include that. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the function signature.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the regex as a parameter, but the signature is incomplete. But according to the user's message, the function signature is def validate_value(value):, so the regex is not part of the parameters. Therefore, the function must be implementing a validation based on a regex that's not provided.

This is a problem. Without knowing the regex, I can't implement the function. However, perhaps the user intended to include the regex in the problem but forgot. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate the value against a regex that's part of the problem, but the user hasn't provided it.

Given that, perhaps the user expects me to generate a generic validator with a default regex. For example, maybe the function is supposed to validate if the value is a string, but that's not clear.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should include a default regex.

For example, let's assume that the regex is for checking if the value is a valid email address. So the code would be:

import re

def validate_value(value):
    regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    if not re.match(regex, value):
        raise ValueError("Invalid value")
    return True

But the user's docstring says "Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression." So the function is supposed to validate the value against a regex, but the regex is not provided. Therefore, the code must include a regex.

But since the user hasn't provided the regex, perhaps the code should be a generic function that uses a default regex. However, the user's problem statement is incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate the value against a regex that's part of the problem, but the user forgot to include it. Therefore, the code must be a placeholder.

But given that, I need to proceed. Let me assume that the regex is for checking if the value is a valid email address. So the code would be as above.

So, the final code would be:

import re

def validate_value(value):
    """
    Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression.
    """
    regex = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    if not re.match(regex, value):
        raise ValueError("Invalid value")
    return True

But the user's docstring says "Validate the given value against the corresponding regular expression." So the function is supposed to validate the value against a regex, but the regex is not provided. Therefore, the code is incomplete. However, since the user hasn't provided the regex, I have to proceed with a sample one.

Therefore, the code is as above.
