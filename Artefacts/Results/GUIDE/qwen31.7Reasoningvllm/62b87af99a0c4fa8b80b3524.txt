Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_run_el based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is supposed to check if the given object's class has a run method. So, the goal is to determine whether the class of the object (obj) has a method named 'run'.

First, I need to think about how to check if a class has a specific method. In Python, you can check if a method exists in a class by using the hasattr() function. But wait, hasattr checks if the object has the attribute, not the method. Oh right, because hasattr checks for attributes, not methods. So, to check if a class has a method, I should use the inspect module's getattr function or check the __dict__ of the class.

Alternatively, maybe using the hasattr() function with the class itself. Wait, no. Let me think: if I have an object, say obj, and I want to check if its class has a run method. So, for example, if obj is an instance of a class that has a run method, then hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run') would return True.

Yes, that's correct. So the function is_run_el should check if the class of obj has a run method.

So the code would be something like:

def is_run_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run')

But wait, what if the class doesn't have a run method? Then it returns False. That's exactly what the function is supposed to do.

Now, I need to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function checks if the obj class has the run method. So the code is straightforward.

But I should also consider edge cases. For example, if obj is None, then obj.__class__ would be type(None), which might not have a run method. But the function is supposed to check the class, so even if obj is None, it would check the class of None, which is type, which might not have a run method. So the function would return False in that case.

So the code is as simple as using hasattr on the class of obj with the name 'run'.

Therefore, the generated code is:

def is_run_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the run method.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run')

Wait, but the docstring is given as part of the function definition. So the code should include the docstring. But in Python, the docstring is part of the function definition. So the code would be:

def is_run_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the run method.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'run')

Yes, that's correct. So the code is as above. The user wants the code generated, so I just need to output that.
