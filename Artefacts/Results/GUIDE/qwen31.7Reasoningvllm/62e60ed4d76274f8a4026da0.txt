Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called keys and is part of a class. The docstring says it returns the __keys property as a list.

First, I need to figure out what the __keys property is. Since it's a property, it's probably a list that's being accessed via getter and setter. But the function keys() is supposed to return it as a list. So the function just needs to return the __keys attribute.

Wait, but in Python, properties are usually accessed with dot notation. So if the class has a property called __keys, then the keys() method would return that. But the function is named keys, so maybe the class has a method named keys that returns the __keys property.

But the docstring says it returns the __keys property as a list. So the function keys() should return the __keys attribute. But how is __keys stored? Maybe it's a list that's being managed by the class's __keys property.

Wait, perhaps the __keys is a property that's being accessed via the keys() method. So the keys() method returns the value of the __keys property. But in Python, properties are typically accessed with .keys, so the method would return the value of the property.

But the function is named keys, so maybe the class has a method named keys that returns the __keys property. So the code would be something like:

def keys(self):
    return self.__keys

But then, the __keys would need to be a property. Wait, maybe the __keys is a property that's being accessed via the keys() method. So the class would have a property called __keys, and the keys() method returns that.

But the problem is that the function is named keys, and the docstring says it returns the __keys property as a list. So the code would be straightforward: the keys() method returns the __keys attribute.

But how is __keys stored? Maybe it's a list that's being managed by the class. For example, if the class has a __keys property, then the keys() method would return that.

But the user hasn't provided any class definition, so I need to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring.

So the function keys() returns a list. The docstring says it returns the __keys property as a list. So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    """Returns the __keys property of a class as a List"""
    return self.__keys

But wait, the __keys is a property. So maybe the class has a property called __keys, and the keys() method returns that. But in Python, properties are accessed with .__keys, so the method would return the value of the property.

But the function is named keys, so perhaps the class has a method named keys that returns the __keys property. So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    """Returns the __keys property of a class as a List"""
    return self.__keys

But the __keys is a property, so maybe it's stored as a list. However, the user hasn't provided any class definition, so the code just returns self.__keys.

But the problem is that the __keys is a property, so the code would need to have that property defined. But since the user hasn't provided that, the code just returns the __keys attribute.

So the generated code would be the function keys() that returns self.__keys. But the docstring is as given.

So the answer is the code for the keys() method that returns self.__keys, with the docstring as specified.
