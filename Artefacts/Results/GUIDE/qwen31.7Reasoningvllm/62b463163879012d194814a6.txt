Okay, I need to write a Python function called files_list_from_zipfile that takes a zip path and returns the list of files inside it. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that Python has a library called zipfile that can handle zip files. So I'll need to import that. The function should open the zip file, iterate through its contents, and collect the filenames.

Wait, but how do I handle the zip file? Maybe using the ZipFile class from the zipfile module. So the steps would be: open the zip file, get the list of files, then return that list.

But wait, what about the path? The zip_path is the path to the zip file. So the function will open that file, read its contents, and list the files.

But I need to make sure that the zip file is properly opened. Also, I should handle possible exceptions, but the docstring doesn't mention handling errors. The user probably expects a simple function that returns the list of files, maybe assuming the zip file is valid and accessible.

So the code would be something like:

import zipfile

def files_list_from_zipfile(zip_path):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_file:
        return zip_file.namelist()

Wait, but what if the zip file is not accessible? Well, the function is supposed to return the list, but maybe the user expects to handle errors. However, the docstring doesn't mention error handling, so maybe the function just returns the list as is, and the caller is responsible for handling any exceptions.

So the code would be as above. Let me test this in my mind. If the zip file is valid, then zip_file.namelist() returns a list of filenames. That's correct.

So the final code is importing zipfile, opening the zip file in read mode, then returning the namelist.
