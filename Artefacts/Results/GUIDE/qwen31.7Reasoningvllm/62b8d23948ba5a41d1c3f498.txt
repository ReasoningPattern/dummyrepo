Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the lru_cache decorator based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is called lru_cache and takes two parameters: maxsize (default 128) and typed (default False). The docstring explains that it's a decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable using the LRU algorithm.

First, I need to create a decorator that caches function results. The standard way to do this in Python is using the functools.lru_cache decorator, but since the user wants me to generate the code from scratch, I need to implement it manually.

Wait, but the user is asking for the code generation, not the existing decorator. So I need to write the decorator that implements the LRU cache.

Let me think about how to structure this. The decorator will need to track the function's arguments and the results. The LRU algorithm requires that the least recently used items are evicted when the cache is full.

So, the decorator will need to:

1. Track the function's arguments and the results.
2. Use a dictionary to store the cached results.
3. Maintain a order of usage to determine which items to evict.

But how to implement the LRU algorithm? The standard approach is to use a recent used order, and when the cache is full, evict the least recently used item.

So, the decorator will need to:

- Have a cache (a dictionary) that stores the function's results.
- Keep track of the order of calls to determine the least recently used.
- When a function is called, update the cache and manage the eviction.

But implementing this from scratch might be complex. Let me think about the steps.

The decorator will need to have a closure that holds the function, the maxsize, and the typed parameter. Then, for each call to the decorated function, it will check if the result is in the cache. If not, compute it and store it. If the cache is full, evict the least recently used.

But how to track the order of usage? One approach is to use a list to track the arguments, and when a function is called, append the arguments to the list. Then, when evicting, remove the oldest element.

Wait, but the LRU algorithm requires that the least recently used is evicted. So, when a new item is added, the oldest one is removed. So, the list can be maintained in order, and when a new item is added, the oldest is removed if the cache is full.

Alternatively, using a dictionary with a timestamp or a counter to track the order.

But for simplicity, maybe using a list to track the arguments, and when a new call is made, append the arguments to the list. Then, when evicting, remove the first element (the oldest).

But then, the function's arguments are stored in the list, and the cache is a dictionary mapping the key (the arguments) to the result.

Wait, but the function's arguments can be of different types. For example, if the function is called with multiple arguments, the key would be the tuple of arguments. So, the cache key is the tuple of arguments.

So, the decorator will need to generate a key based on the function's arguments. For example, if the function is f(a, b), then the key is (a, b).

So, the steps for the decorator:

1. Define the decorator function, which takes the function and the parameters maxsize and typed.
2. Inside the decorator, create a cache (a dictionary) and a list to track the order of calls.
3. For each call to the decorated function, generate the key from the arguments.
4. Check if the key is in the cache. If not, compute the result and store it in the cache.
5. If the cache is full, evict the least recently used item (the first element in the list).
6. Return the computed result.

But how to handle the cache and the order? Let's think.

The cache is a dictionary where the keys are the arguments (tuple), and the values are the results. The list tracks the order of calls, so that when a new call is made, the oldest is removed.

Wait, but the list would need to track the order of the arguments. For example, when a function is called with arguments (a, b), then the list would have (a, b). Then, when the function is called again with (a, c), the list would have (a, b), then (a, c). The oldest is the first element.

So, when a new call is made, the arguments are added to the list, and the cache is updated. When the cache is full, the first element in the list is removed from the cache.

But this approach might not be efficient for large maxsize, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable.

So, the code structure would be:

def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # Implement the cache here
        pass
    return decorator

But then, the decorator needs to handle the cache and the order.

Wait, but the user wants the code to be generated, so I need to write the actual code.

Let me outline the code:

The decorator will have a cache (a dictionary) and a list (or something similar) to track the order of calls.

But how to manage the cache and the order. Let's think.

The decorator will need to:

- For each call to the function, generate the key (arguments) and check if it's in the cache.
- If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and add the key to the list.
- If the cache is full, remove the first element from the list and the corresponding key from the cache.

But how to handle the list. For example, when a function is called, the arguments are added to the list. Then, when the cache is full, the first element (oldest) is removed.

But the list is maintained in the order of the calls. So, each time a function is called, the arguments are added to the list, and the cache is updated.

So, the code for the decorator would be something like:

def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # Cache is a dictionary, and the list tracks the order of calls
        # The list is used to track the order of arguments
        # The cache is a dictionary mapping (args) to results
        # The list is used to track the order of calls
        # But how to manage the cache and the list?

        # For each call to the function, generate the key
        # And manage the cache and the list

        # So, the decorator will have a closure that holds the function, the maxsize, and the typed parameter.

        # But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can use a class inside the decorator.

        # Wait, but the decorator is a function that returns a function. So, perhaps the decorator needs to have some state.

        # So, the decorator will have a cache and a list.

        # Let's think of the decorator as a function that returns a wrapper function.

        # So, the code would be:

        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Generate the key based on the arguments
            # For example, if the function is f(a, b), then the key is (a, b)
            # But how to handle the kwargs? Because the function may have varying numbers of arguments.

            # So, the key is generated by the arguments passed to the function.

            # So, for the arguments, we can create a tuple of the args, and then the kwargs.

            # But how to handle the kwargs? For example, if the function has keyword arguments, then the key is the tuple of the args and the kwargs.

            # Wait, but the key should be the arguments passed to the function. So, for a function with variable arguments, the key is the tuple of all arguments, and for keyword arguments, the tuple of the keyword arguments.

            # So, perhaps the key is generated by the args and kwargs.

            # But how to handle that? For example, if the function is called with *args and **kwargs, then the key is (args, kwargs).

            # But in Python, the *args and **kwargs are passed as a tuple. So, for example, if the function is called with (1, 2, 3) and {'a': 4}, then the key is (1, 2, 3, {'a': 4}).

            # But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the key is generated by the args and kwargs.

            # So, the code would be:

            # Generate the key
            # But how to handle the args and kwargs?

            # Let's assume that the function is called with *args and **kwargs.

            # So, the key is a tuple of args and kwargs. But how to represent that?

            # For example, the key could be a tuple of the args and the kwargs. But for the purpose of the cache, the key is the arguments passed to the function.

            # So, perhaps the key is generated by the args and kwargs.

            # But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the key is the tuple of the args, and the kwargs are ignored. Or perhaps the key is the args and kwargs combined.

            # But this is getting complicated. Let me think of a simple example.

            # Suppose the function is called with arguments (a, b), then the key is (a, b). If the function is called with (a, b, c), then the key is (a, b, c). If the function is called with (a, b) and some kwargs, then the key is (a, b, {'c': 1}).

            # But for the purpose of the cache, the key needs to be unique for each call. So, the key is the arguments passed to the function.

            # So, the code for generating the key would be:

            # key = tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items())

            # But that's not efficient. Alternatively, the key could be a tuple of the args and the kwargs.

            # However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the key is simply the tuple of the args, and the kwargs are ignored. But that's not correct. For example, if the function is called with different kwargs, the key should be different.

            # So, perhaps the key is generated by the args and the kwargs. But how?

            # For example, the key could be a tuple of the args and the kwargs. But in Python, the *args and **kwargs are passed as a tuple. So, for example, if the function is called with *args and **kwargs, then the key is (args, kwargs).

            # But how to represent that in code?

            # Maybe the key is generated by the args and kwargs as a tuple. For example:

            # args_tuple = tuple(args)
            # kwargs_tuple = tuple(kwargs.items())
            # key = (args_tuple, kwargs_tuple)

            # But this would be a tuple of two tuples. However, for the cache, the key needs to be unique. So, this approach would work.

            # So, in the wrapper function, the key is generated as follows:

            args_tuple = tuple(args)
            kwargs_tuple = tuple(kwargs.items())
            key = (args_tuple, kwargs_tuple)

            # Then, check if the key is in the cache.

            # Now, the cache is a dictionary, and the list is a list of tuples (args, kwargs) in the order of calls.

            # Wait, but the list would need to track the order of the calls. So, each time a function is called, the key is added to the list, and the cache is updated.

            # So, the code for the wrapper function would be:

            # Check if the key is in the cache.
            # If not, compute the result, add to the cache, and add to the list.
            # If the cache is full, evict the first element in the list (oldest) and the corresponding key in the cache.

            # But how to manage the cache and the list.

            # So, the decorator will have a cache (a dictionary) and a list (a list of keys in the order of calls).

            # So, inside the decorator, we can have:

            # cache = {}
            # call_order = []

            # But since the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper, the cache and call_order need to be managed within the decorator.

            # So, perhaps the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper, which has access to the cache and call_order.

            # But in Python, closures can access variables from the outer scope. So, the decorator can have a closure that holds the cache and call_order.

            # So, the code for the decorator would be:

            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                # Generate the key
                args_tuple = tuple(args)
                kwargs_tuple = tuple(kwargs.items())
                key = (args_tuple, kwargs_tuple)

                # Check if the key is in the cache
                if key in cache:
                    return cache[key]

                # Compute the result
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                # Store in cache and add to call_order
                cache[key] = result
                call_order.append(key)

                # If the cache is full, evict the first element in call_order
                if len(cache) > maxsize:
                    # Remove the first element from call_order and cache
                    evict_key = call_order.pop(0)
                    del cache[evict_key]

                return result

            # But this is not correct, because the call_order is a list that is maintained within the wrapper function. However, the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper, which is a function that has access to the cache and call_order.

            # Wait, but in Python, the decorator is a function that returns a function. So, the wrapper function is part of the decorator. Therefore, the cache and call_order need to be managed within the decorator.

            # So, the decorator would need to have variables that are accessible to the wrapper function.

            # Therefore, the code would be:

            def decorator(func):
                # Define the cache and call_order inside the decorator
                # But since the decorator is a function, it can't have variables in the outer scope unless they are declared in the outer scope.

                # So, perhaps the decorator is written as follows:

                def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                    # Generate the key
                    args_tuple = tuple(args)

                # However, this approach would have the cache and call_order being redefined each time the decorator is called. Which is not desired. Because the cache and call_order are per-decorator instance.

                # Wait, but the decorator is a function that is called once, and the cache and call_order are created once. So, the code would be:

                # However, this code has a problem: when the decorator is applied to a function, the cache and call_order are created, but the wrapper function is returned. So, the cache and call_order are part of the decorator's scope.

                # But in Python, the variables cache and call_order are in the scope of the decorator function. So, when the decorator is called, the cache and call_order are created, and the wrapper function uses them.

                # However, this approach would not work because the cache and call_order are not part of the wrapper function's scope. They are part of the decorator's scope.

For example, when the decorator is applied to a function, the cache and call_order are created once, and the wrapper function uses them. But when the function is called again, the cache and call_order are still in the decorator's scope.

                # Therefore, the code is correct.

                # But there's another issue: the maxsize parameter. The code currently uses maxsize=128, but the parameter is passed as an argument to the decorator. So, the code would need to handle that.

                # Wait, the function signature is def lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False). So, the decorator function is called with maxsize and typed as parameters. So, the code should handle those parameters.

                # So, the code for the decorator would need to accept maxsize and typed as parameters. But in the current code, the decorator is defined as:

                # So, the maxsize and typed parameters are passed to the decorator function. But in the current code, the decorator function is defined with maxsize=128 and typed=False. But the parameters are passed to the decorator function.

                # Wait, no. The function lru_cache is defined with maxsize and typed as parameters. So, when the decorator is called, it's called as lru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False). So, the decorator function is called with those parameters.

                # But the maxsize and typed parameters are passed to the decorator function. So, the code would need to use them in the wrapper function.

                # However, in the current code, the maxsize and typed parameters are not used. So, the code would need to be modified to use them.

                # For example, the maxsize parameter is used to determine when to evict the least recently used item. The typed parameter is used to determine whether to use the arguments as a tuple or not.

                # Wait, the typed parameter is part of the function signature. So, the decorator needs to handle it. But in the current code, the typed parameter is not used. So, the code needs to be modified.

                # The typed parameter is a boolean that determines whether the arguments are treated as a tuple or not.

If typed is False, then the arguments are treated as individual parameters, and the key is generated as a tuple of the arguments.

                # Wait, but the typed parameter is part of the function signature. So, the code needs to handle it.

                # Wait, but the typed parameter is not used in the code. So, the code needs to be modified to use it.

                # So, the code for the wrapper function would need to generate the key based on the typed parameter.

                # For example, if typed is True, then the key is generated as a tuple of the arguments. If typed is False, then the key is generated as a tuple of the arguments.

                # Wait, but the typed parameter is not used in the code. So, perhaps the code is incomplete.

                # Therefore, the code needs to be modified to use the typed parameter.
