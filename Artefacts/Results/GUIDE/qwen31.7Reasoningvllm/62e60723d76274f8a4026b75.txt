Okay, I need to implement the round_half_to_even function in Python. Let me think about how to approach this. The function is supposed to round a floating-point number to the nearest even number when it's exactly halfway between two options. 

First, I remember that Python's built-in round function does this kind of rounding. But maybe I need to handle cases where the number is exactly halfway between two integers. For example, 0.5 rounds to 0, 1.5 rounds to 2, etc. But wait, the round function in Python rounds to the nearest even number when the number is halfway. Like, 2.5 rounds to 2, 3.5 rounds to 4. So maybe the built-in round function already does this. But the problem says to implement it, so perhaps I should replicate that behavior.

Wait, but the function's docstring says "round a floating-point number". So maybe the user wants a custom implementation. Let me check the standard way to do this.

The standard way to round to the nearest even number is to use the built-in round function. However, there's a catch. For example, when the number is exactly halfway between two integers, the round function rounds to the even one. But in some programming languages, like Python, the round function rounds to the nearest even number when the number is halfway. For example, round(2.5) is 2, round(3.5) is 4. So maybe the built-in round function already does this. But perhaps the user wants a manual implementation.

Wait, but the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "round a floating-point number". So maybe the user expects a custom implementation. However, the built-in round function already does this. But maybe the user wants to handle cases where the number is exactly halfway, but the built-in round function might not handle it correctly in some cases? Or maybe the user wants to ensure that the rounding is done correctly according to the rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to implement the round half to even method, which is the same as the built-in round function. But since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, maybe the code should use the built-in round function. However, the problem might be expecting a different approach.

Wait, let me think again. The function is called round_half_to_even. So maybe the user wants to implement the rounding according to the "round half to even" rule, which is the same as the built-in round function. But perhaps the user wants to implement it manually, for example, by checking if the number is exactly halfway and then rounding to the even digit.

But how to do that? Let me think. For example, if the number is 2.5, it's halfway between 2 and 3. The even number is 2, so it rounds to 2. If the number is 3.5, it's halfway between 3 and 4, so it rounds to 4. But if the number is 2.6, it rounds to 3. So the standard way is to use the built-in round function.

But perhaps the user wants to implement it manually. Let me check.

In Python, the round function does this. For example:

>>> round(2.5)
2
>>> round(3.5)
4
>>> round(2.6)
3

So the built-in round function already implements the round half to even rule. Therefore, maybe the code can just use the built-in round function. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the user expects the code to use the built-in function. But maybe there's a case where the built-in function doesn't work as expected. For example, in some programming languages, the round function might round to the nearest even number, but in Python, it's already done.

But perhaps the user wants to implement it manually. Let me think. How to do that?

One approach is to check if the number is exactly halfway between two integers. For example, if the number is x, then check if x is halfway between floor(x) and ceil(x). If so, then round to the even number. Otherwise, round normally.

But how to implement that?

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the built-in round function. Since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the docstring says "round a floating-point number", then using the built-in round function is acceptable.

But maybe the user wants to implement it manually. For example, in some cases, the built-in round might not work as expected. For example, if the number is 2.5, round(2.5) is 2, which is correct. But if the number is 1.5, round(1.5) is 2, which is correct. So perhaps the built-in round function is sufficient.

Therefore, the code can be as simple as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But wait, let me check some test cases.

Test case 1: n = 2.5 → round(2.5) is 2 → correct.

Test case 2: n = 3.5 → round(3.5) is 4 → correct.

Test case 3: n = 2.1 → round(2.1) is 2 → correct.

Test case 4: n = 2.6 → round(2.6) is 3 → correct.

So the built-in round function seems to handle this correctly. Therefore, the code can be written as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But maybe the user expects a different approach. For example, if the number is exactly halfway, but the built-in round function rounds to the even digit. But in Python, that's exactly what the round function does.

Therefore, the code is straightforward. However, perhaps the user wants to implement it without using the built-in round function. Let me think about that.

For example, another approach is to check if the number is exactly halfway between two integers. If so, round to the even one. Otherwise, round normally.

But how to do that?

Let me think. Let's take the number n. Let's get the integer part and the fractional part.

For example, n = 2.5 → integer part is 2, fractional part is 0.5.

If the fractional part is 0.5, then we need to round to the even integer. So, the even integer is 2 (since 2 is even), so round to 2.

But how to compute that?

Another approach is to use the decimal module. But that might be overkill.

Alternatively, we can use the following steps:

1. Check if the number is exactly halfway between two integers. That is, if the fractional part is 0.5.

2. If so, round to the even integer.

3. Otherwise, round normally.

But how to implement that?

For example, for n = 2.5, the fractional part is 0.5. So, we need to round to the even integer. The even integer is 2, so the result is 2.

For n = 3.5, the fractional part is 0.5. The even integer is 4, so the result is 4.

For n = 2.6, the fractional part is 0.6, so we round to 3.

But how to compute the even integer?

The even integer can be found by taking the integer part and checking if it's even. If it's even, then round to that integer. If it's odd, then round to the next even integer.

But how to do that?

Alternatively, the even integer can be determined by the integer part. For example, if the integer part is even, then the even integer is the same. If it's odd, then the even integer is integer part + 1.

But this is only for the case where the fractional part is 0.5. So, for example, if the number is 2.5, the integer part is 2 (even), so round to 2. If the number is 3.5, the integer part is 3 (odd), so round to 4.

But how to handle this in code?

So, the steps would be:

- Check if the fractional part is 0.5.

- If yes, then round to the even integer.

- Else, round normally.

But how to check if the fractional part is 0.5?

In Python, we can do:

fractional_part = n - math.floor(n)

But for numbers like 2.5, fractional_part is 0.5.

So, for example:

n = 2.5 → fractional_part = 0.5.

So, if fractional_part == 0.5, then we need to round to the even integer.

But how to compute the even integer?

The even integer is the integer part if it's even, else integer part + 1.

But the integer part is math.floor(n).

So, for example:

integer_part = math.floor(n)

if integer_part % 2 == 0:

    round_to = integer_part

else:

    round_to = integer_part + 1

But then, if the fractional part is 0.5, we need to check if the integer part is even. If it is, round to it. Else, round to integer part + 1.

But in this case, the fractional part is 0.5, so the code would round to the even integer.

So, combining these steps:

def round_half_to_even(n):

    import math

    integer_part = math.floor(n)

    fractional_part = n - integer_part

    if fractional_part == 0.5:

        if integer_part % 2 == 0:

            return integer_part

        else:

            return integer_part + 1

    else:

        return round(n)

But wait, this code would handle the case where the fractional part is exactly 0.5. However, what about numbers like 2.5, 3.5, etc.?

Let me test this code.

Test case 1: n = 2.5 → integer_part = 2, fractional_part = 0.5 → integer_part is even → return 2 → correct.

Test case 2: n = 3.5 → integer_part = 3, fractional_part = 0.5 → integer_part is odd → return 4 → correct.

Test case 3: n = 2.6 → fractional_part is 0.6 → else clause → round(n) → 3 → correct.

Test case 4: n = 2.4 → fractional_part is 0.4 → else clause → round(2.4) is 2 → correct.

Test case 5: n = 1.5 → fractional_part is 0.5 → integer_part is 1 (odd) → return 2 → correct.

So this code seems to handle the cases correctly.

But wait, what about numbers like 1.0? The fractional part is 0.0, so the code returns round(n) which is 1.0. Correct.

Another test case: n = 0.5 → returns 0.0? Let's see:

integer_part = 0, fractional_part = 0.5 → integer_part is even → return 0 → correct.

Another test case: n = 0.6 → returns 1.0? No, because the fractional part is 0.6, so the code returns round(0.6) which is 1.0. Correct.

But what about n = -2.5? Let's see:

integer_part = -3 (since math.floor(-2.5) is -3). fractional_part is 0.5. integer_part is -3, which is odd. So return -3 + 1 = -2. So round(-2.5) is -2. Which is correct according to the rules.

So this code seems to handle negative numbers correctly.

But wait, what about n = -2.5? The built-in round function would round to -2, which is correct. So this code would return -2, which is correct.

So this code seems to handle all cases.

But then, the code would need to import math. However, the function is supposed to be self-contained. But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would need to include the import statement.

But in Python, the math module is usually imported at the top. However, in the function, we can use math.floor.

So the code would be:

import math

def round_half_to_even(n):
    integer_part = math.floor(n)
    fractional_part = n - integer_part
    if fractional_part == 0.5:
        if integer_part % 2 == 0:
            return integer_part
        else:
            return integer_part + 1
    else:
        return round(n)

But wait, what about when the fractional part is exactly 0.5 but the integer part is even? For example, 2.5 → returns 2, which is correct.

But what if the fractional part is 0.5 and the integer part is even? Then return integer_part. Otherwise, return integer_part + 1.

But in the code, the condition is if fractional_part == 0.5, then check if integer_part is even. If yes, return integer_part. Else, return integer_part + 1.

But what if the fractional part is 0.5 but the integer part is even? For example, 2.5 → returns 2. Correct.

But what if the fractional part is 0.5 and the integer part is odd? Like 3.5 → returns 4. Correct.

So this code should handle all cases.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "round a floating-point number". So the code would be as above.

But the problem may expect the use of the built-in round function. However, the code above is a manual implementation. But the user may want to see the code that uses the built-in function. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, which may imply that the code should be implemented as per the docstring, not using the built-in function. But the docstring says "round a floating-point number", which is exactly what the built-in round function does. So perhaps the code can be as simple as using the built-in round function.

But then, why would the user want to implement it manually? Maybe the user wants to ensure that the rounding is done according to the specific rules, perhaps for a specific use case. However, in Python, the built-in round function already does this.

But perhaps the user expects the code to use the built-in function. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is def round_half_to_even(n):, and the docstring says "round a floating-point number". So the code can be as simple as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But maybe the user wants to implement it manually. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring is just a description, so the code can be as simple as using the built-in function.

But perhaps the user wants to implement it manually. However, the problem may have a trick. For example, in some cases, the built-in round function may not handle the rounding correctly. But in Python, it does.

So, in conclusion, the code can be written as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But to be thorough, perhaps the code should use the manual approach. However, given that the built-in function already does the required rounding, perhaps the code is as simple as that.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is given, and the docstring is given. So the code can be written as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number to the nearest even number.
    """
    return round(n)

But the docstring is provided. However, the user may expect the code to handle the rounding according to the specific rules. But since the built-in round function does this, the code is correct.

But perhaps the user wants to implement it manually. However, without further information, it's hard to tell. But given that the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the docstring is just a description, the code can be as simple as using the built-in round function.

Therefore, the final code is:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    """
    Round a floating-point number to the nearest even number.
    """
    return round(n)

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check some test cases.

Test case 1: n = 2.5 → round(2.5) is 2 → correct.

Test case 2: n = 3.5 → round(3.5) is 4 → correct.

Test case 3: n = 2.1 → round(2.1) is 2 → correct.

Test case 4: n = 2.6 → round(2.6) is 3 → correct.

Test case 5: n = 0.5 → round(0.5) is 0 → correct.

Test case 6: n = -2.5 → round(-2.5) is -2 → correct.

So the code works for these cases.

Therefore, the code is correct.
