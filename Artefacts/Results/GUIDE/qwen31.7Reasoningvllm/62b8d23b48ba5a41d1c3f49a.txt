Okay, I need to implement the mru_cache decorator in Python. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The function signature is given as def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False), and the docstring describes it as a decorator that wraps a function with a memoizing callable using an MRU algorithm. 

First, I remember that memoization usually uses a dictionary to store the results. But since it's MRU, the least recently used item is evicted when the maxsize is exceeded. Also, the typed parameter might indicate whether the keys are typed (like strings) or not. Wait, the docstring says "based on a Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm." So the decorator should track the order of usage.

Let me think about the steps. The decorator needs to track the function's arguments. For MRU, the order of the arguments matters. So when a function is called with certain arguments, the decorator should store them in a way that the most recently used is kept, and the least is evicted if needed.

Wait, but how does the MRU work with function arguments? For example, if a function is called with different parameters, each call is a new entry. So the MRU cache would store each call's arguments in the order they were used. So the first call is the most recent, then the next, etc. When the maxsize is reached, the oldest entry is removed.

But how to implement this. Let's think about the structure. The decorator needs to track the function's calls. So perhaps the decorator will have a cache that's a dictionary, and each time the function is called, the arguments are added to the cache, and the order is maintained.

Wait, but for MRU, the order of the arguments in the cache should be the order in which they were used. So each time the function is called, the arguments are added to the cache, and the last one is the most recent. So the cache would be a list, where each entry is the arguments passed to the function. Then, when the maxsize is reached, the oldest entry is removed.

But how to handle the arguments. For example, if the function is called with parameters (a, b), then the next call with (a, c) would have the second argument as the most recent. So the cache would store the arguments in the order of their usage.

So the decorator would need to track the arguments passed to the function. So each time the function is called, the arguments are added to the cache, and the last one is the most recent. When the cache exceeds maxsize, the oldest entry is removed.

But how to implement this in Python. Let's think about the decorator. The decorator will need to have a cache, which is a dictionary. The function will be decorated with this decorator, and the decorator will manage the cache.

Wait, but the decorator is a function that takes maxsize and typed as parameters. So the decorator function will need to handle these parameters.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create a cache that is a dictionary. The keys are the arguments passed to the function, and the values are the return values.

But wait, the MRU cache needs to track the order of the arguments. So perhaps the cache is a list, where each element is a tuple of the arguments. Then, when the function is called, the arguments are added to the list, and the last one is the most recent. When the maxsize is exceeded, the oldest entry is removed.

But how to handle the arguments. For example, if the function is called with parameters (a, b), then the next call with (a, c) would have the second argument as the most recent. So the cache would store (a, b) and (a, c), with the latter being the most recent.

But how to represent the arguments in the cache. The arguments can be converted to a tuple, so that they can be stored as keys. However, if the function is called with different parameters, the tuple is unique.

So, the cache would be a dictionary where the keys are tuples of the arguments, and the values are the return values.

But then, when the function is called again with the same arguments, the cache will return the stored value. Otherwise, it will add the new arguments to the cache.

But how to manage the order. For example, each time the function is called, the arguments are added to the cache, and the last one is the most recent. So the cache is a list of tuples, and each time a new call is made, the new tuple is added to the end of the list. Then, when the maxsize is exceeded, the first element (oldest) is removed.

Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the MRU algorithm evicts the least recently used item. So, the first element in the list would be the least recently used. So, when the maxsize is exceeded, we remove the first element.

But how to track the order. For example, if the function is called three times with arguments (a, b), (a, c), (a, d), then the cache would have these three entries. The first entry is (a, b), then (a, c), then (a, d). When the maxsize is 2, the oldest entry (a, b) is removed, and the next call would add (a, c) and (a, d) would be the new entries.

But how to manage the order. The list would be in the order of the calls. So, when a new call is made, the new tuple is added to the end. Then, when the maxsize is exceeded, the first element is removed.

But this approach would work. So the cache is a list, and each time a function is called, the arguments are added to the list, and the last one is the most recent. When the list's length exceeds maxsize, the first element is removed.

But then, the cache is a list of tuples. So, for each call to the function, the arguments are converted to a tuple and added to the list. The value is the return value of the function.

But how to handle the typed parameter. The docstring says that typed=False. So perhaps if typed is True, the keys are strings, and if False, they are tuples. Wait, but the function's arguments are passed as parameters, so the typed parameter might affect how the arguments are stored. For example, if typed is True, then the arguments are converted to strings, and the keys are strings. But I'm not sure. Maybe the typed parameter is a boolean that determines whether the arguments are stored as tuples or as strings. Or perhaps it's a flag indicating whether the keys are typed (like strings) or not. But the docstring is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the typed parameter is a boolean that determines whether the arguments are stored as tuples or as strings. For example, if typed is True, then the arguments are converted to strings, and the keys are strings. But I need to check the docstring again.

The docstring says: "saves up to `maxsize` results based on a Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm." So the key is the arguments passed to the function. The typed parameter might indicate whether the keys are typed (like strings) or not. But I'm not sure. Maybe the typed parameter is a boolean that determines whether the arguments are stored as tuples or as strings. For example, if typed is True, then the arguments are converted to strings, and the keys are strings. But I need to think about how to implement this.

Alternatively, perhaps the typed parameter is a boolean that determines whether the arguments are stored as tuples or as strings. For example, if typed is True, then the arguments are stored as tuples, and if False, as strings. But this is unclear.

Wait, the function is a decorator. So the decorator will be applied to a function. The decorated function's arguments are passed to the decorator. So, the decorator needs to handle the arguments passed to the function. So, the typed parameter might be a boolean that determines whether the arguments are stored as tuples or as strings. For example, if typed is True, then the arguments are stored as tuples, and if False, as strings. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the typed parameter is a boolean that indicates whether the keys are typed (like strings) or not. For example, if typed is True, then the keys are strings, and if False, they are tuples. But this is unclear.

But given that the docstring says "typed=False", perhaps the default is that the keys are tuples. So, the decorator will store the arguments as tuples. So, when the function is called with parameters (a, b), the key is (a, b), and when called again with (a, c), the key is (a, c). So, the cache is a list of tuples, and the order is maintained.

So, the steps for the decorator:

1. The decorator will have a cache, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the arguments passed to the function.

2. Each time the function is called, the arguments are converted to a tuple, and added to the cache list.

3. The cache is managed such that when the length exceeds maxsize, the oldest entry (first in the list) is removed.

4. The function's return value is stored in the cache, and when the function is called again with the same arguments, the cached value is returned.

But how to handle the cache. The decorator will need to have a way to track the cache. So, the decorator will have a cache that is a list, and each time the function is called, the arguments are added to the list, and the value is stored.

But how to implement this in Python. Let's think about the decorator.

The decorator function will need to have a cache. So, the decorator can be implemented as a function that takes the original function as an argument, and then wraps it.

So, the code structure would be:

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # implement the cache here
        pass
    return decorator

But then, the decorator needs to manage the cache. So, inside the decorator, we need to have a cache that is a list of tuples, and a way to track the function's return values.

Wait, but the cache is a list of tuples, and each tuple is the arguments passed to the function. The value is the return value of the function. So, the cache can be a dictionary where the keys are the tuples, and the values are the return values. But then, when the function is called again with the same arguments, the value is retrieved from the dictionary.

But how to manage the order. For example, when the function is called multiple times with different arguments, the cache is a dictionary with keys as the tuples. The order of the arguments in the cache is not important, except that when the maxsize is exceeded, the oldest entry is removed.

Wait, but the MRU algorithm requires that the least recently used item is evicted. So, the cache should be a list where each element is the arguments passed to the function, and the order is the order of usage. So, when the function is called, the new arguments are added to the end of the list, and when the maxsize is exceeded, the first element is removed.

But how to track the order. So, the cache is a list of tuples, and each time the function is called, the new tuple is added to the end. Then, when the list's length exceeds maxsize, the first element is removed.

But then, the cache is a list, and the function's return value is stored in the cache. However, the cache is a list, so the values are not stored. Wait, perhaps the cache is a dictionary where the keys are the tuples, and the values are the return values. But then, how to track the order.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again.

The MRU cache is a cache that stores the results of function calls. Each time the function is called, the arguments are stored in the cache, and the most recently used is kept. So, for example, if the function is called three times with arguments (a, b), (a, c), (a, d), then the cache will have these three entries. The first entry is (a, b), the second is (a, c), the third is (a, d). When the maxsize is 2, the first entry (a, b) is evicted, and the next call would add (a, c) and (a, d) would be the new entries.

But how to manage the order. The cache is a list of tuples, and each time a new call is made, the new tuple is added to the end. When the maxsize is exceeded, the first element is removed.

So, the cache is a list, and each time the function is called, the arguments are added to the list. Then, when the list's length exceeds maxsize, the first element is removed.

But then, the cache is a list, and the values are stored in the dictionary. So, the decorator will need to have a cache that is a dictionary, and a list of tuples.

Alternatively, the cache can be a dictionary where the keys are the tuples, and the values are the return values. But then, how to track the order. The order is determined by the order in which the arguments were used. So, the first time the function is called with (a, b), the key (a, b) is added to the dictionary. The next call with (a, c) adds (a, c) to the dictionary. When the maxsize is exceeded, the oldest entry (a, b) is removed.

But how to track the oldest entry. The oldest entry is the one that was added first. So, the dictionary can have the keys as the tuples, and the values as the return values. But the order in which the keys are stored in the dictionary is not important. However, when the maxsize is exceeded, the first key added (the oldest) is removed.

But in Python, dictionaries do not maintain insertion order. So, if the maxsize is 2, and the first two calls are (a, b) and (a, c), then when the third call is made, the first entry (a, b) is removed. But if the maxsize is 1, then only the latest entry is kept.

So, the decorator needs to track the order of the arguments. Therefore, the cache is a list of tuples, and each time a new call is made, the new tuple is added to the end. When the list's length exceeds maxsize, the first element is removed.

But then, the dictionary is not needed. The cache is a list of tuples, and the value is stored in the function's return. So, the decorator can be implemented as follows:

The decorator will have a cache that is a list. Each time the function is called, the arguments are converted to a tuple, and added to the list. The value is stored in the function's return. But how to store the value. Wait, the function's return value is stored in the cache. So, the cache is a list of tuples, and the value is stored in the function's return. But how to track that.

Alternatively, the decorator can have a cache that is a dictionary, where the keys are the tuples, and the values are the return values. Then, when the function is called, the new tuple is added to the dictionary, and the value is stored. When the maxsize is exceeded, the oldest entry (the one added first) is removed.

But how to track the oldest entry. The oldest entry is the one that was added first. So, the decorator can keep track of the order in which the tuples were added. For example, the cache is a list, and each time a new tuple is added, it's appended to the list. Then, when the list's length exceeds maxsize, the first element is removed.

But then, the dictionary is not needed. The dictionary can be a separate structure, but perhaps the list is sufficient. However, the dictionary is needed to store the return values.

So, the steps for the decorator:

- The decorator will have a cache that is a list of tuples (arguments), and a dictionary that maps tuples to return values.

- Each time the function is called, the arguments are converted to a tuple, and added to the list. The return value is stored in the dictionary.

- When the list's length exceeds maxsize, the first element is removed from the list, and the corresponding entry in the dictionary is also removed.

But how to handle the case where the same arguments are called again. The dictionary will have the key as the tuple, and the value is the return value. So, when the function is called again with the same arguments, the dictionary will return the stored value.

So, the code for the decorator would be:

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # Cache is a list of tuples (arguments) and a dictionary of (tuple -> value)
        cache = []
        cache_dict = {}
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Convert args to a tuple
            key = tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items())
            # Check if the key is in the cache
            if key in cache_dict:
                # Return the cached value
                return cache_dict[key]
            # Otherwise, add to the cache and dictionary
            # Check if the cache is full
            if len(cache) >= maxsize:
                # Remove the first element (oldest)
                removed = cache.pop(0)
                del cache_dict[removed]
            # Add the new key to the cache and dictionary
            cache.append(key)
            cache_dict[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return cache_dict[key]
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but this code has a problem. The key is generated as tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items()). But the kwargs.items() returns a list of (key, value) pairs. So, when we convert that to a tuple, it's a tuple of tuples. So, the key is a tuple of the args and the kwargs. But this might not be correct. For example, if the function has keyword arguments, the key should include those. However, the way the key is generated here is by converting args to a tuple and then adding the kwargs as a tuple of tuples. But this may not be the correct way to represent the arguments.

Alternatively, the key should be the args and the kwargs. So, the key is a tuple that includes all the arguments passed to the function. For example, if the function is called with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 1}, then the key is (a, b, ('c', 1)).

But how to generate that. The args are converted to a tuple, and the kwargs are converted to a tuple of tuples. So, the key is (tuple(args), tuple(kwargs.items())).

But in the code above, the key is generated as tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items()). Which would be a tuple of the args and the kwargs as a tuple of tuples. So, that's correct.

But then, when the function is called again with the same args and kwargs, the key is the same, and the cached value is returned.

But there's another problem. The code above uses the same key for both the args and the kwargs. However, the function's arguments are passed as *args and **kwargs. So, the key should include all the arguments, regardless of whether they are positional or keyword.

But the code above seems to handle that.

However, there's a problem with the way the key is generated. For example, if the function is called with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 1}, then the key is (a, b, ('c', 1)). But if the function is called again with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 2}, then the key is (a, b, ('c', 2)), which is correct.

But the code as written would generate the key correctly.

But then, the code for the wrapper function is:

def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    key = tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items())
    if key in cache_dict:
        return cache_dict[key]
    if len(cache) >= maxsize:
        removed = cache.pop(0)
        del cache_dict[removed]
    cache.append(key)
    cache_dict[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
    return cache_dict[key]

But this code has a problem. The key is generated as tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items()), which is a tuple of the args and the kwargs. However, the args are passed as *args, which is a tuple of the positional arguments. The kwargs.items() is a list of (key, value) pairs, which when converted to a tuple, becomes a tuple of tuples. So, the key is a tuple of the args and the kwargs.

But when the function is called again with the same args and kwargs, the key is the same, and the cached value is returned.

But there's another issue. The code uses the same key for both the args and the kwargs. However, if the function is called with different kwargs, the key would be different. So, that's correct.

But the code also has the typed parameter. The docstring says that typed=False. So, perhaps the typed parameter is a boolean that determines whether the arguments are stored as tuples or as strings. For example, if typed is True, then the arguments are converted to strings, and the keys are strings. But how to implement that.

Wait, the docstring says that the typed parameter is a boolean. So, perhaps the code needs to handle that. For example, if typed is True, then the arguments are converted to strings, and the keys are strings. But how to do that.

So, the code for the key would be:

if typed:
    key = tuple(str(arg) for arg in args) + tuple(str(k) + '=' + str(v) for k, v in kwargs.items())
else:
    key = tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items())

But this is getting complicated. The typed parameter is a boolean that determines whether the arguments are stored as tuples or as strings. However, the function's arguments are passed as *args and **kwargs, which are tuples and dictionaries. So, the code needs to handle the typed parameter.

But the problem is that the docstring is not clear on what the typed parameter does. However, given that the user provided the docstring, I need to implement the decorator according to that.

Assuming that the typed parameter is a boolean that determines whether the arguments are stored as tuples or as strings. For example, if typed is True, then the arguments are converted to strings, and the keys are strings. But how to do that.

So, the code would need to generate the key as follows:

if typed:
    key = tuple(str(arg) for arg in args) + tuple(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in kwargs.items())
else:
    key = tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items())

But this is just an assumption. However, the user's docstring says that the typed parameter is a boolean, so the code needs to handle that.

But the original code I wrote earlier doesn't include the typed parameter. So, perhaps the code needs to be adjusted to handle the typed parameter.

But the original problem is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. The user provided the function signature and docstring, and the task is to generate the code.

So, the code must include the typed parameter in the decorator.

So, the code for the decorator would need to handle the typed parameter. So, the code would be:

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # Cache is a list of tuples (arguments) and a dictionary of (tuple -> value)
        cache = []
        cache_dict = {}
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Determine the key based on typed parameter
            if typed:
                # Convert args to strings and kwargs to strings
                key_args = tuple(str(arg) for arg in args)
                key_kwargs = tuple(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in kwargs.items())
                key = key_args + key_kwargs
            else:
                # Use the original args and kwargs as tuples
                key = tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items())
            # Check if the key is in the cache
            if key in cache_dict:
                # Return the cached value
                return cache_dict[key]
            # Otherwise, add to the cache and dictionary
            # Check if the cache is full
            if len(cache) >= maxsize:
                # Remove the first element (oldest)
                removed = cache.pop(0)
                del cache_dict[removed]
            # Add the new key to the cache and dictionary
            cache.append(key)
            cache_dict[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return cache_dict[key]
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the code for the key is generating the key as a tuple of the args and kwargs. However, when typed is True, the args are converted to strings, and the kwargs are converted to strings. But the code for the key is correct.

But there's another issue: when the function is called with the same args and kwargs, the key is the same, and the cached value is returned.

But the problem is that the cache is a list of tuples, and the cache_dict is a dictionary mapping tuples to values. So, when the function is called again with the same args and kwargs, the key is the same, and the cached value is returned.

But in the code above, the key is generated as a tuple, and the cache_dict is a dictionary that maps tuples to values. So, this should work.

But there's another problem. The code uses the same key for both the args and the kwargs. However, if the function is called with different kwargs, the key will be different. So, that's correct.

But what about the case where the function is called with the same args and kwargs, but different order? For example, if the function is called with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 1}, then the key is (a, b, ('c', 1)). If called again with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 2}, the key is (a, b, ('c', 2)), which is correct.

So, the code seems to handle that.

But there's another issue: the cache is a list of tuples, and when the maxsize is exceeded, the first element is removed. However, the cache_dict is a dictionary that maps the keys to the return values. So, when the first element is removed from the cache, the corresponding entry in the cache_dict is also removed.

This should work.

But there's another problem. The code uses the same key for both the args and the kwargs. However, when the function is called with the same args and kwargs, the key is the same, and the cached value is returned.

But what if the function is called with the same args and kwargs but different order? For example, if the function is called with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 1}, then the key is (a, b, ('c', 1)). If called again with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 1}, the key is the same, and the cached value is returned.

So, this should work.

But the code as written may have a problem with the way the key is generated. For example, when the function is called with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 1}, the key is (a, b, ('c', 1)). But when the function is called again with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 2}, the key is (a, b, ('c', 2)), which is correct.

So, the code seems to handle that.

But what about the case where the function is called with the same args and kwargs but different order? For example, if the function is called with args (a, b) and kwargs {'c': 1}, then the key is (a, b, ('c', 1)). If called again with args (b, a) and kwargs {'c': 1}, the key is (b, a, ('c', 1)), which is different. So, the cache will store that as a new entry.

So, this should work.

Now, the code needs to handle the typed parameter. The code above includes that.

But there's another issue: the code uses the same key for both the args and the kwargs. However, if the function is called with the same args and kwargs, but different order, the key is different. So, the cache will store each unique key.

So, the code seems to handle that.

But there's another problem. The code uses the same key for both the args and the kwargs. However, the code for the key is generated as tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items()). But in Python, the tuple of kwargs.items() is a tuple of tuples. So, the key is a tuple of the args and the kwargs as tuples.

But when the function is called with the same args and kwargs, the key is the same, and the cached value is returned.

So, the code should work.

But there's another issue: when the function is called with the same args and kwargs, but the kwargs are different, the key is different. So, the cache will store each unique key.

So, the code seems correct.

Now, the code needs to be written in Python markdown format, with the code generated. The user wants the code generated, and only the code, not the explanation.

So, the final code would be:

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):

But the code needs to be in Python markdown format, which is the code block. So, the final code is:

```python
def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
	"""
	Decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves
	up to `maxsize` results based on a Most Recently Used (MRU)
	algorithm.
	"""
	def decorator(func):
		cache = []
		cache_dict = {}
		def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
			if typed:
				key_args = tuple(str(arg) for arg in args)
				key_kwargs = tuple(f"{k}={v}" for k, v in kwargs.items())
				key = key_args + key_kwargs
			else:
				key = tuple(args) + tuple(kwargs.items())
			if key in cache_dict:
				return cache_dict[key]
			if len(cache) >= maxsize:
				removed = cache.pop(0)
				del cache_dict[removed]
			cache.append(key)
			cache_dict[key] = func(*args, **kwargs)
			return cache_dict[key]
		return wrapper
	return decorator
```

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check for possible errors.

- The code uses the typed parameter to determine how to generate the key. If typed is True, the args are converted to strings, and the kwargs are converted to strings. The key is the concatenation of these two parts.

- The cache is a list of tuples, and the cache_dict is a dictionary mapping tuples to return values.

- When the function is called again with the same args and kwargs, the key is the same, and the cached value is returned.

- When the cache exceeds maxsize, the oldest entry (first in the list) is removed.

- The code handles the case where the function is called with different args and kwargs.

This should work.

Another possible issue: when the maxsize is 0, the cache is empty. But the code handles that by checking len(cache) >= maxsize, which would be False, so no removal occurs.

So, the code should be correct.
