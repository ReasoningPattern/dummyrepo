Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called test_tag, which takes a string 'tag' and returns a boolean. The docstring says that it checks if each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag. If any character is in the tag, returns False; else True.

Wait, but the problem statement mentions LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, but the function doesn't have that as an argument. Oh, right, the function is supposed to be implemented based on the given docstring. Wait, the user provided the docstring, but the function's parameters are 'tag: str' and returns a bool. So the function is supposed to check if each character in some predefined set (LEEGL_TAG_CHARS) is in the tag. But the function's parameters don't include that set. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, looking back at the user's message: the function is defined as def test_tag(tag: str) -> bool, and the docstring says "Checks whether each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag." But the function doesn't have LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS as an argument. So how is this possible? Unless the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a constant in the code, but the function is supposed to be written based on the given docstring.

Wait, maybe the user is expecting that the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a predefined set of allowed characters, and the function test_tag checks if all characters in the tag are in that set. But the function's parameters don't include that set. So perhaps the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a global variable or a constant in the code, and the function is supposed to check if each character in the tag is in that set.

But the problem is that the function's code isn't provided. The user wants me to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must include the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS as a constant, and the test_tag function checks if all characters in the tag are in that set.

Wait, but the docstring says "If any character belongs to a tag, the value False is returned. Otherwise, the value True is returned." So the function is checking if any character in the tag is in the allowed set. Wait, no. Wait, the docstring says that if any character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag, then return False. Wait, that's confusing. Let me re-read the docstring.

The docstring says: "Checks whether each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag. If any character belongs to a tag, the value False is returned. Otherwise, the value True is returned."

Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it. The function is checking if each character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag. If any of them is in the tag, return False. Otherwise, return True.

Wait, but that would mean that the function is checking if any character in the allowed set (LEEGL_TAG_CHARS) is present in the tag. If so, return False. Otherwise, True.

But that's the opposite of what the docstring says. Let me rephrase: The function test_tag is supposed to return True if all characters in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS are not in the tag. Otherwise, return False. So the function is checking if the tag contains any of the allowed characters. If it does, return False; else True.

But the docstring says "If any character belongs to a tag, the value False is returned." So that would mean that if any character in the tag is in the allowed set, return False. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me think again.

The function's purpose is to check whether each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to check if the tag contains any of the characters from LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. If it does, return False; else True.

But the docstring is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it again.

Original docstring: "Checks whether each character in the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag. If any character belongs to a tag, the value False is returned. Otherwise, the value True is returned."

So, the function is checking if each character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag. If any of them is in the tag, return False. Otherwise, return True.

Wait, that would mean that the function returns True only if all characters in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS are not in the tag. So, the function is checking if the tag does not contain any of the allowed characters. If it does, return False; else True.

But the way the docstring is written, it's a bit confusing. Let me think of an example. Suppose LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is {'a', 'b'}, and the tag is 'ab'. Then, each character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is in the tag. So the function returns False. If the tag is 'cd', then the function returns True.

So the function is checking if the tag contains any of the allowed characters. If yes, return False; else True.

So the code for test_tag would be:

def test_tag(tag: str) -> bool:
    allowed = LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS
    for char in allowed:
        if char in tag:
            return False
    return True

But the problem is that the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is not defined in the code. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must include the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS as a constant.

But the user hasn't provided that. So perhaps the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS is a predefined set of allowed characters. For example, maybe it's {'a', 'b', 'c'}, but the user hasn't specified. However, since the function is supposed to be generated based on the docstring, the code must include the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS as a constant.

But in the code, how is that handled? The user's code would need to have that constant defined. However, since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code is supposed to have that constant as a global variable.

So, the code would be:

LEEGL_TAG_CHARS = {'a', 'b', 'c'}  # Example, but actual value depends on the problem

def test_tag(tag: str) -> bool:
    allowed = LEEGL_TAG_CHARS
    for char in allowed:
        if char in tag:
            return False
    return True

But the problem is that the user's function signature doesn't include LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS. However, the function is supposed to be generated based on the docstring. So the code must include that constant.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code must include the LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS as a constant.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual value of LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS, perhaps it's a placeholder. However, in the code, it's necessary to have that constant.

So the final code would be:

LEEGL_TAG_CHARS = {'a', 'b', 'c'}  # Assuming this is the allowed characters

def test_tag(tag: str) -> bool:
    allowed = LEEGL_TAG_CHARS
    for char in allowed:
        if char in tag:
            return False
    return True

But the user's docstring says that the function checks if each character in LEEGAL_TAG_CHARS belongs to a tag. So the function is checking if any of the allowed characters are in the tag. If yes, return False; else True.

So the code is correct.

But the user's function signature is def test_tag(tag: str) -> bool. So the code must have that.

Therefore, the generated code would include the LEEGL_TAG_CHARS as a constant, and the test_tag function as described.

So the final answer is the code with those elements.
