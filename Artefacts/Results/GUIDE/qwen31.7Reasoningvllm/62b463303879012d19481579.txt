Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. Let me look at the docstring again. The function is supposed to return possible values of number and sup from the contents of the issue. Hmm, the parameters are just 'issue', which I assume is some data structure. But the docstring isn't very detailed. 

Wait, the function is named with an underscore, and the docstring says "return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue." So maybe 'issue' is an object that has some attributes or methods that I need to extract numbers and supplements from. But the function's signature is just def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):. 

Since the docstring isn't very specific, I need to make assumptions here. Maybe 'issue' is a string, and I need to extract numbers and supplements (like maybe abbreviations or something) from it. Alternatively, maybe 'issue' is a dictionary or a list, and I need to process its contents.

But without more info, I should think of possible scenarios. Let's say the 'issue' is a string. For example, if the issue is a string like "Issue 123-ABC", then maybe the number is 123 and the supplement is ABC. But the function needs to return possible values, so maybe it returns a tuple or a dictionary with those values.

Alternatively, maybe the 'issue' is a list of strings, and each string contains a number and a supplement. For example, ["123-ABC", "456-DEF"], and the function would extract the numbers and supplements from each element.

But since the function is supposed to return the possible values, perhaps it's supposed to extract all possible numbers and supplements from the entire 'issue' content. So maybe the function processes the contents of the 'issue' object, which could be a string, a list, or some other structure.

Wait, the function is named _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. The underscore suggests it's a private method. But the user is asking for the code, not the tests. So I need to write the code that implements this function.

Since the docstring is vague, I need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that 'issue' is a string, and the function is supposed to extract numbers and supplements from it. For example, numbers could be digits, and supplements could be letters or other characters. But how to distinguish between them?

Alternatively, maybe 'sup' is a typo for 'supplement', and the function is supposed to extract numbers and supplements from the issue's content. For example, in a string like "Issue 123-ABC", the number is 123 and the supplement is ABC. So the function would return (123, 'ABC').

But how to extract that? Maybe the function splits the string on hyphens and takes the parts. For example, splitting on '-' and taking the first part as the number and the second as the supplement. But that's just a guess.

Another possibility: the 'issue' is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'supplement', and the function returns those values. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to extract all possible numbers and supplements from the 'issue' object's contents. For example, if 'issue' is a list of strings, each containing a number and a supplement, then the function would collect all numbers and supplements.

But since the function is supposed to return the possible values, perhaps it's returning a list of numbers and supplements. For example, if the issue is a string like "123-456", the function returns [123, 456]. Or maybe it returns a tuple (123, 456).

But the docstring says "return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue." So maybe the function returns a list of numbers and supplements. But how to determine which parts are numbers and which are supplements?

This is quite ambiguous. Since the user wants the code generated, I need to make some assumptions. Let's proceed with the following approach:

Assume that 'issue' is a string, and the function extracts numbers and supplements from it. For example, numbers are digits, and supplements are letters or other characters. The function could split the string into parts, extract numbers and supplements.

But how to split? Maybe split on hyphens, and take the first part as the number and the second as the supplement. But that's just one possible way.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to extract all numbers and supplements from the string. For example, numbers could be any sequence of digits, and supplements could be any other characters. But how to distinguish?

Another approach: the function could return a list of numbers and supplements. For example, if the issue is "123-456", the function returns [123, 456]. If the issue is "abc123-def456", returns [123, 456]. But how to extract that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'supplement', each being the extracted values. For example, if the issue is "123-ABC", returns {'number': 123, 'supplement': 'ABC'}.

But without more info, it's hard to know. Since the user wants the code, I'll proceed with the assumption that 'issue' is a string, and the function extracts numbers and supplements from it. Let's code that.

So, the function would process the 'issue' string, split it into parts, and extract numbers and supplements. For example:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    # Assume issue is a string
    parts = issue.split('-')
    if len(parts) >= 2:
        number = int(parts[0])
        supplement = parts[1]
        return (number, supplement)
    else:
        return None

But this is just one possible implementation. However, the docstring says "possible values", which might imply that there could be multiple possibilities. But without more info, this is the best I can do.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return all numbers and supplements found in the 'issue' content. For example, if the issue is "123-456", return [123, 456]. If the issue is "abc123-def456", return [123, 456]. But how to extract that?

Another approach: use regular expressions to find all numbers and supplements. For example, numbers are sequences of digits, and supplements are any other characters. But how to define supplements?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of numbers and supplements from the 'issue' string. For example, using re.findall to find all digits and all other characters.

But again, without more info, it's hard. The user probably expects a simple implementation. So the code I'll write is:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    # Extract number and supplement from the issue
    # Assume issue is a string, split on '-' and take first part as number, second as supplement
    if '-' in issue:
        number_part, supplement_part = issue.split('-', 1)
        return (int(number_part), supplement_part)
    else:
        return None

But the docstring says "return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue." So maybe the function returns a tuple of (number, supplement). But the function is supposed to return the possible values, which might be multiple. But without more info, this is the best guess.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to return a list of numbers and supplements. For example, if the issue is "123-456", return [123, 456]. So the code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    if '-' in issue:
        parts = issue.split('-', 1)
        return [int(parts[0]), parts[1]]
    else:
        return []

But again, this is just a guess. Since the user wants the code, I'll proceed with this implementation, assuming that the 'issue' is a string, and the function splits on hyphen and returns the number and supplement as a tuple.

So the final code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    if '-' in issue:
        parts = issue.split('-', 1)
        return (int(parts[0]), parts[1])
    else:
        return ()

But the docstring says "return the possible values of number and sup", so maybe the function returns a list. But without more info, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the function returns a dictionary.

But given the ambiguity, the code I'll write is as above. Now, the user wants the code generated, so I'll output that.
