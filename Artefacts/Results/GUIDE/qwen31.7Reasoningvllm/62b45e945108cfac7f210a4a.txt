Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_hierarchy, and it's supposed to validate a storage root hierarchy. Let me start by understanding the parameters and the return values.

The parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings. The docstring says that it returns the number of objects checked and the number of good objects. The function is part of a class, as indicated by the self parameter.

First, I need to think about what the function does. It's likely checking the hierarchy of objects, maybe ensuring that each object's digest matches the parent's. The parameters validate_objects and check_digests probably control whether the function checks the objects and their digests, respectively. The show_warnings parameter might control whether to print warnings during the validation process.

But since the user hasn't provided any specific implementation details, I need to create a mock or stub implementation. The function is supposed to return two integers: num_objects and good_objects. So, the code should simulate this behavior.

Let me think about the steps. The function might start by initializing counters. Then, it would iterate over the objects, check each one, and increment counters accordingly. If an object is valid, it's counted in good_objects. If not, it's not. The parameters determine whether these checks are performed.

Wait, the parameters are boolean. So, validate_objects is True by default. If it's False, maybe the function doesn't check the objects. Similarly for check_digests. But how does that affect the code? Maybe if validate_objects is False, the function doesn't process the objects, so num_objects and good_objects are zero.

But the function's return is num_objects and good_objects. So, the code needs to generate these values based on the parameters.

Let me outline the code structure. The function will have:

- Initialize num_objects and good_objects to 0.
- If validate_objects is True, then process each object, incrementing num_objects and good_objects as needed.
- If check_digests is True, maybe check the digest of each object against the parent's, but that's not specified here. So perhaps the code just checks if the object is valid, which could be based on some condition.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual logic, I need to make assumptions. Maybe the function checks if the object's digest is correct, and if so, counts it as valid. But without knowing the exact logic, I have to create a mock.

So, perhaps the code would look like this:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    if validate_objects:
        # Process each object
        for i in range(10):  # Assuming 10 objects for example
            num_objects += 1
            # Check if the object is valid
            if check_digests:
                # Check digest here
                if some_condition:
                    good_objects += 1
                else:
                    # Maybe mark as invalid
                    pass
            else:
                # If check_digests is False, assume all objects are valid?
                good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is just a mock. The actual logic would depend on the specific implementation. However, the user hasn't provided any details, so I need to create a placeholder.

Wait, the function's docstring says it returns num_objects and good_objects. So the code needs to generate these values. The parameters determine whether to process the objects and check their validity.

Another consideration: the function is part of a class, so the code should be inside a class. But the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code will be a standalone function, but the docstring indicates it's part of a class. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the function is part of a class, but the code is written as a standalone function. But the docstring says it's part of a class, so maybe the code is inside a class.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so I need to write the function as per the signature, even if it's part of a class. However, the code will be written as a standalone function, but the docstring is part of the function.

So, the code will be a function with the given parameters and returns the two integers.

Now, considering the parameters:

- validate_objects: if True, process the objects; else, don't.
- check_digests: if True, check digests; else, maybe don't.
- show_warnings: if True, maybe print warnings, but the return value is just the counts.

But the return value is just the two integers. So the code needs to generate those.

So, the code could be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    if validate_objects:
        # Assume there are 10 objects for example
        for _ in range(10):
            num_objects += 1
            # Check if the object is valid
            # For the sake of example, assume all objects are valid unless check_digests is False
            if check_digests:
                # Check digest here, but since we don't have actual logic, just assume valid
                good_objects += 1
            else:
                # If check_digests is False, assume valid
                good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is a very basic example. However, the user might expect more. But without more information, this is the best I can do.

Another possibility is that the function checks the hierarchy, ensuring that each object's digest matches the parent's. So, for each object, check if its digest matches the parent's. If not, it's invalid. But again, without knowing the actual logic, I have to make assumptions.

So, perhaps the code would look like:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    if validate_objects:
        # Assume there are 10 objects for example
        for i in range(10):
            num_objects += 1
            # Check if the object is valid
            # For the sake of example, assume valid unless check_digests is False
            if check_digests:
                # Check digest here, but since we don't have actual logic, just assume valid
                good_objects += 1
            else:
                # If check_digests is False, assume valid
                good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

But this is just a mock. The actual implementation would need to have the logic for checking digests and validating objects.

But the user hasn't provided any specific details, so this is the best I can do.

Another thing to consider: the function returns the number of objects checked and the number of good objects. So, the code must generate these values based on the parameters.

In the code, if validate_objects is True, then the number of objects checked is the number of objects processed. If it's False, then it's zero.

So, the code would have:

num_objects = 0
if validate_objects:
    num_objects = some_value

But since the user hasn't provided the actual number of objects, I need to make it dynamic. Maybe the code uses a loop that processes a certain number of objects, but since the user hasn't specified, perhaps it's better to have a fixed number, like 10.

So, the code would be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    if validate_objects:
        # Assume 10 objects for example
        for _ in range(10):
            num_objects += 1
            # Check if the object is valid
            # For the sake of example, assume valid unless check_digests is False
            if check_digests:
                # Check digest here, but since we don't have actual logic, just assume valid
                good_objects += 1
            else:
                # If check_digests is False, assume valid
                good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

This is a simple implementation. However, the actual logic would need to be more detailed. But given the information, this is the best I can do.

Another possible approach is to have the function return the counts based on the parameters, but without actual logic, it's hard to say. So, the code above is a placeholder.

So, the final code would be as written above, with the parameters and the return values.
