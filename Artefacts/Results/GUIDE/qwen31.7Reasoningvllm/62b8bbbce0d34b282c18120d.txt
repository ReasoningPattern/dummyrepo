Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_file_exist that checks if a given file name exists. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function needs to determine if the file exists. In Python, I can use the os module's path.exists() function. Wait, but wait, the os module's path.exists() is available in Python 3.3 and above. But maybe the user wants a more portable approach. Alternatively, using the pathlib module's Path class might be better, as it's more modern and handles paths correctly.

So, the function should check if the file exists. Let me recall: the Path object has a exists() method. So, perhaps using pathlib.Path(file_name).exists() would be the way to go. But I need to make sure that the file_name is a valid path. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention handling invalid paths, so maybe just check if the path exists, regardless of whether it's a valid file or not.

Wait, the function's purpose is to check if the file_name is an existing file. So, the function should return True if the file exists and is a regular file, False otherwise. But wait, what about if the file is a directory? Then, the exists() method returns True, but the function's docstring says "file_name is an existing file". So, the function should return True only if the file exists and is a regular file, not a directory.

Hmm, so the function needs to check two things: whether the path exists, and whether it's a regular file. How to do that?

Using os.path.exists(file_name) would check if the path exists. Then, check if it's a regular file. For that, os.path.isfile(file_name) would return True if it's a regular file. So, combining these two checks.

But wait, what if the file_name is a directory? Then os.path.isfile would return False. So, the function should return True only if the path exists and is a regular file.

So the function would be:

import os
from pathlib import Path

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    if os.path.exists(file_name):
        if os.path.isfile(file_name):
            return True
    return False

Alternatively, using pathlib:

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    path = Path(file_name)
    return path.exists() and path.is_file()

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me test some cases.

Test case 1: file exists and is a file. Returns True.

Test case 2: file exists but is a directory. Returns False.

Test case 3: file does not exist. Returns False.

Test case 4: file is a directory but doesn't exist. Returns False.

So the code should handle these cases.

But wait, what about if the file_name is empty? Like an empty string? Then, os.path.exists would return False, so the function returns False. That's correct.

Now, the docstring says "Check whether file_name is an existing file." So the function should return True only if the file exists and is a regular file. So the code above should work.

Now, the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the necessary imports.

But the user's example shows that the code should be output in Python markdown format. So the code should be written with the function definition, and any necessary imports.

But in Python, the imports need to be at the top. So the code would start with:

import os
from pathlib import Path

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    path = Path(file_name)
    return path.exists() and path.is_file()

Wait, but maybe the user wants to use os.path. But the pathlib approach is more modern. However, the problem is that the user might not have imported pathlib. But the code should be self-contained.

Alternatively, using os.path:

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.exists(file_name) and os.path.isfile(file_name)

Which is simpler and doesn't require importing pathlib. But which is better? Well, the pathlib approach is more robust for handling paths, but the os.path approach is simpler.

But the function's docstring says "Check whether file_name is an existing file." So the function should return True if the file exists, regardless of whether it's a file or directory. Wait, no. The function's purpose is to check if it's an existing file. So the function should return True only if the file exists and is a regular file. So the code using os.path.exists and os.path.isfile is correct.

But perhaps the user wants to check if the file exists, regardless of whether it's a file or directory. But the function's docstring says "file_name is an existing file." So the function should return True only if the file exists and is a regular file.

So the code using os.path.exists and os.path.isfile is correct.

But what about if the file_name is a directory? Then os.path.isfile returns False, so the function returns False, which is correct.

So the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.exists(file_name) and os.path.isfile(file_name)

But perhaps the user wants to use pathlib. Let me check.

Using pathlib:

from pathlib import Path

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return Path(file_name).exists() and Path(file_name).is_file()

But the user's example shows that the code should be generated. So which approach is better?

Well, the os approach is more compatible with older Python versions, but the pathlib approach is more modern. However, the problem is that the user might not have imported pathlib. But the code should be self-contained.

But the function's docstring doesn't mention anything about handling different OSes, so the code should be as simple as possible.

So, the code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.exists(file_name) and os.path.isfile(file_name)

But perhaps the user wants to use pathlib. Let me think. The function's name is is_file_exist, which is a bit ambiguous. But the code should be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the function should check if the file exists and is a regular file, which is what the code does.

So the code is correct.

Now, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as:

```python
import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    return os.path.exists(file_name) and os.path.isfile(file_name)
```

But the user's example shows that the code should be generated with the function signature and docstring. Wait, the original problem says that the function signature is given, and the docstring is provided. So the code should include the function definition with the docstring.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the code should include the function definition with the docstring.

So the code would be:

def is_file_exist(file_name):
	"""
	Check whether file_name is an existing file.
	"""
	# code here

But the user's example shows that the code should be written with the function definition and the docstring. So the code would be:

def is_file_exist(file_name):
	"""
	Check whether file_name is an existing file.
	"""
	import os

	return os.path.exists(file_name) and os.path.isfile(file_name)

Wait, but the import should be at the top. So the code should have the import statement before the function.

So the correct code would be:

import os

def is_file_exist(file_name):
	"""
	Check whether file_name is an existing file.
	"""
	return os.path.exists(file_name) and os.path.isfile(file_name)

But the user's example shows that the code should be generated with the function definition and docstring. So the code would be as above.

Alternatively, the code could be written with the import inside the function, but that's not standard. So the correct way is to have the import at the top.

So the final code is as above.
