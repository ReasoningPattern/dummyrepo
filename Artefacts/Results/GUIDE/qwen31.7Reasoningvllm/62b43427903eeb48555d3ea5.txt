Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called format, and it takes sql, params, and returns a tuple of a string and the params. The docstring says it converts SQL using self._converter.convert.

First, I need to understand the function's purpose. The function seems to take a SQL string and some parameters, convert them, and return a tuple. The return type is a tuple where the first element is a string (the converted SQL) and the second is the same params argument. Wait, but the params could be a dict or a sequence. The function's return type is a tuple of AnyStr and Union[Dict..., Sequence[Any]].

So the function is supposed to take the sql, convert it using the converter, and return the converted sql as the first element, and the original params as the second. But how does the converter work? The docstring mentions self._converter.convert, which suggests that the converter is an instance method of the class. So the function is using that converter to process the sql.

But the problem is, the function's parameters are sql and params. The return is a tuple of the converted sql and the params. Wait, but the params are passed as a Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]. So the function is returning the same params as input, but the first element is the converted SQL.

So the code would be something like:

def format(self, sql, params):
    converted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql)
    return (converted_sql, params)

But wait, the function's return type is a tuple of AnyStr and Union[...]. So the first element must be a string. So the converted_sql must be a string. But the converter's convert method returns whatever it does. So assuming that the converter's convert method returns a string, then this code would work.

But the user's function signature has the return type as a tuple of AnyStr and the same params. So the code would be straightforward.

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function converts sql using self._converter.convert. So the code is simply applying the converter to the sql and returning the tuple.

So the code would be:

def format(self, sql, params):
    return (self._converter.convert(sql), params)

But wait, the parameters are passed as a Union[Dict..., Sequence[Any]], but the function returns the same params. So the code is correct.

But maybe the params are modified? No, the docstring says that the function returns the same params. So the code is as above.

So the generated code would be the function that applies the converter to sql and returns the tuple.
