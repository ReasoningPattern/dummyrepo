Okay, I need to generate a Python function called generate_default_observer_schema_dict that takes a manifest_dict and a first_level parameter. The docstring says that the function creates a new dictionary based on the value types in the manifest_dict. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to create a schema dictionary. The keys in the new dict are probably the keys from the manifest_dict, and the values are generated based on the type of the values in the manifest_dict. But how?

Wait, the docstring says "the values corresponding to different keys in the new dict are generated based on the value type (such as dict and list) in the manifest_dict file." So, for each key in the manifest_dict, the value in the new dict is determined by the type of the value in the manifest_dict. But what's the exact logic here?

For example, if a value is a dict, maybe it's transformed into a schema that represents that dict. Similarly, if it's a list, maybe it's transformed into a schema for lists. But what's the exact structure?

Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to create a schema that represents the structure of the manifest_dict. For instance, if the manifest_dict has a key 'a' with value {'b': 1}, then the schema might have 'a' as a key, and the value would be a schema for the nested dict. But how to handle different types?

Wait, the function's parameters are manifest_dict and first_level. The first_level parameter might indicate whether the schema is for the first level of the manifest, or maybe whether to process nested structures. But the docstring doesn't specify, so maybe it's just a flag to control processing.

But the main task is to generate the schema based on the value types. Let's think about possible cases:

- If the value is a dict, perhaps the schema for that dict is generated recursively. For example, if the value is {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, then the schema for that dict would be a dictionary with keys 'a' and 'b', each with their own schema.

- If the value is a list, maybe the schema is a list of schemas. For example, if the value is [1, 2, 3], then the schema would be a list with elements 1, 2, 3, each as their own schema.

But how to represent this in the function? The function returns a new dictionary. So, for each key in the manifest_dict, the value is generated based on the type of the value.

So, the steps could be:

1. Iterate over each key in the manifest_dict.
2. For each key, check the type of the value.
3. Generate the corresponding schema for that value.
4. Add the key to the new dictionary with the generated schema.

But how to generate the schema for different types?

For example:

- If the value is a dict, then the schema for that dict is a dictionary where each key in the original dict becomes a key in the schema, and the value is the schema for that value.

Wait, but the function is supposed to generate the schema based on the value's type. So maybe the schema is a dictionary where each key is the original key, and the value is the schema for that key's value.

But how to handle nested structures? For example, if the value is a dict, then the schema for that dict would be a dictionary with keys from the dict, each with their own schema.

But the function's parameters include first_level. Maybe first_level is a boolean that determines whether to process the first level of the manifest_dict or all levels. But the docstring doesn't specify, so maybe it's just a flag to control recursion.

Alternatively, maybe first_level is a boolean that indicates whether the schema is for the first level of the manifest_dict, and if so, then the function should not process nested structures. But without more info, I need to make assumptions.

Assuming that first_level is a boolean that determines whether to process the first level or not. But how does that affect the schema generation?

Alternatively, perhaps first_level is a parameter that controls whether the function should generate a schema for the first level of the manifest_dict, and if so, then the function should not process nested structures. But I'm not sure.

But the main task is to generate the schema based on the value types. So, perhaps the function is supposed to recursively generate the schema for each value in the manifest_dict, considering the type of the value.

So, the function would look something like this:

def generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest_dict, first_level=False):
    result = {}
    for key, value in manifest_dict.items():
        if first_level:
            # Process first level
            # For example, if value is a dict, then the schema for that dict is generated
            # But how?
            # Maybe the schema for a dict is a dictionary with keys from the dict, each with their own schema
            # So, for each key in value, recursively generate the schema
            # But if first_level is True, maybe we don't process nested structures?
            # Not sure, but perhaps the first_level parameter is a flag to control recursion
            # For example, if first_level is True, then the function processes the first level, and if False, processes all levels
            # But without more info, it's hard to say. Maybe the first_level is just a parameter to control whether to process the first level or not.
            # For now, let's assume that first_level is a boolean that determines whether to process the first level, and if so, then the schema is generated for the first level, and if not, then for all levels.
            # But how to handle that?

            # For the purpose of this function, maybe the first_level parameter is not used, but the docstring says it's a parameter. So perhaps the function is supposed to generate the schema for the first level, and if first_level is False, then it's for the entire manifest_dict.

            # But this is unclear. Maybe the first_level is a parameter that indicates whether to generate the schema for the first level of the manifest_dict, and if so, then the function should not process nested structures. But again, not sure.

            # Let's proceed with the assumption that the first_level parameter is a boolean that determines whether to process the first level, and if so, then the schema is generated for the first level, and if not, then for all levels.

            # So, for the first level, the function would generate the schema for the value, but if the value is a dict, then it would recursively generate the schema for that dict.

            # But how to handle that? Let's think.

            # For example, if the value is a dict, then the schema for that dict is a dictionary where each key in the dict is a key in the schema, and the value is the schema for that key's value.

            # So, for the first level, the function would generate a dictionary where each key is the original key, and the value is the schema for that key's value.

            # So, for the first level, the function would generate the schema for each value in the manifest_dict, regardless of whether it's a dict or list.

            # But how to handle lists? For example, if the value is a list, then the schema for that list would be a list of schemas, each for the elements in the list.

            # So, the function would need to handle different types:

            # If the value is a dict: generate a dictionary where each key is the key from the dict, and the value is the schema for that key's value.

            # If the value is a list: generate a list of schemas, each for the elements in the list.

            # If the value is a number, string, etc.: generate a schema for that type.

            # But how to represent that in the function?

            # So, for each key in the manifest_dict:

            # Check the type of the value.

            # If the value is a dict: recursively generate the schema for that dict.

            # If the value is a list: generate a list of schemas for each element in the list.

            # Else: generate a schema for the value.

            # But how to represent the schema for the value? For example, if the value is a number, then the schema would be a dictionary with a key 'type' and the value as the type (e.g., 'int').

            # But the docstring says that the new dict is returned. So, the schema for each value is a dictionary that represents the structure.

            # So, for example:

            # If the value is a dict, then the schema for that dict is a dictionary with keys from the dict, each with their own schema.

            # If the value is a list, then the schema is a list of schemas for each element.

            # If the value is a number, then the schema is a dictionary with 'type' as the key and the value as the type.

            # But how to handle different types? For example, if the value is a list of dicts, then the schema would be a list of schemas for each dict.

            # So, the function would need to handle these cases.

            # So, the code would look like:

            # For each key in the manifest_dict:

            #   if value is a dict:

            #       generate a dictionary where each key is the key from the dict, and the value is the schema for that key's value.

            #   elif value is a list:

            #       generate a list of schemas for each element in the list.

            #   else:

            #       generate a schema for the value, which is a dictionary with 'type' as the key and the value as the type.

            # But how to handle nested structures? For example, if the value is a dict that contains another dict, then the function would recursively generate the schema for that inner dict.

            # So, the function would need to be recursive.

            # But the first_level parameter is a boolean. So, perhaps if first_level is True, then the function processes the first level, and if False, it processes all levels. But how to determine that?

            # Maybe the first_level parameter is used to control whether the function should process the first level of the manifest_dict. For example, if first_level is True, then the function processes the first level, and if False, it processes all levels. But this is unclear.

            # However, the function's docstring says that the values are generated based on the value type in the manifest_dict. So, regardless of first_level, the function should generate the schema based on the value types.

            # So, perhaps the first_level parameter is not used in the function's logic, but is part of the function's parameters. But how?

            # Maybe the first_level parameter is a boolean that indicates whether to generate the schema for the first level of the manifest_dict, and if so, then the function should not process nested structures. But again, this is unclear.

            # Given the ambiguity, perhaps the first_level parameter is not used in the function's logic, and the function is supposed to generate the schema for the entire manifest_dict, regardless of first_level.

            # So, the function would process each key in the manifest_dict, and for each value, generate the schema based on its type.

            # So, the code would look like:

            # For each key in manifest_dict:

            #   if value is a dict:

            #       new_value = generate_schema(value)

            #   elif value is a list:

            #       new_value = [generate_schema(v) for v in value]

            #   else:

            #       new_value = {'type': type(value).__name__}

            #   result[key] = new_value

            # But how to handle the first_level parameter? Maybe it's not used, but the docstring says it's a parameter. So perhaps the first_level is a boolean that determines whether to process the first level, but in the code, it's not used. Or maybe it's a parameter that is passed but not used.

            # However, the function's parameters are manifest_dict and first_level. So, the code must include the first_level parameter, but it's not used. But that's possible.

            # So, the code would be:

            # def generate_default_observer_schema_dict(manifest_dict, first_level=False):

            #     result = {}

            #     for key, value in manifest_dict.items():

            #         if first_level:

            #             # process first level

            #         else:

            #             # process all levels

            #         # generate the schema for the value

            #         # add to result

            #     return result

            # But how to implement the processing of the value's type?

            # So, the code would need to check the type of the value. For example:

            # if isinstance(value, dict):

            #     # generate schema for the dict

            # elif isinstance(value, list):

            # But how to generate the schema for the value?

            # For example, if the value is a dict, then the schema for that dict is a dictionary where each key is the key from the dict, and the value is the schema for that key's value.

            # Now, let's check if this code would handle different cases.

            # For example, if the manifest_dict is {'a': {'b': 1}}, then the generated schema would be {'a': {'b': {'type': 'int'}}}.

            # If the value is a list, like ['a', 'b'], then the schema would be a list of {'type': 'str'}.

            # If the value is a number, like 1, then the schema is {'type': 'int'}.

            # So, this seems to handle the cases.

            # Therefore, the code is correct.
