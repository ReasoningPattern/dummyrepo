Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function generate_default_observer_schema as per the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it generates the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in spec.manifest where a custom observer schema isn't specified. So, the function is probably looking for Kubernetes resources in a specified file (spec.manifest) and creating default schemas for those that don't have their own.

First, I need to figure out how to access the spec.manifest. But the function is called within a Flask app context, maybe? Wait, the function is part of a Flask application, perhaps? The function is decorated with @app.route, but the docstring doesn't mention that. However, the function is named generate_default_observer_schema and is called with app as an argument. So, maybe this is a Flask route handler, and the spec.manifest is a variable in the scope of the function.

But the problem is, the function is supposed to generate the schema. So, the code needs to process the spec.manifest, which is probably a list of Kubernetes resources. For each resource, if there's no custom observer schema defined, generate a default one.

But how to represent the spec.manifest? Maybe it's a list of resource names, like ['Pod', 'Deployment', ...]. The function needs to iterate over these resources, check if a custom schema exists, and if not, generate a default.

But the actual implementation details are not provided. So, I need to think about how to structure the code.

Assuming that spec.manifest is a list of resource names, and that each resource has a custom schema in a dictionary or some structure. But since the function is supposed to generate the default, perhaps it's generating a default schema structure for each resource.

So, the code would:

1. Read the spec.manifest (probably a list of resource names).
2. For each resource in spec.manifest:
   a. Check if a custom schema exists for that resource.
   b. If not, generate a default schema.
3. Return the generated schemas.

But how to represent the default schema? For example, a default schema might be a dictionary with keys like 'type', 'properties', 'required', etc. But the exact structure depends on the Kubernetes resource.

But since the function is supposed to generate the default, perhaps the code is generating a generic default schema structure. However, without knowing the exact structure of the spec.manifest, it's hard to say. But the function's purpose is to generate the default, so the code would need to create a default schema for each resource.

But how to implement this? Let's think of a sample scenario. Suppose the spec.manifest contains 'Pod' and 'Deployment'. For each, the code would generate a default schema.

But the actual implementation would require knowing the structure of the Kubernetes resource. For example, for a Pod, the default schema might include fields like 'metadata', 'spec', etc. But since the function is generic, perhaps the code is generating a default schema structure that can be used for any resource.

However, without specific information, the code can't be fully accurate. But the problem requires generating code based on the given function signature and docstring, so the code must be generic enough to handle any resource in spec.manifest.

So, the code would:

- Iterate over each resource in spec.manifest.
- For each resource, check if a custom schema exists. If not, generate a default.
- Return the generated schemas.

But how to check if a custom schema exists? Maybe the code has a way to look up custom schemas, like a dictionary where keys are resource names and values are the custom schemas. But since the function is part of a Flask app, perhaps the custom schemas are stored in the app's context.

But the function is called with app as an argument. So, perhaps the code is part of a Flask route, and the spec.manifest is a variable in the scope. For example, in the route handler, the code would have:

spec_manifest = ... # some list of resource names

Then, for each resource in spec_manifest:

if resource in custom_schemas:
    use that
else:
    generate default

But the code needs to be written in Python, so the actual implementation would involve checking for the presence of custom schemas.

But since the problem doesn't provide the actual implementation details, the code must be written in a way that's generic enough.

So, the code would look something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    # Assume spec.manifest is a list of resource names
    # Assume custom_schemas is a dictionary mapping resource names to their custom schemas
    # For each resource in spec.manifest:
    #   if resource in custom_schemas: use it
    #   else: generate default
    # Return the list of schemas

But how to generate the default schema? For example, a default schema might be a dictionary with a 'type' key, and 'properties' with fields like 'metadata', 'spec', etc.

But without knowing the exact structure, the code can't be fully accurate. However, the problem requires generating code based on the given function signature and docstring, so the code must be written in a way that's plausible.

So, the code would:

- Iterate over each resource in spec.manifest.
- For each resource, check if it's in the custom_schemas dict.
- If not, create a default schema.

But how to create the default schema? For example, a default schema might be a dictionary with a 'type' of 'object' and 'properties' containing the necessary fields.

But since the function is supposed to generate the default, perhaps the code is generating a generic default structure.

So, the code would look like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    # Assume spec.manifest is a list of resource names
    # Assume custom_schemas is a dictionary of custom schemas
    # Generate default schemas for resources not in custom_schemas
    default_schemas = []
    for resource in app.spec_manifest:
        if resource in app.custom_schemas:
            default_schemas.append(app.custom_schemas[resource])
        else:
            # Generate default schema for resource
            default_schema = {
                'type': 'object',
                'properties': {
                    'metadata': {
                        'type': 'object',
                        'properties': {
                            'name': {'type': 'string'},
                            'namespace': {'type': 'string'},
                            'labels': {'type': 'object'},
                            'annotations': {'type': 'object'}
                        },
                        'required': ['name', 'namespace']
                    },
                    'spec': {
                        'type': 'object',
                        'properties': {
                            'containers': {
                                'type': 'array',
                                'items': {
                                    'type': 'object',
                                    'properties': {
                                        'name': {'type': 'string'},
                                        'image': {'type': 'string'},
                                        'args': {'type': 'array'},
                                        'env': {
                                            'type': 'array',
                                            'items': {
                                                'type': 'object',
                                                'properties': {
                                                    'name': {'type': 'string'},
                                                    'value': {'type': 'string'}
                                                },
                                                'required': ['name', 'value']
                                            }
                                        }
                                    },
                                    'required': ['name', 'image']
                                }
                            }
                        },
                        'required': ['containers']
                    }
                },
                'required': ['metadata', 'spec']
            }
            default_schemas.append(default_schema)
    return default_schemas

But this is just a sample. The actual code would need to handle the specific structure of the Kubernetes resources, but since the problem doesn't provide that info, the code must be generic.

However, the function's docstring mentions that the spec.manifest is a list of Kubernetes resources. So, the code must process that.

But the problem says to output only the code generated, so the code must be written in Python, using the given function signature.

So, the final code would be as above, but with the actual implementation details. However, since the problem requires generating code based on the given function signature and docstring, the code must be written in a way that's plausible.

Another consideration: the function is part of a Flask app, so perhaps the spec.manifest is a variable in the app's context. But the code is written as a standalone function, so the spec.manifest and custom_schemas would need to be accessible.

But the problem doesn't provide the actual implementation details, so the code must be written in a way that's generic.

Therefore, the code would look like the sample above, but with the actual structure of the default schema.

But since the problem requires outputting only the code, I'll proceed with writing the code as per the sample, assuming that the spec.manifest is a list of resource names, and custom_schemas is a dictionary of custom schemas.

So, the final code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    # Assume spec.manifest is a list of resource names
    # Assume custom_schemas is a dictionary mapping resource names to their custom schemas
    default_schemas = []
    for resource in app.spec_manifest:
        if resource in app.custom_schemas:
            default_schemas.append(app.custom_schemas[resource])
        else:
            # Generate default schema for resource
            default_schema = {
                'type': 'object',
                'properties': {
                    'metadata': {
                        'type': 'object',
                        'properties': {
                            'name': {'type': 'string'},
                            'namespace': {'type': 'string'},
                            'labels': {'type': 'object'},
                            'annotations': {'type': 'object'}
                        },
                        'required': ['name', 'namespace']
                    },
                    'spec': {
                        'type': 'object',
                        'properties': {
                            'containers': {
                                'type': 'array',
                                'items': {
                                    'type': 'object',
                                    'properties': {
                                        'name': {'type': 'string'},
                                        'image': {'type': 'string'},
                                        'args': {'type': 'array'},
                                        'env': {
                                            'type': 'array',
                                            'items': {
                                                'type': 'object',
                                                'properties': {
                                                    'name': {'type': 'string'},
                                                    'value': {'type': 'string'}
                                                },
                                                'required': ['name', 'value']
                                            }
                                        }
                                    },
                                    'required': ['name', 'image']
                                }
                            }
                        },
                        'required': ['containers']
                    }
                },
                'required': ['metadata', 'spec']
            }
            default_schemas.append(default_schema)
    return default_schemas

But I need to make sure that the code is in Python markdown format, which means the code is enclosed in triple backticks and the language is specified. However, the user said to output only the code generated, so the code should be in Python markdown format.

So, the final answer would be the code above, but with the correct syntax.
