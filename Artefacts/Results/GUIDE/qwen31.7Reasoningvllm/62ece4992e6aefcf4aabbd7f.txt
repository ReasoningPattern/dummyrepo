Okay, I need to write the Python function _parse_image_ref as described. Let me look at the docstring again. The function takes an image_href string and returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl), and raises ValueError if it can't parse.

First, I need to figure out how to parse the image_href. The docstring mentions using urllib, so maybe the image_href is a URL like "https://example.com/image.jpg" or something similar. The tuple returns image_id, netloc, and use_ssl. 

Wait, the netloc is the network location, which is the part after the domain, like "example.com" or "subdomain.example.com". The use_ssl flag would be True if the URL uses HTTPS, False otherwise.

So the steps would be: split the image_href into parts. Let's see. The image_href might start with http or https. The netloc is the part after the scheme, like "example.com", and the image_id could be the part after the domain, but maybe it's the entire path? Or maybe the image_id is the part before the domain? Wait, the function returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So the image_id is probably the part after the domain, but how?

Wait, maybe the image_href is structured like "https://example.com/image.jpg". Then the netloc is "example.com", the image_id is "image.jpg", and use_ssl is True. But how to extract that?

Alternatively, maybe the image_href is something like "http://example.com/path/to/image.jpg". Then netloc is "example.com", image_id is "path/to/image.jpg", and use_ssl is False.

But how to split this? The netloc is the part after the scheme (http or https), and before the path. So the netloc is the part between the scheme and the path. So, for example, in "https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg", the netloc is "example.com", the path is "/path/to/image.jpg", and the image_id would be the path part. But the function returns (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So image_id is the path part?

But how to split the href into these parts. Let's think about the structure. The image_href is a URL. So, first, we need to split it into scheme, netloc, and the rest. Then, the image_id would be the part after the netloc, but maybe it's the entire path. Wait, but the function returns (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So image_id is the part after the netloc, but maybe it's the entire path. For example, if the href is "https://example.com/image.jpg", then netloc is "example.com", image_id is "image.jpg", use_ssl is True.

So the steps would be:

1. Split the image_href into scheme, netloc, and the rest. The scheme is the first part, like "http" or "https". The netloc is the next part, like "example.com". The rest is the rest of the string.

But how to split that? Using urllib.parse, maybe. Let's think. The urllib.parse module has urlparse which can split a URL into components.

So, for example, urlparse("https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg") would return a ParseResult object with fields: scheme='https', netloc='example.com', path='/path/to/image.jpg', etc.

So, the netloc is the netloc field, and the use_ssl is the scheme starts with 'https'.

Then, the image_id would be the path part. But wait, the path could be something like "/path/to/image.jpg", so the image_id would be "path/to/image.jpg". But maybe the image_id is the part after the netloc, but how to split that?

Wait, the function returns (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So image_id is the part after the netloc, but maybe it's the entire path. So, for example, if the href is "https://example.com/image.jpg", then the path is "/image.jpg", so image_id is "image.jpg".

So, the steps would be:

- Parse the URL into components using urlparse.

- Check if the URL is valid. If not, raise ValueError.

- Get the netloc from the parsed result.

- Check if the scheme is 'https' to set use_ssl to True.

- The image_id is the path part of the URL. But wait, the path could be something like "/path/to/image.jpg", so the image_id would be "path/to/image.jpg". But maybe the image_id is the part after the netloc, but how to split that?

Wait, the path is the part after the netloc. So, the path is the part after the netloc. So, for example, in "https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg", the path is "/path/to/image.jpg". So the image_id would be "path/to/image.jpg".

But how to extract that? The path is the parsed result's path attribute. So, image_id would be the path.

But what if the path is empty? Like "https://example.com", then the path is "/". So image_id would be "/". But maybe that's acceptable.

So, the code would be:

Import urllib.parse.

Parse the image_href using urlparse.

Check if the parsed result is valid. If not, raise ValueError.

Then, get netloc = parsed.netloc.

use_ssl = (scheme == 'https').

image_id = parsed.path.

But wait, the path could be something like "/path/to/image.jpg", so the image_id is "path/to/image.jpg".

But what if the image_href is something like "http://example.com" (no path)? Then the path is "/", so image_id is "/".

But the function returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So that's acceptable.

But what if the image_href is not a valid URL? For example, if it's "example.com" (no scheme), then urlparse would raise a ValueError. So the function needs to handle that.

So, the code would be:

import urllib.parse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href")
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    image_id = parsed.path
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but what if the image_href is something like "https://example.com/image.jpg"? Then parsed.scheme is 'https', parsed.netloc is 'example.com', parsed.path is '/image.jpg', so image_id is '/image.jpg'.

But maybe the image_id is supposed to be the part after the domain, but in that case, the path would be the image_id. But the function's docstring says that the returns are (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So according to this code, that's what it returns.

But perhaps the image_id is supposed to be the part after the domain, but the path is the image_id. So, for example, if the href is "https://example.com/image.jpg", then image_id is "image.jpg".

Wait, but the parsed.path is "/image.jpg", so the image_id would be "/image.jpg". But maybe the image_id is supposed to be the part after the domain, which would be the path. But in that case, the code would return the path as the image_id.

But the function's docstring doesn't specify how to extract the image_id. So according to the problem statement, the code needs to parse the image_href into the three parts. The docstring says that the function returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So the code must extract image_id from the href.

But how? The URL structure is such that the netloc is the domain, and the path is the rest. So the image_id is the path. But maybe the image_id is the part after the domain, which would be the path. So the code as written would work.

But perhaps there's a mistake here. For example, if the image_href is "http://example.com/image.jpg", then the parsed.path is "/image.jpg", so image_id is "/image.jpg". But maybe the image_id is supposed to be "image.jpg", not the entire path. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. So according to the given docstring, the code must return the path as the image_id.

So the code would be as written.

But what about cases where the image_href is not a valid URL? For example, if the href is "example.com", then urlparse would raise a ValueError. So the function would raise ValueError in that case.

So the code would handle that.

But the function's docstring says that it returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl), and raises ValueError if it can't parse. So the code needs to handle that.

So the code would be:

import urllib.parse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)
    if not parsed:
        raise ValueError("Invalid image href")
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    image_id = parsed.path
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, what if the image_href is something like "https://example.com" (no path)? Then parsed.path is "/", so image_id is "/". But maybe that's acceptable.

But the function's docstring doesn't specify any constraints on the image_href, so the code must handle any valid URL.

But what if the image_href is not a URL? For example, if it's "image.jpg", then urlparse would raise a ValueError. So the function would raise ValueError in that case.

So the code is correct.

Now, the user wants the code generated, output only the code. So the answer is the code as written above.
