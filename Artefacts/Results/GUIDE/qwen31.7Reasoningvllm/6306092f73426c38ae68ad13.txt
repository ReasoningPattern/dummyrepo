Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_playbook, and it's supposed to wrap the 'ansible-playbook' CLI. 

First, I need to understand the parameters. The function takes several parameters: ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args. The docstring explains each parameter, so I need to make sure the code reflects that.

The function is supposed to wrap the Ansible CLI. So, I'll need to use the subprocess module to run the ansible-playbook command. But how to handle the parameters?

Let me think about the steps. The playbook_path is a parameter, so the command will be something like 'ansible-playbook' followed by the playbook_path. Then, there are optional parameters like verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args. These need to be passed to the subprocess call.

The ir_workspace and ir_plugin are objects, but the function doesn't use them directly. Maybe they're for logging or context, but the code doesn't need to interact with them. So I can ignore them for now.

The extra_vars is a dict, which can be passed as --extra-vars. The ansible_args is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, I need to combine these into the command line arguments.

Wait, the ansible_args is a dict of arguments to plumb down directly to Ansible. So, I should merge the extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary, then pass them as --extra-vars and other arguments.

But how to handle the verbosity? The verbose parameter is an integer, so when passing to Ansible, it's probably --verbose, but the exact value depends on Ansible's options. However, the function's docstring says 'verbose: Ansible verbosity level', so the code should pass that as the --verbose argument.

So, the command would be something like:

subprocess.run(['ansible-playbook', playbook_path], **kwargs)

Where kwargs includes the extra_vars and ansible_args, and the verbose parameter.

But how to handle the verbose parameter? If verbose is None, maybe it's not passed. But the function's docstring says that verbose is optional. So, the code should handle that.

So, the code would look something like:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    # Combine the extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary
    args = {}
    if extra_vars:
        args['extra_vars'] = extra_vars
    if ansible_args:
        args.update(ansible_args)
    
    # Construct the command
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    
    # Add verbose if provided
    if verbose is not None:
        command.append('--verbose')
        command.append(str(verbose))
    
    # Run the command
    subprocess.run(command, check=True, env=ir_workspace.env, cwd=ir_workspace.cwd)
    # Or maybe use ir_workspace.env and cwd? Wait, the ir_workspace might have the environment and working directory. But the function's parameters are ir_workspace, ir_plugin, etc. The code might need to use those for environment or working directory. But the function doesn't use them in the code, so perhaps they are for logging or context, but the code doesn't use them. So, maybe the code can just use the default environment and cwd.

Wait, the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, but the code doesn't use them. So, perhaps they are for logging or context, but the code doesn't interact with them. So, the code can ignore them.

But the docstring says that ir_workspace is an Infrared Workspace object. Maybe the code needs to use it for the environment or working directory. However, the function's parameters are not used in the code, so perhaps the code can just use the default environment and cwd.

But the problem is that the code needs to be written, and the user wants the code generated. So, the code will have to use the ir_workspace and ir_plugin, but since they are not used in the code, perhaps they are for logging or context, and the code doesn't use them. So, the code can proceed without them.

So, the code would be:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    # Combine the extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary
    args = {}
    if extra_vars:
        args['extra_vars'] = extra_vars
    if ansible_args:
        args.update(ansible_args)
    
    # Construct the command
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    
    # Add verbose if provided
    if verbose is not None:
        command.append('--verbose')
        command.append(str(verbose))
    
    # Run the command
    subprocess.run(command, check=True, env=ir_workspace.env, cwd=ir_workspace.cwd)
    # Or maybe use ir_plugin.env? But the function's parameters are ir_workspace and ir_plugin, but the code doesn't use them. So, perhaps the code uses ir_workspace.env and cwd.

But wait, the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin. The code might need to use them for the environment or working directory. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the code can just use the default environment and cwd.

But the problem is that the code is supposed to wrap the 'ansible-playbook' CLI. So, the code needs to run the command with the correct parameters. The ir_workspace and ir_plugin might be for logging or context, but the code doesn't use them. So, the code can proceed without them.

So, the code would be as above. But the user wants the code generated, and the code must be in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written with the necessary imports and function definition.

Wait, the function is supposed to be part of a module, but the user hasn't specified that. The code will be written as a standalone function.

So, the final code would be:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    args = {}
    if extra_vars:
        args['extra_vars'] = extra_vars
    if ansible_args:
        args.update(ansible_args)
    
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    if verbose is not None:
        command.append('--verbose')
        command.append(str(verbose))
    
    subprocess.run(command, check=True, env=ir_workspace.env, cwd=ir_workspace.cwd)

But wait, the ir_workspace and ir_plugin are not used in the code. So, perhaps the code should use them for the environment and working directory. But the function's parameters are not used, so maybe the code can just use the default environment and cwd. However, the function's parameters are part of the function signature, so the code must include them.

But the code doesn't use them, so they are just part of the function parameters. So, the code can proceed as written.

Another thing to consider is that the 'ansible_args' is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, the code needs to merge that with the extra_vars. For example, if ansible_args has a 'host' key, it would be added as --host.

But the code as written would combine the extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary, then pass them as --extra-vars. However, the code is using the 'extra_vars' key in the args dictionary. So, the code would be:

args = {}
if extra_vars:
    args['extra_vars'] = extra_vars
if ansible_args:
    args.update(ansible_args)

Then, the command would be:

command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
if verbose is not None:
    command.append('--verbose')
    command.append(str(verbose))

But wait, the 'extra_vars' is a dict, and when passed to Ansible, it's used as --extra-vars. So, the code would need to pass that as a key in the args dictionary. But the code is using the 'extra_vars' key in the args dictionary. So, the code would be:

command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
if verbose is not None:
    command.append('--verbose')
    command.append(str(verbose))
if args:
    # Wait, no. The args dictionary is for the extra_vars and ansible_args. But the code is passing them as command line arguments. Wait, no. The code is using the args dictionary to pass the extra_vars and ansible_args as command line options.

Wait, the code is using the args dictionary to pass the extra_vars and ansible_args. But how? Because the args dictionary is not being passed as command line arguments. The code is using the args dictionary to pass the extra_vars and ansible_args as command line options. But the code is not using the args dictionary in the command. So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, the code is combining the extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary, but then the command is just ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path], and the args are not being passed as command line arguments. That's a problem.

Ah, here's a mistake. The code as written doesn't pass the extra_vars and ansible_args as command line arguments. The code is using the args dictionary to pass them, but the code is not using them in the command. So, that's incorrect.

So, the correct approach is to pass the extra_vars and ansible_args as command line arguments. For example, if extra_vars is {'host': '127.0.0.1'}, then the command would have --extra-vars host=127.0.0.1. Similarly, if ansible_args has {'host': '127.0.0.1'}, then the command would have --host 127.0.0.1.

So, the code needs to merge the extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary, then pass them as command line arguments.

So, the code should be:

command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
if verbose is not None:
    command.append('--verbose')
    command.append(str(verbose))
if extra_vars:
    command.extend(['--extra-vars', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in extra_vars.items())])
if ansible_args:
    command.extend(['--', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in ansible_args.items())])

But this approach would combine the extra_vars and ansible_args into the command line arguments. However, the 'ansible_args' is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, the code needs to merge them into the command line arguments.

But the problem is that the 'ansible_args' is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, for example, if ansible_args is {'host': '127.0.0.1'}, then the command would have --host 127.0.0.1.

So, the code should merge the extra_vars and ansible_args into the command line arguments.

So, the correct approach is:

- Combine the extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary.
- Then, for each key-value pair in that dictionary, add them as command line arguments.

But how to do that in the code?

So, the code would be:

command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
if verbose is not None:
    command.append('--verbose')
    command.append(str(verbose))
if extra_vars:
    command.extend(['--extra-vars', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in extra_vars.items())])
if ansible_args:
    command.extend(['--', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in ansible_args.items())])

But this would add the extra_vars and ansible_args as command line arguments. However, the 'ansible_args' is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, the code needs to merge them into the command line arguments.

But the code is supposed to pass the extra_vars and ansible_args as command line arguments. So, the code would need to handle both.

But the problem is that the 'ansible_args' is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, for example, if ansible_args is {'host': '127.0.0.1'}, then the command would have --host 127.0.0.1. But if the extra_vars is {'host': '127.0.0.1'}, then the command would have --extra-vars host=127.0.0.1. However, if both are present, the code would have both --extra-vars and --host, which is correct.

So, the code should merge the extra_vars and ansible_args into the command line arguments.

So, the code would be:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    if verbose is not None:
        command.append('--verbose')
        command.append(str(verbose))
    
    # Combine extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary
    combined_args = {}
    if extra_vars:
        combined_args.update(extra_vars)
    if ansible_args:
        combined_args.update(ansible_args)
    
    # Add the combined arguments as command line options
    for key, value in combined_args.items():
        if key == 'extra_vars':
            # Wait, no. The key is the same as the argument name. So, the code should add --extra-vars key=value.
            # But the combined_args is a dictionary, and the code needs to pass them as command line arguments.
            # So, for each key in combined_args, add --key=value.
            # But the key is the same as the argument name. For example, if the key is 'host', then the command line argument is --host=value.
            # So, the code would need to loop through each key-value pair in combined_args and add them as command line arguments.
            # However, the combined_args is a dictionary, and the code needs to pass them as command line arguments.
            # So, the code would do:
            command.extend(['--', key, value])
        else:
            # For other arguments, like --host, --timeout, etc.
            command.extend(['--', key, value])
    
    # Run the command
    subprocess.run(command, check=True, env=ir_workspace.env, cwd=ir_workspace.cwd)

Wait, but this approach would have the combined_args as a dictionary, and then for each key-value pair, add --key=value. However, the code is adding the -- key=value as command line arguments. But the problem is that the 'extra_vars' is a dict, and the code is adding it as --extra-vars, but in this code, the combined_args is a dictionary, and the code is adding --key=value for each key. So, for example, if the combined_args is {'host': '127.0.0.1'}, then the code would add --host 127.0.0.1. But the 'extra_vars' is a dict, so the code is passing it as --host 127.0.0.1. But the code is not handling the 'extra_vars' key specifically. So, this approach would work.

But the code is not handling the 'extra_vars' key specifically. For example, if the combined_args is {'extra_vars': {'host': '127.0.0.1'}}, then the code would add --extra-vars host=127.0.0.1. But in the code above, the combined_args is a dictionary, and the code is adding --key=value for each key. So, if the key is 'extra_vars', then the code would add --extra-vars key=value. But the code is not checking for that. So, this approach is incorrect.

Ah, here's the mistake. The code is combining the extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary, but the code is not handling the 'extra_vars' key specifically. For example, if the combined_args has a key 'extra_vars', then the code would add --extra-vars, but if the key is something else, like 'host', then it would add --host=value.

But the code is not handling that. So, the code needs to check if the key is 'extra_vars' and handle it differently.

So, the code should:

- For each key in combined_args:
   - if the key is 'extra_vars', then add --extra-vars key=value.
   - else, add --key=value.

But how to do that in the code?

So, the code would be:

for key, value in combined_args.items():
    if key == 'extra_vars':
        command.extend(['--extra-vars', f'{key}={value}'])
    else:
        command.extend(['--', key, value])

But this would only handle the 'extra_vars' key. However, the 'ansible_args' is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, for example, if the ansible_args has a key 'host', then the code would add --host=value.

But the code is combining the extra_vars and ansible_args into the combined_args dictionary. So, the code would have:

combined_args = {}
if extra_vars:
    combined_args.update(extra_vars)
if ansible_args:
    combined_args.update(ansansible_args)

Then, for each key in combined_args, the code would add the corresponding command line argument.

But the code is not handling the 'extra_vars' key specifically. So, the code would need to check if the key is 'extra_vars' and handle it differently.

So, the code would be:

for key, value in combined_args.items():
    if key == 'extra_vars':
        command.extend(['--extra-vars', f'{key}={value}'])
    else:
        command.extend(['--', key, value])

But this would only handle the 'extra_vars' key. However, the 'ansible_args' is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, for example, if the ansible_args has a key 'host', then the code would add --host=value.

But the code is combining the extra_vars and ansible_args into the combined_args dictionary, so the code would have both 'extra_vars' and 'host' keys. So, the code would handle both.

But the code is not handling the 'extra_vars' key specifically. So, the code would need to check if the key is 'extra_vars' and handle it as a separate case.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to pass the extra_vars and ansible_args as command line arguments, regardless of their name.

So, the code would be:

command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
if verbose is not None:
    command.append('--verbose')
    command.append(str(verbose))
if extra_vars:
    command.extend(['--extra-vars', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in extra_vars.items())])
if ansible_args:
    command.extend(['--', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in ansible_args.items())])

But this would add the extra_vars as --extra-vars and the ansible_args as -- and the key=value pairs.

But this approach would work, but the code would have to handle the case where extra_vars is a dict and ansible_args is a dict. For example, if both are present, the code would add both --extra-vars and --host=value.

But the code would need to handle the case where the extra_vars is a dict and the ansible_args is a dict. So, the code would combine them into the command line arguments.

So, the code would be:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    if verbose is not None:
        command.append('--verbose')
        command.append(str(verbose))
    
    # Combine extra_vars and ansible_args into a single dictionary
    combined_args = {}
    if extra_vars:
        combined_args.update(extra_vars)
    if ansible_args:
        combined_args.update(ansible_args)
    
    # Add the combined arguments as command line options
    for key, value in combined_args.items():
        if key == 'extra_vars':
            # Handle extra_vars specifically
            command.extend(['--extra-vars', f'{key}={value}'])
        else:
            # Handle other arguments
            command.extend(['--', key, value])
    
    # Run the command
    subprocess.run(command, check=True, env=ir_workspace.env, cwd=ir_workspace.cwd)

Wait, but the code is not handling the 'extra_vars' key in the combined_args. For example, if the combined_args has a key 'extra_vars', then the code would add --extra-vars. But if the combined_args has a key 'host', then the code would add --host=value.

But in the code above, the combined_args is a dictionary that includes both extra_vars and ansible_args. So, if the extra_vars is a dict, then combined_args will have the key 'extra_vars' with the value being the extra_vars dict. But that's not correct. Because the extra_vars is a dict, and the code is combining it with ansible_args. So, the combined_args would have the keys from both extra_vars and ansible_args.

Wait, no. The code is:

combined_args = {}
if extra_vars:
    combined_args.update(extra_vars)
if ansible_args:
    combined_args.update(ansible_args)

So, if extra_vars is a dict, then combined_args will have the keys from extra_vars. If ansible_args is a dict, then combined_args will have the keys from ansible_args. So, if both are present, the combined_args will have the keys from both.

But the code is adding the 'extra_vars' key as a separate case. So, if the combined_args has a key 'extra_vars', then the code would add --extra-vars. But that's not correct, because the 'extra_vars' is a key in the combined_args, but it's not the same as the argument name. So, this approach is incorrect.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct way is to pass the extra_vars and ansible_args as command line arguments, regardless of their name.

So, the code would be:

command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
if verbose is not None:
    command.append('--verbose')
    command.append(str(verbose))
if extra_vars:
    command.extend(['--extra-vars', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in extra_vars.items())])
if ansible_args:
    command.extend(['--', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in ansible_args.items())])

But this would add the extra_vars as --extra-vars and the ansible_args as -- and the key=value pairs.

But in this case, the 'extra_vars' is a dict, and the code is passing it as --extra-vars. The ansible_args is a dict, and the code is passing it as -- and the key=value pairs.

This approach would work, but the code would need to handle the case where the combined_args has both extra_vars and ansible_args. For example, if the extra_vars is {'host': '127.0.0.1'} and the ansible_args is {'host': '127.0.0.1'}, then the code would add --extra-vars host=127.0.0.1 and --host 127.0.0.1. Which is correct.

So, the code would be:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    if verbose is not None:
        command.append('--verbose')
        command.append(str(verbose))
    
    # Add extra_vars as --extra-vars
    if extra_vars:
        command.extend(['--extra-vars', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in extra_vars.items())])
    
    # Add ansible_args as -- and key=value pairs
    if ansible_args:
        command.extend(['--', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in ansible_args.items())])
    
    # Run the command
    subprocess.run(command, check=True, env=ir_workspace.env, cwd=ir_workspace.cwd)

But this code would handle the extra_vars and ansible_args as separate command line arguments. However, the code is not handling the case where the ansible_args has a key that is also present in the extra_vars. For example, if both are present, the code would add both --extra-vars and --host=value, which is correct.

So, this seems to be the correct approach.

But the code is not using the ir_workspace and ir_plugin, but the function's parameters include them. So, the code is supposed to use them, but the code doesn't use them. So, the code can proceed without them.

So, the final code would be:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    if verbose is not None:
        command.append('--verbose')
        command.append(str(verbose))
    
    # Add extra_vars as --extra-vars
    if extra_vars:
        command.extend(['--extra-vars', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in extra_vars.items())])
    
    # Add ansible_args as -- and key=value pairs
    if ansible_args:
        command.extend(['--', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in ansible_args.items())])
    
    # Run the command
    subprocess.run(command, check=True, env=ir_workspace.env, cwd=ir_workspace.cwd)

But wait, the 'ansible_args' is a dict of arguments to pass directly to Ansible. So, the code is adding them as -- and key=value pairs. But the 'ansible_args' is a dict, so the code is joining the key-value pairs with ' ' and adding them as --key=value. This is correct.

So, this code should handle the parameters correctly.

Now, the user wants the code generated, and the output should be in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as:

import subprocess

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None, extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    command = ['ansible-playbook', playbook_path]
    if verbose is not None:
        command.append('--verbose')
        command.append(str(verbose))
    
    # Add extra_vars as --extra-vars
    if extra_vars:
        command.extend(['--extra-vars', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in extra_vars.items())])
    
    # Add ansible_args as -- and key=value pairs
    if ansible_args:
        command.extend(['--', ' '.join(f'{k}={v}' for k, v in ansible_args.items())])
    
    # Run the command
    subprocess.run(command, check=True, env=ir_workspace.env, cwd=ir_workspace.cwd)

But the user wants the code generated, so the code must be written in Python markdown format, which in this case is just the code.

So, the final answer is the code above.
