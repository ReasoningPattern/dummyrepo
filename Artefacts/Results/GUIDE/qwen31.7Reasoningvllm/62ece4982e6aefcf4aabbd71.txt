Okay, I need to write a Python function called regex_dict that takes a dictionary as input. The function's goal is to convert filenames with wildcards in the keys into their corresponding regex patterns, while leaving the values unchanged. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's docstring says that the keys are filenames with wildcards, and we need to convert them to regexes. So for example, if a key is "file*name.txt", the regex should be "file.*name.txt". But how do I handle the wildcards?

In Python, the re module has a subpattern syntax that allows for wildcards. The pattern for a wildcard is usually a question mark (?) or a star (*), but I need to replace those with their regex equivalents. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says to convert the keys into regexes. So the original keys have wildcards, and we need to replace those wildcards with regex patterns.

Wait, but how do I handle the wildcards in the keys? For example, if the key is "file*.txt", the regex should be "file.*\.txt". So the asterisk (*) is replaced with a regex pattern that matches any number of characters. But in regex, the * is a wildcard, but in the context of a regex pattern, it's a quantifier. Wait, no. Wait, in regex, the * is a quantifier for the previous character. But in the context of a filename, the * is a wildcard. So maybe the function needs to replace each * with .*, but that's not right. Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to replace the wildcards in the keys with their regex equivalents. For example, in the key "file*name.txt", the * is replaced with .*, but that would make the regex "file.*name.txt", which is correct. But wait, the * in the filename is a wildcard, so in regex, it's replaced with .*, which matches any number of characters. But then, the . in the regex would be a literal dot. Wait, but in the original key, the * is a wildcard, so the regex should replace * with .*, but then the . in the regex would be a literal dot. Wait, but in the original key, the * is part of the filename, so the regex should replace the * with .*, but then the . in the regex is a literal dot. So for example, if the key is "file*name.txt", the regex would be "file.*name.txt".

But how do I handle the wildcards in the keys? The function needs to take each key in the dictionary, check if it contains wildcards, and replace them with their regex equivalents.

So the steps would be:

1. For each key in the input dictionary, process it to convert it into a regex pattern.
2. Replace each * in the key with .*, but also handle other wildcards if necessary. Wait, but the problem says that the keys are filenames with wildcards. So the wildcards are * and ? (maybe?), but the problem doesn't specify. However, the function's docstring says "convert *.cpp keys to regex keys", so perhaps the wildcards are * and ? (but the problem doesn't specify). But since the problem doesn't mention other wildcards, maybe we just replace * with .*, and ? with .?.

Wait, but the problem says "convert *.cpp keys to regex keys". So maybe the wildcards are * and ? (but the problem doesn't specify). However, the function's docstring doesn't mention other wildcards. So perhaps the function is supposed to replace * with .*, and ? with .?.

But the problem says "convert *.cpp keys to regex keys", which suggests that the wildcards are * and perhaps ?.

But the function's parameters are a dict where the keys are filenames with wildcards. So the function needs to process each key, replacing the wildcards with their regex equivalents.

So the approach would be:

For each key in the input dictionary:

- Replace any * with .*, but also replace any ? with .?.

But wait, in regex, the * is a quantifier, but in the context of a filename, the * is a wildcard. So perhaps the function is supposed to replace * with .*, and ? with .?.

So, for example, if the key is "file*name.txt", the regex would be "file.*name.txt".

But then, the . in the regex is a literal dot. So the function would replace * with .*, and ? with .?.

So the code would take each key, replace * with .*, and ? with .?.

But how to handle that in Python?

So, the function would process each key by replacing * with .*, and ? with .?.

But wait, what if the key has multiple wildcards? For example, "file**name.txt" would become "file.*.*name.txt", which is correct.

So the code would be:

For each key in the input dictionary:

new_key = key.replace('*', '.*').replace('?', '.?')

Then, the new key is the regex pattern.

But wait, the problem says that the function should convert the keys into regex keys. So the values are left intact. So the function returns a new dictionary where the keys are converted to regex patterns, and the values are the original values.

So the code would be:

def regex_dict(item):
    result = {}
    for key in item:
        # Convert the key to regex
        regex_key = key.replace('*', '.*').replace('?', '.?')
        result[regex_key] = item[key]
    return result

But wait, the problem says that the function is supposed to convert the keys into regex keys. So the keys in the output dictionary are the regex patterns, and the values are the original values.

But what about the original keys? For example, if the input key is "file*name.txt", the output key is "file.*name.txt", and the value is the original value.

But the function's docstring says that the function converts the keys into equivalent regexes and leaves the values intact. So yes, the code above would do that.

But wait, what about the case where the key has other wildcards? For example, if the key is "file?name.txt", then the regex would be "file.?name.txt".

But the problem doesn't mention other wildcards, so perhaps the function is supposed to handle only * and ?.

But the problem's example is *.cpp, which suggests that the wildcards are * and perhaps ?.

But the problem's docstring says "convert *.cpp keys to regex keys", which implies that the wildcards are * and perhaps ?.

So the code above would work.

But let me think about edge cases. For example, if the key is "file.txt", then the regex would be "file.txt", which is correct.

Another case: "file*txt" becomes "file.*txt".

So the code seems correct.

But wait, the function's parameters are a dict, and the function returns a dict. So the code would process each key in the input dictionary, convert it to a regex key, and keep the original values.

So the code would be as above.

But wait, the problem says that the function is supposed to convert the keys into regex keys. So the function is supposed to take the keys (which are filenames with wildcards) and convert them into regex patterns. So the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code would be as follows.
