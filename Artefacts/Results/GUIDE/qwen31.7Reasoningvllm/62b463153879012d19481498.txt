Okay, I need to generate a Python function called files_list that takes a path as an argument and returns the list of files in that directory. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function needs to list the files in the given path. In Python, the os module has a listdir function that can be used here. But I should also consider handling possible errors, like if the path doesn't exist or is invalid.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Return the files in given path." So it's probably expecting a list of filenames. But I should make sure to handle cases where the path is not a directory. Oh right, because if it's a file, listdir would return the file's name, but maybe the function is supposed to list directory contents. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the path is a directory. But the problem statement doesn't specify that. Hmm.

The function's signature is given as def files_list(path):, and the docstring says "Return the files in given path." So perhaps the function is intended to list the files in the directory at the given path. So I should assume that the path is a directory.

But what if the path is not a directory? Well, the function might raise an error, but the problem doesn't specify handling that. The user might expect that the function works as long as the path is valid. So maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the path is a valid directory.

So, the steps would be:

1. Import os module.
2. Use os.listdir(path) to get the list of files and directories in the path.
3. Filter out the directories (like . and ..) and return the remaining files.

Wait, but the problem says "files", so maybe the function should return only the files, not directories. So I need to filter out the directories.

But how to do that? For each item in the list, check if it's a directory. So, for each name in os.listdir(path), check if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(path, name)) is True. Then include it in the result.

But what if the path is not a directory? Then os.listdir would return the files and directories, but the function is supposed to return the files. So maybe the function should handle that, but the problem doesn't specify. The user might expect that the function works as long as the path is valid.

So the code would be:

import os

def files_list(path):
    files = []
    for name in os.listdir(path):
        full_path = os.path.join(path, name)
        if os.path.isfile(full_path):
            files.append(name)
    return files

Wait, but what if the path is not a directory? For example, if the path is a file. Then os.listdir would return the file's name, but the function is supposed to return the files. So in that case, the function would return a list with one element, which is the name of the file. But the problem says "files in given path", so maybe the function is intended to list the files in the directory. So the code above should work.

But what if the path is not a directory? For example, if the path is a file. Then os.listdir would return the file's name, and the code would add it to the list. But the function is supposed to return the files in the path. So if the path is a file, then the function returns a list with one element. Which is correct.

But perhaps the function should raise an error if the path is not a directory. But the problem doesn't specify that. The user might not want to handle that. So the code as written should work.

Another thing: the function should return the list of files. So the code above is correct.

Testing this function: if the path is a directory, it returns the list of files in it. If the path is not a directory, it returns the list of files in the path (which might be a single file or nothing).

So the code seems correct. Now, the user wants the code generated, so I need to write that.

Also, the user mentioned to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as a Python function.

So the final code would be:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """Return the files in given path."""
    files = []
    for name in os.listdir(path):
        full_path = os.path.join(path, name)
        if os.path.isfile(full_path):
            files.append(name)
    return files

But wait, the docstring is part of the function. The user's docstring is:

def files_list(path):
	"""
	Return the files in given path.
	"""

So the code should have the docstring as specified. So the code would include the docstring.

So the code is as above. Also, the import statement is needed. But in Python, the import is at the top. So the code would have import os, then the function.

But the user might not want the import statement. However, the function uses os.listdir and os.path.join, so the import is necessary.

So the code is correct.
