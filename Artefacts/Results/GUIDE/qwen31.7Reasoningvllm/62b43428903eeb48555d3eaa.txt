Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the 'formatmany' method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is part of a class, and it takes 'sql' as a parameter, which is any string. The 'many_params' is a union of an iterable of dicts or sequences of any type. The return type is a tuple of a string and either a list of dicts or a list of sequences.

The docstring says that the function converts the SQL using self._converter.convert_many. So the actual implementation should call that method and return the result.

First, I need to make sure that the function is correctly structured. The parameters are sql and many_params. The return is a tuple of the converted SQL and the result of convert_many.

Wait, the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and either a List[Dict...] or List[Sequence[Any]]. So the first element is a string, and the second is a list of dicts or a list of sequences.

So the code would look like:

def formatmany(self, sql: AnyStr, many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]]) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:
    return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But wait, the docstring mentions that the function converts SQL using self._converter.convert_many. So the code is straightforward. The function just returns the result of calling convert_many on the sql and many_params.

But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly handled. The many_params can be an iterable of dicts or sequences. The convert_many method probably expects those parameters. So the code is correct as is.

I should also check the return type. The return is a tuple of a string and a list. The first element is AnyStr, which is a string. So the code returns the converted SQL as a string, and the result of convert_many as a list.

So the generated code is simply calling the convert_many method and returning the result. The rest is just the function definition with the parameters and return type.

I need to make sure that the code is in Python markdown format, but the user said to output only the code generated. So the answer should be the code block with the function definition.

Wait, the user said to output ONLY the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks and use the correct Python syntax.

So the final code would be:

def formatmany(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:
	"""
	Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many
	"""
	return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But I need to make sure that the return type is correctly specified. The return is a tuple of a string and a list. So the return type is Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[...], List[...]]].

Yes, that's correct. So the code is as above.
