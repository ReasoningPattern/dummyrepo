Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called validate_version_inventories and takes a list of version directories. The docstring says each version should have an inventory up to that point, and we need to track content digests different from the root inventory.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The function is likely part of a class, given the self parameter. The version_dirs is an array of version directory names in sequence, like 1, 2, 3, etc. So, the function needs to check each version directory to ensure there's an inventory, and track any content digests that differ from the root.

Wait, the docstring mentions keeping a record of content digests different from the root. So, maybe the root inventory is a certain directory, and for each version, we check if the content digests in that version's inventory are different from the root's. If they are, we need to record those differences.

But how do we structure this? Let's think about the steps:

1. For each version directory in version_dirs, check if there's an inventory file. Maybe the inventory is a file in the version directory, like 'inventory.txt' or something similar. But the problem doesn't specify the exact file name, so perhaps the function assumes that the inventory is present in each version directory.

2. For each version, we need to compare the content digests (maybe checksums) of the inventory files with the root inventory's digests. If any difference is found, we need to record those.

But how do we get the content digests? Maybe the root inventory's digest is stored somewhere, like in a variable or a file. But the function doesn't have access to that. Wait, the problem says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So perhaps the root inventory's digest is a known value, and for each version, we compare the digest of the inventory file with that value.

But how does the function know what the root digest is? Maybe the root digest is stored in a variable, like self.root_digest. But since the function is part of a class, perhaps the class has a method to compute the root digest, or it's a static variable.

Alternatively, maybe the root inventory is the first version's inventory, and the digest of that is compared to the others. But the problem states that each version should have an inventory up to that point, so perhaps the root inventory is the first one, and subsequent versions' inventories are compared against it.

But the function's docstring says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So, the root inventory's digest is a baseline. For each version, if the inventory's digest differs from the root's, we need to record that.

So, the steps would be:

- For each version directory in version_dirs:
   - Check if the inventory file exists. If not, raise an error.
   - Compute the digest of the inventory file.
   - Compare with the root digest.
   - If different, record the difference.

But how to compute the digest? The problem doesn't specify the exact method, but perhaps using a hashlib object. For example, read the inventory file, compute its hash, and compare.

But the function is supposed to generate code based on the given signature and docstring. So, the code needs to handle these steps.

Now, the function's return type is not specified, but the docstring says it's supposed to validate the versions. So, perhaps it returns a boolean indicating success, or raises an exception if any validation fails.

But the problem says to generate the code, not the tests. However, the user mentioned that the code should be generated based on the function signature and docstring, and the tips mention test-driven development. But the user wants the code generated, not the tests. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format.

So, the code needs to implement the validate_version_inventories function.

Let me outline the code structure:

The function will iterate over each version directory in version_dirs. For each, check if the inventory exists. Then compute the digest of the inventory file. Compare with the root digest. If any difference, record it.

But how to handle the root digest? Maybe the root digest is stored in a variable, like self.root_digest. But since the function is part of a class, perhaps the class has a method to compute the root digest, or it's a static variable.

Assuming that the root digest is stored in self.root_digest, then for each version, we compute the digest of the inventory file and compare.

But the problem says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So, perhaps the function should collect all the differences and return them, or raise an error if any difference is found.

But the function's docstring says "Each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point." So, perhaps the function is supposed to check that each version has an inventory, and also check that the content digests are correct.

But the exact implementation details are not clear. However, based on the docstring, the code should:

- For each version directory in version_dirs:
   - Check that there's an inventory file (maybe named 'inventory.txt' or something).
   - Compute the digest of the inventory file.
   - Compare with the root digest.
   - If different, record the difference.

But how to handle the inventory file? The problem doesn't specify the exact name, so perhaps the function assumes that the inventory is a file named 'inventory' in each version directory.

So, the code would look something like:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    # Assume that each version directory has an inventory file named 'inventory'
    # Check if each version has the inventory
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory')
        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
            # Raise an error or log it
            raise ValueError(f"Version {version_dir} missing inventory file")
        # Compute digest of inventory file
        with open(inventory_path, 'rb') as f:
            content = f.read()
            digest = hashlib.md5(content).hexdigest()
        # Compare with root digest
        if digest != self.root_digest:
            # Record the difference
            self.differences.append((version_dir, digest))
    # If any difference found, return False or raise an exception
    return True

But the problem says to keep a record of any content digests different from the root. So, perhaps the function should collect these differences and return them, or raise an error if any are found.

But the function's docstring says "validate the version inventories", so perhaps it should return a boolean indicating success, or raise an exception if any validation fails.

But the code above would raise an error if the inventory is missing, and record differences otherwise. However, the function's return type is not specified, but the docstring says it's supposed to validate, so perhaps it returns True if all are valid, False otherwise.

But the code needs to handle the case where the inventory is present but the digest differs from the root. So, the code would check for the presence of the inventory, and then check the digest.

But the problem says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So, the code should collect these differences, but the function's return type is not specified. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code, not the tests. So, the code should implement the function as per the docstring.

Another thing: the version_dirs is an array of version directory names in sequence (1, 2, 3...), so the code can assume that the versions are in order.

So, the code would iterate over each version directory in the list, check for the inventory, compute the digest, compare with the root, and record differences.

But the code needs to import os and hashlib. Also, the function should probably have a self.root_digest variable, which is presumably computed elsewhere.

But since the function is part of a class, the code would need to have access to self.root_digest.

So, putting it all together, the code would look like:

import os
import hashlib

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    # Assume that each version directory has an inventory file named 'inventory'
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory')
        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
            # Raise an error or log it
            raise ValueError(f"Version {version_dir} missing inventory file")
        # Compute digest of inventory file
        with open(inventory_path, 'rb') as f:
            content = f.read()
            digest = hashlib.md5(content).hexdigest()
        # Compare with root digest
        if digest != self.root_digest:
            # Record the difference
            self.differences.append((version_dir, digest))
    # If any difference found, return False or raise an exception
    return True

But the problem says to generate the code, and the user wants only the code. However, the code needs to be in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as a function inside a class, but since the user hasn't provided a class, perhaps the code is standalone.

Wait, but the function is part of a class. So, the code would be:

class InventoryValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root_digest = None
        self.differences = []

    def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
        for version_dir in version_dirs:
            inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory')
            if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
                raise ValueError(f"Version {version_dir} missing inventory file")
            with open(inventory_path, 'rb') as f:
                content = f.read()
                digest = hashlib.md5(content).hexdigest()
            if digest != self.root_digest:
                self.differences.append((version_dir, digest))
        return True

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is given as def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):, so the code should have that.

But the user's example shows that the code should be generated, and the output should be in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as a function inside a class, but since the user hasn't provided the class, perhaps the code is standalone.

But the function is part of a class, so the code would need to have the class definition. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the code is written as a standalone function, but that's not possible since the function is part of a class.

Wait, the function is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class. So, the code would need to include the class definition. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the code is written as a function inside a class, but the class is not provided.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be:

import os
import hashlib

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory')
        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
            raise ValueError(f"Version {version_dir} missing inventory file")
        with open(inventory_path, 'rb') as f:
            content = f.read()
            digest = hashlib.md5(content).hexdigest()
        if digest != self.root_digest:
            self.differences.append((version_dir, digest))
    return True

But the problem is that the function is part of a class, and the code needs to have the class definition. However, the user hasn't provided the class, so perhaps the code is written as a standalone function, but that's not possible. Alternatively, the code is written within a class.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the code is written as a function inside a class, but the class is not shown. However, the user's example shows that the code is written as a function, so perhaps the code is written as a standalone function, but that would not make sense.

Alternatively, the code is written as a method of a class, and the class is not shown. But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so the code would be the function as written.

But the function is part of a class, so the code would need to have the class definition. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so perhaps the code is written as a function inside a class, but the class is not shown.

In any case, the code must include the function as per the given signature and docstring. So, the code would be:

import os
import hashlib

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory')
        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
            raise ValueError(f"Version {version_dir} missing inventory file")
        with open(inventory_path, 'rb') as f:
            content = f.read()
            digest = hashlib.md5(content).hexdigest()
        if digest != self.root_digest:
            self.differences.append((version_dir, digest))
    return True

But the problem says to keep a record of any content digests different from the root inventory. So, the code should collect these differences, but the function's return type is not specified. However, the function is supposed to validate, so it might return a boolean indicating success.

But the code above returns True, which is correct if all are valid. If any difference is found, the function would have recorded them, but the return value is True. However, the function's docstring says "validate the version inventories", so perhaps it should return False if any validation fails.

But the code as written would return True, which is correct if all are valid. However, the code may need to raise an exception if any validation fails. But the problem says to generate the code, not the tests.

So, the code as written would check for the presence of the inventory, compute the digest, compare with the root, and return True. If any difference is found, it's recorded, but the function returns True. However, the function's docstring says "Each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point." So, perhaps the function should check that each version has an inventory, and if not, raise an error.

But the code as written raises an error if the inventory is missing. So, that's handled.

Another thing: the code uses self.root_digest, which is presumably a variable in the class. But the code doesn't have it defined. So, the code would need to have that variable.

But since the user hasn't provided the class, the code is written with the assumption that self.root_digest is a variable in the class.

So, the final code would be as above, with the imports and the function.

But the user's example shows that the code is written in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as:

import os
import hashlib

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory')
        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
            raise ValueError(f"Version {version_dir} missing inventory file")
        with open(inventory_path, 'rb') as f:
            content = f.read()
            digest = hashlib.md5(content).hexdigest()
        if digest != self.root_digest:
            self.differences.append((version_dir, digest))
    return True

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so this is the code.
