Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _validate_labels, and it's supposed to check that keys and values in the labels dictionary are valid by calling validate_key and validate_value on them. 

First, I should understand the docstring. The function takes a labels parameter, which is a dictionary. The docstring says that it checks keys and values by validating them using the validate_key and validate_value functions. But wait, the function isn't provided here. So I need to assume that these helper functions exist. 

Wait, the user hasn't provided the implementations of validate_key and validate_value. But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the helper functions are part of the code that needs to be written? Or are they existing? Hmm.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the helper functions are not part of the code that needs to be written here. The task is to implement the _validate_labels function, which uses these helper functions. But since the helper functions are not provided, maybe the code should include them? Or maybe the user expects that the helper functions are already defined elsewhere.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the helper functions are part of the code that needs to be written. Wait, no. The function _validate_labels is supposed to call validate_key and validate_value on the keys and values of the labels dictionary. So the code for _validate_labels would need to loop through each key-value pair in the labels dictionary, validate each key, validate each value, and raise exceptions if any validation fails.

But since the helper functions are not provided, maybe the code should include them? Or perhaps the user expects that the helper functions are already defined. But the problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code for _validate_labels would be written, and the helper functions are assumed to exist.

So, the steps are:

1. Create a function _validate_labels that takes a labels dictionary.
2. Iterate over each key-value pair in the labels dictionary.
3. For each key, call validate_key(key).
4. For each value, call validate_value(value).
5. If any validation fails, raise an exception.

But how to handle the exceptions? The docstring doesn't mention what exceptions to raise. Maybe the helper functions raise exceptions, and the _validate_labels function needs to catch them. But the docstring doesn't specify. Alternatively, perhaps the helper functions return True/False, and the _validate_labels function checks their return values.

Wait, the docstring says "Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().". So perhaps the validate_key and validate_value functions are supposed to return True or raise exceptions. But the exact behavior is not specified. 

Since the helper functions are not provided, the code for _validate_labels must call them. So the code would look like:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

But then, if validate_key or validate_value raises an exception, _validate_labels would catch it. However, the docstring doesn't mention handling exceptions. So perhaps the helper functions are supposed to return True/False, and the code checks their return values. But without knowing the implementation, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the helper functions are supposed to validate the keys and values, and the _validate_labels function is supposed to check that they are valid. So the code would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key, value in labels.items():
        if not validate_key(key):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid key: {key}")
        if not validate_value(value):
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid value: {value}")

But again, without knowing the implementation of validate_key and validate_value, it's hard to know. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code must include the calls to validate_key and validate_value.

So the code for _validate_labels would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

But since the helper functions are not provided, perhaps the code is supposed to include them. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code would be written as a function.

But the user's example shows that the code should be generated, and the helper functions are not part of the code. So the code for _validate_labels is as above.

Wait, but the function is supposed to check that the keys and values are valid. So maybe the code should check that the keys and values pass the validation. So perhaps the helper functions are supposed to return True/False, and the code checks that.

But without knowing the helper functions, it's impossible to know. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must include the calls to validate_key and validate_value.

Therefore, the code for _validate_labels is:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

But since the helper functions are not provided, perhaps the code is supposed to include them. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, so the code would be the function as written.

But the problem says that the function is to be generated, and the helper functions are not part of the code. So the code is just the function that calls the helper functions.

So the final code is:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    for key, value in labels.items():
        validate_key(key)
        validate_value(value)

But the user might expect that the helper functions are defined elsewhere. However, since the problem doesn't provide them, the code must include the calls.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
