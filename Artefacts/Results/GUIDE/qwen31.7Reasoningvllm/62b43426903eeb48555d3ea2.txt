Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _create_converter method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is part of a class, and it's supposed to return a converter instance. The docstring says it creates the parameter style converter, and returns a _converting._Converter object. 

First, I need to figure out what the converter is. Since the docstring mentions _converting._Converter, I assume that's a class in the _converting module. But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of that class. However, the task is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, not on the actual implementation.

So, the method is supposed to create an instance of _converting._Converter. But how? The function is called _create_converter, which suggests that it's a method in a class, maybe part of a larger system. But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I have to make assumptions.

Wait, the function returns a _converting._Converter, which is a class. So the method is supposed to instantiate that class. But without knowing the parameters or the constructor of the converter, I can't write the code. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the converter is created with some default parameters, or maybe it's a factory method.

But the function is called _create_converter, and the docstring says "create the parameter style converter". Maybe the converter is created with some parameters, but the function is supposed to return an instance. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I have to make an assumption.

Wait, maybe the converter is created using a factory pattern. For example, maybe the converter is created by some factory method, but the function is supposed to return the converter. But without knowing the actual implementation, I can't write the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the converter is a simple class that's instantiated with some parameters, but the function is just returning an instance. But since the user hasn't provided the actual code, I have to write a generic example.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return a converter that's created with some default parameters. For example, maybe the converter is created with a default style, or some other default settings. But without knowing the actual parameters, I can't know.

Alternatively, maybe the converter is created using a factory method, but the function is just returning the instance. So the code would be something like:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    return _converting._Converter()

But that's just a guess. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is simply instantiating the converter class.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of the converter class. So the code would be:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    return _converting._Converter()

But maybe there are parameters that need to be passed. However, the function signature doesn't mention any parameters. The function is supposed to return the converter, so the code would be to create an instance of the converter class.

Alternatively, maybe the converter is created with some parameters, but the function is just returning an instance. So the code would be:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    return _converting._Converter()

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Since the user hasn't provided the actual code, this is the best I can do.

Another possibility is that the converter is created with some parameters, but the function is supposed to return it. However, since the function signature doesn't have parameters, the code would just instantiate the class.

So the final code would be:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    """
    Create the parameter style converter.

    Returns the parameter style converter (:class:`._converting._Converter`).
    """
    return _converting._Converter()

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. However, since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of the converter class, this is the best possible answer.
