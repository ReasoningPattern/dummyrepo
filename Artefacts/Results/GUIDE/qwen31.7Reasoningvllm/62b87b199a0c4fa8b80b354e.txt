Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_fill_request_seq. Let me start by understanding the problem. The function needs to check if a given sequence can be converted into a FillRequestSeq, and return a boolean.

First, I should figure out what a FillRequestSeq is. Since the function is called is_fill_request_seq, maybe it's a sequence of fill requests, like in financial trading. But the exact definition isn't given. However, the docstring says it should be converted to FillRequestSeq, so perhaps the function needs to validate that the input sequence meets certain criteria.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a boolean. So the code needs to check if the input sequence is valid according to some rules. But what are those rules? Since the problem doesn't provide details, I need to make assumptions based on common scenarios.

Maybe the FillRequestSeq is a sequence where each element is a fill request, and certain conditions are met. For example, maybe each element is a dictionary with specific keys, or follows a certain structure.

But without knowing the exact requirements, I'm stuck. However, the user expects me to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the input sequence is a valid sequence of fill requests, perhaps with certain properties.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to check if the sequence is a valid FillRequestSeq, which could mean that it's a list of dictionaries with specific keys. For example, each element in the sequence might be a dictionary with 'symbol', 'quantity', 'price', etc.

But since the docstring says "can be converted to FillRequestSeq", maybe the function is supposed to check that the input sequence is a valid representation of such a sequence. So the code needs to validate that the input is a list of dictionaries with certain keys.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check if the sequence is a valid sequence of fill requests, like each element is a fill request object with certain attributes.

But since the problem doesn't provide details, I need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that a FillRequestSeq is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary has at least the keys 'symbol', 'quantity', and 'price'. Also, maybe the quantity and price are positive numbers, and the symbol is a string.

So the function is_fill_request_seq would check that the input sequence is a list of dictionaries with those keys, and that the values are of the correct type.

So the code would need to:

1. Check that the input is a list.
2. Check that each element in the list is a dictionary.
3. Check that each dictionary has at least the keys 'symbol', 'quantity', 'price'.
4. Check that the quantity and price are positive numbers (int or float).
5. Return True if all these conditions are met, False otherwise.

But how to implement this in Python?

Let me outline the steps:

- Check if the input is a list. If not, return False.
- Iterate over each element in the list.
- For each element, check if it is a dictionary. If not, return False.
- For each dictionary, check that it has 'symbol', 'quantity', 'price' keys. If any missing, return False.
- Check that 'quantity' and 'price' are numbers (int or float). If not, return False.
- Also, check that the quantity is positive, price is positive.
- Return True if all checks pass.

So the code would look something like this:

def is_fill_request_seq(seq):
    if not isinstance(seq, list):
        return False
    for item in seq:
        if not isinstance(item, dict):
            return False
        if not all(key in item for key in ['symbol', 'quantity', 'price']):
            return False
        if not (isinstance(item['quantity'], (int, float)) and isinstance(item['price'], (int, float))):
            return False
        if item['quantity'] <= 0 or item['price'] <= 0:
            return False
    return True

But wait, the docstring says "can be converted to FillRequestSeq". Maybe the function is supposed to check that the sequence is a valid sequence, but perhaps the actual validation is more complex. However, without more information, this is the best approach.

Another possible scenario: maybe the FillRequestSeq is a sequence of integers, but that's less likely. Or maybe it's a sequence of strings. But the docstring mentions converting to FillRequestSeq, which suggests that the input is a sequence that can be converted into that structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the sequence is a valid sequence of fill requests, but the actual validation is more about the structure. For example, each element must be a dictionary with certain keys.

So the code I wrote above seems reasonable. Let me test it with some examples.

Test case 1: valid sequence.
seq = [{'symbol': 'AAPL', 'quantity': 100, 'price': 150.0}]
returns True.

Test case 2: missing key.
seq = [{'symbol': 'AAPL', 'quantity': 100}]
returns False.

Test case 3: invalid type.
seq = [100, 150]
returns False.

Test case 4: negative quantity.
seq = [{'symbol': 'AAPL', 'quantity': -100, 'price': 150}]
returns False.

Test case 5: valid but with float price.
seq = [{'symbol': 'AAPL', 'quantity': 100, 'price': 150.0}]
returns True.

So the code should handle these cases.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Check whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and bool is returned." So the function's purpose is to check if the input sequence is a valid FillRequestSeq.

Therefore, the code I wrote should be correct.

Now, the user wants the code generated in Python markdown format, outputting only the code. So I need to write the function as per the given signature and docstring.

So the final code would be:

def is_fill_request_seq(seq):
	"""
	Check whether seq can be converted to FillRequestSeq and bool is returned.
	"""
	if not isinstance(seq, list):
		return False
	for item in seq:
		if not isinstance(item, dict):
			return False
		if not all(key in item for key in ['symbol', 'quantity', 'price']):
			return False
		if not (isinstance(item['quantity'], (int, float)) and isinstance(item['price'], (int, float))):
			return False
		if item['quantity'] <= 0 or item['price'] <= 0:
			return False
	return True

But I need to make sure that the code is correctly formatted. Also, the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks, and the function should be properly defined.

Yes, that's the code. So the answer is the code above.
