Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called paging that takes a response (which is a list) and a max_results integer. The goal is to return a generator that splits the response into pages, each with max_results elements. 

First, I should think about how to split the list. If the response is already split into pages, maybe the function needs to yield chunks of max_results each. But the problem says the response is a list, so perhaps the original response is a single page, and we need to split it into multiple pages.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Return every response with the length of max_results". So the input response is a list, and we need to split it into pages, each of max_results elements. So for example, if the response is [1,2,3,4,5,6] and max_results is 2, the generator should yield [1,2], [3,4], [5,6].

So the approach is to iterate over the response list in chunks of max_results. But how to do that in Python?

A generator function can be used here. The function will yield each chunk. So, for each i in range 0, len(response), max_results, we take the slice response[i:i+max_results], and yield that.

But wait, what if the last chunk is smaller than max_results? That's okay, because the function is supposed to return every response with max_results. So even if the last page has less than max_results, it's still included.

So the code would look like:

def paging(response, max_results):
    for i in range(0, len(response), max_results):
        yield response[i:i+max_results]

But wait, what if the response is empty? Well, the function would return an empty generator, which is correct.

Testing this with some examples. Let's say response is [1,2,3,4,5], max_results is 2. The generator would yield [1,2], [3,4], [5]. That's correct.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a generator object. So the code is correct.

But the function is supposed to be a generator. So the code is as above.

But maybe the function is supposed to handle the case where max_results is zero? Well, the problem says max_results is an int, but probably it's assumed that it's a positive integer. But the code would handle it by not yielding anything if the response is empty, or if max_results is zero. But the problem doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps we don't need to.

So the code is straightforward. The generator yields chunks of max_results elements from the response list.

So the final code is as written.
