Okay, I need to implement the try_retrieve_webfinger_document function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what this function is supposed to do.

The function is supposed to try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document. RFC7033 is the webfinger protocol, which is used for discovering user endpoints. The function returns an optional string, so it can return None if it fails.

First, I need to figure out how to retrieve the webfinger document. Webfinger typically involves making a HTTP GET request to the user's endpoint. The standard URL for a webfinger endpoint is https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger, and the query parameters are handled via the URL.

Wait, the webfinger protocol uses a specific format. The endpoint is usually https://[domain].well-known/webfinger, and the query parameters are in the form of urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:wsdl. So, for a given handle, the URL would be something like https://[handle].well-known/webfinger?xmlns=... etc.

But the exact structure might vary. Let me think. The webfinger endpoint is usually a GET request to https://[domain].well-known/webfinger, and the query parameters are in the form of urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:wsdl. So, for a handle like 'example.com', the URL would be https://example.com/.well-known/webfinger.

Wait, but the handle is a string, so maybe the function is supposed to construct the URL based on the handle. For example, if the handle is 'user@example.com', the URL would be https://user@example.com/.well-known/webfinger.

But how to handle the actual request? The function needs to make a GET request to that URL. Then, parse the response to see if it's a valid XML document.

But the function is supposed to return Optional[str], so if the request is successful, it returns the XML content. If it fails, it returns None.

So the steps are:

1. Construct the URL for the webfinger endpoint using the handle.
2. Make a GET request to that URL.
3. Check the response status code. If it's 200 OK, parse the XML and return the content.
4. If the request fails, return None.

But how to handle the parsing? The webfinger response is XML, so I need to parse it with xml.etree.ElementTree. But the function is supposed to return the string content, so maybe just return the XML as a string, or maybe parse it and return the content.

Wait, the function's return type is Optional[str], so if the request is successful, it returns the XML content as a string. If it fails, returns None.

So the code would be something like:

import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    url = f"https://{handle}.well-known/webfinger"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        try:
            root = ET.fromstring(response.content)
            # Assuming the XML is valid and contains the desired content
            # But the actual structure might vary. Maybe the content is in the first element?
            # Or maybe the XML is structured in a specific way.
            # For example, the webfinger response might have a <Document> element with a <uri> and <tag> etc.
            # But the function is supposed to return the content, so maybe just return the response content as a string.
            return response.content.decode('utf-8')
        except ET.ParseError:
            # If the XML is invalid, return None?
            return None
    else:
        return None

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the content as a string. So, even if the XML is invalid, maybe the function should return None. But the docstring says it doesn't raise if it fails. So, if the request fails (like 404 or 500), return None. If the request is successful but the XML is invalid, return None.

But the function's return type is Optional[str], so even if the XML is invalid, it returns None. So the code would be as above.

But wait, the function is supposed to retrieve the document. So, perhaps the actual content is in the XML, but the function is supposed to return the content as a string. So, the code would be:

But maybe the webfinger response is structured in a specific way. For example, the XML might have a <Document> element with a <uri> and <tag> etc. But the function is supposed to return the content, so maybe just return the response content as a string.

But the function's docstring says "retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document". So, the function is supposed to return the document content. So, the code would be to make the request, check the status, and return the content as a string.

But what if the request is successful but the content is not valid XML? Then, the code would return the content as a string, which might be invalid. But according to the docstring, the function doesn't raise if it fails. So, even if the XML is invalid, the function returns None? Or returns the content?

Wait, the function's return type is Optional[str], so if the request is successful but the XML is invalid, the function returns the content as a string. But that's not necessarily correct. For example, if the XML is invalid, the code would raise an exception when trying to parse it. But the function is supposed to return the content as a string, so maybe the code would return the content as is, even if it's invalid.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to return the document, which is the XML. So, perhaps the function should return the content as a string, even if it's invalid. But that's not really a document. However, the function's docstring says "retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document", which is the XML. So, the function is supposed to return the XML content as a string.

So, the code would be:

import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    url = f"https://{handle}.well-known/webfinger"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        try:
            root = ET.fromstring(response.content)
            # Assuming the XML is valid and contains the desired content
            # But the actual structure might vary. Maybe the content is in the first element?
            # For example, the XML might have a <Document> element with a <uri> and <tag> etc.
            # But the function is supposed to return the content, so maybe just return the response content as a string.
            return response.content.decode('utf-8')
        except ET.ParseError:
            # If the XML is invalid, return None?
            return None
    else:
        return None

But wait, the function is supposed to return the document, which is the XML. So, even if the XML is invalid, the function returns None? Or returns the content as a string?

The docstring says "does not raise if it fails". So, if the request fails (like 404), return None. If the request is successful but the XML is invalid, return the content as a string. But that's not a valid XML, so the function would return an invalid string. However, the function's return type is Optional[str], so it's allowed.

But maybe the function is supposed to return the content as a string, regardless of validity. So, the code would return the content as a string, even if it's invalid.

But in that case, the code would be as above.

But perhaps the actual content is in the XML, and the function is supposed to return the content. So, the code would return the response content as a string.

But then, what if the response is not XML? For example, if the server returns a JSON response. But according to RFC7033, the webfinger response is XML. So, the function is supposed to handle that.

But the function is supposed to return the document, which is the XML. So, the code would be as above.

But the code uses requests, which is a third-party library. The function is supposed to be written in Python, so it's acceptable to use requests.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to be self-contained. However, the code uses requests, which is not part of the standard library. So, the code would need to import requests.

But the user hasn't specified whether to include the imports. However, the code must be generated, and the user expects the code to be in Python markdown format.

So, the code would include the necessary imports.

But the user's example shows that the code is to be generated, so the code would have to include the imports.

So, the final code would be:

import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    url = f"https://{handle}.well-known/webfinger"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        try:
            root = ET.fromstring(response.content)
            return response.content.decode('utf-8')
        except ET.ParseError:
            return None
    else:
        return None

But wait, what if the response is not XML? For example, if the server returns a JSON response. But according to RFC7033, the webfinger response is XML. So, the function is supposed to handle that. However, the code would return the content as a string, which may be invalid XML. But the function's return type is Optional[str], so it's allowed.

But perhaps the function is supposed to return the content as a string, even if it's invalid. So, the code would return the content as is.

But the code as written would return the content as a string, which may be invalid XML. However, the function's docstring says that it doesn't raise if it fails. So, even if the XML is invalid, the function returns the content as a string.

But maybe the function is supposed to return the content, and the caller is responsible for parsing it. So, the code would return the content as a string.

So, the code as written is correct.

But perhaps the function should return the XML content, not the decoded string. For example, if the response is XML, then return the content as a string. But the function's return type is Optional[str], so it's okay.

Another thing to consider: the URL construction. The handle is a string, so the URL is constructed as https://[handle].well-known/webfinger. But what if the handle is empty or invalid? The function is supposed to handle that, but the docstring doesn't mention it. However, the function is supposed to try to retrieve the document, so it's up to the implementation.

So, the code as written should be correct.

Now, the user wants the code generated, so the final code would include the imports and the function as above.

But the user's example shows that the code should be in Python markdown format. So, the code would be written as:

import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    url = f"https://{handle}.well-known/webfinger"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        try:
            root = ET.fromstring(response.content)
            return response.content.decode('utf-8')
        except ET.ParseError:
            return None
    else:
        return None

But the function returns Optional[str], which is from the typing module. So, the code would need to import typing and have Optional[str] as a type annotation.

But the user's code example doesn't include that. However, the code must be generated. So, the code would include the necessary imports and the function with the type annotation.

So, the final code is as above.
