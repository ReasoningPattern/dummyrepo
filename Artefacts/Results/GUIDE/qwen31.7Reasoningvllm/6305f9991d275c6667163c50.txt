Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function set_cut_chars. Let me look at the function signature and docstring again.

The function is called set_cut_chars and takes two parameters: before and after, both are bytes. It returns None. The docstring explains that these bytes are used to delimit slice points. 

So the task is to implement this function. But wait, the user wants me to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned a test-driven approach, so I should think about what tests would be needed.

First, I need to understand what the function does. The function sets the delimiters for splitting a file. So, maybe the class has some internal state that stores these delimiters. For example, maybe the class has attributes like before_cut and after_cut, which are bytes.

But the function is called set_cut_chars, which suggests that it's setting these delimiters. So the function would probably modify these attributes. However, the function's parameters are before and after, which are bytes. So the function would assign these bytes to the respective attributes.

Wait, but the function is written as a method of a class. So the class must have attributes before_cut and after_cut. But the function is called set_cut_chars, which implies that the method is responsible for setting these values.

So, the code would look something like:

class SomeClass:
    def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
        self.before_cut = before
        self.after_cut = after

But the user wants the code generated, so I need to write that. However, the user also mentioned that the output should be in Python markdown format, but the assistant is supposed to output only the code generated.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." But Python markdown is not a standard format. Maybe they mean that the code should be written in Python, and the output should be in a code block using Python syntax.

So the code would be a Python class with that method. But the problem is that the function is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class definition. However, since the function is part of a class, the code would need to define the class.

But the user hasn't provided any other information. So the code would need to include the class definition with the method.

So the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
        """
        Set the bytes used to delimit slice points.

        Args:
            before: Split file before these delimiters.
            after: Split file after these delimiters.
        """
        self.before_cut = before
        self.after_cut = after

But wait, the function's docstring is given. So the code must include that docstring.

But the user's example shows that the function's docstring is part of the function definition. So the code would have the function with the docstring.

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, so the code would have the class definition.

However, the user hasn't provided the class name. But since the function is called set_cut_chars, perhaps the class is named something like FileSplitter or similar. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the class is named something generic.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code must be written with a class that has this method.

So the code would be:

class SomeClass:
    def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
        """
        Set the bytes used to delimit slice points.

        Args:
            before: Split file before these delimiters.
            after: Split file after these delimiters.
        """
        self.before_cut = before
        self.after_cut = after

But the user might expect that the class has attributes before_cut and after_cut. However, the function is called set_cut_chars, which suggests that the method is responsible for setting these attributes. So the code is correct.

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, so the code must include the class definition.

Therefore, the generated code is the class with the method as described.
