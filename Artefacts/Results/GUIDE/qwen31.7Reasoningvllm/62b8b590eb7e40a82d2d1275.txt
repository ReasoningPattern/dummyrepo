Okay, I need to write a Python function called _legacy_mergeOrderings that takes a list of lists (orderings) and returns a new list with no duplicate elements, combining the lists in the order they appear. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says to combine the lists in the sequence of occurrence. So, for example, if the input is [[1,2], [3,4], [1,3]], the output should be [1,2,3,4,1,3], but wait, no duplicates. Wait, no, the function is supposed to combine the lists into a single list with no duplicates. So each element from each list is added, but duplicates are removed.

Wait, the docstring says "Combine multiple lists in the sequence of occurrence into a list with no duplicate elements." So the order of the lists is preserved, and within each list, elements are added in their original order, but duplicates are removed.

Wait, no. Let me re-read the docstring. It says "Combine multiple lists in the sequence of occurrence into a list with no duplicate elements." So the order of the lists is preserved, and within each list, elements are added in their original order, but duplicates are removed. So for example, if the input is [[1,2], [2,3], [1,4]], the output would be [1,2,2,3,1,4], but with duplicates removed. Wait, no. Wait, the function is supposed to combine the lists into a single list with no duplicates. So the order of the lists is preserved, and within each list, elements are added in their original order, but duplicates are removed. So the final list is the concatenation of each list, but with duplicates removed.

Wait, but how? For example, if the input is [[1,2], [2,3], [1,4]], the output would be [1,2,2,3,1,4], but with duplicates removed. Wait, but that's not possible. Because the first list is [1,2], the second is [2,3], the third is [1,4]. So the combined list would be [1,2,2,3,1,4], but duplicates are removed. So the final list would be [1,2,3,4], but that's not right. Wait, no. The function is supposed to merge the lists into a single list with no duplicates. So the order of the elements is the same as the order of the lists, and within each list, elements are added in their original order, but duplicates are removed.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to merge the lists in the order they appear, but each list is processed to remove duplicates, and then the lists are concatenated. But that's not the case. Let me think again.

The function's purpose is to combine multiple lists in the sequence of occurrence into a list with no duplicate elements. So the order of the lists is preserved, and within each list, the elements are added in their original order, but duplicates are removed. So for example, if the input is [[1,2], [3,4], [1,3]], the output would be [1,2,3,4,1,3], but with duplicates removed. Wait, but the first list is [1,2], the second [3,4], the third [1,3]. So the combined list would be [1,2,3,4,1,3], but since 1 is already present, but in the third list, 1 is present again. So the final list would have 1 once, 2 once, 3 once, 4 once, 1 again. Wait, but that's duplicates. So the function is supposed to remove duplicates from the entire combined list.

Wait, but the docstring says "no duplicate elements". So the output list should have all elements from all the input lists, but with duplicates removed. So the order of the elements is the same as the order of the lists, but each list is processed to have no duplicates, and then the lists are concatenated.

Wait, no. Because if the input is [[1,2], [2,3], [1,4]], then the combined list would be [1,2,2,3,1,4], but with duplicates removed, so the final list would be [1,2,3,4]. But that's not the case. Because the order of the elements is preserved. So the first list is [1,2], then the second [2,3], then the third [1,4]. So the combined list is [1,2,2,3,1,4], but with duplicates removed, so the result is [1,2,3,4].

But how to achieve that? The function needs to merge all the lists, and then remove duplicates, keeping the order of the elements as they appear in the original lists.

So the approach would be:

1. Concatenate all the lists in the order they appear.
2. Remove duplicates, keeping the order of the first occurrence.

So for example, if the input is [[1,2], [2,3], [1,4]], the concatenated list is [1,2,2,3,1,4], and the duplicates are removed, resulting in [1,2,3,4].

So the function needs to first merge all the lists into a single list, then remove duplicates while preserving the order.

So the steps are:

- Take the input orderings, which is a list of lists.
- Concatenate all the lists into one big list.
- Remove duplicates from this big list, keeping the order of the first occurrence.

So how to implement this in Python?

The standard way to remove duplicates while preserving order is to use a set, but since the elements can be any type, we need to track the order. So, for each element in the concatenated list, if it's not in a set, add it to the set and to the result list. Otherwise, skip it.

So the code would be something like:

def _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings):
    result = []
    seen = set()
    for lst in orderings:
        for item in lst:
            if item not in seen:
                seen.add(item)
                result.append(item)
    return result

Wait, but that would work. Let's test with the example.

Example 1: orderings = [[1,2], [2,3], [1,4]]

The concatenated list is [1,2,2,3,1,4]. The seen set starts empty. First item 1 is added to seen and result. Then 2 is added. Then 2 is in seen, skipped. Then 3 added. Then 1 is in seen, skipped. Then 4 added. So the result is [1,2,3,4], which is correct.

Another example: orderings = [[1,2], [2,1], [3,4]]. The concatenated list is [1,2,2,1,3,4]. The result would be [1,2,3,4].

Another example: orderings = [[1], [1], [1]]. The concatenated list is [1,1,1]. The result is [1].

So this approach seems correct.

But wait, the function is supposed to combine the lists in the sequence of occurrence. So the order of the lists is preserved, and within each list, the elements are added in their original order, but duplicates are removed. So the code above does exactly that.

So the code would be:

def _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings):
    result = []
    seen = set()
    for lst in orderings:
        for item in lst:
            if item not in seen:
                seen.add(item)
                result.append(item)
    return result

But wait, the function is called _legacy_mergeOrderings, and the docstring says "Combine multiple lists in the sequence of occurrence into a list with no duplicate elements." So the code above seems to do that.

But let me think about the test cases.

Test case 1: input is empty list. Then the output is empty list.

Test case 2: input is [[1,2], [3,4]], output is [1,2,3,4].

Test case 3: input is [[1,2], [2,3], [1,4]], output is [1,2,3,4].

Test case 4: input is [[1], [1], [1]], output is [1].

So the code seems to handle these cases.

But what about if the lists have elements that are not unique? Like [[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [1,4,5]]. The concatenated list is [1,2,3,2,3,4,1,4,5]. The result would be [1,2,3,4,5].

Yes.

So the code seems correct.

Therefore, the Python code is as written above.
