Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called workspace_manager and it's a class method. The docstring says it gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service().

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions that it's a class method, so it's part of a class. The function is supposed to retrieve the workspace manager service by calling cls._get_service() with the service name WORKSPACE_MANAGER.

Wait, the function is a class method, so it's probably part of a class that has a method _get_service() which returns the service instance. So the workspace_manager method would call that method and return the result.

But the problem is that the function is named workspace_manager, and the docstring says it's a class method. So the code would look something like this:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName is a module or a class that has a WOKRSPACE_MANAGER constant. Assuming that ServiceName is a module with a constant SERVICE_NAME, but the docstring says ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER. Wait, the docstring says "ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER", so maybe ServiceName is a class with a static attribute WORKSPACE_MANAGER.

So the code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But the user wants the code generated, so I need to write that function. However, the user also mentioned that the output should be in Python markdown format, but the assistant's previous response was in code blocks. So the answer should be the code.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be in a code block, using triple backticks and the python syntax.

So the correct code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But wait, the docstring is part of the function. The user's docstring is given as:

def workspace_manager(cls):
	"""
	Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
	"""

So the function's docstring is as given. So the code would be the function definition with the docstring.

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be the function definition with the docstring.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check again.

The function is a class method, so it's defined as def workspace_manager(cls):. The docstring is as given. The code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER)

But I need to make sure that ServiceName is properly referenced. Assuming that ServiceName is a module or a class that has the constant WORKSPACE_MANAGER. So the code is correct as written.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
