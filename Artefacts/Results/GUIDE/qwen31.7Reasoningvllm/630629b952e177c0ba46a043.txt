Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_nodeinfo_well_known_document, and it takes url and document_path as parameters. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary with url and document_path.

First, I need to figure out what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions returning a dictionary with url and document_path. But the parameters are url and document_path. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes these two parameters, but maybe there's more? The docstring says "including information such as url and document_path," but the parameters are url and document_path. So perhaps the function is simply returning a dictionary with those two keys.

So the function would take url and document_path, and return a dict like {'url': url, 'document_path': document_path}?

But maybe there's more to it. The function's name suggests it's related to nodeinfo, which might be a part of some API or library. But the user hasn't provided any specific details about what's in the nodeinfo, so maybe the function is just returning the two parameters as is.

Wait, the function's parameters are url and document_path. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary. So the code would be straightforward: return a dictionary with those two keys.

So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {'url': url, 'document_path': document_path}

But wait, the parameter document_path has a default value of None. So in the return statement, if document_path is not provided, it would be None. But the docstring says the function returns a formatted dictionary including those two. So the default is okay.

But maybe the function is supposed to handle cases where document_path is None. But the docstring doesn't mention that. The user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code would just return the two parameters as keys in a dictionary.

So the code is simple. The test cases would need to check that the function returns a dictionary with the correct keys and values. For example, testing with url 'https://example.com' and document_path 'path/to/file' would return {'url': 'https://example.com', 'document_path': 'path/to/file'}.

But since the user mentioned generating unit tests first, but the instruction says to output only the code generated. So the code would be the function as described.

So the answer is the code that returns the dictionary with the two parameters.
