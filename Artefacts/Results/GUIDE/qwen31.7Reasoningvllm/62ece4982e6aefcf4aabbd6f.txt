Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function get_repo_archive based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function takes a URL and a destination path, and it's supposed to download and extract a .tar.gz archive. The archive must contain a 'desc' file for each package. The return value is the path where the archive is extracted to.

First, I need to figure out how to download the archive. Python has the requests library for that. So I'll need to import requests. Then, I'll download the file using requests.get and save it to the destination_path.

Next, I need to extract the .tar.gz archive. The tarfile module in Python can handle this. So I'll use tarfile.open with the mode 'r:gz' to read the archive. Then, I'll extract all files into the destination_path.

Wait, but the destination_path is the path where the archive is extracted. So the function should return that path. But when using tarfile.open, the extract method will extract all files into the destination directory. So the destination_path is the target directory, and the function returns it.

But wait, what if the destination_path doesn't exist? The function should create it, right? Because otherwise, the extraction would fail. So maybe I need to create the directory if it doesn't exist. So I'll use os.makedirs to create the destination directory.

Also, the function needs to handle the case where the URL is invalid or the archive isn't found. But the problem statement doesn't mention error handling, so maybe the code just proceeds as per the given parameters.

Putting it all together:

Import necessary modules: requests, tarfile, os, Path from pathlib.

Define the function get_repo_archive. The destination_path is a Path, so I'll need to use Path objects. But in the function, the destination_path is a Path, so maybe the code will use that.

Wait, the function's parameters are url: str and destination_path: Path. So in the code, the destination_path is a Path object. So when saving the downloaded file, I need to save it to the destination_path, but perhaps the destination_path is the path where the archive is extracted. Wait, the function's return is the path where the archive is extracted to. So the destination_path is the path where the archive is extracted. So the code should download the archive to the destination_path, then extract it there.

Wait, but the destination_path is a Path. So maybe the function is supposed to download the archive to the destination_path, then extract it there. But the function's return is the path where it's extracted. So the code would download the archive to the destination_path, then extract it into the same path.

Wait, but the function's docstring says "the path on disk where to extract archive". So the destination_path is the path where the archive is extracted. So the code would download the archive to the destination_path, then extract it there.

So the steps are:

1. Download the .tar.gz archive from the URL to the destination_path.

2. Extract the archive into the destination_path.

But wait, the destination_path is the path where the archive is extracted. So the code would download the archive to the destination_path, then extract it into the same path.

But how does the extraction work? The tarfile.open will open the archive and extract all files into the destination_path.

So the code would be:

import requests
import tarfile
import os
from pathlib import Path

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    # Download the archive
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to download archive: {url}")
    # Save the archive to the destination_path
    archive_path = destination_path.with_suffix('.tar.gz')
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    # Extract the archive
    with tarfile.open(archive_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    # Return the destination_path
    return destination_path

Wait, but the destination_path is a Path. So when we do destination_path.with_suffix('.tar.gz'), that would create a new path with the .tar.gz suffix. But if the original archive is already .tar.gz, then the suffix is already there. But the function's parameter is the destination path, which is where the archive is extracted. So the code downloads the archive to the destination_path, then extracts it into the same path.

But wait, the function's docstring says that the destination_path is the path on disk where to extract the archive. So the code downloads the archive to the destination_path, then extracts it into that same path.

But what if the destination_path doesn't exist? The code would create it, because when we call extractall, it will create the necessary directories.

But in the code above, when we do tar.extractall(path=destination_path), it will create the directories if they don't exist. So that's handled.

But the function returns destination_path, which is the path where the archive was extracted. So that's correct.

But what if the archive is not a .tar.gz? The code would download it, but the code would try to open it as a gzipped archive. But the function's docstring says that the archive is a .tar.gz, so the code is correct.

But the code as written would download the archive to the destination_path, then extract it into the same path. So the function returns the destination_path, which is the path where the archive was extracted.

But wait, the function's return is the path where the archive is extracted to. So the code is correct.

But what if the destination_path is a directory that doesn't exist? The code would create it when extracting, so that's handled.

So the code seems correct.

But I need to make sure that the destination_path is a Path object. The function's parameter is a Path, so the code uses Path objects.

But in the code, when we do destination_path.with_suffix('.tar.gz'), that would create a new path with the .tar.gz suffix. But if the original archive is already .tar.gz, then the suffix is already there. But the code is downloading the archive to the destination_path, which is a Path. So for example, if the destination_path is '/path/to/dest', then the archive is saved as '/path/to/dest.tar.gz'.

But the function's docstring says that the archive is a .tar.gz, so the code is correct.

So the code should work.

Now, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written with the necessary imports and the function.

But the user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written with the proper syntax.

Also, the code needs to handle the case where the URL is invalid, but the problem statement doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps the code doesn't include it.

So the final code would be:

import requests
import tarfile
import os
from pathlib import Path

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to download archive: {url}")
    archive_path = destination_path.with_suffix('.tar.gz')
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    with tarfile.open(archive_path, 'r:gz') as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    return destination_path

But wait, the code uses 'with tarfile.open(...)' and then 'tar.extractall(...)'.

But the 'tar.extractall' method will extract all files into the specified path. So the code is correct.

But what if the archive is not a .tar.gz? Well, the function's docstring says that the archive is a .tar.gz, so the code is correct.

So this should be the correct code.
