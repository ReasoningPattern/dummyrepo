Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called add_rendition, and it takes two parameters: lang and file_path. The docstring says that it assigns the filepath from filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions of the class.

First, I need to understand what the class looks like. The function is part of a class, so I assume there's a _renditions attribute that's a dictionary or some structure that holds the renditions. The filepath() method must return the path specified by the user, which is passed as file_path here.

So, the function needs to update the _renditions attribute. Let me think about the structure. Maybe _renditions is a dictionary where each key is a language code, and the value is the file path. But the function is adding a new entry for the given lang with the provided file_path.

Wait, the docstring says "assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'lang' in _renditions". So, the filepath() method is called, which returns the file path, and then that path is assigned to the lang key in _renditions.

So, the function should do something like:

self._renditions[lang] = self.filepath()

But wait, the function is called add_rendition, so maybe the _renditions is a class attribute. So, the function would modify that attribute.

But how is the class structured? Let's assume that the class has a _renditions attribute, which is a dictionary. The function adds a new entry to this dictionary with the given lang as the key and the file path as the value.

So, the code would be:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    self._renditions[lang] = self.filepath()

But wait, the docstring says that the filepath() is invoked. So, the function is using self.filepath() to get the file path. But the function is called add_rendition, so maybe the filepath() is a method of the class. So, the function would call self.filepath() to get the file path.

But the function is supposed to assign that path to the lang in _renditions. So, the code would be as I wrote.

But I need to make sure that the _renditions is a dictionary. So, the class must have that attribute. But since the user didn't provide the class definition, I have to assume that the class has a _renditions attribute.

So, the code would be:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    self._renditions[lang] = self.filepath()

But wait, the function is called add_rendition, and the parameters are lang and file_path. So, the code is straightforward.

But maybe the _renditions is a class attribute, and the function is modifying it. So, the code is correct.

Now, the user wants the code generated, output only the code in Python markdown format. So, the answer should be the code block with the function definition.

So, the final code would be:

def add_rendition(self, lang, file_path):
    """
    Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to "lang" in _renditions in the class.
    """
    self._renditions[lang] = self.filepath()

But wait, the docstring is part of the function. The user provided the docstring, so the code must include that.

So, the code is as above. The user wants the code generated, so the answer is the function definition with the docstring.
