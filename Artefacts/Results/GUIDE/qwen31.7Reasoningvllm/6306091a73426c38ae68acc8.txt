Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called list_of_file_names, and it takes two parameters: settings_dirs and spec_option. The docstring says it creates and returns a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

First, I need to figure out what the actual implementation would look like. Since the function is supposed to create an IniType complex type, I guess that's part of a library or module that has a cli.ListOfFileNames() function. But since I don't have access to that library, I need to simulate it.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a new IniType complex type. So maybe the function is supposed to create an instance of IniType using the cli.ListOfFileNames() method. But how does that work? Maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames() returns a list of file names, and then IniType is a class that takes that list as an argument.

But without knowing the exact implementation, I need to make assumptions. Let's think: the function is supposed to create a new IniType, so perhaps it's initializing an instance of IniType with the settings_dirs and spec_option. But the parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option. Maybe the spec_option is a parameter that determines how the files are processed.

Wait, the docstring says "via cli.ListOfFileNames()", which suggests that the function is using that method to get the list of file names. So perhaps the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames() with the settings_dirs and spec_option, then create an IniType instance with that list.

But since I don't have access to the actual cli module, I need to create a mock implementation. Let's assume that cli.ListOfFileNames() returns a list of file names based on the settings_dirs and spec_option. Then, the IniType class is a class that takes a list of file names and does something with them.

So, the code would involve:

1. Importing necessary modules (maybe cli, IniType, etc.)
2. Defining the function list_of_file_names that calls cli.ListOfFileNames() with the parameters, then creates an IniType instance with that list.

But since the user wants the code generated, I need to write the function. However, the user also mentioned that the code should be in Python markdown format, but the instructions say to output only the code generated. So I need to write the function as per the given signature and docstring.

Wait, the function's docstring is given, but the actual implementation is not. So the code would be something like:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    # Call the cli.ListOfFileNames method with the parameters
    file_names = cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)
    # Create an IniType instance with the file names
    return IniType(file_names)

But since the user hasn't provided the definitions of cli.ListOfFileNames or IniType, I need to assume that these are existing modules or classes. However, the user might expect that the code is self-contained, but since the function is supposed to create an IniType complex type, perhaps the code is part of a larger module.

But the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code would be the function as described, using the cli and IniType classes.

So the generated code would be the function with the logic as outlined. However, since the user wants the code in Python markdown format, perhaps using comments or the actual code.

But the user's example shows that the code should be written in Python, so the code would be the function definition with the necessary steps.

Wait, the user's example shows that the code should be generated, and the output should be in Python markdown format. But Python markdown is not a standard format. Maybe the user is expecting the code to be written in a way that's properly formatted with comments or something else.

But given the instructions, the code should be the function as per the given signature and docstring. So the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    # Assume cli.ListOfFileNames returns a list of file names
    file_names = cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)
    # Create an IniType instance with the file names
    return IniType(file_names)

But since the user might expect that the code is self-contained, perhaps the cli and IniType classes are defined elsewhere. However, the user hasn't provided those, so the code would just include the function as described.

Therefore, the generated code is the function with the comments as per the docstring.
