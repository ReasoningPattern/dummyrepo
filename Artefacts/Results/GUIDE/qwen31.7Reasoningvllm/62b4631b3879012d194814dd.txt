Okay, I need to write a Python function called fix_namespace_prefix_w that takes a content parameter. The docstring says it replaces "w:st=" with "w-st=". Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function needs to process the input content. Since content could be a string, maybe a list, or some other structure, but the docstring doesn't specify. The example given is replacing a specific string in the content. So the simplest approach is to check if the content is a string and then replace the substring.

Wait, the function's name is fix_namespace_prefix_w. The docstring says to replace "w:st=" with "w-st=". So the task is to find all occurrences of "w:st=" in the content and replace them with "w-st=".

So the code would be something like:

def fix_namespace_prefix_w(content):
    return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st=")

But wait, what if the content is not a string? Like if it's a list or another data structure? The problem statement doesn't mention handling those cases, so maybe the function is intended to work on strings. The docstring doesn't mention handling other types, so perhaps the function is supposed to assume that content is a string.

Testing this function: if the input is "w:st=abc", the output should be "w-st=abc". If the input is "w:st=abc def", it should become "w-st=abc def".

But the function is supposed to be written based on the given signature and docstring. The user wants the code generated, so the code would be as simple as replacing the substring.

So the code is straightforward. The function returns the content with the replacement. That's all.
