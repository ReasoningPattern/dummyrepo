Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'on' and takes a 'hook' parameter. The docstring says it returns a decorator to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.

First, I need to understand what's going on here. The function is supposed to be a decorator, but it's named 'on' and takes a 'hook' argument. So, the decorator is adding a handler to a registry for that hook.

Wait, the docstring mentions that the decorator adds a handler to the registry in the class. So, the 'on' method is probably part of a class that manages these hooks. Maybe the class has a registry, and the 'on' method is a decorator that adds a handler to that registry.

But the function signature is def on(self, hook):. So, the 'on' method is part of a class, and it's a decorator. So, the decorator is adding a handler to the hook in the registry.

But how does the decorator work? Let's think. In Python, decorators are functions that take a function and return a new function. So, the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry.

Wait, but the function signature is def on(self, hook):. So, the 'on' method is called with a hook, and returns something. But what's the return value? The docstring says it returns a decorator function. So, the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that can be used as a decorator.

Wait, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry. But how does that work? Let's think of an example.

Suppose there's a class called 'Registry' with a method 'on' that is a decorator. The 'on' method takes a hook and returns a function that when called, adds a handler to the registry for that hook.

But the function signature is def on(self, hook):. So, the 'on' method is part of the class, and when called, it returns a decorator. Wait, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that can be used as a decorator.

Alternatively, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that adds a handler to the registry. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that, when called, adds a handler to the registry. But the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which suggests that the 'on' method is a method of the class, not a decorator.

Wait, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to another function. For example, the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that can be used as a decorator.

This is a bit confusing. Let's try to break it down.

The docstring says: "Return a decorator function to add a new handler to the 'hook' in the registry in the class."

So, the 'on' method returns a decorator function. So, the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that can be used as a decorator.

But how does that work? Let's think of an example.

Suppose we have a class called 'Registry' with a method 'on' that is a decorator. The 'on' method takes a hook and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry.

Wait, but the function signature is def on(self, hook):. So, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and when called, it returns a decorator function. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function. For example, the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that can be used as a decorator.

But the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which suggests that the 'on' method is a method of the class, not a decorator.

This is a bit tricky. Let's think of the possible implementation.

The 'on' method is a decorator that adds a handler to the registry. So, the 'on' method is a function that takes a hook and returns a function that can be used as a decorator.

Wait, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to another function. For example, the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that, when called, adds a handler to the registry.

But how does that work? Let's think of the code.

Let's say the class has a registry, and the 'on' method is a decorator that adds a handler to the registry for the given hook.

So, the 'on' method would look something like this:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry for hook
        return func
    return decorator

But then, the 'on' method would return a decorator function. But the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method. So, perhaps the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to another function.

Wait, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function. For example, the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that can be used as a decorator.

But the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method. So, perhaps the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry.

Alternatively, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a class, but that's not clear.

This is a bit confusing. Let's think of the possible code.

The function is supposed to return a decorator function. So, the 'on' method is a function that returns a decorator. So, the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry for hook
        return func
    return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and returns a decorator. But how does that work?

Alternatively, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry.

But the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method. So, perhaps the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and the 'hook' is the name of the hook, and the function is the handler.

But the docstring says that the 'on' method returns a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.

So, the 'on' method is a decorator that takes a hook and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry.

So, the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry for hook
        return func
    return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and returns a decorator. But how is this used?

Alternatively, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and the 'hook' is the name of the hook, and the function is the handler.

But the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method. So, perhaps the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and the 'hook' is the name of the hook, and the function is the handler.

But the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method. So, perhaps the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and returns a function that adds a handler to the registry.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to implement the 'on' method as a decorator that adds a handler to the registry for the given hook.

So, the code would be:

class Registry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hooks = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            self.hooks[hook] = self.hooks.get(hook, []) + [func]
            return func
        return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the Registry class, and returns a decorator. But the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is correct.

But the user's function signature is def on(self, hook):, so the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry for hook
        return func
    return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and returns a decorator. But how is this used?

Alternatively, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and the 'hook' is the name of the hook. So, the code would be:

def on(hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry for hook
        return func
    return decorator

But then, the function signature is def on(hook):, which is not a method. So, the user's function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method.

So, the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            # add func to the registry for hook
            return func
        return decorator

But then, the function signature is def on(hook):, which is not a method. So, the user's function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method.

So, the code would be:

            # add func to the registry for hook

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and returns a decorator. But how is this used?

Perhaps the 'on' method is part of a class that has a registry, and the 'on' method is a decorator that adds a handler to the registry.

So, the code would be:

class Registry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hooks = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            self.hooks[hook] = self.hooks.get(hook, []) + [func]
            return func
        return decorator

But then, the function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is correct.

But the user's function signature is def on(self, hook):, so the code would be:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry for hook
        return func
    return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and returns a decorator. But how is this used?

Alternatively, maybe the 'on' method is a decorator that is applied to a function, and the 'hook' is the name of the hook. So, the code would be:

def on(hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry for hook
        return func
    return decorator

But then, the function signature is def on(hook):, which is not a method. So, the user's function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method.

So, the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            # add func to the registry for hook
            return func
        return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and returns a decorator. But the 'decorator' function is not using the 'hook' parameter. So, perhaps the 'decorator' function is supposed to add the function to the registry for the given hook.

But in the code above, the 'decorator' function is not using the 'hook' parameter. So, that's a problem.

Ah, right. The 'decorator' function needs to know the 'hook' parameter. So, the code should be:

def on(self, hook):
    def decorator(func):
        # add func to the registry for hook
        self.hooks[hook] = self.hooks.get(hook, []) + [func]
        return func
    return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and returns a decorator. But the 'decorator' function is using the 'self' and 'hook' parameters.

So, the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hooks = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            self.hooks[hook] = self.hooks.get(hook, []) + [func]
            return func
        return decorator

But then, the 'on' method is a method of the class, and returns a decorator. The 'decorator' function is using 'self.hooks' to store the handlers for the hook.

So, this seems to fit the docstring.

But the user's function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is correct.

So, the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hooks = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            self.hooks[hook] = self.hooks.get(hook, []) + [func]
            return func
        return decorator

But the user's function is supposed to return a decorator function. So, the 'on' method is a method that returns a decorator.

But in this code, the 'on' method is a method that returns a decorator. So, the code is correct.

So, the final code would be:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hooks = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            self.hooks[hook] = self.hooks.get(hook, []) + [func]
            return func
        return decorator

But the user's function is supposed to be a function, not a class. Wait, the original question says that the function is called 'on' and has the given signature. But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class.

Wait, the original problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the function is part of a class, and the code is to be generated for that class.

So, the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hooks = {}

    def on(self, hook):
        def decorator(func):
            self.hooks[hook] = self.hooks.get(hook, []) + [func]
            return func
        return decorator

But the user's function is supposed to be a function, not a class. Wait, no. The function signature is def on(self, hook):, which is a method of a class. So, the code is for a class.

So, the code is as above.

But the user's docstring says that the 'on' method returns a decorator function to add a new handler to the "hook" in the registry in the class.

So, the code is correct.

But the user's example shows that the function is called 'on' and has the given signature. So, the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
