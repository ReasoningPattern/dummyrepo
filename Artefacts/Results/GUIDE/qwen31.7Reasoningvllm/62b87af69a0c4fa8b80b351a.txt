Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_compute_el that checks if an object's class has the fill and compute methods. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's docstring says it checks if the obj class has both fill and compute methods. So, the goal is to determine if both methods exist in the class of the given object.

In Python, to check if a method exists in a class, I can use the hasattr() function. But wait, hasattr checks if the class has the method, not the instance. But since the function is called on the obj, maybe it's supposed to check the class of obj. Wait, the function's parameter is obj, but the docstring says "the obj class". So, the function should check if the class of obj has the fill and compute methods.

So, the steps are: check if the class of obj has the 'fill' method and the 'compute' method.

So, the code would be something like:

return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')

But wait, what if the methods are not present? Then the function returns False.

So, the function returns True if both methods exist, else False.

So, the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'compute')

Wait, but what if the methods are not present? Then the function returns False, which is correct.

Testing this function: if the class of obj has both methods, returns True; otherwise, False.

Yes, that should work. Let me think about possible edge cases. For example, if the obj is a subclass, but the parent class has the methods. But the function checks the class of obj, so that's handled.

So the code is straightforward. The tests would be something like:

Test case 1: obj is an instance of a class that has both methods. Expected True.

Test case 2: obj is an instance of a class that has only one method. Expected False.

Test case 3: obj is an instance of a class that has neither. Expected False.

Test case 4: obj is an instance of a class that has one method. Expected False.

So, the code should pass these tests.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
