Okay, let's tackle this problem. The function vertex3tuple is supposed to take a list of vertices (probably a list of tuples) and return a new list where each element is a tuple containing the vertex and the two points on either side. Hmm, the docstring says it's for a polygon, so maybe each vertex is part of a polygon, and for each vertex, we need to get the vertex itself and the two adjacent points.

Wait, the function's parameters are called vertices, but the docstring mentions "vertices to be converted". Wait, the function's name is vertex3tuple, which suggests that the input is a list of vertices, perhaps tuples, and the output is a list of tuples where each element is a triplet: the original vertex and the two adjacent points.

But the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. So, for each vertex in the input list, we need to get the vertex itself, and then the two points on either side. But how are the points on either side determined?

Wait, maybe the input is a list of points, and each vertex is part of a polygon. For example, if the input is a list of points, then for each vertex, we take the vertex, and the two adjacent points. But if the index is out of bounds, we wrap around to the start or end of the list.

Wait, the function's return is a list where each element is a tuple. So, for each vertex in the input list, we need to create a tuple that includes the vertex and the two adjacent points. But how are the adjacent points determined?

Let me think. Suppose the input is a list of points, like [p0, p1, p2, p3]. For each vertex, say p1, the two adjacent points would be p0 and p2. So, for each index i, the vertex is vertices[i], and the two adjacent points are vertices[i-1] and vertices[i+1], with wrap-around. So, for i=0, the previous is vertices[-1], and next is vertices[1].

So, the function would loop through each index i in the vertices list. For each i, create a tuple (vertices[i], vertices[i-1], vertices[i+1]), but with wrap-around for i=0 and i=len(vertices)-1.

But wait, the function's docstring says "the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So, for each vertex, we need the vertex itself, and the two points on either side. So, the output is a list of tuples where each tuple is (vertex, left, right). So, for each vertex, the left is the previous vertex, and the right is the next vertex.

So, the code would be something like:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        vertex = vertices[i]
        left = vertices[(i-1) % len(vertices)]
        right = vertices[(i+1) % len(vertices)]
        result.append((vertex, left, right))
    return result

Wait, but the function's parameters are called vertices, but the docstring says "vertices to be converted". But the function's name is vertex3tuple, which suggests that the input is a list of vertices, and the output is a list of triplets. But the function's parameters are vertices, which is a list. So, the code would take the input list, loop through each index, and for each, create a tuple with the vertex, left, and right.

But the problem says that if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. So, the modulo operation is necessary here. For example, if i is 0, then i-1 is -1, which mod len(vertices) would be len(vertices)-1. Similarly, i+1 would be 1, which is fine.

So, the code would be as I wrote above. But let's check the test cases.

Wait, the user hasn't provided any test cases, but the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be as written.

But the function's return is a list where the elements of vertices are represented by tuples. So, the input is a list of vertices (probably tuples), and the output is a list of tuples where each tuple is (vertex, left, right).

So, the code would be:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(vertices)):
        vertex = vertices[i]
        left = vertices[(i-1) % len(vertices)]
        right = vertices[(i+1) % len(vertices)]
        result.append((vertex, left, right))
    return result

But wait, the docstring says "the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". So, for each vertex, the two points on both sides. So, the left and right are the previous and next points. So, the code is correct.

But what if the input is empty? Well, the function would return an empty list, which is handled.

So, the code should be as above. Now, the user wants the code generated, output only the code in Python markdown format. So, the answer is the code as written.
