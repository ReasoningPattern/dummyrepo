Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function make_parsers as described. The docstring says it builds a parser and its subparsers and returns them as a tuple. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, the argparse module is commonly used for parsing command-line arguments. So the function should probably use argparse to create the parsers.

The function needs to return a tuple of the main parser and its subparsers. So, I'll need to create a main parser, add subparsers, and then return them.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Import argparse.
2. Create a main parser using argparse.ArgumentParser.
3. Create subparsers using subparsers = parser.add_subparsers().
4. Each subparser will have a description, and maybe some arguments.
5. Return a tuple (parser, subparsers).

But wait, the function is supposed to build the parser and its subparsers. So maybe the subparsers are part of the main parser. So the function returns (parser, subparsers).

But how to structure the code? Let me think.

The code would look like:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Some description')
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    # Add subparsers here
    return (parser, subparsers)

But the problem is that the subparsers need to be added with their own arguments. However, the function as given doesn't have any parameters. So the user might expect that the subparsers are added with some default arguments or that the function is supposed to generate them in a way that they can be used later.

But the problem statement says that the function is to "build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple." So perhaps the function is supposed to create a basic structure, and the actual subparsers are added in the code. But since the function doesn't have parameters, maybe the subparsers are added with some default options.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided any specific details about the subparsers. So maybe the function is supposed to create a basic parser with a subparser, and return them. For example, maybe the subparsers are added with a default command.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the parser and subparsers, and the user can then add their own commands to the subparsers.

But since the function is supposed to be self-contained, maybe the code is just creating the parser and subparsers, and returning them. So the code would be:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    return (parser, subparsers)

But then, the subparsers are not actually used. However, the function is supposed to build them. So maybe that's acceptable.

But perhaps the user expects that the subparsers are added with some commands. But since the function doesn't have parameters, maybe the code is just creating the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the parser and subparsers, and the user can then add their own commands to the subparsers.

So the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the function returns a tuple of the parser and subparsers.

Another thing to consider: the argparse module's add_subparsers() returns a SubParsersAction, which is an object that can be used to add subparsers. So the code would be correct.

So the final code would be:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    return (parser, subparsers)

But maybe the user expects that the subparsers are added with some commands. However, since the function doesn't have parameters, perhaps that's not necessary. The function is just supposed to create the structure.

Therefore, the code is as above. Let me check if there are any other considerations.

The docstring says "return them as a tuple." So the parser and subparsers are returned. The parser is the main one, and subparsers are the subparsers. So the code is correct.

So the generated code is as written.
