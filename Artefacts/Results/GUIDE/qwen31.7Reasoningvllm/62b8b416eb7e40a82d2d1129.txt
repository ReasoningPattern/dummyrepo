Okay, I need to generate Python code for the 'names' method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is part of a class, and it's called 'names' with a parameter 'all' which is a boolean. The docstring says it returns the attribute names of the current class. So, the goal is to implement this method.

First, I need to figure out how to get the attribute names of the current class. In Python, you can use the __dict__ attribute of a class to get its attributes. But wait, __dict__ includes both instance attributes and class attributes. However, the problem says "attribute names of current class," which likely refers to the class's own attributes, not the instance's.

So, the method should return a list of the names of the class's attributes. But how to get those names? The __dict__ attribute of the class contains all the attributes, and we can iterate over them to get the keys.

But wait, the __dict__ of a class includes both instance and class attributes. However, the problem might be referring to the class's attributes, not the instance's. So, the method should return the keys in the class's __dict__.

But wait, the method is part of a class, so perhaps the class is the one being referred to. So, the method would access the class's __dict__ and return the keys.

So, the code would be something like:

def names(self, all=False):
    return list(self.__dict__.keys())

But wait, the parameter 'all' is a boolean. The docstring says "Return the attribute names of current class." So, if all is True, maybe it returns all attributes, otherwise, it returns the ones that are not instance attributes. Wait, but how to differentiate between instance and class attributes.

Wait, the __dict__ of a class includes both instance and class attributes. But when you create a class, the __dict__ of the class includes all the attributes, including those defined in the class itself. So, if the method is called on the class, then self would be the class, and self.__dict__ would contain all the attributes.

But in Python, when you have a class, the __dict__ of the class includes all the attributes, including those defined in the class. So, if the method is called on the class, then self is the class, and self.__dict__ would have all the attributes.

But the problem says "attribute names of current class." So, perhaps the method is supposed to return the names of the class's attributes, regardless of whether they are instance or class attributes. But in that case, the code would be as simple as returning the keys of the class's __dict__.

But then, the parameter 'all' is present. Maybe the 'all' parameter is to indicate whether to include all attributes, including those from the instance. Wait, but if the method is called on the class, then self is the class, and self.__dict__ includes all attributes. So, perhaps the 'all' parameter is a red herring, or maybe it's meant to be used when the method is called on an instance.

Wait, the function signature is def names(self, all=False). So, the method is part of a class, and it's called on an instance. But the docstring says "Return the attribute names of current class." So, perhaps the method is called on the class, but the parameter 'all' is a boolean that determines whether to include all attributes or not.

But this is a bit confusing. Let me think again.

If the method is called on an instance, then self is an instance, and self.__dict__ contains the instance's attributes. But the docstring says "attribute names of current class," which would be the class's attributes, not the instance's. So, perhaps the method is supposed to return the class's attributes, regardless of whether it's called on the class or an instance.

But how to get the class's attributes. For example, if the method is called on the class, then self is the class, and self.__dict__ would have all the attributes. But if the method is called on an instance, then self is an instance, and self.__dict__ has the instance's attributes. So, perhaps the method is supposed to return the class's attributes, regardless of whether it's called on the class or an instance.

But how to get the class's attributes. Well, if the method is called on the class, then self is the class, and self.__dict__ is the class's attributes. If the method is called on an instance, then self is the instance, and self.__dict__ is the instance's attributes. But the docstring says "attribute names of current class," which would be the class's attributes, not the instance's.

So, perhaps the method is supposed to return the class's attributes, and the 'all' parameter is a boolean that determines whether to include all attributes or not. But how to get the class's attributes.

Wait, maybe the method is supposed to return the names of the attributes of the current class, which is the same as the class's __dict__ keys. So, regardless of whether it's called on the class or an instance, the method would return the class's attributes. But that's not possible because when called on an instance, self is the instance, and self.__dict__ is the instance's attributes.

This is a bit confusing. Maybe the 'all' parameter is a way to include all attributes, including those from the instance. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'all' parameter is a way to include all attributes, including those from the instance. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to return the names of the attributes of the current class, which is the same as the class's __dict__ keys. So, the code would be:

def names(self, all=False):
    if all:
        return list(self.__dict__.keys())
    else:
        # maybe return a subset, but the docstring doesn't specify. Since the docstring says "attribute names of current class," perhaps the default is to return all attributes.

But the docstring says "Return the attribute names of current class." So, perhaps the default is to return all attributes. But the 'all' parameter is present, so maybe it's a way to include all attributes.

But without more information, perhaps the code is as simple as returning the keys of the class's __dict__.

But the method is part of a class, so when called on the class, self is the class, and self.__dict__ is the class's attributes. So, the code would be:

def names(self, all=False):
    return list(self.__dict__.keys())

But then, the 'all' parameter is not used. Maybe the 'all' parameter is a red herring, or perhaps it's meant to be used when the method is called on an instance. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the 'all' parameter is to indicate whether to include all attributes, including those from the instance. But that would be impossible because when called on an instance, self is the instance, and self.__dict__ is the instance's attributes. So, the class's attributes would be in self.__dict__ of the class, not the instance.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the problem is that the method is supposed to return the names of the attributes of the current class, and the 'all' parameter is a boolean that determines whether to include all attributes or not. But how to get the class's attributes.

In any case, based on the given function signature and docstring, the code is as above.
