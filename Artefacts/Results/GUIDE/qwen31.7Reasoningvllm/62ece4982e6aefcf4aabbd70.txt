Okay, I need to write a Python function called os_is_mac() that checks if the operating system is macOS. Let me think about how to do this.

First, I remember that in Python, the os module has functions to get system information. The os.name variable can tell me if it's a Unix-based system. But macOS is a Unix-based system, so os.name would be 'posix' for macOS. But wait, sometimes people use 'mac' instead of 'posix' for macOS. Hmm, maybe I should check the platform.

Wait, the os module's name is 'posix' for macOS, but maybe the platform module's system() function can give more specific info. Oh right, the platform module has platform.system() which returns 'Darwin' for macOS. So maybe the function should check if platform.system() is 'Darwin'.

Alternatively, using os.name might be more straightforward. Let me check: for macOS, os.name is 'posix', and platform.system() is 'Darwin'. So perhaps the function can check if platform.system() == 'Darwin' or os.name == 'posix'.

But wait, sometimes on Windows, os.name is 'nt', and platform.system() is 'Windows'. So for macOS, both os.name and platform.system() would return 'posix' and 'Darwin' respectively. So the function can check if platform.system() == 'Darwin' or os.name == 'posix'.

But maybe the best way is to use the platform module's system() function. Because that's more specific. So the function would return True if platform.system() == 'Darwin', otherwise False.

Wait, but what about other Unix-like systems? Like Linux or BSD. If someone calls this on a Linux system, it would return False. That's correct.

So the code would be:

import platform

def os_is_mac():
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

But wait, maybe the user wants to check the os.name. Let me think. For macOS, os.name is 'posix', but on other Unix systems, it's 'posix' as well. So checking os.name == 'posix' would also work. But then, for macOS, platform.system() is 'Darwin', and os.name is 'posix'. So both conditions would be true. But the function needs to return True only when it's macOS.

So perhaps the correct approach is to check if platform.system() == 'Darwin' or os.name == 'posix'? Wait, no. Because on macOS, both would be true. But if someone is on a Linux system, os.name is 'posix' and platform.system() is 'Linux'. So in that case, the function would return False, which is correct.

Wait, but if I check platform.system() == 'Darwin' or os.name == 'posix', then on macOS, both are true, so returns True. On Linux, os.name is 'posix' and platform.system() is 'Linux', so returns False. That's correct.

But maybe the best way is to check platform.system() == 'Darwin'. Because that's more specific. But I need to make sure that the function returns True only when it's macOS.

So the code would be:

import platform

def os_is_mac():
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

But wait, what about when the system is macOS but the os.name is something else? No, because on macOS, os.name is 'posix'. So platform.system() is 'Darwin', and os.name is 'posix'. So the function would return True.

But maybe the user wants to check if it's macOS, not just Darwin. But Darwin is the name of the OS. So yes, checking platform.system() == 'Darwin' is correct.

So the code should be:

import platform

def os_is_mac():
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

But I should also consider that sometimes, especially in older versions, the platform.system() might return 'MacOS' or something else. But according to the standard, platform.system() returns 'Darwin' for macOS. So this should work.

So the function is straightforward. The tests would be:

Test case 1: macOS system. Expected True.

Test case 2: Linux system. Expected False.

Test case 3: Windows system. Expected False.

Test case 4: Darwin (macOS) but with a different name. Wait, but Darwin is the correct name. So the test cases would be as mentioned.

So the code is as above. Now, I need to write the code in Python markdown format, output only the code generated.
