Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called check_sender_and_entity_handle_match that takes two parameters, sender_handle and entity_handle. The docstring says it returns True if they are the same, else False.

Hmm, the function is straightforward. But wait, what if the inputs are not strings? Well, the problem doesn't mention handling different data types, so maybe we just compare them directly. But maybe the function is supposed to check if both are strings and equal? The docstring doesn't specify, but the function's purpose is to check if the sender handle matches the entity handle. So perhaps the function is meant to check if both are the same, regardless of their type. But maybe the parameters are expected to be strings. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, so I should follow that.

So the code would be as simple as returning sender_handle == entity_handle. But wait, maybe there's a catch. Like, what if one is None? But the docstring doesn't mention handling that. So the function just compares the two parameters directly.

So the code would be:

def check_sender_and_entity_handle_match(sender_handle, entity_handle):
    """Check whether sender_handle is the same as entity_handle. If yes, return True. Otherwise, return False."""
    return sender_handle == entity_handle

That's all. The tests would be simple, like testing when they are equal and when they are not. But since the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, I just need to write the function as per that.
