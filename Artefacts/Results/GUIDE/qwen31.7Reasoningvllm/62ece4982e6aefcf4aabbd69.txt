Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function _replace_register based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding the function's purpose.

The docstring says that the function replaces the value of flow_params at register_number with the value from register_value and then deletes the entry at register_value. So, the function is modifying the flow_params dictionary by replacing one entry with another and then removing the second one.

First, I need to check if the register_number is a valid key in flow_params. But the function doesn't handle that; maybe it's assumed that the parameters are valid. So, I'll proceed under the assumption that register_number exists in flow_params.

The steps are: replace flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value], then delete flow_params[register_value]. But wait, if register_value is the same as register_number, then replacing and deleting would do nothing. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that case, so I'll proceed as is.

So, the code would look like this: take flow_params, replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, then remove the key register_value.

In Python, dictionaries have a .popitem() method, but if you want to remove a specific key, you can do flow_params.pop(register_value). However, if the key isn't present, it will raise a KeyError. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that, so I'll assume that register_value is present.

So the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    # Replace the value of register_number with register_value's value
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    # Delete the entry at register_value
    del flow_params[register_value]

Wait, but what if register_value is not a key in flow_params? Then del will raise an error. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps the caller ensures that register_value is present. So the code is as above.

Testing this function: let's say flow_params is {'a': 1, 'b': 2}. If register_number is 'a' and register_value is 'b', then after replacement, flow_params is {'a': 2, 'b': 2}, then del 'b' leaves {'a': 2}.

Another test case: if register_number is 'b' and register_value is 'a', then flow_params becomes {'b': 1, 'a': 1}, then del 'a' leaves {'b': 1}.

So the code seems correct. The function modifies the original dictionary, which is acceptable if the caller expects it. The docstring says "delete flow_params[register_value]", which is exactly what the code does.

So the generated code is as written above.
