Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_choices_args function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is supposed to check if the provided args are one of the available choices. But wait, the docstring doesn't mention what the available choices are. Hmm, maybe the choices are defined elsewhere, like in the class or another part of the code. But the function is called validate_choices_args, so perhaps the choices are stored in the class's attributes.

Wait, the function's parameters are 'args', but the docstring doesn't specify what 'args' is. Maybe 'args' is a list or a dictionary of parameters. But the function's purpose is to validate that each argument in 'args' is one of the available choices. However, without knowing the specific choices, I can't hardcode them. Oh, but maybe the choices are stored in the class's attributes, like a list or a set. For example, maybe the class has a variable called CHOICES, which contains the allowed values.

But the function is part of a class, so perhaps the class has a method that checks the choices. Wait, the function is called validate_choices_args, which suggests that it's a method of a class. So, the function is part of a class, and the choices are probably stored in the class's attributes.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the specific choices. So, how can I write the code? Maybe the choices are passed as a parameter, but the docstring doesn't mention that. Wait, the function's parameters are 'args', but the docstring doesn't specify what 'args' is. That's a problem. Because without knowing what 'args' is, I can't determine how to validate the choices.

Wait, maybe the 'args' is a list of parameters, and each parameter needs to be checked against the available choices. But without knowing the specific choices, I can't write the code. Unless the choices are stored in the class's attributes. For example, maybe the class has a variable called CHOICES, which is a list of allowed values.

But the function's docstring doesn't mention that. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is in the CHOICES list. But how to implement that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' themselves are in the CHOICES. But that's not clear.

Wait, the function's docstring says: "Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices." So, perhaps 'args' is a list of values, and each value needs to be checked against the choices. But again, without knowing the choices, I can't proceed.

Hmm, maybe the choices are passed as a parameter. But the function's parameters are 'args', which is the received arguments. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the choices. But how to know the choices?

This is a problem. The user hasn't provided the specific choices. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a template, and the actual implementation would depend on the class's attributes.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a class that has a method to validate choices. For example, the class might have a CHOICES attribute, and the function checks that each argument in 'args' is in that list.

But since the user hasn't provided that, I need to make assumptions. Let me think: perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the allowed choices, which are stored in the class's attributes. So, the function would need to check each argument in 'args' against the CHOICES list.

But how to implement that? Let's outline the steps:

1. The function is a method of a class, probably called validate_choices_args.
2. The function takes 'args' as a parameter.
3. The function needs to check that each value in 'args' is in the CHOICES list.
4. If any value is not in CHOICES, raise an exception.

But since the choices are not provided, perhaps the code should be written with a placeholder for the choices. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to assume anything else.

Wait, maybe the choices are passed as a parameter. But the function's parameters are 'args', which is the received arguments. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that the 'args' are valid choices. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' itself is one of the choices. For example, if 'args' is a list, check if it's in the CHOICES list. But that's not typical.

This is confusing. Since the user hasn't provided the specific choices, perhaps the code should be written with a placeholder for the choices. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to assume anything else.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' are valid choices, and the choices are stored in the class. So, the code would look like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    choices = self.CHOICES  # Assuming CHOICES is a class attribute
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Argument {arg} is not a valid choice.")

But since the user hasn't provided the CHOICES attribute, I can't hardcode it. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should include a check that each argument in 'args' is in the CHOICES list, which is a class attribute.

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code should be written with a placeholder. However, the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, so the code would need to be written with the assumption that CHOICES is a class attribute.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the specific choices. Therefore, the code would need to be written with a placeholder for the choices. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to assume anything else.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' are valid choices, and the choices are passed as a parameter. But the function's parameters are 'args', which is the received arguments. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' are valid choices, and the choices are stored in the class. So, the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    choices = self.CHOICES
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Argument {arg} is not a valid choice.")

But again, without knowing what CHOICES is, I can't write the code. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should be written with the assumption that CHOICES is a class attribute.

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code should be written with a placeholder. However, the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, so the code would need to be written with that in mind.

Therefore, the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    """
    # Assume CHOICES is a class attribute containing the allowed choices
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.CHOICES:
            raise ValueError(f"Argument {arg} is not a valid choice.")

But the problem is that the user's docstring doesn't mention the CHOICES, so the code is written with that assumption. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to assume anything else. So perhaps the code should be written with the assumption that the choices are passed as a parameter. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' are valid choices, and the choices are passed as a parameter. But the function's parameters are 'args', which is the received arguments. So that's not possible.

I think the correct approach is to assume that the choices are stored in the class's attributes, and the function checks each argument in 'args' against those choices. Therefore, the code would be as above.

So, the final code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    """
    # Assume CHOICES is a class attribute containing the allowed choices
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.CHOICES:
            raise ValueError(f"Argument {arg} is not a valid choice.")

But since the user hasn't provided the CHOICES attribute, this is the best possible code based on the given information.
