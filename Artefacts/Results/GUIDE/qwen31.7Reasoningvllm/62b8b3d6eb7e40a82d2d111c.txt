Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function _normalizeargs based on the given docstring. The function needs to normalize arguments that might contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. Anything but individual interfaces or implements specs should be expanded.

First, I need to understand the function's purpose. The function takes a sequence and an output parameter. The docstring says that the sequence can contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. The goal is to normalize these arguments. The key part is that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs is expanded. So, if the input is a tuple or a Declarion, it should be expanded into its components.

Wait, but what's a Declarion? Maybe it's a class or an interface. The function is supposed to normalize these arguments. So, perhaps the function is meant to process a sequence of arguments, expanding any complex structures into their individual components.

Let me think about the steps. The function needs to handle different types of inputs. For example, if the input is a tuple, each element should be processed. If it's a Declarion (maybe a class), then it should be expanded. But if it's a single interface or implements spec, then it's left as is.

So, the approach might be to recursively process each element of the sequence. For each element, check if it's a tuple. If it is, expand it. If it's a Declarion (assuming that's a class or interface), expand it. Otherwise, leave it as is.

But how to represent Declarions and implements specs? The problem statement says that the function might contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle these cases. But the actual implementation details are not clear. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so I need to write the code that matches the docstring's description.

Let me outline the steps for the code:

1. The function _normalizeargs takes a sequence and an output. The output is probably used to collect the normalized arguments.

2. The function needs to process each element in the sequence. For each element, check if it's a tuple. If it is, expand it. If it's a Declarion (maybe a class), expand it. Otherwise, leave it as is.

3. The expansion process would involve breaking down the complex structures into their individual components. For example, a tuple like (A, B) would be expanded into A and B. A Declarion might be a class, which would be expanded into its attributes or methods.

But since the actual implementation details are not provided, I need to make assumptions. Let's assume that the function is supposed to recursively process each element, expanding tuples and Declarions into their components.

So, the code would look something like this:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            # Expand the tuple
            for subitem in item:
                _normalizeargs(subitem, output)
        elif isinstance(item, type):  # Assuming Declarion is a class
            # Expand the Declarion
            # For example, if it's a class, expand its attributes or methods
            # But how? Maybe we need to process each attribute or method
            # But without knowing the exact structure, this is tricky
            # Maybe we just leave it as is for now
            output.append(item)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but the docstring says that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs is expanded. So, if the input is a tuple, it's expanded. If it's a Declarion (a class), it's expanded. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to expand any non-atomic elements. So, for example, if the input is a tuple, it's expanded into its elements. If it's a Declarion (a class), it's expanded into its components. But how to represent that?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to process the sequence, and for each element, if it's a tuple, expand it, else if it's a Declarion (like a class), expand it. Otherwise, leave it as is.

But the problem is that the actual expansion logic is not specified. So, the code would need to handle these cases.

Another thought: the function's purpose is to normalize the arguments. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take a sequence of arguments, and expand any complex structures into their individual components. For example, if the input is a tuple (A, B), it becomes [A, B]. If the input is a Declarion (like a class), it becomes the class itself. But if it's a single interface, it's left as is.

But how to handle the expansion? For example, if the input is a tuple, then each element is processed. If the input is a Declarion (a class), then it's added as is. If it's a single interface, then it's added as is.

So, the code would look like:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            # Expand the tuple
            for subitem in item:
                _normalizeargs(subitem, output)
        elif isinstance(item, type):  # Assuming Declarion is a class
            # Expand the Declarion
            # For example, if it's a class, expand its attributes or methods
            # But without knowing the exact structure, we can just add it as is
            output.append(item)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

But this is a very simplistic approach. The problem is that the actual expansion might require more complex processing. However, given the information, this is the best approach.

Now, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So, the code should be written as a Python function.

Also, the function is supposed to have the docstring as given. So, the code should include the docstring.

So, putting it all together:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """
    Normalize declaration arguments

    Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
    interfaces.

    Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.
    """
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            # Expand the tuple
            for subitem in item:
                _normalizeargs(subitem, output)
        elif isinstance(item, type):  # Assuming Declarion is a class
            # Expand the Declarion
            # For example, if it's a class, expand its attributes or methods
            # But without knowing the exact structure, we can just add it as is
            output.append(item)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but the docstring mentions that anything but individual interfaces or implements specs is expanded. So, if the input is a tuple, it's expanded. If it's a Declarion (a class), it's expanded. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to expand any non-atomic elements. So, if the input is a tuple, it's expanded. If it's a Declarion (a class), it's expanded. Otherwise, left as is.

But the code above would handle that. For example, if the input is a tuple (A, B), then each element is processed. If A is a class, it's added to the output. If B is a single interface, it's added as is.

But the code as written would process each element recursively. So, for a tuple (A, B), it would expand A and B. If A is a class, it would be added to the output. If B is a tuple, it would be expanded.

This seems to align with the docstring's description.

So, the code should be as written above. The tests would need to verify that tuples are expanded, Declarions are expanded, and single interfaces are left as is.

But since the user wants the code generated, not the tests, the code is as above.
