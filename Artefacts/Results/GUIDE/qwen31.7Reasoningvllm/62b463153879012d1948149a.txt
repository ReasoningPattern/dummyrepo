Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function _group_files_by_xml_filename based on the given docstring. The function takes source, xmls, and files as parameters. The docstring says it groups files by xmls and returns a dict in the format.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The parameters are source, xmls, and files. The function is probably grouping the files in the 'files' parameter based on the XML filenames specified in 'xmls'. But wait, the parameters are named differently. The function is called _group_files_by_xml_filename, which suggests that maybe the parameters are named differently. Wait, the function signature is def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):. So the parameters are source, xmls, and files. The docstring says "groups files by xmls". So perhaps the 'xmls' parameter is a list of XML filenames, and the 'files' parameter is a list of file paths. The function needs to group the files in 'files' based on the XML filenames in 'xmls'.

Wait, but how? For example, if xmls is a list like ['file1.xml', 'file2.xml'], and files is a list of files, maybe the function groups files by their names matching the XML filenames. But the exact logic isn't clear. Maybe the function is supposed to create a dictionary where each key is an XML filename from xmls, and the value is a list of files in the source directory that match that XML filename.

But the parameters are source, xmls, and files. So perhaps the 'source' is the directory where the files are located, and 'files' is a list of file paths. The 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames. The function needs to group the files in 'files' based on the XML filenames in 'xmls'.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take the 'files' list and group them by their names, but the 'xmls' is a list of possible XML filenames to group by. So for each file in files, check if its name matches any of the XML filenames in xmls. Then group them accordingly.

But how to implement that. Let's think. For example, if xmls is ['a.xml', 'b.xml'], and files is [ 'a.xml', 'c.xml', 'b.xml' ], then the grouped dict would have keys 'a.xml' and 'b.xml', each with the corresponding files.

So the steps would be:

1. Iterate over each file in the 'files' list.
2. For each file, check if its name matches any of the XML filenames in 'xmls'.
3. If it does, add it to the corresponding group in the dictionary.
4. If it doesn't, maybe ignore it or handle it somehow.

But the problem is, how to handle cases where a file doesn't match any XML filename. The docstring doesn't mention handling those, so maybe the function just returns the groups as per the matching.

So the code would be something like:

Create a dictionary. For each file in files, check if the file's name is in xmls. If yes, add to the corresponding key. Otherwise, maybe skip.

But wait, the function is called _group_files_by_xml_filename. Maybe the 'source' is the directory where the files are located. But the parameters are source, xmls, files. So perhaps the 'files' are the files in the source directory, and xmls are the list of XML filenames to group by.

But the function's parameters are source, xmls, files. So the function is probably supposed to take the files in the source directory, group them by the XML filenames in xmls, and return a dictionary.

But how to implement that. Let's think of the code.

The function would need to process the 'files' list, and for each file, check if its name is in the xmls list. Then group them.

But maybe the 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and the 'files' are the files in the source directory. So the function would group the files by their names, but only those that match any of the XML filenames in xmls.

So the code would be:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    groups = {}
    for file in files:
        if file in xmls:
            key = file
            if key not in groups:
                groups[key] = []
            groups[key].append(file)
    return groups

Wait, but that's simplistic. What if there are multiple files with the same name? For example, if xmls is ['a.xml', 'b.xml'], and files is ['a.xml', 'a.xml', 'b.xml'], then the groups would have 'a.xml' with two entries and 'b.xml' with one.

But the function's docstring says "groups files by xmls". So perhaps the 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and the function groups the files in 'files' by their names, but only those that are in xmls.

But maybe the 'xmls' is a list of possible keys, and the function is supposed to group the files by their names, but only those that are in xmls.

But the code above would do that. However, the 'source' parameter is present, but the code doesn't use it. So perhaps the 'source' is for the directory where the files are located, but the code doesn't use it. That's a problem. The function's parameters include 'source', but the code doesn't use it. So maybe the function is supposed to process the files in the source directory, but the code is not using the 'source' parameter. That's a bit odd.

But the user hasn't specified any constraints on the 'source' parameter. So perhaps the function is supposed to group the files in 'files' based on the XML filenames in 'xmls', and the 'source' is just a parameter that's not used. But that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is the directory path, and the function is supposed to check if the file exists in that directory. But the code doesn't do that. So perhaps the function is intended to group the files in 'files' (which are presumably in the source directory) by their names, but only those that match the XML filenames in 'xmls'.

In that case, the code would be as I wrote earlier.

But the function's parameters are source, xmls, files. So the code would need to process the 'files' list, and group them by the XML filenames in 'xmls'.

So the code would be:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    groups = {}
    for file in files:
        if file in xmls:
            key = file
            if key not in groups:
                groups[key] = []
            groups[key].append(file)
    return groups

But wait, the 'source' parameter is not used. But the user hasn't specified any constraints on it. So perhaps the function is supposed to process the files in the source directory, but the code doesn't use the 'source' parameter. That's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is the directory path, and the function is supposed to check if the file exists in that directory. But the code doesn't do that. So perhaps the function is intended to group the files in 'files' (which are in the source directory) by their names, but the code doesn't use the 'source' parameter. That's a bit odd, but perhaps the user expects that.

In any case, the code would be as above. However, the function's docstring says "groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format." So the code would group the files in 'files' by the XML filenames in 'xmls'.

But perhaps the 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and the function is supposed to group the files in 'files' by their names, but only those that are in 'xmls'. So the code would be as written.

But maybe the 'xmls' is a list of possible keys, and the function is supposed to group the files by their names, but only those that are in 'xmls'. So the code would be as above.

Another possible approach: maybe the 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and the function is supposed to group the files in 'files' by their XML filenames, but the 'source' is the directory where the files are located. However, the code doesn't use the 'source' parameter. So perhaps the function is supposed to process the files in the 'source' directory, but the code doesn't use it. That's possible.

In any case, the code would be as written.

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    """
    Groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format.
    """
    groups = {}
    for file in files:
        if file in xmls:
            groups[file] = groups.get(file, [])
            groups[file].append(file)
    return groups

Wait, but in the code above, the 'source' is not used. But the function's parameters include it. So perhaps the code is supposed to process the files in the 'source' directory, but the code doesn't use it. That's a problem. However, the user hasn't specified any constraints, so perhaps the code is correct as written.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is the directory path, and the function is supposed to check if the file exists in that directory. But the code doesn't do that. So perhaps the function is intended to group the files in 'files' (which are in the source directory) by their names, but the code doesn't use the 'source' parameter. That's possible.

In any case, the code would be as written. The user's example code would be:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    """
    Groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format.
    """
    groups = {}
    for file in files:
        if file in xmls:
            groups[file] = groups.get(file, [])
            groups[file].append(file)
    return groups

But maybe the 'source' is not used, but the function is supposed to process the files in the source directory. However, the code doesn't use it. So perhaps the function is supposed to have the 'source' parameter, but the code doesn't use it. That's acceptable.

Another possible approach: maybe the 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and the function is supposed to group the files in 'files' by their names, but only those that are in 'xmls'. So the code would be as above.

So the final code would be as written.
