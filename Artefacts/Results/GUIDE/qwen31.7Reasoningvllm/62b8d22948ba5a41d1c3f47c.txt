Okay, I need to generate Python code for the get method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is called get, and it takes a key and a default value. The docstring says that if the key exists in the class, return the value; otherwise, return default. So the task is to implement this method.

First, I need to figure out how the class is structured. The function is part of a class, and the get method is likely a method of that class. The parameters are key and default. The return value is either the value associated with the key or default.

Wait, but the class isn't shown. So the code needs to be written in a way that the get method can access the class's data. But since the class isn't provided, maybe the class has a dictionary or some data structure that stores the keys. But the problem says that the function is part of a class, so perhaps the class has a dictionary called self.data or something similar.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should have the get method that checks if the key exists in the class. However, the class's data structure isn't specified. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the class has a dictionary that stores the keys. For example, the class might have a data attribute that's a dictionary. So the get method would check if the key is in that dictionary and return the value, else return default.

But since the problem doesn't provide the class structure, I need to assume that the class has a data attribute that's a dictionary. So the get method would look something like:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    return self.data.get(key, default)

But the docstring says that if the key exists in the class, return the value. So the class's data structure must have the key. So the code would check if the key is in the data dictionary.

Wait, but the problem says "if a key exists in the class". So maybe the class has a data attribute that's a dictionary, and the get method checks if the key is present in that dictionary.

So the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    return self.data.get(key, default)

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is def get(self, key, default=None):. So the code would be as above.

But maybe the class has a different structure. For example, maybe the class has a __dict__ attribute, but that's less likely. Typically, a class would have a data attribute, like data = {}.

But since the problem doesn't specify, the code should assume that the class has a data attribute that's a dictionary. Therefore, the get method would use the get method of the dictionary.

So the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    return self.data.get(key, default)

But the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be written as a Python function.

Wait, but the user might expect the code to be part of a class. So the code would be part of a class, like:

class MyClass:
    def get(self, key, default=None):
        return self.data.get(key, default)

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is given as def get(self, key, default=None):. So the code would be the method itself.

But the user wants the code generated, so the answer should be the code for the get method.

So the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
    """
    If a key exists in the class, the value corresponding to the key is returned. Otherwise, default is returned.
    """
    return self.data.get(key, default)

But wait, the docstring is part of the function. So the code would include the docstring.

But the user's example shows that the docstring is part of the function. So the code would have the function with the docstring.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code would be the function definition with the docstring.

So the final code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
	"""
	If a key exists in the class, the value corresponding to the key is returned. Otherwise, default is returned.
	"""
	return self.data.get(key, default)

But wait, the problem says that the function is part of a class. So the code would be part of a class. But the user's example shows the function as a standalone function. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be the function as part of a class.

But the user's example shows the function as a method of a class. So the code would be:

class MyClass:
    def get(self, key, default=None):
        """
        If a key exists in the class, the value corresponding to the key is returned. Otherwise, default is returned.
        """
        return self.data.get(key, default)

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code would be the function definition.

But the user's example shows the function as a method, so the code would be:

def get(self, key, default=None):
	"""
	If a key exists in the class, the value corresponding to the key is returned. Otherwise, default is returned.
	"""
	return self.data.get(key, default)

But the problem says that the function is part of a class. However, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code would be the function as a method of a class.

But since the user hasn't provided the class structure, the code must assume that the class has a data attribute. So the code is as above.

Therefore, the generated code is the function with the docstring and the return statement.
