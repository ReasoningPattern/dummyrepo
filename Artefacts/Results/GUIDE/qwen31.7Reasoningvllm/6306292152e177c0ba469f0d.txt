Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called identify_request that takes a RequestType and returns a bool. The docstring says it checks if the request body loaded using JSON contains events. If yes, return True, else False.

First, I need to figure out how to access the request body. In Flask, for example, you might use request.json. But the function's parameter is called request, which I assume is a Flask request object. So, the function should check if the JSON body has 'events' key.

Wait, the function's parameter is named request, but in Python, the RequestType is probably a class. So, the function is probably part of a Flask app, where request is an instance of Request. So, the code would be something like:

if 'events' in request.json:
    return True
else:
    return False

But I need to make sure that the request.json exists. Maybe check if the JSON is present. But the docstring says "the request body loaded using JSON contains events". So, perhaps the function is supposed to check if the JSON body has the 'events' key.

So the code would be:

def identify_request(request: RequestType) -> bool:
    return 'events' in request.json

But wait, what if the request isn't a Flask request? Well, the function's parameter is named request, and the docstring says it's a RequestType, which I assume is a class that has a json attribute. So, the code is straightforward.

But maybe the function is part of a larger framework, like FastAPI. Wait, the function is called identify_request, and the parameter is request. In FastAPI, the request is an instance of Request, and you can access request.json. So the code would be similar.

So the code would be:

def identify_request(request: RequestType) -> bool:
    return 'events' in request.json

But I need to make sure that the RequestType has a json attribute. The docstring says "the request body loaded using JSON contains events", so the function is checking if the JSON body has events. So the code is as above.

Now, the user wants the code generated, so I should output only the code, no explanations. So the answer is the code as written.
