Okay, I need to generate a Python function called _get_resource_name_regex that returns the regular expressions for validating Krake resource names. The docstring says it returns the regexes used to validate the name.

First, I should figure out what the typical constraints are for Krake resource names. Since it's not specified, I'll have to make some assumptions. Usually, resource names might have certain character restrictions. Let me think about common regex patterns for resource names.

Typically, resource names might not include certain characters like spaces, special symbols, or certain letters. For example, they might allow letters, numbers, and certain symbols. But I need to make sure the regex is correct.

Let me recall that in regex, character classes are done with [characters], and special characters need to be escaped. For example, a period (.) is usually escaped in regex, but maybe in this case, it's allowed. Wait, but in the context of resource names, maybe periods are allowed. Hmm.

Also, Krake might have specific requirements. Let me think of possible constraints. Maybe the name can't start with a number, or have certain characters. But since the problem doesn't specify, I need to make reasonable assumptions.

Let me think of a standard regex for resource names. For example, a regex that allows letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and certain symbols like underscores, dashes, and dots. But also, maybe it can't have certain characters like spaces or special symbols.

Wait, the function is supposed to return the regexes. So perhaps the function returns a list of regex patterns. But the docstring says "return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources". So the function should return a list of regex patterns.

But the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which starts with an underscore. Maybe it's a private method, so the code would be in a class, but the user is just asking for the function definition.

So the function should return a list of regex patterns. Let me think of possible patterns.

For example, a regex that allows letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and certain symbols. But maybe the Krake resource names have specific rules. For instance, they might not allow certain characters like spaces, or they might require certain prefixes/suffixes.

But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll have to make some standard assumptions. Let me think of a regex that allows letters, numbers, and underscores, dashes, and dots. But also, maybe it can't start with a number.

So the regex could be something like ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$. But that's too simplistic. Maybe the Krake resource names have more restrictions. For example, they might not allow certain characters like spaces or special symbols.

Alternatively, maybe the regex is more complex. For example, allowing letters, numbers, and certain symbols, but not certain others.

But without specific information, I need to make an educated guess. Let me check common regex patterns for resource names. For example, in some systems, resource names are allowed to have letters, numbers, and underscores, but not spaces or special characters.

So perhaps the regex would be something like ^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$. But maybe the Krake has more specific requirements. For example, maybe they allow dots, but not others.

Alternatively, maybe the regex is more complex. For example, allowing letters, numbers, underscores, dashes, and dots, but not spaces or certain other characters.

But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed with a standard regex that allows letters, numbers, and certain symbols, and doesn't allow certain characters.

So, the function would return a list of regex patterns. Let me structure the code.

The function would return a list of regex patterns. For example:

return [
    r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$',  # Allow letters, numbers, underscores, dashes
    r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+$',  # Allow dots as well
    # Add more patterns if needed
]

But maybe the Krake has specific requirements. For example, maybe the name can't have certain characters. Let me think of possible constraints.

Another possibility is that the name must start with a letter, and then have letters, numbers, and certain symbols. So the regex would be ^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_\-\.]+$. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the regex is more complex. For example, allowing letters, numbers, and certain symbols, but not others.

But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed with a standard regex that allows letters, numbers, and certain symbols, and doesn't allow spaces or other prohibited characters.

So the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return [
        r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$',  # Allow letters, numbers, underscores, dashes
        r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+$',  # Allow dots as well
        r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+$',  # Maybe another pattern
    ]

But maybe the actual regexes are different. For example, maybe the first regex is for allowing letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes, and the second is for allowing dots as well.

Alternatively, maybe the regexes are more specific. For example, the first regex is for allowing letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes, and the second is for allowing letters, numbers, underscores, dashes, and dots.

But without specific info, this is the best I can do.

So the code would be as above. The function returns a list of regex patterns. The docstring is as given.
