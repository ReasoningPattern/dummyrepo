Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function process_text_links as described. Let's start by understanding the function's purpose. The docstring says it processes links in text, adding attributes and linkifying them. So the goal is to identify links in the text, modify them to be clickable, and add some attributes like href, rel, etc.

First, I need to figure out how to detect links in the text. In Python, regular expressions are commonly used for this. So I'll probably use re.findall to find all occurrences of URLs in the text.

The standard way to extract URLs is to use a regex pattern that matches URLs. The pattern should capture the URLs, maybe using something like r'https?://\S+'. But I need to make sure it's comprehensive enough. Maybe include http, https, and other protocols like ftp, but that might be too broad. Alternatively, use a more specific pattern.

Wait, the problem says "linkifying textual links". So the function should take a string and return a new string where the links are converted into clickable links. So the steps are:

1. Find all URLs in the text.
2. Replace each URL with a hyperlink tag, like <a href="url">url</a>.

But how to handle the replacement? Using re.sub with a callback function might be better. Because the replacement needs to generate the actual HTML tags.

So the plan is:

- Use re.findall to find all URLs in the text.
- For each URL found, replace it with an <a> tag with the href attribute set to the URL.

But wait, the function's parameters are text. So the function will take the input text and return the processed text.

Now, the regex pattern. Let's think about possible URLs. The standard pattern is r'https?://\S+', but that might not capture all cases. For example, URLs with subdomains, like https://example.com/path?query=1. But maybe the problem expects a basic approach.

Alternatively, use a more comprehensive pattern. Maybe r'https?://\S+'

But maybe the user expects to capture URLs like http://example.com, https://example.com, etc. So the regex pattern would be r'https?://\S+'.

So the code would be something like:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    # Find all URLs in the text
    urls = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    # Replace each URL with an <a> tag
    processed = re.sub(r'https?://\S+', lambda m: f'<a href="{m.group()}" target="_blank">{m.group()}</a>', text)
    return processed

Wait, but the target="_blank" is optional. The docstring doesn't mention it, but adding it might be a good idea for click-through links. However, the problem says "adding some attributes", so maybe the user wants to add href and maybe rel. But the docstring says "adding some attributes and linkifying textual links". So perhaps the href is the main attribute, and maybe rel is added as well.

But the problem is, the function's parameters are just text. So the code needs to process the text, find the links, and replace them with hyperlinks.

But the regex might not capture all possible URLs. For example, URLs with www, like http://www.example.com. The pattern r'https?://\S+' would capture that.

Another thing: the replacement should wrap the URL in <a> tags. So the substitution is replacing each URL with the <a> tag.

But what about the case where the URL is part of a longer string? For example, if the text is "Visit https://example.com for more info.", the replacement would be "<a href=\"https://example.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://example.com</a> for more info."

But the problem says "linkifying textual links", which implies that the URLs are already in the text and need to be converted. So the code should find all occurrences of URLs and replace them.

But there's a problem with the regex. For example, if the text has multiple URLs, like "https://example.com and https://another.com", the code would replace each with their respective links.

Now, testing the code. Let's think about some test cases.

Test case 1: Input text is "Visit https://example.com." Expected output is "Visit <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">https://example.com</a>."

Test case 2: Input text is "Check out http://example.org and https://another.org." Expected output is "Check out <a href="http://example.org" target="_blank">http://example.org</a> and <a href="https://another.org" target="_blank">https://another.org</a>."

But the code as written would do that.

But what about the target="_blank" attribute? The docstring doesn't mention it, but the problem says "adding some attributes". So maybe the code should add target="_blank" as a default.

So the code would include that.

Another thing: the regex might not capture URLs that are part of a larger string. For example, if the text is "https://example.com/path?query=1", the regex would capture the entire URL.

But the code as written would replace the entire URL with the <a> tag.

So the code seems correct.

But wait, the function is supposed to process the text and return the processed text. So the code should be as follows.

Now, the code needs to be written in Python, using re.sub with a lambda function.

But the code needs to be in the function. So the code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    urls = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    processed = re.sub(r'https?://\S+', lambda m: f'<a href="{m.group()}" target="_blank">{m.group()}</a>', text)
    return processed

But wait, the re.sub function's pattern is the same as the findall, which is r'https?://\S+', but that's not correct. Because the findall returns the URLs, and the sub replaces each occurrence with the <a> tag. But the pattern in the sub is the same as the pattern in the findall. So the code is correct.

But wait, the pattern in the sub is r'https?://\S+', which is the same as the pattern in the findall. So the code is correct.

But perhaps the code should use a different pattern. For example, if the user wants to capture URLs with http, https, etc., but maybe the code is correct as is.

Another possible issue: the regex may not capture URLs that have parameters, like http://example.com?query=1. But the problem says "linkifying textual links", which probably refers to the standard URLs, so the code is okay.

So the code should be as written.

Now, the user wants the code generated, and the output should be in Python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in backticks, and the function is defined.

So the final code would be:

```python
import re

def process_text_links(text):
    urls = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    processed = re.sub(r'https?://\S+', lambda m: f'<a href="{m.group()}" target="_blank">{m.group()}</a>', text)
    return processed
```

But wait, the code uses re.findall and re.sub. But the problem says that the function is supposed to process the text. So this code should work.

Testing it with some examples:

Test case 1: input "https://example.com", output "<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">https://example.com</a>".

Test case 2: input "http://example.com and https://another.com", output "<a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">http://example.com</a> and <a href="https://another.com" target="_blank">https://another.com</a>".

Yes, that's correct.

So the code is correct.
