Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that popitem removes and returns the (key, value) pair that's least recently used. So, this is likely related to a cache or a dictionary that keeps track of items with their usage counts. In Python, the standard way to handle this is using a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache, which is implemented in the collections module. Specifically, the OrderedDict from the collections module is used because it maintains the order of insertion and allows for efficient removal of the oldest item.

Wait, but the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature. The function is part of a class, so I need to assume that the class has an OrderedDict or something similar. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition. So, I need to make sure that the code uses the OrderedDict from the collections module.

The function is called popitem, which is a method in a class. The docstring mentions that it returns the least recently used item. So, the implementation would need to retrieve the item with the smallest usage count, remove it, and return it.

But how does the OrderedDict handle this? The OrderedDict has a method called popitem(last=False), which removes and returns the last item if last is True, or the first item if False. Wait, no. Wait, the OrderedDict's popitem method removes and returns the last item if last is True. Wait, no, actually, the default is to return the last item. Wait, let me check. Oh right, the OrderedDict's popitem() method returns the last item by default. But if you pass last=False, it returns the first item. Wait, no, the documentation says that popitem() returns the last item if last is True, otherwise the first. Wait, no, I think the actual behavior is that popitem() returns the last item if you don't specify last, and if you do specify last, it returns the first. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again.

Wait, the OrderedDict's popitem() method, when called without any arguments, returns the last item. If you call popitem(last=False), it returns the first item. So, if the OrderedDict is used as a cache, then the least recently used item would be the first one, so we need to call popitem(last=False). But wait, the problem says that the function should return the least recently used. So, if the OrderedDict is used as a LRU cache, then the least recently used is the first item. Therefore, to get that, we need to call popitem(last=False).

But the user's function is called popitem, and the docstring says that it returns the (key, value) pair least recently used. So, the code would need to call OrderedDict.popitem(last=False) and return that.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the class definition. So, the code would need to assume that the class has an OrderedDict instance. For example, if the class is something like:

class MyCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self._cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        return self._cache.popitem(last=False)

But wait, the problem says that the function is part of a class, but the user hasn't provided the class. So, the code would need to be written in a way that the class has an OrderedDict instance. However, the user's function signature is just the def popitem(self):, so the code would need to implement that method.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the class. So, the code would need to be written in a way that the class has an OrderedDict. Therefore, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    return self._cache.popitem(last=False)

But wait, the user's docstring says that the function returns the (key, value) pair least recently used. So, the code would need to return the item that's least recently used. Assuming that the OrderedDict is used as a LRU cache, then the least recently used is the first item, so popitem(last=False) would return that.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the class. So, the code would need to be written with the assumption that the class has an OrderedDict instance. Therefore, the code would be as follows.

But wait, maybe the user expects that the class uses a different data structure. For example, maybe it's a dictionary that tracks the order. But that's more complicated. However, the standard way to implement LRU cache is using OrderedDict.

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    return self._cache.popitem(last=False)

But the user's function signature is def popitem(self):, so the code would need to have self._cache as an OrderedDict.

But since the user hasn't provided the class, the code would need to be written with that assumption.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the (key, value) pair least recently used.
    """
    return self._cache.popitem(last=False)

But wait, the docstring is part of the function, so the code would include the docstring. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So, the code would be the function definition with the docstring.

But the user's example shows that the code should be generated with the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the (key, value) pair least recently used.
    """
    return self._cache.popitem(last=False)

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the class. However, the code is written assuming that the class has an OrderedDict instance called _cache.

So, the final code would be as above.
