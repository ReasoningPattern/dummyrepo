Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_spec_defaults and it's part of a class. The docstring says it resolves arguments' values from spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). 

First, I need to understand what this function does. The docstring mentions that it's resolving arguments' values by combining the spec and other sources. But the actual implementation is not provided. The user probably expects me to write the code for this function.

Wait, the function is supposed to be part of a class. The docstring says it's resolving arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults(). So, the function likely calls another method, self._get_defaults(), which probably handles the actual resolution.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the implementation of self._get_defaults(). So, I need to assume that this method is already implemented. However, since the user hasn't given that, I have to write the get_spec_defaults function based on the given docstring.

Wait, maybe the user expects me to generate the code for get_spec_defaults, assuming that self._get_defaults() is available. So the function would probably call self._get_defaults() and return the result. But maybe there's more to it. Let me think.

The function's purpose is to resolve arguments' values from the spec and other sources. So, perhaps it's combining the spec's defaults with other sources. But without knowing what self._get_defaults() does, I can't be sure. However, the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code should be written in a way that follows the docstring.

So, the function get_spec_defaults is supposed to resolve the arguments' values. The docstring says it uses self._get_defaults(). So, the code would be something like:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()"""
    return self._get_defaults()

But maybe there's more to it. For example, maybe the function needs to handle some logic, like combining multiple sources. But since the user hasn't provided the implementation of self._get_defaults(), I can't add any logic. So, the simplest implementation is to call self._get_defaults() and return it.

Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to handle the resolution process. For example, perhaps it's supposed to check the spec and other sources, and return the defaults. But without knowing what self._get_defaults() does, I can't be sure. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code should be as per the docstring.

Therefore, the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    """Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()"""
    return self._get_defaults()

But maybe there's more. For example, maybe the function needs to handle some parameters or other logic. However, since the user hasn't provided that, I have to stick to the given info.

Another possibility is that the function is supposed to return the defaults, and the docstring is a placeholder. So, the code is straightforward.

So, the answer is to write the function as per the docstring, calling self._get_defaults() and returning it.
