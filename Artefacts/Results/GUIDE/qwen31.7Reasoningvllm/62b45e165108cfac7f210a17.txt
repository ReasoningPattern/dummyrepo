Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the function get_logical_path_map based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function takes two parameters: inventory and version. The docstring says it returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in a dictionary. But the function is currently just a stub. So I need to figure out what the actual implementation should do.

Wait, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is supposed to return a dict of file paths. But what's the inventory and version doing here? Maybe the inventory is a list of states, and the version is the version number. But the function isn't implemented yet.

Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to process the inventory and version to create a map of logical paths. But without more context, I need to make assumptions. Let's think about possible scenarios.

Perhaps the inventory is a list of states, each with a path, and the version is the version of the state. The function needs to create a dictionary where each key is a state's path, and the value is the logical path. But that's too vague.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of files, and the version is the version number. The function needs to map each file to its logical path based on the version. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the docstring says "file paths of the states in the inventory". So maybe the inventory is a list of states, each with a path, and the version is the version of the state. The function returns a dictionary where each key is the state's path, and the value is the logical path. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of files, and the version is the version of the file. The function needs to create a map of logical paths based on the version. But again, without more details, it's hard to code.

Since the problem is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are the states' paths and the values are the logical paths. But how to generate that?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a state's path, and the value is the logical path. But how to determine that? Maybe the inventory is a list of states, each with a path, and the version is the version of the state. So the function would create a dictionary where each state's path is the key, and the value is the logical path based on the version.

But without knowing how the version affects the logical path, I can't code that. Maybe the version is used to generate a unique identifier or to determine the path. For example, maybe the logical path is the state's path plus the version.

But since the problem is to generate the code, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the inventory's states as keys and some logical path as values. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are the states' paths and the values are the logical paths. But the inventory and version are parameters. Maybe the inventory is a list of states, and the version is the version number. The function returns a dictionary mapping each state's path to its logical path based on the version.

But without knowing the exact logic, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are the inventory's states and the values are the logical paths. But how?

But without knowing the exact logic, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the inventory's states as keys and some default logical path as values. But that's not helpful.

But without knowing the exact logic, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the inventory's states as keys and the logical path as the value. For example, maybe the logical path is the state's path plus the version.

So, the code would be something like:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    # Assume inventory is a list of states, each with a path
    # And version is the version number
    # Create a dictionary where each state's path is the key, and the value is the logical path
    # For example, logical path is path + version
    logical_path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        logical_path = state['path'] + str(version)
        logical_path_map[state['path']] = logical_path
    return logical_path_map

But since the inventory and version are parameters, and the function is supposed to return the dictionary, this is a possible approach.

But the problem is that the inventory and version are not defined in the function signature. So the code would need to assume that inventory is a list of states, each with a 'path' key.

But the original function signature is:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    # ... code here

So the code needs to be generated based on this. Since the docstring says it returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in a dict, but the actual implementation is not given.

But the problem is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must be written such that it returns a dictionary of file paths.

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """

    """
    logical_path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        # Assuming each state has a 'path' key
        logical_path = state['path'] + str(version)
        logical_path_map[state['path']] = logical_path
    return logical_path_map

But the problem is that the inventory and version are parameters, and the code assumes that each state in the inventory has a 'path' key. However, the original function signature doesn't specify that. So maybe the code should be more generic.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are the states' paths and the values are the logical paths. But the inventory is a list of states, and the version is the version number. So the code would iterate over the inventory, and for each state, create a key as the state's path and the value as the logical path based on the version.

But again, without knowing the exact logic, this is the best possible approach.

So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    logical_path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        # Assuming each state has a 'path' key
        logical_path = state['path'] + str(version)
        logical_path_map[state['path']] = logical_path
    return logical_path_map

But the problem is that the inventory and version are parameters, and the code assumes that each state in the inventory has a 'path' key. However, the original function signature doesn't specify that. So perhaps the code should be more general.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are the states' paths and the values are the logical paths. But the inventory is a list of states, and the version is the version number. So the code would create a dictionary where each state's path is the key, and the value is the logical path based on the version.

But without knowing the exact logic, this is the best possible code.

So the final code would be as above.
