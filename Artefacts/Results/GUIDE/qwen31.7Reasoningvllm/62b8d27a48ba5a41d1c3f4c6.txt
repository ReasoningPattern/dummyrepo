Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for the `cached` function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to be a decorator that caches results using a cache, with optional parameters for a key function and a lock.

First, I need to understand what the `cached` function does. The docstring says it returns a decorator that saves results in the cache. So, the decorator will take a function and apply caching to it. The parameters are `cache`, `key=hashkey`, and `lock=None`.

Wait, the `hashkey` is probably a function that generates a key for the cache. The `lock` parameter is probably for threading, to handle concurrent access. But the user hasn't provided specific details on how the cache is implemented. Since the function is a decorator, I need to assume that the cache is a dictionary or some other structure, and the key is generated using the `key` function.

So, the steps I need to take:

1. Create a decorator that wraps the function being decorated.
2. Use the `key` parameter to generate a unique key for each invocation of the function.
3. Use the `cache` parameter to store the results.
4. Handle the `lock` parameter to ensure thread safety if needed.

But how to implement the caching? The `cache` parameter is expected to be a dictionary, perhaps. The decorator will need to store the results in this cache, using the key generated by the `key` function.

Wait, the `key` parameter is set to `hashkey`, but the user hasn't provided the definition of `hashkey`. Maybe it's a function that returns a hashable key. But since the user hasn't provided it, I'll assume that `hashkey` is a function that takes the arguments of the decorated function and returns a key. However, the `key` parameter is optional, so perhaps the default is to use the default hashkey.

But the problem is that the `cached` function is supposed to be a decorator. So, the decorator will take the function, and then apply the caching logic.

Let me think about the structure. The decorator will need to:

- For each call to the decorated function, generate a key using the `key` function.
- Check if the key is already in the cache. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and return it.
- If the key is present, return the cached result.

But how to handle the lock? If `lock` is provided, perhaps it's a threading lock that needs to be acquired before accessing the cache. But since the user hasn't specified how the lock is used, maybe the lock is for thread safety. So, the decorator will acquire the lock before accessing the cache, and release it after.

So, the steps for the decorator:

1. Define the decorator function, which takes the `cache`, `key`, and `lock` parameters.
2. For each function decorated with this decorator, the decorator will manage the cache.
3. The key is generated using the `key` function, which takes the arguments of the decorated function.
4. The cache is a dictionary, and the key is used as the key in the cache.
5. The lock is used to ensure that multiple threads don't access the cache simultaneously.

But how to implement this in Python? Let's think about the code structure.

The `cached` function is a decorator, so it should return a function that takes the original function and returns a wrapper.

Wait, the function signature is `def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):` So, the `cached` function is a decorator that takes `cache`, `key`, and `lock` as parameters. But in Python, decorators are usually defined as functions that take a function as an argument. So perhaps the `cached` function is supposed to return a decorator that takes the function to be decorated.

Wait, maybe the `cached` function is supposed to be a decorator that takes the `cache`, `key`, and `lock` as parameters, and returns a decorator that can be applied to other functions.

But the way the parameters are given is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the function signature:

The function is defined as:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
	"""
	Returns a decorator function that saves the results in the cache
	"""

So, the `cached` function is a function that returns a decorator. So, the `cached` function is a factory function that creates a decorator. The parameters are `cache`, `key`, and `lock`. The `key` is set to `hashkey` by default, and `lock` is None.

But how does this work? Let me think. The `cached` function is supposed to return a decorator. So, the decorator will take a function as an argument, and then apply the caching.

So, the code structure would be:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # implement the decorator here
        return wrapper_function
    return decorator

But then, the `key` and `lock` parameters are passed to the decorator. However, the `key` is set to `hashkey` by default. So, the `key` parameter is optional, and if not provided, uses the default `hashkey`.

But the problem is that the `hashkey` is not defined. So, perhaps the `hashkey` is a function that is supposed to be provided by the user, but since it's not given, maybe it's a placeholder. However, the user's docstring says that `key=hashkey`, so perhaps `hashkey` is a function that is supposed to be used as the key generator.

But in the code, we can't use `hashkey` unless it's defined. So, perhaps the `hashkey` is a function that is supposed to be provided by the user, but in the code, we can't use it unless it's defined. However, the user's code may have a `hashkey` function that is available.

Alternatively, maybe the `hashkey` is a function that is part of the module, but since the user hasn't provided it, we can't use it. This is a bit confusing.

But given that the user's code is to be generated, perhaps the `hashkey` is a function that is supposed to be used as the key generator. So, in the code, we can assume that `hashkey` is a function that takes the arguments of the decorated function and returns a key.

So, the code for the `cached` function would be:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # Implement the decorator here
        # Use the key function to generate the key for the cache
        # Use the lock to handle concurrency
        # Store the results in the cache
        # Return the wrapper function
        pass
    return decorator

But how to implement the actual caching logic?

The decorator needs to handle the caching. So, the wrapper function would check if the key is in the cache. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and return it. If it is present, return the cached value.

But how to handle the lock? If the lock is provided, the decorator would acquire it before accessing the cache, and release it after.

So, the code would look something like this:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # Check if the lock is provided
        if lock is not None:
            # Acquire the lock
            lock.acquire()
        # Generate the key for the function
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Generate the key using the key function
            key_value = key(*args, **kwargs)
            # Check if the key is in the cache
            if key_value in cache:
                # Return the cached value
                return cache[key_value]
            # Compute the result
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            # Store the result in the cache
            cache[key_value] = result
            # Release the lock if needed
            if lock is not None:
                lock.release()
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, this code is not handling the case where the same key is generated multiple times. Also, the `cache` parameter is expected to be a dictionary, but the code uses `cache[key_value] = result`, which would work if the cache is a dictionary.

However, there's a problem here. The `key` function is supposed to generate a key for the cache. But in the code above, the `key` function is called with the arguments of the decorated function. However, the `key` function might not be able to handle the arguments correctly. For example, if the decorated function has keyword arguments, the `key` function would need to take them into account.

But the user's docstring says that the `key` parameter is optional and defaults to `hashkey`. So, perhaps the `key` function is supposed to be provided by the user, and the code uses it as is.

But the code above assumes that the `key` function is called with the arguments of the decorated function. However, in the `wrapper` function, the `key` is called with `*args` and `**kwargs`, which would pass all the arguments of the decorated function. But if the `key` function is supposed to take the arguments of the decorated function, then this is correct.

But there's another issue: the `cache` parameter is passed to the decorator. The `cache` is a dictionary that the decorator will use to store the results. So, the `cache` is a parameter to the `cached` function, and the decorator uses it.

But in the code above, the `cache` is used as a global variable inside the decorator. However, in Python, the `cache` would be a local variable inside the `decorator` function. So, the code would need to have the `cache` as a parameter to the `decorator` function.

Wait, no. The `cached` function is a function that returns a decorator. The `decorator` function is inside `cached`, and it takes `func` as an argument. So, the `cache` is a parameter to `cached`, and the `decorator` function uses it.

So, the code is correct in that sense.

But there's another problem: the `lock` parameter. If the `lock` is provided, the code acquires it before accessing the cache and releases it after. However, the `lock` is a parameter to the `cached` function, and the `decorator` function uses it.

But in the code above, the `lock` is checked, and if it's not None, the lock is acquired. However, the `lock` is a parameter to the `cached` function, and the `decorator` function uses it.

So, the code seems correct.

But there's another issue: the `cache` parameter is a dictionary, and the `cache` is used in the `decorator` function. So, the `cache` is a parameter to the `cached` function, and the `decorator` function uses it.

But in the code, the `cache` is used as a local variable inside the `decorator` function. So, the code is correct.

However, there's a problem with the `key` function. The `key` is called with `*args` and `**kwargs` in the `wrapper` function. But if the `key` function is supposed to take the arguments of the decorated function, then this is correct. However, if the `key` function is supposed to take the arguments of the decorated function, then the `key` function would need to be called with the arguments of the decorated function. But in the `wrapper` function, the `key` is called with `*args` and `**kwargs`, which are the arguments of the decorated function. So, this is correct.

But what if the `key` function is supposed to take the arguments of the decorated function, but the `wrapper` function is called with the arguments of the decorated function? Yes, that's correct.

So, the code seems to handle that.

Another thing to consider is that the `cache` is a dictionary, and the `key_value` is the key used to store the result. So, the code uses `cache[key_value] = result`.

But what if the `cache` is not a dictionary? Well, the function is supposed to save the results in the cache, so the `cache` is expected to be a dictionary.

So, the code is correct.

But there's another issue: the `lock` parameter. If the `lock` is provided, the code acquires it before accessing the cache and releases it after. However, in Python, the `lock` must be a threading.Lock object. So, the code assumes that the `lock` is a threading.Lock, and that it's properly initialized.

But the user hasn't provided any information about the `lock` parameter, so the code assumes that it's a threading.Lock.

So, putting it all together, the code for the `cached` function would be:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            key_value = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if key_value in cache:
                return cache[key_value]
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            cache[key_value] = result
            if lock is not None:
                lock.release()
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but the `lock` is acquired before accessing the cache. So, the code should acquire the lock before checking the cache. Let me correct that.

In the code, the lock is acquired before accessing the cache. So, the code should be:

if lock is not None:
    lock.acquire()
# then check the cache

But in the current code, the lock is acquired before checking the cache. So, the code would be:

def cached(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            if lock is not None:
                lock.acquire()
            key_value = key(*args, **kwargs)
            if key_value in cache:
                return cache[key_value]
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            cache[key_value] = result
            if lock is not None:
                lock.release()
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the `lock` is acquired before checking the cache, and released after. So, the code is correct.

But there's a problem here: the `lock` is a parameter to the `cached` function, and the `decorator` function uses it. However, the `lock` is a parameter to the `cached` function, and the `decorator` function uses it. So, the code is correct.

But the `lock` is a parameter to the `cached` function, and the `decorator` function uses it. So, the code is correct.

Another thing to consider: the `cache` is a parameter to the `cached` function, and the `decorator` function uses it. So, the `cache` is a local variable inside the `decorator` function.

So, the code should be correct.

But the user's docstring says that the `cached` function returns a decorator function that saves the results in the cache. So, the code is correct.

But there's another issue: the `key` function is called with `*args` and `**kwargs` in the `wrapper` function. However, if the `key` function is supposed to take the arguments of the decorated function, then this is correct. But if the `key` function is supposed to take the arguments of the decorated function, then the `key` function would need to be called with the arguments of the decorated function. So, the code is correct.

But what if the `key` function is not provided? Well, the `key` parameter is set to `hashkey` by default. So, the code uses `hashkey` as the default key function.

But the user hasn't provided the definition of `hashkey`, so the code assumes that `hashkey` is a function that takes the arguments of the decorated function and returns a key.

So, the code is correct.

But the user's code may have a `hashkey` function that is available, so the code uses it.

Therefore, the final code for the `cached` function is as follows.
