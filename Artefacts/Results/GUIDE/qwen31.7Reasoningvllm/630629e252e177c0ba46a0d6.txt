Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function retrieve_diaspora_host_meta. The docstring says it retrieves a remote Diaspora host-meta document and returns an XRD instance. 

First, I should figure out what the XRD instance is. XRD is probably the XRD (Extensible Resource Description) class from the xrd library. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's from the xrd library, like xrd.client or something similar. But I need to check. However, since the user hasn't provided any specific libraries, I'll assume that the XRD instance is a class that can be instantiated with a host and returns the metadata.

The function's parameters are host, which is the URL of the Diaspora host. The function returns an XRD instance. So, the code would likely involve making a GET request to the host's metadata endpoint, parsing the XML response, and then creating an XRD object.

But how to structure this? Let's think step by step.

First, I need to make a request to the host's metadata. For example, maybe the endpoint is /host-meta or something similar. But without knowing the exact endpoint, I'll have to make assumptions. Maybe the host is a URL like 'https://example.com' and the metadata is at '/host-meta.xml' or similar.

So, the code would use a library like requests to make the HTTP request. Then parse the XML response. Then create an XRD instance.

But the user hasn't specified which library to use. Since the function is supposed to return an XRD instance, I'll assume that the XRD class is part of the xrd library. However, if the user expects a specific library, maybe they have their own. But since the problem is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, I'll proceed with standard libraries.

Wait, the user might expect that the XRD is a class from a specific library. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code will use the requests library to make the request and then parse the XML. But how to create the XRD instance?

Alternatively, maybe the XRD is a class that's part of the Diaspora library. But without knowing, I'll have to proceed with standard code.

So, the steps would be:

1. Import necessary modules: requests for HTTP requests, xml.etree.ElementTree for parsing XML.

2. Make a GET request to the host's metadata endpoint.

3. Parse the XML response.

4. Create an XRD instance from the parsed data.

But the problem is that the XRD instance's creation is not specified. So perhaps the code will assume that the XRD class is available, and that the host's metadata is parsed into that class.

But since the user hasn't provided the XRD class, maybe the code will just return a dummy XRD instance, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the XRD is a class that's part of the Diaspora library, and the code will use that.

Alternatively, maybe the XRD is a class that's part of the xrd library, and the code will use that.

But since the user hasn't provided the XRD class, perhaps the code will just return a dictionary or some object that represents the XRD data. However, the docstring says it returns an XRD instance, so the code must create that.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the code will use a simple approach. For example, the XRD instance could be a dictionary with keys like 'host', 'metadata', etc. But that's not a real XRD instance.

Alternatively, maybe the XRD is a class that's part of the xrd library, and the code will use that. But since I can't know, perhaps the code will use a placeholder.

Wait, the user's example function is supposed to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function returns an XRD instance. So the code must create that instance.

But how? Maybe the XRD instance is a class that's part of the xrd library. For example, in the xrd library, there's a XRD class that takes a host and returns the metadata. But without knowing the exact code, I'll have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the XRD is a class that's part of the Diaspora library, and the code will use that. But again, without knowing the exact code, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the XRD is a simple dictionary, but the docstring says it's an XRD instance, which implies a class.

Given that, perhaps the code will use a simple approach, like returning a dictionary with the host and metadata. But that's not an XRD instance.

Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Maybe the user expects that the XRD is a class that's part of the xrd library, and the code will use that. So, the code will make a request to the host's metadata, parse the XML, and then create an XRD instance.

But without knowing the exact XRD class, perhaps the code will use a placeholder. For example, the XRD class could be something like:

class XRD:
    def __init__(self, host, metadata):
        self.host = host
        self.metadata = metadata

But the user's function is supposed to return an XRD instance. So, the code would create an instance of this class.

But how to get the metadata? The code would make a GET request to the host's metadata endpoint, parse the XML, and then create the XRD instance.

So, putting it all together:

Import requests and xml.etree.ElementTree.

Make a GET request to the host's metadata URL, say, '/host-meta.xml'.

Parse the XML response.

Create an XRD instance with the host and metadata.

Return that instance.

But the exact URL depends on the host. For example, if the host is 'https://example.com', the metadata might be at 'https://example.com/host-meta.xml'.

But the function's parameter is 'host', which is a string. So, the code would need to construct the URL. However, the problem doesn't specify how the host is structured. So, perhaps the code assumes that the metadata is at 'https://{host}/host-meta.xml'.

But the user's function is supposed to be generic. So, the code would have to handle that.

So, the code would look like:

import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

class XRD:
    def __init__(self, host, metadata):
        self.host = host
        self.metadata = metadata

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f'https://{host}/host-meta.xml'
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f'Failed to retrieve metadata for {host}')
    root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
    metadata = {}
    for child in root:
        metadata[child.tag] = child.text
    return XRD(host, metadata)

But this is just a guess. The actual code might have different structure. However, the user's docstring says that the function returns an XRD instance, so the code must create that.

But the problem is that the XRD class is not provided. So, the code will have to assume that the XRD class exists. However, in practice, the XRD class might be part of the xrd library, but without knowing, the code will have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the XRD is a class that's part of the Diaspora library, and the code will use that. But again, without knowing, it's hard to say.

In the absence of specific information, the code will proceed with the above approach, assuming that the XRD class is available and that the metadata is parsed into a dictionary and passed to the XRD constructor.

So, the final code would be as above. But the user's function is supposed to return the XRD instance, so the code must return an instance of that class.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

class XRD:
    def __init__(self, host, metadata):
        self.host = host
        self.metadata = metadata

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f'https://{host}/host-meta.xml'
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f'Failed to retrieve metadata for {host}')
    root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
    metadata = {}
    for child in root:
        metadata[child.tag] = child.text
    return XRD(host, metadata)

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. For example, the URL is constructed with the host, and the response is parsed. Also, the XRD class is defined.

However, the user's docstring says that the function returns an XRD instance, which is what the code does.

So, this should be the correct code.
