Okay, I need to implement the pop method in Python based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is part of a class, and it's called pop. The parameters are key and default, with default being __marker by default. The docstring says that if the key is not found, default is returned if given, otherwise a KeyError is raised.

So, the task is to write the code for the pop method. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, in Python, dictionaries have a pop method. But since this is a method in a class, I need to simulate that behavior. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature, so I need to implement it as a method.

Wait, but the user is asking for the code, not the test cases. But the initial instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code. So I need to write the actual code for the pop method.

Let me think about the steps:

1. The method takes self, key, and default (which is __marker by default).
2. It needs to remove the key from the dictionary and return the corresponding value.
3. If the key is not present, return default if provided, else raise KeyError.

But how to handle the dictionary? Assuming that the class has an underlying dictionary, like a dict attribute. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the class has a __dict__ attribute, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the class has a dictionary instance, and the pop method is part of that.

Wait, but the problem says to generate the code. So perhaps the class has a dictionary, and the pop method is part of that. But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I need to assume that the class has a dictionary, and the pop method is implemented as a method of that class.

But perhaps the user expects that the pop method is implemented as a method of the class, and the dictionary is managed by the class. So, for example, the class might have a __dict__ attribute, and the pop method is implemented as:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    # code here

But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I need to proceed with that assumption.

So, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    # check if key is in the dictionary
    if key in self.__dict__:
        value = self.__dict__.pop(key)
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

Wait, but the default is __marker. So, if the key is not found, then if default is not __marker, return default, else raise KeyError.

But in Python, __marker is a special marker, but in the code, perhaps the user expects that the default is a specific value. However, the docstring says that default is __marker by default. So, in the code, the default parameter is set to __marker, but when the user calls pop, they can pass a default.

But in the code, the default is __marker, but when the user passes a default, it's used. So, the code would check if the key is present. If it is, remove it and return the value. If not, check if default is not __marker, then return default, else raise KeyError.

But wait, in Python, the default parameter in a function is set to the value given when the function is called. So, in the code, when the function is called with default=__marker, then the default is __marker. But when the user calls pop with a default, it's set to that.

So, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.__dict__:
        value = self.__dict__.pop(key)
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

But wait, the __dict__ of the class is a dictionary. So, the class's __dict__ is the underlying dictionary. So, the pop method is modifying that dictionary.

But in Python, when you pop a key from a dictionary, it removes it. So, this code would work.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the class definition, so the code is assuming that the class has a __dict__ attribute. However, in Python, the __dict__ of a class is the dictionary of attributes. But if the class is an instance, then the __dict__ is the instance's dictionary. So, perhaps the class is an instance, and the pop method is part of that instance.

But the problem says that the function is part of a class, so the code is written as a method of that class.

So, the code would be as above.

But wait, the default parameter is __marker. So, in the code, when the function is called with default=__marker, then the default is __marker. But when the user calls pop with a default, it's set to that.

But in the code, the default is passed as a parameter. So, the code would check if the key is present. If it is, return the value. If not, check if default is not __marker, then return default, else raise KeyError.

But in Python, the __marker is a special value. However, in the code, the user might have defined __marker as a specific value, but in the code, it's just a variable. So, the code would work as intended.

So, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.__dict__:
        value = self.__dict__.pop(key)
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

But wait, the default parameter is set to __marker by default. So, when the user calls pop with default, it's set to that. But in the code, the default is checked against __marker.

But the problem says that the default is __marker by default. So, the code is correct.

But perhaps the user expects that the default is a specific value, but the problem says that default is __marker. So, the code is correct.

So, the code is as above.

But the user wants the code generated, so I need to output only the code.

So, the final code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.__dict__:
        value = self.__dict__.pop(key)
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

But wait, in Python, the __marker is a special value. However, in the code, the user might have defined __marker as a specific value. But since the problem says that default is __marker by default, the code is correct.

So, this should be the code.
