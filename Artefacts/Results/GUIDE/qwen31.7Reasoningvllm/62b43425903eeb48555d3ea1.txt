Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the _create_in_regex method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the method is supposed to do.

The docstring says it creates an in-style parameter regular expression and returns a re.Pattern object. The method is part of a class, so I assume it's part of a class that handles regex patterns. The function is named _create_in_regex, which suggests it's a private method, maybe used internally.

First, I need to figure out what "in-style parameter regular expression" refers to. Since the method is called _create_in_regex, perhaps it's related to regex patterns that match parameters in a certain format. Common in-style regex patterns might include things like matching parameters with specific formats, such as key-value pairs, or parameters with certain constraints.

But without more context, I need to make some assumptions. Let's think about possible scenarios. Maybe the method is supposed to create a regex that matches parameters in a specific format, like "key=value" or something similar. For example, a regex that matches parameters like "name=John" or "age=30".

Assuming that the method is supposed to create a regex that matches parameters in the "in-style" format, which could be a specific format like "key=value" or something else. Let's say the in-style is a regex that matches parameters where each parameter is a key followed by an equals sign and a value.

So, the regex might look something like r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)' or similar. But I need to make sure that the regex is properly formatted.

Wait, the method returns a re.Pattern object. So the code needs to import re and create a regex pattern using re.compile().

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided any specific details about the regex pattern. So I need to generate a plausible regex that fits the description.

Another thought: maybe the in-style is a regex that matches parameters in a certain format, like a list of parameters separated by commas, each parameter being a key-value pair. For example, "name=John,age=30".

In that case, the regex might be r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)' but that would match each parameter. However, if it's a list, maybe the regex is r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)' but with a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe the in-style is a regex that matches parameters in a specific format, like a single parameter. For example, a regex that matches a single parameter like "name=John".

But without more context, it's challenging. However, since the user is expecting me to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, I need to create a regex that is reasonable.

Let me think of a common in-style regex. For example, a regex that matches parameters in the format "key=value", where key is a word (starting with letter, possibly underscore), and value is any characters except whitespace.

So the regex would be something like r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)'.

But I need to make sure that the regex is properly escaped and that the re.compile() function is used correctly.

So the code would look like:

import re

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    # Create the in-style regex pattern
    pattern = r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

But wait, the method is part of a class, and the return type is Pattern. So the code would need to import re and use re.compile(). However, the user's code might not have the Pattern class imported, but since the method returns a re.Pattern, it's assumed that re.Pattern is imported.

But in Python, the re module's Pattern is a class, so the code would need to import re and then return re.compile(pattern).

But the user's code might have the necessary imports. However, since the problem says to generate the code, I need to include the necessary imports.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so the code would have to import re and perhaps other modules. But the user's code might not have them, but the method is supposed to return a re.Pattern.

So the code would be:

import re

class MyClass:
    def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
        pattern = r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)'
        return re.compile(pattern)

But the user's function is named _create_in_regex, and the return type is Pattern. However, in Python, the re module's Pattern is a class, so the code would need to import re and then return re.compile(pattern).

But the user's code might not have the necessary imports. However, since the problem is to generate the code, I need to include the necessary imports.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code would be written as a Python function.

But the function is part of a class. So the code would be:

import re

class MyClass:
    def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
        pattern = r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)'
        return re.compile(pattern)

But the user's function is supposed to return a Pattern, which is a class from the re module. So the code is correct.

However, the user's function is named _create_in_regex, and the code is written as a method in a class. So the code would be as above.

But perhaps the user expects the code to be written as a standalone function, but the function is part of a class. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code would be part of a class.

But the user's example shows that the function is part of a class, so the code would be written within a class.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code would be written as a Python function within a class.

But since the user hasn't provided the class, I need to assume that the code is part of a class, and the function is part of that class.

Therefore, the code would be:

import re

class MyClass:
    def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
        pattern = r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)'
        return re.compile(pattern)

But the user's function is supposed to return a Pattern, which is a class from the re module. So the code is correct.

However, perhaps the regex should be more specific. For example, if the in-style is a regex that matches parameters in a specific format, like "key=value" where key is a word and value is any characters except whitespace.

But without more context, this is the best assumption.

Another possible scenario: the in-style could be a regex that matches parameters in a list, like "param1=value1,param2=value2".

In that case, the regex would be r'([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)(=)([^ ]*)' but with a different structure. However, the exact pattern depends on the specific requirement.

But since the user hasn't provided details, I need to make an educated guess.

So, the code I'll generate is as above, with the regex pattern that matches key-value pairs.
