Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_config function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says that get_config() should return a new VersioneerConfig() instance and set various attributes of it. So the main task is to create a VersioneerConfig object and configure its attributes.

First, I should recall what the VersioneerConfig class does. From what I remember, VersioneerConfig is part of the versioneer library, which is used for versioning in Python projects. It's used to manage version numbers, like semantic versions. The config object has attributes like version_template, release_template, etc.

So, the function needs to create a new instance of VersioneerConfig and set some attributes. But the problem is, the user hasn't specified which attributes to set. The docstring says "various attribute of it," which implies that the function should set some common ones.

Wait, maybe the user expects the function to set the default configuration parameters. For example, the version template, release template, and maybe the version format. But since the docstring doesn't specify, I need to make assumptions based on typical usage.

Let me think about the standard parameters for VersioneerConfig. The version_template is usually something like '{major}.{minor}.{patch}'. The release_template might be similar. Also, there's the version variable, which is the variable name used in the code, like 'version'.

So, the function should create a new VersioneerConfig instance and set these attributes. But how to do that in code?

In Python, the VersioneerConfig class is part of the versioneer module. So, I need to import it. But the user hasn't provided the import statement, so I'll assume that the necessary imports are already in place.

So, the code would look like:

from versioneer import VersioneerConfig

def get_config():
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.version_template = '{major}.{minor}.{patch}'
    config.release_template = '{version}'
    config.version = '1.0.0'
    return config

Wait, but the version variable is set to '1.0.0'? Or is that part of the config? Wait, the VersioneerConfig class has a version attribute, which is the variable name used in the code. So, setting config.version would set that variable. But the version_template is the template for the version string.

But the docstring says "set various attribute of it." So, the function should set the version_template, release_template, and maybe the version variable.

But the user might want to set other attributes as well. However, since the docstring doesn't specify, I need to choose common ones.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a config that's ready for use, so setting the default templates and the version.

Another thing: the VersioneerConfig class might have other attributes, but without knowing the exact ones, I can't set them. So, the code should include the most common ones.

So, the code would create a new config, set the version template, release template, and the version variable. Then return it.

But wait, the version variable is set via config.version. So, in the code, setting config.version to '1.0.0' would set that variable.

But maybe the user expects the function to return a config that's ready to use, so the code would look like that.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

from versioneer import VersioneerConfig

def get_config():
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.version_template = '{major}.{minor}.{patch}'
    config.release_template = '{version}'
    config.version = '1.0.0'
    return config

But I need to make sure that the VersioneerConfig is properly imported. However, the user hasn't provided the import statement, so the code will assume that it's already there.

Another point: the VersioneerConfig class might have other attributes, but without knowing them, I can't set them. So, the code will only set the ones that are commonly used.

So, this should fulfill the requirements of the function signature and docstring.
