Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_nested_custom_and_control_args, and it takes a list of args. The goal is to split these arguments into control_args, nested_args, and custom_args. 

First, I should understand the parameters. The docstring says that control arguments are those that control the IR behavior and aren't put into the yml file. Nested arguments are for Ansible playbooks and go into the yml. Custom arguments are custom variables that replace the nested ones.

So, the function needs to process the input args and categorize them. The output is two dictionaries: control_args and nested_args. The custom arguments are probably the remaining ones, but I need to check.

Wait, the docstring mentions that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested usage. So maybe the custom arguments are separate from the nested and control. But the function's return is (dict, dict), so perhaps the control_args is the ones that control the IR, nested is the ones for Ansible, and custom is the ones that are custom. But how are they split?

Wait, the function's parameters are args, which is a list. The function needs to split this list into three categories. Let me think about how to do that.

Maybe the approach is to iterate through the args and check each element. For example, if an argument is a control argument, add it to control_args. If it's a nested argument, add to nested_args. If it's a custom argument, add to custom_args. But how to determine which ones are which?

But the problem is that the function's parameters are not specified. The docstring doesn't mention any specific types for the args. So perhaps the args are strings, and we need to parse them. But the function's parameters are just a list, so maybe the args are strings, and we need to split them into the three categories.

Wait, but the function's docstring doesn't provide any examples. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into the three categories based on some criteria. However, the problem statement doesn't specify how to determine which arguments are control, nested, or custom. 

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. The user might have intended that the function splits the args into three categories, but without specific criteria, it's hard to know. However, the function's docstring mentions that control arguments are not put into the yml, nested are put into the yml, and custom are used instead of nested. So perhaps the custom arguments are those that are not in the nested or control categories. But how to differentiate between them?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into three groups: control, nested, and custom. But how? The problem statement doesn't specify the criteria. Maybe the function is supposed to split the args into the three groups based on some predefined keys. For example, if the argument is a control argument, it's in control_args. If it's a nested argument, it's in nested_args. If it's a custom argument, it's in custom_args. But how to determine that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control, nested, and custom based on some specific keys. For example, if the argument is a control argument, it's in control_args. If it's a nested argument, it's in nested_args. The custom arguments are the ones that are not in either. But again, without knowing the specific criteria, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into the three categories, but the actual splitting is based on the presence of certain keywords or patterns. For example, control arguments might have a certain prefix, like '--control', nested might have '--nested', and custom might have '--custom'. But since the problem statement doesn't specify this, I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into three groups, but the actual splitting is done by the caller, and the function is supposed to return the three groups. But the problem statement says that the function returns (dict, dict), which implies that the function is splitting the args into two dictionaries, but the docstring mentions three categories. Wait, the docstring says that control_args are not put into the yml, nested are put into the yml, and custom are used instead of nested. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control_args, nested_args, and custom_args. But the return is (dict, dict), which suggests that the function returns two dictionaries. So maybe the custom_args are not part of the return, but the docstring is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the function's return is (dict, dict), so perhaps the control_args and nested_args are the two returned dictionaries. The custom arguments are not part of the return. But the docstring mentions that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested usage. So maybe the custom arguments are the ones that are not in the nested_args, but the function is supposed to split the args into control, nested, and custom. However, the function returns two dictionaries, so perhaps the custom arguments are not part of the return. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested ones. But that doesn't make sense. The docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested usage. So perhaps the custom arguments are a separate category, but the function returns two dictionaries: control_args and nested_args. So maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but the function is supposed to split them into custom and nested. But without knowing the criteria, it's hard to proceed.

Given that the problem is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested. So maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control, nested, and custom, but the return is two dictionaries. Therefore, perhaps the custom arguments are not part of the return, and the function is supposed to split into control and nested. But the docstring mentions three categories.

This is a bit of a puzzle. However, since the function's return is (dict, dict), perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into two dictionaries: control_args and nested_args. The custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but the function is supposed to split them into custom and nested. But without knowing the criteria, it's hard to code.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control_args and nested_args, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested usage. So perhaps the custom arguments are a separate category, but the function is supposed to split into control and nested, and the custom is part of the nested. But this is unclear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested. So maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control, nested, and custom, but the return is two dictionaries. Therefore, the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. But how?

So maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. But then, the function's return is two dictionaries, so the custom arguments are included in the nested_args.

In that case, the function would process the args, split into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. But how to determine which arguments are control, nested, or custom?

Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific criteria, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. But without knowing the criteria, I can't code that. However, the problem might expect that the function splits the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. But the docstring mentions that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested. So maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control, nested, and custom, but the return is two dictionaries.

This is quite challenging. Given that, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. So the code would process each argument, check if it's a control argument (like --control), and add to control_args. Otherwise, add to nested_args. But the problem is that the function's parameters are a list of args, which are probably strings. So the code would iterate through each arg in the list, check if it starts with a certain prefix (like '--control'), and add to control_args. Otherwise, add to nested_args. But the docstring doesn't specify the criteria, so this is an assumption.

The custom arguments are part of the nested_args, but the docstring says they are used instead of the normal nested. So the function's return is (control_args, nested_args), and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. 

Therefore, the code would be:

Initialize two dictionaries, control_args and nested_args. Iterate through each arg in args. For each arg, check if it's a control argument (like starts with '--control'), add to control_args. Otherwise, add to nested_args. The custom arguments are part of the nested_args. 

But how to determine if an argument is a control argument? Since the problem statement doesn't specify, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom arguments are part of the nested. Therefore, the code would process each arg, and if it's a control argument, add to control_args, else add to nested_args. 

So the code would look like:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('--control'):
            control_args[arg] = True
        else:
            nested_args[arg] = True
    return (control_args, nested_args)

But this is a big assumption. However, given the lack of specific criteria, this is the best approach. The function would split the args into control and nested, with the custom arguments being part of the nested. 

But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control, nested, and custom. But the return is two dictionaries. Therefore, the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. 

In that case, the code would be as above. However, the function's return is (dict, dict), so the code would return the two dictionaries. 

Therefore, the generated code would be as follows.
