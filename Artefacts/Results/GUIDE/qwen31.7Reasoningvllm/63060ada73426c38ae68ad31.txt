Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _convert_non_cli_args and it's part of a class. The docstring says it converts arguments to correct types by modifying the values_dict parameter. By default, all values are strings.

First, I should figure out what the function does. The function takes parser_name and values_dict. The docstring mentions that by default, all values are strings. So the function is supposed to cast these arguments to their correct types. But how?

Hmm, maybe the function is responsible for converting the values in the values_dict from strings to other types. For example, if the parser is 'main', maybe some arguments are integers or booleans. But the problem is, the function is supposed to modify the values_dict. So the function needs to iterate through the values in the dict and convert them to their appropriate types.

But the problem is, the function's implementation isn't given. The user wants me to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So I need to think about how to implement this.

Wait, the function is part of a class. The docstring says it's called _convert_non_cli_args. So perhaps this is a helper method in a class that handles argument conversion. The function's purpose is to cast the arguments to correct types.

But without knowing the specific types that need to be converted, it's a bit tricky. However, the docstring doesn't specify the types, so maybe the function is supposed to handle a general case. Maybe the function is supposed to convert the values to their correct types based on the parser name. For example, if the parser is 'virsh', maybe some arguments are integers, others are booleans, etc.

But since the function is supposed to be generic, maybe the code is supposed to handle common cases. For example, converting strings to integers, booleans, etc.

But how to do that? The function needs to iterate through the values in the values_dict and convert them. So perhaps the code would look something like this:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    for key, value in values_dict.items():
        # Convert to appropriate type
        if isinstance(value, str):
            # Check if it's a boolean
            if value.lower() in ('yes', 'y', 'true', 't'):
                values_dict[key] = True
            elif value.lower() in ('no', 'n', 'false', 'f'):
                values_dict[key] = False
            else:
                # Try to convert to integer
                try:
                    values_dict[key] = int(value)
                except ValueError:
                    # Maybe leave as string or raise an error?
                    # The docstring says "casts arguments to correct types", so perhaps it's supposed to convert to the best possible type.
                    # But without knowing the exact types, this is tricky.
                    # Maybe raise an exception?
                    # Or leave as string?
                    # The original code might have a default of string, so perhaps the function is supposed to convert to the best possible type.
                    # For example, if it's a string, but can be converted to an integer, then do that.
                    # But if not, leave as string.
                    # So in this case, maybe we can try to convert to integer, else leave as string.
                    # But the docstring says "casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param." So perhaps the function is supposed to convert to the correct type, but if it's not possible, leave as string.
                    # So in this case, we can try to convert to integer, else leave as string.
                    values_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # Handle other types, like boolean, etc.
            # But how?
            # Maybe check if it's a boolean and convert accordingly.
            # But this is getting complicated.
            # Maybe the function is supposed to handle common cases, like converting strings to integers, booleans, etc.
            # So perhaps the code would look like this:

            # Check if the value is a string and try to convert to integer
            # If not, check for boolean
            # Else, leave as is.

    return values_dict

But this is just a rough idea. However, the problem is that the function's implementation isn't given, and the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring.

Wait, the docstring says that by default all values are strings. So the function is supposed to cast them to correct types. But how? The function's implementation is missing. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle converting the values to their correct types based on the parser name.

But without knowing the specific types, it's hard to code. However, the function is part of a class, and the user might expect that the code is generic enough to handle common cases.

So perhaps the function is supposed to convert the values to their appropriate types, like converting strings to integers, booleans, etc. For example, if the value is a string, check if it's a boolean, then convert to boolean, else try to convert to integer, else leave as string.

But how to implement this in code?

Let me think of possible code. For each key in values_dict:

- If the value is a string, check if it's a boolean (case-insensitive), then set to boolean. Else, try to convert to integer. If that fails, leave as string.

But what about other types? For example, if the value is a list or a dictionary? The docstring says that the function is supposed to cast arguments to correct types, but the function's implementation is not given. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle the most common cases.

So the code could look like this:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    for key, value in values_dict.items():
        if isinstance(value, str):
            # Check for boolean
            if value.lower() in ('yes', 'y', 'true', 't'):
                values_dict[key] = True
            elif value.lower() in ('no', 'n', 'false', 'f'):
                values_dict[key] = False
            else:
                # Try to convert to integer
                try:
                    values_dict[key] = int(value)
                except ValueError:
                    # If it's not a number, leave as string
                    values_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # Handle other types, like boolean, but maybe the value is already a boolean?
            # Or maybe it's a list or other type?
            # For example, if the value is a boolean, leave as is.
            # But how to handle other types?
            # Maybe the function is supposed to convert to the best possible type, but for the sake of this problem, we can assume that the values are strings and other types are handled in a similar way.
            # So perhaps for non-string values, check if they are boolean and convert accordingly.
            # But this is getting complicated.
            # For example, if the value is a list, maybe it's supposed to be a list of strings, but the function is not given that information.
            # So perhaps the function is supposed to handle the most common cases, like converting strings to integers and booleans.
            # So for non-string values, maybe leave as is, or convert to boolean if possible.
            # But without knowing, it's hard to code.
            # So perhaps the code for non-string values is left as is, or converted to boolean if possible.
            # For example, if the value is a boolean, leave as is. If it's a number, leave as is. If it's a string, already handled.
            # So maybe the code for non-string values is:

            # Check if it's a boolean
            if isinstance(value, bool):
                continue  # already a boolean
            # Else, maybe convert to integer?
            # But how?
            # Maybe the function is supposed to handle the most common cases, and for other types, leave as is.
            # So in this case, the code would be:

            # If the value is a boolean, leave as is.
            # Else, if it's a number, leave as is.
            # Else, leave as is.
            # So in code:

            # Check if it's a boolean
            if isinstance(value, bool):
                continue
            # Check if it's a number (int or float)
            if isinstance(value, (int, float)):
                continue
            # Else, leave as is
            values_dict[key] = value

But this is just a possible approach. However, the problem is that the function's implementation is not given, and the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring.

So, putting it all together, the function would iterate through each key in the values_dict, check if the value is a string, and convert it to the appropriate type. For non-string values, maybe leave as is or convert to boolean if possible.

But the exact implementation depends on the specific use case. Since the docstring doesn't specify, the code should be generic enough to handle common cases.

So, the code would look something like this:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    for key, value in values_dict.items():
        if isinstance(value, str):
            # Check for boolean
            if value.lower() in ('yes', 'y', 'true', 't'):
                values_dict[key] = True
            elif value.lower() in ('no', 'n', 'false', 'f'):
                values_dict[key] = False
            else:
                # Try to convert to integer
                try:
                    values_dict[key] = int(value)
                except ValueError:
                    # If it's not a number, leave as string
                    values_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # Handle other types, like boolean, but maybe the value is already a boolean?
            # For example, if the value is a boolean, leave as is.
            # Else, maybe convert to integer?
            # But without knowing, assume that the value is already in the correct type.
            # So leave as is.
            values_dict[key] = value

But this code may not handle all cases, but it's a starting point. The function is supposed to cast arguments to correct types, so this code tries to convert strings to integers or booleans, and leaves others as is.

So, the final code would be this function, which modifies the values_dict by converting strings to appropriate types.
