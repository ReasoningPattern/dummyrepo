Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the split function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function split takes a string s and a platform parameter. The platform can be 'this' (auto-detect current platform), 1 (POSIX style), or 0 (Windows/CMD style). The goal is to split the string into parts based on the platform's rules.

First, I need to figure out how to detect the current platform. In Python, I can check the platform using os.name. But wait, os.name gives 'posix' for Unix-like systems and 'nt' for Windows. However, the platform parameter is 'this' which should auto-detect. So, if the platform is 'this', I need to determine the actual platform.

But wait, the function's docstring says that if platform is 'this', it auto-detects the current platform. So, the code should check the os.name and set the platform accordingly. But how to handle that in the function?

Wait, the function's parameters have platform as a string, but the docstring says that if it's 'this', it auto-detects. So, the function's logic is: if platform is 'this', use the current platform. Otherwise, use the specified platform.

So, the first step is to determine the platform. Let me think about how to do that.

In Python, os.name gives 'posix' for Unix-like systems and 'nt' for Windows. But for Windows, the platform might be 'nt' or 'win32' depending on the environment. However, the function's platform parameter is a string, so when platform is 'this', we need to determine the actual platform.

But the problem is that the function's code needs to handle the platform detection. So, the code would first check if the platform is 'this', then determine the actual platform.

But how to do that? Let me think. For example, if the platform is 'this', then:

if os.name == 'posix':
    platform = 1
elif os.name == 'nt':
    platform = 0
else:
    # maybe raise an error? Or handle it somehow?

But the function's docstring says that if platform is 'this', auto-detect. So, the code would first check the os.name and set the platform accordingly.

But then, the function's code would need to handle the splitting based on the platform.

So, the steps for the function:

1. Check if the platform is 'this'. If so, determine the actual platform (posix, nt, etc.) and set the platform variable.

2. Based on the platform value (0, 1, or 'this'), split the string s.

But wait, the platform parameter is a string, but in the function's code, when platform is 'this', we need to determine the actual platform. So, the code would first check if platform is 'this', then determine the actual platform.

But how to handle that in the code.

So, the code would look like:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            platform = 1
        elif os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            # Maybe raise an error? Or handle it?
            # For the sake of this problem, perhaps assume that the platform is detected correctly.
            # But maybe the function should handle other cases? The problem says to auto-detect, so perhaps the code should handle that.
            # But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that os.name is 'posix' or 'nt'.

    # Now, based on the platform value, split the string.

    if platform == 0:
        # Windows/CMD style splitting
        # Split on whitespace, but maybe using split() with default parameters?
        # Wait, in Windows, split() with default parameters splits on any whitespace, but the actual splitting might be different.
        # But the problem says to split the input string under the given platform. So, for platform 0, split on whitespace, but perhaps using split() with default parameters.

        # However, in Python, the split() method with no arguments splits on any whitespace, and returns a list. So, for platform 0, split on whitespace.

        return s.split()

    elif platform == 1:
        # POSIX style, which is similar to the default split in Python, but perhaps using split() with a separator?
        # Wait, POSIX style might refer to splitting on whitespace, but maybe using a different approach. But the problem says to split the input string under the given platform. So, for POSIX, perhaps split on whitespace.

        # So, same as platform 0, but maybe using split() with default parameters.

        return s.split()

    else:
        # platform is 'this'?
        # But wait, if platform is 'this', then we have already determined the platform. So, perhaps the code is:

        # If platform is 'this', then split using the default split (which is on whitespace).

        return s.split()

Wait, but the problem says that if platform is 'this', auto-detect. So, the code would first check if platform is 'this', then determine the actual platform. But how to handle that.

Wait, the code for platform detection:

if platform == 'this':
    if os.name == 'posix':
        platform = 1
    elif os.name == 'nt':
        platform = 0
    else:
        # Maybe raise an error? Or handle it?

But the problem says that the function should auto-detect the current platform. So, if the platform is 'this', then the code should determine the actual platform.

But in Python, os.name is 'posix' for Unix-like systems and 'nt' for Windows. So, for example, if the code is run on a Unix system, then platform would be 1. If on Windows, platform would be 0.

But what if the code is run on a system that is not Unix or Windows? Well, the problem probably assumes that the platform is either Unix or Windows.

So, the code would handle that.

But then, the function's code would have:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            platform = 1
        elif os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            # Maybe raise an error? Or handle it?
            # For the purpose of this problem, perhaps assume that the platform is detected correctly.
            # But the problem says to auto-detect, so perhaps the code should handle that.

    if platform == 0:
        return s.split()
    elif platform == 1:
        return s.split()
    else:
        # platform is 'this'?
        return s.split()

Wait, but in this code, if platform is 'this', then the code would set platform to 1 or 0 based on os.name. Then, the code would split using platform 0 or 1. But the problem says that the function returns the splitting result. So, for platform 0 and 1, the split is done with s.split().

But wait, the problem says that the function should split the input string under the given platform. So, for platform 0 (Windows/CMD style), perhaps the split is done using split() which splits on whitespace. But maybe the problem expects different splitting for different platforms. However, the problem's docstring doesn't specify different splitting methods for different platforms. It just says to split the input string under the given platform.

But the problem's docstring says that if platform is 1, use POSIX style. So, perhaps for POSIX style, the split is done using split() with a different separator. But the problem doesn't specify. So, perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both platforms, but the docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style. But without more info, perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both.

But the problem's docstring says that the function returns a list of splitting str. So, the code would split the string into parts based on the platform. But how?

Alternatively, maybe for platform 0 (Windows/CMD style), the split is done using split() with default parameters, which splits on whitespace. For platform 1 (POSIX style), perhaps split on a different separator, like commas or something else. But the problem doesn't specify. So, perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both platforms.

But the problem's docstring says that if platform is 1, use POSIX style. So, perhaps for POSIX style, the split is done using split() with a different separator. But without knowing the exact requirements, perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both.

But the problem's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both platforms. Therefore, the code would return s.split() for both platform 0 and 1.

But then, the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            platform = 1
        elif os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            # handle other platforms?
            # For the purpose of this problem, perhaps assume that the platform is detected correctly.
            # But the problem says to auto-detect, so maybe the code should handle that.
            # However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that the platform is detected correctly.
            # So, proceed.

    if platform == 0:
        return s.split()
    elif platform == 1:
        return s.split()
    else:
        return s.split()

But this seems too simplistic. However, the problem's docstring doesn't specify different splitting methods for different platforms, so perhaps this is acceptable.

But wait, the problem's docstring says that the function returns a list of splitting str. So, the code is supposed to split the string into parts based on the platform. But how?

Alternatively, maybe for platform 0 (Windows/CMD style), the split is done using split() with default parameters, which splits on whitespace. For platform 1 (POSIX style), perhaps split on a different separator, like commas. But without knowing, it's hard to say.

But the problem's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both platforms.

But then, the code would be as above.

But the problem's docstring says that if platform equals 1, use POSIX style. So, perhaps for POSIX style, the split is done using split() with a different separator. But again, without knowing, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the string into parts based on the platform's rules. For example, for platform 0 (Windows/CMD style), split on whitespace, and for platform 1 (POSIX style), split on a different separator. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both.

But then, the code would be as above.

But the problem's docstring says that the function returns a list of splitting str. So, the code would return s.split() for both platforms.

But then, the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            platform = 1
        elif os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            # handle other platforms?
            # For the purpose of this problem, perhaps assume that the platform is detected correctly.
            # So, proceed.

    if platform == 0:
        return s.split()
    elif platform == 1:
        return s.split()
    else:
        return s.split()

But this seems too simple. However, given the problem's docstring, perhaps this is the intended code.

But perhaps the problem expects that for platform 0 (Windows/CMD style), the split is done using split() with default parameters, and for platform 1 (POSIX style), split on a different separator. But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the string into parts based on the platform's rules, but the actual splitting method is the same for both platforms. So, the code would return s.split() for both.

In that case, the code would be as above.

But then, the function's code would have the platform detection, and then split using s.split().

But the problem's docstring says that the function returns a list of splitting str. So, the code would return s.split().

But then, the code would be as above.

But I need to make sure that the code handles the platform detection correctly.

Another thing to consider: the platform parameter is a string, but in the code, when platform is 'this', we check os.name and set platform to 1 or 0. So, for example, if the code is run on a Unix system, platform becomes 1. If on Windows, 0.

Then, the code would split using platform 0 or 1.

So, the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            platform = 1
        elif os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            # handle other platforms? Maybe raise an error?
            # But the problem says to auto-detect, so perhaps assume that os.name is 'posix' or 'nt'.
            # So, proceed.

    if platform == 0:
        return s.split()
    elif platform == 1:
        return s.split()
    else:
        return s.split()

But this code would return s.split() for all cases. However, the problem's docstring says that the function should split the input string under the given platform. So, perhaps the code is supposed to use different splitting methods for different platforms.

But without more information, it's hard to say. However, given the problem's docstring, perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both platforms.

But then, the code is as above.

But perhaps the problem expects that for platform 0 (Windows/CMD style), the split is done using split() with default parameters, and for platform 1 (POSIX style), split on a different separator. But since the problem doesn't specify, it's hard to know.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the string into parts based on the platform's rules. For example, for platform 0, split on whitespace, and for platform 1, split on a different separator. But again, without knowing, it's hard to code.

But given the problem's docstring, perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both platforms.

Therefore, the code would be as above.

But I need to write the code that follows the function signature and docstring.

Another thing to consider: the function's parameters. The platform parameter is a string, but in the code, when platform is 'this', it's handled. So, the code would handle that.

Now, the code would need to import os.

So, the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            platform = 1
        elif os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            # handle other platforms? Maybe raise an error?
            # For the purpose of this problem, assume that os.name is 'posix' or 'nt'.
            # So, proceed.
            pass  # or raise an exception?

    if platform == 0:
        return s.split()
    elif platform == 1:
        return s.split()
    else:
        return s.split()

But the problem says that the function returns a list of splitting str. So, the code would return s.split() for all cases.

But perhaps the code should use different splitting methods for different platforms. For example, for platform 0 (Windows/CMD style), split on whitespace, and for platform 1 (POSIX style), split on a different separator. But without knowing, it's impossible to code that.

But given the problem's docstring, perhaps the code is supposed to use split() for both platforms.

Therefore, the code is as above.

Now, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format, outputting only the code.

So, the final code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            platform = 1
        elif os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
        else:
            # handle other platforms?
            pass  # or raise an error?

    if platform == 0:
        return s.split()
    elif platform == 1:
        return s.split()
    else:
        return s.split()

But the problem says that the function should split the input string under the given platform. However, without knowing the exact splitting method for different platforms, the code is as above.

Another thing to consider: the platform parameter is a string, but in the code, when platform is 'this', it's handled. So, the code would set platform to 1 or 0 based on os.name.

But what if the platform is 'this' and the os.name is something else? For example, if the code is run on a system that is not Unix or Windows. But the problem says to auto-detect, so perhaps the code should handle that. However, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that os.name is 'posix' or 'nt'.

Therefore, the code is as above.

Now, the user wants the code generated, so the final code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            platform = 1
        elif os.name == 'nt':
            platform = 0
    if platform == 0:
        return s.split()
    elif platform == 1:
        return s.split()
    else:
        return s.split()

But wait, the code for platform == 'this' is handled inside the if statement. So, the code would check if platform is 'this', then determine the platform.

But in the code, after setting platform to 1 or 0, the code checks if platform is 0 or 1, and returns s.split().

But the code would return s.split() for all cases.

But the problem's docstring says that the function returns a list of splitting str. So, the code is correct.

Thus, the final code is as above.
