Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called status_str and takes a prefix parameter. The docstring says it returns a string where each element in the sorted self.messages list is added with the prefix.

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The function seems to generate a string by iterating over a sorted list of messages. Each message is added to the string with the prefix. So, the steps would be: sort the messages, then loop through each message, add the prefix and the message, and concatenate all these parts into a single string.

Wait, but the function is part of a class. The self.messages is likely a list that's being sorted. So the function needs to sort the messages before processing them. But wait, does the class have a method to sort the messages? The function is called status_str, which suggests that the class might have a method to sort the messages. But the function itself is just generating the string.

So, the function's logic would be: sort the messages, then iterate through each message, add the prefix and the message, and combine them. But how is the messages list sorted? The function doesn't mention sorting, so maybe the class has a method to sort it, or perhaps the messages are already sorted. But the docstring says "sorted self.messages list", so the function is supposed to sort them.

Wait, but the function is called status_str. Maybe the class has a method to sort the messages, but the function is just using that sorted list. So, the function would first sort the messages, then iterate through each element, adding the prefix and the element.

So, the code would look like:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    result = ''
    for message in sorted_messages:
        result += prefix + message
    return result

But wait, the docstring says "each visit add prefix and the element in the sorted self.messages list." So, the prefix is added before each element. So, the code is correct as above.

But what about the parameters? The prefix is optional, defaulting to empty string. So the function is correctly handling that.

Now, the user wants the code generated, outputting only the code in Python markdown format. So, the answer should be the code block with the function definition.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check again.

Yes, the function sorts the messages, then loops through each, adds the prefix and the message. So the code is correct.

So the generated code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return a string with visiting the sorted self.messages list, each visit add prefix and the element in the sorted self.messages list.
    """
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    result = ''
    for message in sorted_messages:
        result += prefix + message
    return result

But wait, the docstring is part of the function. The user's docstring is given, so the code must include that. So the code includes the function with the docstring as specified.

So the final code is as above. The user wants only the code generated, so I should present it in a code block.
