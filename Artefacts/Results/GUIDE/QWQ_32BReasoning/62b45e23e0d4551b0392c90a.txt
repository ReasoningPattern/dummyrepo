Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method validate_version_inventories based on the given docstring. Let's start by understanding what the method is supposed to do. 

The doc says each version should have an inventory up to that point. So for each version directory in the version_dirs array, which are ordered sequentially (like 1,2,3...), the inventory must exist and be correct up to that version. Also, we need to track any content digests that differ from the root inventory so they can be checked later. 

Hmm, the method is part of a class, so I'll have to consider instance variables or other methods that might be involved. But since the problem doesn't specify the rest of the class, I'll focus on what's needed here.

First, the unit tests. Since we're supposed to use test-driven development, I should start by writing tests. Let's think of possible test cases.

Test case 1: All versions have correct inventories. The method should pass, and maybe return some structure indicating no discrepancies except those tracked.

Test case 2: A version is missing its inventory. Then the method should raise an error or return an error state.

Test case 3: The content digests in a version's inventory differ from the root. The method should record these differences but not necessarily fail, unless the inventory is invalid.

Wait, the doc says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So the method's purpose is to validate that each version's inventory exists and up to date, and also collect differing digests. 

Wait, the method might return some data structure with the discrepancies. Or maybe it raises an error if any inventory is missing. Need to clarify.

The function's purpose is to validate the inventories. So if any version's inventory is missing or incorrect, it should probably raise an exception. But the part about tracking differing digests is for later checks, so maybe store them in a list or something.

Now, how to structure the code. The method will loop through each version directory in order. For each version, check its inventory. The inventory should include all content up to that version. 

Assuming that each version directory has an inventory file, perhaps named like 'inventory.json' or similar. The root inventory is the initial one, maybe version 1's inventory? Or the first version's inventory is the base, and each subsequent version adds to it?

Wait, the root inventory is probably the initial one, so any content in later versions that has different digests from the root's entries need to be tracked. So, for each version's inventory, compare its content entries with the root's. If there's a difference, record it.

Wait, perhaps the root inventory is the one from the initial version, and each subsequent version's inventory should include all previous entries plus new ones. So each version's inventory must be a superset of the previous ones. 

The method's steps might be:

1. Iterate over each version directory in version_dirs in order.
2. For each version, check if its inventory exists. If not, raise an error.
3. Read the inventory for that version.
4. Ensure that the inventory includes all entries from the previous versions. Wait, maybe not exactly, but up to that point. Maybe each version's inventory is cumulative. So each subsequent inventory must have all entries from the prior versions plus new ones.
5. Compare each content entry in the current inventory with the root inventory. If the digest is different, record it in a list or some structure.
6. Return the list of differing digests, or perhaps return a boolean indicating success along with the discrepancies?

But the problem says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory so that we can also check them when validating the content." So the method should collect those differing digests and perhaps return them, or store them in an instance variable.

The method's return type isn't specified, but given the docstring's instructions, perhaps it returns a list of differing content digests, or raises an error if any inventory is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to validate that the inventories are correct and track the differing digests as part of its process. So the method might not return anything but set an instance variable for the differing digests, or raise an exception if any inventory is missing.

Hmm, the problem states that the method is part of a class, so perhaps the differing digests are stored in a class variable. But the exact implementation details are unclear. Let's proceed based on the docstring.

Now, for the tests. Let's think of test cases:

Test 1: All inventories are present and correct. The method should not raise an error and collect any differing digests.

Test 2: One version is missing its inventory. The method should raise an error.

Test 3: A version's inventory has a content digest different from the root. The method should record it in the differing list but not raise an error.

Wait, but the first requirement is that each version should have an inventory up to that point. So the method must ensure that the inventories are present and correct. The differing digests are just tracked for later checks, but the validation here is about the existence and correctness of the inventories themselves.

Wait, maybe "up to that point" means that each inventory includes all the content up to that version. So each inventory must be a superset of the previous ones. So for version 2's inventory, it must have everything from version 1 plus new content.

Therefore, during validation, for each version, we can check that its inventory contains all entries from the previous version's inventory, plus new ones. So we need to track the previous inventory's content to compare.

Wait, but how does the method know what the previous inventory contains? The method's parameter is the list of version directories. So perhaps the method must process each version in sequence, keeping track of the accumulated inventory entries so far, and for each version's inventory, check that it includes all previous entries plus new ones.

Alternatively, maybe each version's inventory is a full list of all content up to that version, so each subsequent inventory must be a superset of the prior. Therefore, the method would need to check that the current version's inventory includes all entries from the previous version's inventory, plus any new entries.

To do this, the method would have to read each inventory in order, and for each step, verify that the current inventory's entries include all previous entries. 

But how to represent the inventories? Maybe each inventory is a dictionary where the keys are content IDs and the values are their digests. So for each version, the current inventory must have all the keys from the previous version, and possibly more.

So, the steps in code might be:

Initialize a set of all content entries (digests?) from the root inventory (the first version's inventory). Wait, no, the root is the first version. 

Wait, the first version's inventory is the root? Or the root is a separate thing? The doc says "content digests different from those in the root inventory". So the root inventory is a separate one, perhaps the initial one, but the version directories are for subsequent versions. Wait, maybe the root is the first version's inventory. 

Assuming that the first version in version_dirs is version 1, which's inventory is the root. Then each subsequent version's inventory must include all entries from previous versions, but their content digests may differ. 

Hmm, perhaps the method proceeds as follows:

- Start with the root inventory (from the first version directory's inventory).
- For each subsequent version directory (starting from the second one):
   - Check that its inventory exists.
   - Read its inventory.
   - Compare each entry in its inventory with the root's entries. If any digest differs, record it.
   - Also, ensure that the current inventory includes all entries from the previous version's inventory (since each inventory is cumulative). 

Wait, but how to check that the current inventory is a superset of the previous one. 

Alternatively, each version's inventory should contain all entries from the previous version plus any new entries, but the digests of existing entries can change? Or maybe the digests must match up to that point? The doc isn't entirely clear. 

The main point is that each version's inventory must exist and be up to that point. So maybe the inventory for version N must have all entries from versions 1 to N. 

The method's first responsibility is to ensure that all inventories exist and are in the correct sequence. The second is to track differing digests from the root.

Now, to code this:

The method would loop through each version in version_dirs in order. For each version:

- Read its inventory file. If it doesn't exist, raise an error (like ValueError or custom exception).
- For the first version (version_dirs[0]), this is the root inventory. Record all its entries (content IDs and their digests).
- For each subsequent version:
   - Read its inventory.
   - Check that all entries from the previous version's inventory are present in this one. Because each inventory is cumulative. Wait, but maybe the current inventory could have some entries removed? Probably not, since each version is an update. So the current inventory must include all previous entries plus new ones. So the current inventory's entries must be a superset of the previous one's.
   - For each entry in the current inventory:
      - If the entry was in the root inventory (version 1's), check if its digest is the same. If not, add to the differing list.
      - Also, ensure that all previous entries are included. 

Wait, the differing digests are only those that differ from the root. So even if an entry was added in version 2 and has a digest different from the root's (if it was present in the root?), then it's recorded. 

Hmm, perhaps the root is the first version's inventory, and any content in later versions that was present in the root but has a different digest is tracked. Also, any new content added in later versions would not be in the root, so their digests don't need to be compared to the root. 

Therefore, for each entry in each version's inventory:

- If the entry exists in the root's inventory (i.e., the first version's inventory has that content ID), and its digest is different, then record this discrepancy.
- Additionally, each subsequent inventory must include all entries from the previous inventory, so we need to check that the current inventory has all the entries from the prior step.

Putting this into code:

We can have a previous_inventory variable that starts as the first version's inventory. Then for each next version:

current_inventory = read_inventory(version_dir)
if not current_inventory includes all keys in previous_inventory:
   raise error
differences = [ (key, current_digest) for key, current_digest in current_inventory.items() 
                if key in root_inventory and current_digest != root_inventory[key] ]
record these differences somewhere.

Wait, but how to track the root inventory. The root is the first version's inventory. So we need to store that when processing the first version.

So steps:

Initialize:

root_inventory = None
previous_inventory = None
differing_digests = []

for idx, version_dir in enumerate(version_dirs):
    inventory = read_inventory(version_dir)  # need to implement this, perhaps via a helper method
    
    if idx == 0:
        # first version is the root
        root_inventory = inventory.copy()
        previous_inventory = inventory
    else:
        # check that all previous keys are present
        for key in previous_inventory:
            if key not in inventory:
                raise error("Inventory for version %s missing entry %s" % (version_dir, key))
        # now check for differing digests from root
        for key in inventory:
            if key in root_inventory:
                if inventory[key] != root_inventory[key]:
                    differing_digests.append( (key, inventory[key]) )
        # update previous_inventory to current
        previous_inventory = inventory.copy()
    
    # Also, check that the current inventory is properly built. Wait, maybe the current inventory has new keys, which is okay.

Wait, but the code above only checks that the current inventory has all the keys from previous_inventory (the previous version's inventory). That ensures that each inventory is a superset of the prior one. 

So that's the main check. 

Now, the method's purpose is to validate that all inventories are present and each is a superset of the previous, and track differing digests from the root. 

The method may return the list of differing digests, or perhaps store it in an instance variable. The doc says "keep a record", so maybe the method returns them, or the class has a variable to hold them. 

The function is part of a class, so perhaps it's supposed to store the differing digests in an instance variable. But without knowing the rest of the class structure, perhaps the method returns the list of differing digests. 

Alternatively, the method could raise an exception if any inventory is invalid, and collect the differing digests in a list that it returns. 

Now, the test cases. Let's think of some examples.

Test case 1: All inventories are valid, and no differing digests. 

Suppose version_dirs is [ 'v1', 'v2', 'v3' ]

v1's inventory has entries A (digest X), B (digest Y).

v2's inventory has A (X), B (Y), and C (Z).

v3's inventory has A (X), B (Y), C (Z), D (W).

The root is v1's inventory. So all entries in v2 and v3 that are in root (A and B) have same digests. So differing_digests is empty. The method should return that list.

Another test case where a later version has a different digest for an entry present in the root. 

Test case 2: v2's inventory has A with digest X', different from root's X. 

Then, the differing_digests would include (A, X'). 

The method should still not raise an error (since the inventory exists and is a superset), but record that difference. 

Another test case where a version's inventory is missing an entry from the previous version. 

Test case 3: v2's inventory lacks B. Then, the method should raise an error. 

Now, the tests need to mock the reading of inventories. Let's think how to write the tests.

Assuming that the method uses a helper function like _read_inventory(version_dir) to get the inventory as a dictionary. 

In the tests, we can mock this function's return value for each version directory. 

So in the test class, we can patch the _read_inventory method to return specific data. 

For example, in test_valid_inventories:

mocked_inventories = {
    'v1': {'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y'},
    'v2': {'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y', 'C': 'Z'},
    'v3': {'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y', 'C': 'Z', 'D': 'W'},
}

Then, the test would call self.validate_version_inventories(['v1', 'v2', 'v3']), and check that the differing_digests is empty.

Another test where a version's inventory is missing an entry:

mocked_inventories for 'v2' is missing 'B'. 

Then the method should raise an error. 

Another test where a digest differs: 

mocked_inventories['v2'] has 'A' with digest 'X2'. So the differing list should have that entry. 

Now, writing the test code. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format, so the code should be in a code block. 

First, the tests. Let's see. 

The tests would be in a test class. Let's assume that the class under test is called VersionManager or something. But since the method is part of a class, the tests would use a mock or a test subclass. 

Alternatively, perhaps the tests can be written using unittest framework. 

But since the user wants the code generated, here's how I'll proceed:

First, the tests. Let's write them using pytest and mocking. 

But to keep it simple, perhaps use unittest.mock to patch the inventory reading. 

The code would look something like:

import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from your_module import YourClass  # assuming the class is in a module

class TestValidateVersionInventories(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch.object(YourClass, '_read_inventory')
    def test_all_valid(self, mock_read_inventory):
        # setup mock to return valid inventories
        mock_read_inventory.side_effect = [
            {'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y'},  # v1
            {'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y', 'C': 'Z'},  # v2
            {'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y', 'C': 'Z', 'D': 'W'}  # v3
        ]
        version_dirs = ['v1', 'v2', 'v3']
        # assuming the method returns the differing digests
        result = YourClass().validate_version_inventories(version_dirs)
        self.assertEqual(result, [])  # no differing

    @patch.object(YourClass, '_read_inventory')
    def test_missing_entry(self, mock_read_inventory):
        # v2's inventory lacks B
        mock_read_inventory.side_effect = [
            {'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y'},  # v1
            {'A': 'X', 'C': 'Z'},  # v2 missing B
            # v3 can be anything but since v2 fails, it won't get there
        ]
        version_dirs = ['v1', 'v2', 'v3']
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
            YourClass().validate_version_inventories(version_dirs)
        self.assertIn("missing entry 'B'", str(context.exception))

    @patch.object(YourClass, '_read_inventory')
    def test_differing_digest(self, mock_read_inventory):
        mock_read_inventory.side_effect = [
            {'A': 'X', 'B': 'Y'},  # v1
            {'A': 'X2', 'B': 'Y', 'C': 'Z'},  # v2's A has different digest
            {'A': 'X2', 'B': 'Y', 'C': 'Z', 'D': 'W'}  # v3
        ]
        version_dirs = ['v1', 'v2', 'v3']
        result = YourClass().validate_version_inventories(version_dirs)
        expected = [('A', 'X2')]
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

Now, the actual code for the method. 

Assuming that the class has a helper method _read_inventory(version_dir) that returns a dictionary of content entries. 

The method would need to loop through the version_dirs, track the previous inventory and root inventory. 

The code for the method:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    root_inventory = None
    previous_inventory = None

    for idx, version_dir in enumerate(version_dirs):
        current_inventory = self._read_inventory(version_dir)
        if current_inventory is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Inventory for version {version_dir} not found")

        if idx == 0:
            # first version is the root
            root_inventory = current_inventory.copy()
            previous_inventory = current_inventory
        else:
            # Check that all previous entries are present
            for key in previous_inventory:
                if key not in current_inventory:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f"Inventory for version {version_dir} missing entry '{key}'"
                    )

            # Check for differing digests from root
            for key, digest in current_inventory.items():
                if key in root_inventory:
                    if digest != root_inventory[key]:
                        differing_digests.append((key, digest))

            previous_inventory = current_inventory.copy()

    return differing_digests

Wait, but in the code above, for each version after the first, we check that all keys from previous_inventory (the previous version's inventory) are present in the current one. That ensures that each inventory is a superset of the prior. 

Additionally, for each entry in the current inventory, if it's present in the root, check if the digest differs and record it. 

This should satisfy the requirements. 

Now, considering edge cases. What if there's only one version? Then root is that inventory, and no differing digests. 

Another case: a version after the first has a new entry not in root. That's okay, since the differing only cares about root's entries. 

Now, the code for the method assumes that _read_inventory returns the inventory as a dictionary, and raises an error if it's not found. 

The method returns the list of differing digest entries. 

This should align with the test cases written earlier. 

So putting it all together, the code would be as above. 

Wait, in the first iteration (idx 0), the current inventory is the first version's. Then, previous_inventory is set to that, and root is same. 

In the next versions, for each key in previous_inventory (which is the prior version's inventory), check that current has it. 

Yes, this should work. 

Now, the code must be in the Python markdown format, only the code. So the user expects the code for the method and the tests, but according to the problem statement, the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring, following TDD. 

The problem says to first generate the unit tests, then the code. But the user wants the code output. 

Wait, the instructions say: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." 

So the code to output is the method's code, not the tests. Wait, but the user also mentioned to follow TDD by first writing tests. But the output is supposed to be the code generated, not the tests. 

Hmm, maybe the user wants the actual method code, given the function signature and docstring. 

So, the code for the method would be as written above. 

But perhaps the helper function _read_inventory is part of the class. Since the problem doesn't mention it, maybe the code should include that. But without knowing the rest of the class structure, perhaps the helper is assumed to exist. 

Alternatively, maybe the method expects to have access to the inventories in another way, but given the problem's description, the code I wrote should be correct. 

Therefore, the final code for the method is as above. 

Wait, in the code above, the method uses self._read_inventory, so the class must have that method. But since the problem didn't specify, perhaps that's an implementation detail. 

Alternatively, maybe the method is part of a class where the inventories are stored elsewhere. But given the problem's constraints, the code is correct. 

Thus, the code to output is the method's code inside a class. 

Wait, the function signature is def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs): so it's a method in a class. 

So putting it all together, the code would be:

class YourClassName:
    def _read_inventory(self, version_dir):
        # This is a placeholder. Actual implementation depends on how inventories are stored.
        # For example, reading a file or querying a database.
        pass  # replace with actual code

    def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
        differing_digests = []
        root_inventory = None
        previous_inventory = None

        for idx, version_dir in enumerate(version_dirs):
            current_inventory = self._read_inventory(version_dir)
            if current_inventory is None:
                raise ValueError(f"Inventory for version {version_dir} not found")

            if idx == 0:
                root_inventory = current_inventory.copy()
                previous_inventory = current_inventory
            else:
                # Check all previous entries are present
                for key in previous_inventory:
                    if key not in current_inventory:
                        raise ValueError(
                            f"Inventory for version {version_dir} missing entry '{key}'"
                        )

                # Check differing digests from root
                for key, digest in current_inventory.items():
                    if key in root_inventory:
                        if digest != root_inventory[key]:
                            differing_digests.append((key, digest))

                previous_inventory = current_inventory.copy()

        return differing_digests

But the _read_inventory method's actual implementation is not provided, but since the problem's docstring doesn't mention it, perhaps it's part of the class. 

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to have access to the inventories through other means. 

In any case, the code for the method as per the problem's requirements is as above. 

So the final answer is the code block with the method and the helper, but since the helper isn't specified, perhaps the problem expects the code without it, but that's impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the _read_inventory is a method that's part of the class, and the user is to write the validate_version_inventories method. 

Therefore, the code provided is correct as written, assuming the helper exists. 

Hence, the answer should be the code for the method inside a class, including the helper's placeholder. 

Wait, but the user's function signature is only for the method in question. So perhaps the code should only include the method's code, assuming that the class has the necessary helper methods. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should not include the helper, but that's necessary for the method to function. 

Hmm, given the problem's instructions, the code to be output is the method's code. The helper is part of the class, but not part of the function signature provided. 

Therefore, the code to output is the method's code as written above (without the class definition and helper, but just the method). 

Wait, but the method is inside a class. So the code would be:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    root_inventory = None
    previous_inventory = None

    for idx, version_dir in enumerate(version_dirs):
        current_inventory = self._read_inventory(version_dir)
        if current_inventory is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Inventory for version {杧ion not found")

        if idx == 0:
            root_inventory = current_inventory.copy()
            previous_inventory = current_inventory
        else:
            for key in previous_inventory:
                if key not in current_inventory:
                    raise ValueError(...)
            for key, digest in current_inventory.items():
                if key in root_inventory and digest != root_inventory[key]:
                    differing_digests.append(...)
            previous_inventory = current_inventory.copy()

    return differing_digests

But with proper indentation and the rest. 

So the final code, formatted as Python in a markdown code block.
