Okay, I need to write a Python function called retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger that takes a handle and returns a parsed webfinger document as a dictionary. Let me think about how webfinger works for Diaspora.

First, the webfinger handle is in the format like user@domain.tld. The function has to make an HTTP request to the Diaspora pod to get the webfinger XML document. The standard endpoint for webfinger is https://pod.domain/.well-known/webfinger. The query parameters should include resource=acct:user@domain.tld.

So the steps are: send a GET request to the webfinger endpoint with the resource parameter, then parse the XML response. The XML should be parsed into a dictionary, probably extracting specific links related to the Diaspora protocol.

Wait, Diaspora's webfinger responses include a link with rel="self" and others like rel="diaspora". The important part is to find the link with rel="http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams" or similar, which points to the user's hcard URL. Or maybe the hcard is in the link's href attribute. Or perhaps the link has a specific rel type that we need to look for.

Looking up the Diaspora protocol specs, the webfinger response should have a link with rel="http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams" which contains the hcard URL. The function needs to extract that link's href as the user's profile URL.

So the parsing steps would involve:

1. Parse the XML to find all link elements.
2. Iterate through the links to find the one with the correct rel attribute.
3. Extract the href from that link and return it in a dictionary, perhaps with other relevant info.

Now, for the HTTP request. Using the requests library would be standard here. But since the user might not have it installed, maybe the function should assume it's available. The function should handle cases where the request fails (like 404, connection errors), but the docstring doesn't mention error handling. The returns are a dict, so maybe on failure, it returns an empty dict or raises an exception? The docstring says returns a dict, but perhaps it's better to raise exceptions, but the user might want to handle that.

But according to the problem statement, the function should return a dict. So maybe if the handle isn't found, the dict is empty? Or maybe it's structured with some keys. Need to see.

The unit tests are supposed to be written first. Let me think about the test cases.

First, a successful case where the handle exists. The test would mock the HTTP response, return a sample XML, and check that the parsed dict has the correct hcard URL.

Second, a case where the handle is invalid, like a 404 response. Then the function should return an empty dict or some indication of failure. The docstring says returns a dict, so maybe an empty dict in such cases.

Third, a case where the XML is malformed, so parsing fails. The function might return an empty dict again.

Fourth, test that the function properly constructs the URL with the handle.

So the unit tests would need to use mocking for requests.get. Let's see, in the tests, we can use the unittest.mock library to patch requests.get and return a Mock response with the desired content.

The actual code structure would be:

- Use requests.get to retrieve the webfinger document.
- Check the response status code. If not 200, return an empty dict?
- Parse the XML content.
- Find the correct link and extract href.
- Return a dictionary with the relevant info, perhaps like {'hcard_url': '...'}, or other fields.

Wait, the Diaspora webfinger response might also have other links. The exact structure of the dict returned is important. The function's docstring says it returns a dict, but doesn't specify keys. So maybe the function should return a dict with the hcard URL as the value for a key like 'link' or 'hcard_url', or perhaps more structured.

Looking at the Diaspora spec, the webfinger response includes a link with rel="http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams" which has the href pointing to the hcard. So the function needs to parse that link's href.

So the code steps:

Make the request:

response = requests.get(f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger", params={"resource": f"acct:{handle}"})

Wait, the handle is user@domain.tld, so split into user and domain. So domain is handle.split('@')[1].

Wait, the handle could be passed as 'user@domain', so first, split the handle into local part and domain.

Wait, but in the request, the resource is "acct:" + handle. So the handle is user@domain.tld, so the full resource is "acct:user@domain.tld".

So the code:

from requests import get

def retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle):
    resource = f"acct:{handle}"
    domain = handle.split('@')[1]
    url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
    params = {'resource': resource}
    response = get(url, params=params)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return {}
    # parse XML
    # parse here
    # find the link with rel="http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams"
    # extract href
    # return as dict
    # ...

Parsing the XML can be done with ElementTree. Let's see, in Python, using xml.etree.ElementTree.

So:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

root = ET.fromstring(response.text)

Then, look for all link elements in the XML. The XML is in the webfinger format, which uses the <link> tags under the root.

The namespaces might be an issue. The webfinger XML uses the 'wf' namespace. The standard namespace is "http://xmlns.org/ns/webfinger".

So the elements would be in that namespace. For example:

<link rel="http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams" href="..." />

So to find the link elements, we have to account for the namespace.

First, find all link elements with the correct rel attribute.

namespaces = {'wf': 'http://xmlns.org/ns/webfinger'}

links = root.findall('wf:link', namespaces)

Then, iterate over the links to find the one with rel="http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams".

for link in links:
    rel = link.get('rel')
    if rel == 'http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams':
        href = link.get('href')
        return {'hcard_url': href}

If not found, return an empty dict.

Putting it all together:

def retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle):
    try:
        resource = f"acct:{handle}"
        domain = handle.split('@')[1]
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
        params = {'resource': resource}
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            return {}
        root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
        namespaces = {'wf': 'http://xmlns.org/ns/webfinger'}
        links = root.findall('wf:link', namespaces)
        for link in links:
            rel = link.get('rel')
            if rel == 'http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams':
                href = link.get('href')
                return {'hcard_url': href}
        return {}
    except Exception:
        return {}

Wait, but splitting the handle into user and domain: handle.split('@') may return a list with two elements if there's exactly one @, but what if the handle is malformed? The function might raise an error, but according to the problem statement, it's supposed to return a dict. So perhaps the try block is needed to catch exceptions like split errors, and return empty dict.

But in the test-driven approach, the tests would need to cover cases where handle is valid, and invalid.

Now, the unit tests. The user said to first write comprehensive unit tests before the code. Let me think about how to write them using mock.

The tests would use the unittest module, with patch from unittest.mock to mock the requests.get.

Test case 1: valid handle, returns the correct hcard URL.

Mock the response to have a 200 status code, and a sample XML containing the desired link.

Test case 2: handle with no such user (404), returns empty dict.

Test case 3: invalid handle (no @ in handle), returns empty dict.

Test case 4: XML parsing error (invalid XML), returns empty dict.

Wait, but in the function, the except Exception would catch all exceptions, including parsing errors. So the tests can check those cases.

The test code would look something like:

import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from your_module import retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger

class TestWebfinger(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_valid_handle(self):
        handle = 'alice@pod.example'
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.status_code = 200
        mock_response.text = '''<XRD xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0">
            <Link rel="http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams" href="https://pod.example/users/alice.hcard" />
        </XRD>'''
        with patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response):
            result = retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle)
            self.assertEqual(result, {'hcard_url': 'https://pod.example/users/alice.hcard'})

    def test_invalid_handle(self):
        handle = 'bob'  # no @
        result = retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle)
        self.assertEqual(result, {})

    def test_404_response(self):
        handle = 'charlie@pod.example'
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.status_code = 404
        with patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response):
            result = retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle)
            self.assertEqual(result, {})

    def test_malformed_xml(self):
        handle = 'dave@pod.example'
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.status_code = 200
        mock_response.text = '<invalid xml>'
        with patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response):
            result = retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle)
            self.assertEqual(result, {})

    def test_missing_link(self):
        handle = 'eve@pod.example'
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.status_code = 200
        mock_response.text = '''<XRD xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0">
            <Link rel="other" href="..." />
        </XRD>'''
        with patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response):
            result = retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle)
            self.assertEqual(result, {})

These tests cover various scenarios. Now, the actual code.

Wait, in the code, when parsing the XML, the root element is in the XRD namespace. The links are under the 'wf:link' with the 'wf' namespace. But in the sample XML in the first test, the XRD has xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0", so the default namespace is different from the 'wf' namespace I used earlier. Wait, perhaps I got the namespace wrong?

Looking up the webfinger spec, the namespace for webfinger is "http://xmlns.org/ns/webfinger". But the example in the test uses a different namespace. Hmm, perhaps the actual namespace used in the XML might vary, but according to the standard, it should be using the correct namespace.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the namespace. Let me check: the webfinger XRD uses the namespace "http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0" for the XRD element, but the links are part of the webfinger profile, which uses the "http://xmlns.org/ns/webfinger" namespace. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the namespace handling.

Alternatively, maybe the links are in the default namespace. To avoid namespace issues, perhaps it's better to use find with the default namespace.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct namespace for the webfinger is "http://xmlns.org/ns/webfinger", so the XRD element's namespace is different, but the link elements are in the webfinger namespace. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should not use namespaces and just look for the 'Link' tag without namespaces. Because in the test example, the XML doesn't have any namespace prefixes, so maybe the code can ignore namespaces by using findall('Link').

Wait, in the first test's XML:

<XRD xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0">
    <Link rel="http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams" href="..." />
</XRD>

The Link element is in the default namespace of the XRD. But the webfinger specification might require using the webfinger namespace for the links. Hmm, perhaps this is a confusion between the XRD and webfinger namespaces.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can ignore the namespaces and just look for the 'Link' element in the default namespace.

So, in the code:

root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
links = root.findall('.//Link')  # using XPath to find all Link elements regardless of namespace?

Wait, but ElementTree's findall with namespaces can be tricky. Alternatively, using the default namespace:

ns = {'xrd': 'http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'}
links = root.findall('xrd:Link', ns)

But that would depend on the actual namespace in the XML. Since the test case uses the XRD namespace, perhaps the code needs to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the webfinger's namespace for the link elements. Maybe I should check the correct namespace for the webfinger links.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without worrying about namespaces by using the 'findall' without namespaces, but that may not be reliable.

Hmm, this is a bit of a snag. To make the test pass as per the first test case, the code would need to find the Link element in the default namespace of the XRD.

So in the code:

links = root.findall('{http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0}Link')

Alternatively, in the code, since the XRD's namespace is fixed, but the webfinger's links may be in the same namespace?

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use:

for link in root.iter('{http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0}Link'):

Then check the rel attribute.

In the first test case's XML, the Link is in the XRD's namespace. So the code would need to use that namespace when searching.

So the code would have:

namespaces = {'xrd': 'http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'}

links = root.findall('xrd:Link', namespaces)

Then, check each link's rel attribute.

Ah, so the initial code's namespace handling was incorrect. The correct namespace for the Link element is the XRD's default one, not the webfinger's.

So the code needs to adjust for that.

So the corrected code steps:

After parsing the XML:

root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
links = root.findall('{http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0}Link')

Wait, but in ElementTree, the tag includes the namespace prefix. So the code can iterate through all Link elements in that namespace.

Alternatively, using findall with the namespace:

namespaces = {'xrd': 'http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'}

links = root.findall('xrd:Link', namespaces)

Then, for each link in links:

rel = link.get('rel')

So that should work.

Therefore, the code's parsing part should be adjusted to use the correct namespace.

Updating the code:

def retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle):
    resource = f"acct:{handle}"
    domain = handle.split('@')[1]
    url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
    params = {'resource': resource}
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    if response.status_code != 2嘲笑200:
        return {}
    root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
    namespaces = {'xrd': 'http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'}
    links = root.findall('xrd:Link', namespaces)
    for link in links:
        rel = link.get('rel')
        if rel == 'http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams':
            href = link.get('href')
            return {'hcard_url': href}
    return {}

Wait, but the ElementTree's findall with namespaces requires using the namespace prefix in the XPath expression. So the code should be:

links = root.findall('{http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0}Link')

Alternatively, using the namespace dictionary:

links = root.findall('xrd:Link', namespaces)

Yes.

This should find all Link elements in the XRD namespace.

Thus, the code should work with the test cases.

Now, putting all together, the code would require importing requests and ElementTree.

So the final code would be:

import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle):
    try:
        resource = f"acct:{handle}"
        domain = handle.split('@')[1]
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
        params = {'resource': resource}
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            return {}
        root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
        namespaces = {'xrd': 'http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'}
        links = root.findall('xrd:Link', namespaces)
        for link in links:
            rel = link.get('rel')
            if rel == 'http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams':
                href = link.get('href')
                return {'hcard_url': href}
        return {}
    except Exception:
        return {}

Wait, but splitting the handle on '@' may raise an error if there are multiple @ symbols or none. The try block would catch that, and return an empty dict.

Testing this code with the unit tests:

The first test case's XML uses the XRD namespace, so the code should find the Link and return the href.

The second test case (invalid handle with no '@') would hit the split error, caught by the try block, and return empty dict.

The third test case (404) returns empty dict.

The fourth test case (malformed XML) would throw an ET.ParseError, caught by the except block, returning empty dict.

The fifth test case (missing link) returns empty dict.

So this code should work with the test cases.

Now, I need to output the code in Python markdown format, only the code. The user said to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with the language specified.

Wait, the user's instruction says "output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format". So the code should be in a code block with ```python, and nothing else.

So putting it all together:

The final code would be:

```python
import requests
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def retrieve_and_parse_diaspora_webfinger(handle):
    try:
        resource = f"acct:{handle}"
        domain = handle.split('@')[1]
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
        params = {'resource': resource}
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            return {}
        root = ET.fromstring(response.text)
        namespaces = {'xrd': 'http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0'}
        links = root.findall('xrd:Link', namespaces)
        for link in links:
            rel = link.get('rel')
            if rel == 'http://joindiaspora.com/rel/streams':
                href = link.get('href')
                return {'hcard_url': href}
        return {}
    except Exception:
        return {}
```

Wait, but in the code above, after splitting the handle into parts, the code uses handle.split('@')[1], which is the domain part. But what if the handle has more than one '@'? Like 'user@domain@other'? Then split would return ['user', 'domain', 'other'], and [1] would be 'domain', but the actual domain is 'domain@other'? That's an invalid handle, but the code would proceed with the domain as 'domain', leading to an incorrect URL. But since the function is supposed to return a dict, perhaps it's acceptable to return empty in such cases, as the handle is invalid. The try block will catch the case where splitting returns less than two elements (like handle = 'bob' becomes ['', '']? No, 'bob'.split('@') gives ['bob'], so split[1] would be index error.

In the try block, that error would be caught, and return empty dict.

So the code is correct in that aspect.

Thus, the code is as above.
