Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called deprecated that takes a message and marks functions or methods as deprecated. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function deprecated should return a decorator. So the structure would be something like: the deprecated function creates a decorator that wraps the original function, adding a warning.

Wait, right. So when someone uses @deprecated("message"), it should wrap the function and issue a DeprecationWarning or similar. But how to actually emit the warning with the message?

I remember that Python has the warnings module. So I should import warnings and then, in the decorator, create a wrapper function that issues the warning whenever the original function is called.

The steps would be:

1. The deprecated function returns a decorator (so it's a higher-order function).
2. The decorator itself takes the original function as an argument.
3. The decorator returns a wrapper function that calls the original function but also issues a warning.

So the structure would look like:

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(message, DeprecationWarning)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but I need to make sure to use functools.wraps to preserve the original function's name and docstring. Oh right, so I should import functools.

Also, the warning message should include the function name maybe? Wait, looking at the docstring, the user's doc says "Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods." So the message is provided by the user, but perhaps the warning should also mention that the function is deprecated.

Alternatively, maybe the message is part of the warning. Like, the user can specify the message to include details like what to use instead.

Wait, the function's docstring says it returns a decorator for deprecating functions. So the decorator should mark the function as deprecated, and when called, it should emit a warning with the given message.

Hmm, so the code structure is as I thought. But I need to make sure to use the warnings module correctly.

Also, in the tests, I should check that the warning is issued when the decorated function is called. But how to test that?

For the unit tests, maybe using the warnings module's catch_warnings context manager. Let's think of writing tests first, as per TDD.

So first, write the tests. Let's see:

Test 1: Check that calling a deprecated function issues a warning with the correct message.

Test 2: Ensure that the original function's return value is preserved.

Test 3: Check that the deprecated decorator works with methods (like instance methods in a class).

Test 4: Maybe check that the function's name and docstring are preserved via functools.wraps.

Hmm, okay. Let's outline the tests.

First, import necessary modules: unittest, warnings, and the module where deprecated is defined.

Wait, but in the code, the user is to write the code, so the tests would be in a separate test file. But for the code generation, I need to think of the tests first.

Sample test code:

import unittest
import warnings
from my_module import deprecated

class TestDeprecatedDecorator(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_issues_warning(self):
        message = "This function is deprecated; use new_function instead."

        @deprecated(message)
        def my_func():
            pass

        with self.assertWarns(DeprecationWarning) as cm:
            my_func()

        self.assertEqual(str(cm.warning), message)

    def test_returns_correct_value(self):
        message = "Deprecated."

        @deprecated(message)
        def add(a, b):
            return a + b

        result = add(2, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def test_method_deprecation(self):
        message = "Use a different method instead."

        class MyClass:
            @deprecated(message)
            def my_method(self):
                return "called"

        instance = MyClass()
        with self.assertWarns(DeprecationWarning):
            result = instance.my_method()
        self.assertEqual(result, "called")

    def test_preserves_function_metadata(self):
        @deprecated("Deprecated.")
        def test_func():
            "Test function docstring."
            pass

        self.assertEqual(test_func.__name__, 'test_func')
        self.assertEqual(test_func.__doc__, 'Test function docstring.')

But wait, in Python 3.2+ there's assertWarns, which is good. Also, the test for the docstring and name requires using functools.wraps.

So the code must include functools.wraps around the wrapper function.

In the code, I need to import warnings and functools.

Putting it all together, the code for the deprecated function would be:

import warnings
from functools import wraps

def deprecated(message):
    """
    Return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods.
    """
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            warnings.warn(message, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, why stacklevel=2? Because the warning should appear to come from the caller's perspective, not from the wrapper. The stacklevel is used to make the warning's source line be the call to the deprecated function, not the wrapper's code. So setting stacklevel=2 would shift the warning's origin to the caller.

That's probably a good idea. So including that.

Now, checking the tests again. The first test uses assertWarns, which checks the context. The message should match exactly.

Another point: The warnings.warn call uses the message provided, and the category is DeprecationWarning.

I think that's all. So the code should look like that.

Wait, but in the wrapper function, when you call func(*args, **kwargs), that's correct. So the function's behavior is preserved except for the warning.

Yes. That should work.

Now, the tests would cover the cases. So the code should be correct.
