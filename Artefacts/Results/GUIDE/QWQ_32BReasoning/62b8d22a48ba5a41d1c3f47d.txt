Okay, I need to implement the pop method for a dictionary-like class in Python. Let's see. The function signature is def pop(self, key, default=__marker):. The docstring explains that if the key is found, it removes it and returns the value. If not found, it returns the default if provided, otherwise raises a KeyError.

Hmm, first, I should think about how this method should work. The default parameter has a special value __marker, which I guess is a unique object used to detect if the default was provided. So, in the code, if the key is in the dictionary, we remove it and return the value. If not, check if a default was given. If yes, return that. If not, raise KeyError.

Wait, but how do I handle the __marker? Because when the user calls D.pop(key), and the key isn't there, we need to raise KeyError. But if they call D.pop(key, some_default), then return that.

So the steps inside the method would be:

1. Check if key is present in self (assuming self is a dictionary-like object, maybe a subclass of dict or has a dictionary as an attribute). Let's assume self has a dictionary stored in something like self.data.

Wait, but the code is part of a class. Since the problem mentions "You are a Python software engineer" and to generate code based on the signature, probably the class is a dictionary subclass or a custom dict-like class. For the code, I'll need to have access to the underlying data structure. Let's assume that the class has a dictionary stored in self.storage or something like that. Wait, maybe the code is for a class that's a subclass of dict? Or maybe it's a custom class with its own storage?

Wait, the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." The function is a method of a class. So the code must be part of a class. Since the function is pop, which is a standard dict method, perhaps the class is a subclass of dict, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a custom class that implements a dictionary interface.

Hmm, but in the code, to make this work, we need to have access to the data. Since the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, perhaps we can assume that the class has a dictionary stored in a member like self.data. Or perhaps it's a subclass of dict, so that self is the dictionary itself. Let me think.

If the class is a subclass of dict, then the code can use self directly. But if not, maybe the class has its own storage. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code should be written assuming that the class has a __dict__ or similar. Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that uses a dictionary as its internal storage, like in a __data attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that is a dictionary, so the pop method would be overriding or extending the standard dict's pop. But in that case, the code would call the original pop, but maybe with some modifications. Wait, no, the problem is to write the code for the pop method as per the given docstring, so probably the code needs to implement it from scratch, assuming that the class has a way to store and retrieve keys.

Wait, perhaps the code is part of a class that is a subclass of dict, so the instance itself is a dictionary. So when we do self.pop, it's acting on the instance's keys. So in that case, the code can be written as:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        val = super().pop(key)
        return val
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but using super() here would call the dict's pop, which is okay. But maybe the class is not a subclass of dict. Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a custom class that has its own storage, like a database or something else, but in the problem's context, since it's similar to the dict's pop, maybe it's safe to assume that the class is a subclass of dict. But the problem might not require that. Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that has a dictionary as an attribute, like self.items or something.

Alternatively, maybe the code is for a class that's a subclass of dict, so the code can use self's own keys and the pop method. Wait, but then the code would have to override the pop method, so perhaps using the standard pop but with the default handling.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that's not a dict, but has a __storage__ or similar. Let me think again.

The problem says to generate the code for the pop method with the given signature and docstring. The user probably expects code that works for a custom class that is similar to a dictionary, but perhaps the code can be written assuming that the class has a dictionary stored in an attribute like self.data. Let me structure the code that way.

Wait, but how do I know? Since the problem is to generate the code, perhaps I can proceed as follows:

Assuming that the class has a dictionary stored in self, perhaps as a subclass of dict. So the code can proceed as:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self:
        # Remove the key and return the value
        value = super().pop(key)
        return value
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but if the class is a subclass of dict, then using super().pop would work. But if the class is not a subclass of dict, then this approach won't work. Hmm, perhaps the code should be written in a way that works without assuming the class is a dict.

Alternatively, perhaps the class has a __storage__ dictionary as an instance variable, and the pop method works on that. For example:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.__storage__:
        return self.__storage__.pop(key)
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

But then, the code would need to have __storage__ as part of the class's attributes. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the first approach is better, assuming that the class is a subclass of dict. But then, how to implement the pop correctly?

Wait, the standard dict's pop method already does exactly what the docstring describes. So if the class is a subclass of dict, then overriding pop with the same behavior would just be redundant, unless there's some additional logic. But the problem's docstring is exactly the same as the standard dict's pop. So perhaps the problem is to write the code for a class that is a subclass of dict, but the code is supposed to replicate the existing functionality? That seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to write the code for a custom class that isn't a subclass of dict, but needs to implement a pop method with that behavior. So in that case, the code would have to manage its own storage.

Hmm, given that the problem doesn't give any other context, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the class has a dictionary stored in an instance variable, like self.data. Let's proceed with that.

So the code would look like this:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
    If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
    """
    # Check if the key exists in our storage
    if key in self.data:
        # Remove and return the value
        return self.data.pop(key)
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

But then, the __marker is a sentinel value. The user's code uses default=__marker in the function signature. So the __marker must be a unique object. So in the class, perhaps __marker is defined as a class-level attribute, like:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()
    def pop(...):

Wait, but in the code, the function is using default=__marker, so the __marker must be in the current scope. So maybe the class has a __marker attribute. So in the code, when defining the pop function, the __marker is the one from the class.

Alternatively, maybe the __marker is a module-level variable. But the problem's function signature shows that the default is set to __marker, so the code must have access to that variable. So perhaps the __marker is defined in the class. So the code would need to refer to self.__class__.__marker or something like that.

Hmm, perhaps the code should use a sentinel object. Alternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that the __marker is defined as an object in the class.

Alternatively, maybe the code can check if the default is the same as the __marker. So in the code's function, when the user calls D.pop(k), the default is __marker (the same object as in the function's parameter). So in the code:

if default is __marker: then raise KeyError.

So in the code, the __marker is the same object as the one used in the function's default parameter. Therefore, the code can check if the default is the same as __marker. So the code can be written as:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    # Check if the key is present
    if key in self.data:
        return self.data.pop(key)
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)

But in this case, the __marker must be the same as the one in the function's default parameter. So the function's default is set to the __marker variable in the current scope, so when the code is written, the __marker must be defined. So perhaps in the class, there's a class-level __marker variable.

Wait, but the function's parameter default is set to __marker, which implies that __marker is in the current namespace. So perhaps the __marker is defined in the class. For example:

class MyClass:
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        ...

So the __marker is the class's attribute. So in the code, when the default is passed as __marker (the class's __marker), then the check works.

Therefore, in the code, the __marker is accessible as the class's attribute. So in the code, when checking if default is __marker, it's comparing to the same object.

Therefore, the code can proceed as above.

But now, the code's structure depends on how the class is structured. Since the problem only gives the function's signature and docstring, perhaps the code should assume that the class has a data storage, like self.data, and that __marker is a class attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can be written without relying on __marker being a class attribute, but using a sentinel. Wait, perhaps the __marker is a module-level variable? Not sure. The problem's function signature uses default=__marker, so the __marker must be defined in the same scope where the function is defined. So in the class, the __marker is probably a class-level variable.

Putting this all together, here's the code:

Assuming that the class has a dictionary stored in self.data, and the __marker is a class-level attribute.

Now, the unit tests. The user mentioned to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So I should think of test cases first.

Test cases for pop:

1. Key exists: should remove it and return the value.
2. Key does not exist, default provided: returns default.
3. Key does not exist, no default: raises KeyError.

Also, edge cases like multiple calls, checking that the key is removed, etc.

Let me structure the tests. Let's say we have a test class.

But since the code is part of a class, perhaps the test would be something like:

import unittest

class TestPopMethod(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_existing_key(self):
        d = MyDict({'a': 1, 'b': 2})
        val = d.pop('a')
        self.assertEqual(val, 1)
        self.assertNotIn('a', d)
        self.assertIn('b', d)
        self.assertEqual(d['b'], 2)
    
    def test_non_existing_key_with_default(self):
        d = MyDict({'x': 5})
        val = d.pop('y', 10)
        self.assertEqual(val, 10)
        self.assertIn('x', d)
    
    def test_non_existing_key_without_default(self):
        d = MyDict({'z': 3})
        with self.assertRaises(KeyError):
            d.pop('w')
    
    def test_multiple_pops(self):
        d = MyDict({'k1': 100, 'k2': 200})
        v1 = d.pop('k1')
        self.assertEqual(v1, 100)
        v2 = d.pop('k2', 300)
        self.assertEqual(v2, 200)
        self.assertEqual(len(d), 0)
    
    def test_default_is_not_used_when_key_exists(self):
        d = MyDict({'key': 'value'})
        result = d.pop('key', 'default')
        self.assertEqual(result, 'value')
        self.assertNotIn('key', d)

These tests cover the main cases. Now, the code.

Now, implementing the code. Let's assume the class has a data dictionary stored in self.data.

Wait, but how does the class manage the data? For example, if the class is a subclass of dict, then self is the dictionary. So in that case, the code could be:

class MyDict(dict):
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        if key in self:
            return super().pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but in this case, the __marker in the function's default is set to the class's __marker. So the comparison is correct.

Alternatively, if the class isn't a subclass of dict, but uses its own data structure, like:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        if key in self.data:
            return self.data.pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

This would be the code for a custom dictionary-like class.

The problem's function signature is given as def pop(self, key, default=__marker):, so the code must match that. The __marker is a class attribute, so in the code, the default is set to the class's __marker.

Thus, the code would look like the second example (using self.data).

Therefore, the code to be generated is for a class that has a data dictionary stored in self.data, and uses __marker as a class attribute.

Now, putting it all together, the code would be:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self.data:
            return self.data.pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but the __init__ method needs to initialize self.data. So in the actual code, the class should have an __init__ that sets self.data to a dictionary. Otherwise, when creating an instance, accessing self.data would cause an error.

So the full code would include that:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        if key in self.data:
            return self.data.pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

But the problem's code only requires the pop method. However, the user might have other methods, but since the question is only about the pop function's code, perhaps the code is just the method's implementation, assuming that the class has a data attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the code to be part of a subclass of dict, so that the pop method uses super().

Alternatively, maybe the code is for a class that is a subclass of dict, so the data is stored in the instance itself.

Let me think again. Let's see the standard dict's pop method:

When you call d.pop(key, default), it removes the key and returns the value, or returns default if not present. So the code for a subclass would need to use the same behavior. But to implement it, the subclass can use the parent's pop.

Wait, but the standard dict's pop already does this. So why would you override it? Maybe the problem is to write this method from scratch, not using the parent's implementation, which would be necessary if the class isn't a subclass of dict.

Assuming that the class is not a subclass of dict, and has its own data structure, the code would have to manage its own storage (like self.data), and the pop method would check that storage.

Therefore, the code for the pop method would be as above.

So, putting it all together, the generated code would be:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = {}

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self.data:
            return self.data.pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but the __init__ method is necessary here. Without it, the data attribute wouldn't exist. So the code must include that. But the problem's function signature is only for the pop method, so perhaps the code should only include the pop method's implementation, assuming the class has the necessary data structure.

Hmm, but the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So maybe the code to be generated is just the method's code, not the entire class. But the code needs to work, so perhaps the class is part of it.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that is a subclass of dict, so the __init__ is handled by the parent class, and the pop method can use super().

Wait, let's try that approach.

class MyDict(dict):
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        if key in self:
            return super().pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

This way, the code uses the dictionary's own storage. But in this case, the __marker is a class attribute, so the default parameter is set to that. The comparison between default and self.__marker (which is the same as the class's __marker) works.

This would also work, and perhaps is a better approach since it's using the built-in dict's pop.

However, the problem's docstring is exactly the same as the standard dict's pop, so perhaps this is just an override for some reason, but the code would work as intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the code to be written for a custom class that isn't a dict subclass, hence requiring the data attribute approach.

In either case, the code must be written to fit the function's signature and the docstring.

Assuming that the code is part of a class that has a data dictionary (like self.data), the code would be as previously.

But the problem requires only the code for the pop method. So perhaps the code should be written as a method inside a class, but the user is to generate the code for that method, including any necessary class attributes like __marker.

Therefore, the code would be:

class MyDict:
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self.data:
            return self.data.pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

But this requires that the class has an __init__ method that initializes self.data. So perhaps the code should include that as well. But the problem's function signature is only for the pop method. Since the user is to generate the code for the function, perhaps the code is just the method, but within the context of the class.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be part of a class that's a subclass of dict, so the __init__ is handled by the parent, and the data is stored in the instance itself.

In that case:

class MyDict(dict):
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        if key in self:
            return super().pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

This would work. The __init__ would be inherited from dict, so when creating an instance, you can pass in the initial data as a dictionary.

In this case, the code is correct and minimal.

The test-driven approach would first write the tests, then the code.

Now, the user's instructions say to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So they want the code enclosed in ```python ... ```.

Therefore, the final code would be either of the two options. But which one is better?

The problem's function signature is part of a class. The docstring matches the standard dict's pop, so perhaps the intended solution is to subclass dict and override the pop method, using the __marker as a class attribute.

So I think the code should be:

class MyDict(dict):
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is抬

        if key in self:
            return super().pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

Wait, but in the code, the __marker in the default parameter is set to the class's __marker. Because when defining the method, the default is set to MyDict.__marker, which is the same as the class's __marker. So when comparing default to self.__marker, it's correct.

Yes, this should work.

So the final code would be:

class MyDict(dict):
    __marker = object()

    def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
        """
        D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
        If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
        """
        if key in self:
            return super().pop(key)
        else:
            if default is not self.__marker:
                return default
            else:
                raise KeyError(key)

This code uses the parent class's pop method, so it's efficient and correct. The __marker is a class-level object to serve as the sentinel for the default parameter.

Therefore, this should be the correct code.
