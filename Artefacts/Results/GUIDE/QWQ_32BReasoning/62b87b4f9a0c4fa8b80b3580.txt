Okay, I need to write a Python function called integral that takes two parameters, bins and edges, and calculates the area of the overall graph. Let me think about what this means. 

Hmm, the function's docstring says it's to calculate the area of the overall graph. Since it's using bins and edges, this probably refers to a histogram. In a histogram, the bins are the heights, and the edges are the boundaries between the bins. The area would be the sum of each bin's height multiplied by the width of the corresponding edge interval.

Wait, right. So each bin has a certain height, and the edges define the x-values. For each bin i, the width is edges[i+1] - edges[i]. The area for that bin is bin_height * width. So the total area is the sum over all bins of (bins[i] * (edges[i+1] - edges[i])).

So the parameters: bins is a list of the heights, and edges is a list of the edge values. The length of edges should be one more than the length of bins. For example, if there are 3 bins, edges has 4 elements.

So the steps are: iterate over each bin index, calculate the width between edges[i] and edges[i+1], multiply by the bin's value, and accumulate the sum.

But first, I need to make sure that the input is valid. Like, the length of edges must be len(bins)+1. Otherwise, it's an error. But the problem didn't mention handling errors, so maybe the function can assume that the inputs are correct. Or perhaps I should include a check?

The problem says to generate the code based on the signature and docstring, so maybe just proceed with the calculation assuming valid inputs.

So the code structure would be:

def integral(bins, edges):
    total = 0.0
    for i in range(len(bins)):
        width = edges[i+1] - edges[i]
        total += bins[i] * width
    return total

Wait, but in Python, for loops can be done with indices. So that should work. Let me test this logic with an example.

Suppose bins = [1, 2, 3], edges = [0, 1, 2, 3]. Then each bin's width is 1. The area is (1*1)+(2*1)+(3*1) = 6. The code would return 6, which is correct.

Another example: bins = [2, 3], edges = [0, 2, 5]. The widths are 2 and 3. So 2*2 +3*3 =4 +9 =13. The code should work here.

So that's the plan. Now, the problem mentions using test-driven development, so first I need to generate unit tests before writing the code. But the user wants me to output only the code, so maybe I should think of the tests to ensure the code is correct.

Wait, the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code is the function as above. But perhaps I should also make sure that edge cases are considered. Like, if the bins are empty? But the function probably expects non-empty inputs. Or if edges have varying widths. 

Another test case: edges with different widths. Let's say bins = [1, 1], edges = [0, 1, 3]. The widths are 1 and 2. So area is 1*1 +1*2= 3.

So the code should handle that.

Therefore, the code I write should be as above. Let me check if there are any possible errors. Oh, the loop runs for each bin, and for each i, edges[i+1] must exist. Since edges is len(bins)+1, the loop will run from 0 to len(bins)-1, so i+1 goes up to len(bins), and edges has exactly that many elements. So it should be okay.

Therefore, the code should be as written.
