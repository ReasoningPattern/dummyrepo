Okay, I need to write a Python function called difference that takes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, and an optional level parameter which defaults to -1. The function should return a new dictionary containing the items from d1 that are not present in d2. But I also have to consider the level parameter, which probably controls the depth of comparison for nested dictionaries.

Hmm, first, the docstring says to return items from d1 not in d2. So for each key in d1, if the key isn't in d2, include it. But if the key is in d2, maybe we need to compare the values? Wait, the problem might be that if the value in d1 is different from d2's value for the same key, then it should be included. Or wait, maybe the function is supposed to return all keys from d1 that are not present in d2 at all, regardless of their value? Or does it also include keys that are present but have different values? The docstring isn't entirely clear. Let me read it again. The description says "items from d1 not contained in d2." So "not contained" probably refers to the keys. So the function would return all keys in d1 that are not in d2, with their values. Wait, but maybe the values also have to be different? Like, if the key is present in both, but the value in d1 is different, then the key is included? Or is it just the keys not in d2?

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The example given in the problem might clarify this. Wait, but there's no example. Let me think. The standard interpretation might be that the keys are not present in d2. So, for the function, the result is {k: v for k, v in d1.items() if k not in d2}.

But the presence of the level parameter complicates things. The level is probably for nested dictionaries. So if the level is -1 (the default), it might compare the entire structure, but if the level is set, it compares only up to that depth. Wait, the function's purpose is to find items in d1 not in d2. So perhaps for nested structures, when level is specified, the comparison is done recursively up to that level. 

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to compare keys and their values recursively for nested dictionaries, and the level parameter controls how deep to go. For example, if two dictionaries have a key with the same top-level value (like a list or another dictionary), but differ at a deeper level, whether those are considered equal depends on the level parameter. 

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter determines how deeply nested the keys can be. Like, if level is 0, it's just the top-level keys. If level is 1, then it also considers first-level nested keys, etc. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of the possible cases. 

First, the basic case where the dictionaries are not nested. The function should return all keys from d1 that are not present in d2. So for example, if d1 has keys 'a', 'b', and d2 has 'a', then the result is {'b': value}.

But if the level is involved, maybe when the values are dictionaries themselves, the function needs to check deeper. For example, if d1 has {'a': {'x':1}}, and d2 has {'a': {'y':2}}, then the key 'a' is present in both, but their values are different. So should 'a' be included in the result? That depends on whether the function considers the values as equal or not. 

The problem's docstring says "items from d1 not contained in d2". The term "contained" might mean that the key is present in d2 and their values are equal. So in that case, the function would compare the values as well. So the difference would include keys where either the key is not in d2, or the key is present but the value differs. 

Wait, but how to handle nested structures? For example, if the values are dictionaries, then we need to compare those sub-dictionaries. The level parameter probably controls how deep to compare. 

So, the function's purpose is to return all keys in d1 where either the key is not present in d2, or the value is different. But when values are nested, the comparison must go down to a certain level. 

So, the approach is:

- Iterate over all keys in d1.

- For each key:

   - If the key is not in d2, add it to the result.

   - Else, check if the values are different. If they are, add to the result. But how?

   - The values could be dictionaries. So, if the value is a dictionary, then we need to compare recursively, up to the given level.

Wait, the level parameter is tricky. Let me think of how the level is used. 

Suppose level is -1 (default), meaning we compare recursively all the way down (infinite depth). So for a nested structure, it would check all levels. 

If level is 0, then only compare the top level. So for the value being a dictionary, it would treat them as equal unless the top-level values (like the entire sub-dictionary) are different. 

Wait, maybe the level parameter specifies the maximum depth to compare. For example, level=1 means compare the first level, but for nested dictionaries, stop at depth 1. Or perhaps the level is how many layers deep to check. 

Alternatively, the level could indicate that we only consider keys up to a certain nesting level. Like, if level is 1, we only look at the top-level keys, but if the value is a dictionary, then we might need to go deeper. 

Hmm, perhaps the function is designed such that when level is -1, it does a deep comparison, considering all nested structures. When level is 0, it compares only the first level (so only the immediate keys and their values as non-dicts). For higher levels, it goes deeper. 

Alternatively, maybe level is the depth to which the function will compare the nested dictionaries. For example, if level is 0, then for a key whose value is a dictionary, we only check whether the keys exist, not the nested values. 

This is getting a bit too vague. Let me think of how to structure the code. 

First, the base case: if level is 0, then for each key in d1:

   if key not in d2, include it.

   else, check if the values are the same. But if the values are dictionaries, then since level is 0, we don't go deeper. So, even if the sub-dicts differ, we treat them as equal? Or wait, maybe when level is 0, we only check the top-level value. So if the values are different (even if they are dictionaries), then they are considered different. 

Alternatively, maybe when the value is a dictionary, we need to compare them recursively, but only up to the given level. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline the function step by step.

The function difference(d1, d2, level=-1) needs to return a dict of items in d1 that are not present in d2, considering the level of nesting.

First, loop through all keys in d1:

for key in d1:

   if key not in d2:

       add to result

   else:

       check if the value in d1 is different from the value in d2. But how?

       If the values are both dictionaries, and level > 0 or level is -1:

           recursively call difference with level decreased by 1?

           if the difference is non-empty, then include the key?

           Wait, perhaps we need to check if the sub-dicts are equal up to the given level. If they are not, then the key is part of the difference.

       else:

           compare the values directly. If they are not equal, include the key.

So the logic is: if the key exists in both, then check if the values are different (considering the level). If they are different, then include the key in the result.

So the overall result is the keys from d1 that are either not in d2, or their values are different when considering the level.

Therefore, the function must compare the values, possibly recursively, based on the level.

So, let's structure the code.

First, the result is a new dictionary.

Initialize an empty dict.

Then, for each key in d1:

   if key not in d2:

       add the key and value to the result.

   else:

       # check if the value differs

       val1 = d1[key]

       val2 = d2[key]

       if isinstance(val1, dict) and isinstance(val2, dict):

           # need to compare the sub-dicts

           # but only if level allows it.

           if level == 0:

               # don't go deeper, treat the sub-dicts as equal?

               # then, since the keys are present, and the values are both dicts, but we can't compare deeper, so we consider them equal?

               # in that case, don't include the key in the result.

               continue

           else:

               # recursively compute the difference between the sub-dicts, but with level adjusted.

               # the level here would be level -1, unless level is -1 (infinite)

               # So, if current level is -1, then next level is still -1.

               # So compute the difference between val1 and val2 with the new level.

               sub_diff = difference(val1, val2, level -1 if level != -1 else -1)

               if sub_diff:  # if there is any difference in the sub-dicts

                   # then the current key's value is different, so include the entire key in the result?

                   # Wait, no. Because the function's result is supposed to have the items from d1 not in d2. But in this case, the key is present in d2, but the sub-dicts differ. So the key should be included in the result?

                   # Because the value in d1 is different from d2's value for that key, so the key is considered not contained in d2?

                   # So yes, in that case, we include the key in the result.

                   # So in this case, add the key to the result with its value from d1.

                   result[key] = val1

               else:

                   # no difference in sub-dicts, so the key is not added.

                   pass

       else:

           # not a dict, so compare directly.

           if val1 != val2:

               result[key] = val1

So, in this logic, if the values are non-dict, then they are compared directly. If they are different, the key is included. For dict values, we check recursively, but only if the level allows.

Wait, but when the level is 0 and the values are both dicts, then we don't compare deeper. So we treat them as equal, so the key is not included in the result. So in that case, even if the sub-dicts differ, since we can't go deeper, we consider them equal?

Hmm, that might be the case. So the level parameter controls how deep to compare the nested dictionaries.

Now, the code structure:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):

    result = {}

    for key in d1:

        if key not in d2:

            result[key] = d1[key]

        else:

            v1 = d1[key]

            v2 = d2[key]

            if isinstance(v1, dict) and isinstance(v2, dict):

                if level == 0:

                    # can't go deeper, so consider equal?

                    continue

                else:

                    # compute the difference between v1 and v2 with level-1

                    new_level = level -1 if level != -1 else -1

                    sub_diff = difference(v1, v2, new_level)

                    if sub_diff:

                        # the sub-dicts have differences, so this key is part of the difference

                        result[key] = v1

            else:

                # non-dict values, check equality

                if v1 != v2:

                    result[key] = v1

    return result

Wait, but when level is -1 (infinite), then new_level is still -1. So it can go as deep as needed.

Hmm, but what about when the level is positive? Like, if level is 1, then the first recursive call would have level 0, so in the next level, when checking the sub-dicts, level is 0, so they stop. So that would compare the first level's sub-dicts but not deeper.

Wait, let's see:

Suppose we have two dictionaries:

d1 = {'a': {'b': 1}}

d2 = {'a': {'b': 2}}

Calling difference(d1, d2, level=1):

First, the key 'a' is present in both.

v1 is a dict, v2 is a dict.

level is 1, so new_level is 0.

Then, in the sub-difference call (difference(v1, v2, 0)), which is for the sub-dicts.

In that sub-call, the key 'b' is present in both, so check their values. Since level is 0, and the values are not dicts (they are integers), then v1 and v2's values (1 vs 2) are different. So the sub_diff would include 'b' because their values are different. Therefore, the sub_diff is non-empty. So in the parent call, the 'a' key would be added to the result.

Therefore, the result would include 'a' because the sub-dicts differ at level 1 (since the top-level was level 1, and the subcall was level 0, which allowed comparing the non-dict values).

Wait, but in the sub-call, the level is 0. Since the values of 'b' are not dicts, they can be compared directly, so they are different, so the sub_diff would have 'b' in it. So the parent call's 'a' is added to the result.

So that's correct.

Another example: if level is 0, then in the first call, when comparing the 'a' key's values (which are dicts), since level is 0, we can't go deeper, so we skip. So the sub_diff would not be computed, and since the values are both dicts, we treat them as equal (so the 'a' key is not added to the result even if their sub-dicts are different).

So that's correct.

Another case: if the value is a list or something else that's not a dict. Then, we just compare the values directly. So if the values are different, it's added.

Now, testing this function.

First, let's generate some test cases.

Test case 1: Basic case where d2 has none of the keys of d1.

d1 = {'a':1, 'b':2}

d2 = {}

Expected result: {'a':1, 'b':2}

Test case 2: d2 has some keys of d1.

d1 = {'a':1, 'b':2}

d2 = {'a':3}

Expected result: {'b':2} because 'a' is present in d2, but values are different? Wait, in this case, the values are non-dicts, so compared directly. Since 1 !=3, so 'a' would be included in the result?

Wait according to the code:

In the else clause (since the key is present in d2):

v1 is 1, v2 is 3. Since they are not dicts, compare directly. They are different, so 'a' is added to the result. So the result would be {'a':1, 'b':2}? Wait no. Wait in the code, the key 'a' is present in both. The code would check v1 and v2. Since they are not dicts, so compare them. 1 !=3, so 'a' is added to the result. So the result would include 'a' and 'b'? Because 'b' is not in d2. So yes, the result is {'a':1, 'b':2}.

Wait but that's correct because the difference is items in d1 not contained in d2. Since the 'a' key's value in d1 is different from d2's, so the key is considered not contained? Yes, because the function's description says to return items from d1 not contained in d2. So if the value differs, the key is considered not contained, so it's included.

Hmm, the function is designed to include keys even if present in d2 but with different values. So that's correct.

Test case 3: nested dicts, level -1 (deep comparison).

d1 = {'a': {'x': 1}}

d2 = {'a': {'x':2}}

The difference should include 'a' because the sub-dicts have different values. Since level is -1, the comparison goes deep. So the result is {'a': {'x':1}}.

Test case 4: same as above but level 0. Then, since the value is a dict, and level is 0, we don't compare deeper. So the sub-dicts are considered equal? So the key 'a' is not in the result because the top-level keys are present, and their values (both dicts) are considered equal (since we can't go deeper). So the result would be empty?

Wait, no. Let me see:

In the first call, key 'a' is present in both. The values are both dicts. Since the current level is 0, so we can't go deeper. So in the code's logic, we skip the sub-difference check and continue. So the key is not added to the result. Hence the result is empty. But in reality, the sub-dicts are different, but since the level is 0, the function doesn't check that. So the key 'a' is not in the result. So the difference is empty.

Test case 5: nested dicts, level 1.

Same d1 and d2 as test 3. The level is 1.

First call: level=1. The values are dicts, so we go into the else clause.

new_level is 0.

The sub-difference call is difference(v1, v2, 0).

In that sub-call, the keys 'x' are present in both. The values (1 and 2) are non-dicts. Since the sub-call's level is 0, which is not a dict, so compare directly. 1 !=2, so the sub-difference includes 'x', so sub_diff is non-empty. Hence, the parent call adds 'a' to the result. So the result is {'a': {'x':1}}.

Which is correct.

Another test case: level 1 but deeper difference.

d1 = {'a': {'b': {'c':1}}}

d2 = {'a': {'b': {'c':2}}}

Calling with level=1:

The first level's 'a' key's sub-dicts are compared with level 0 (since 1-1=0). The sub-difference would check the 'b' key's value (dict). Since the sub-call's level is 0, we can't go deeper. So the 'b' key is present in both, and their values are both dicts, so the sub-difference would not compare deeper, so the sub_diff is empty. Therefore, the parent's 'a' key would not be added to the result. Hence, the overall difference is empty.

Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, let's see:

In the first call (difference(d1, d2, 1)):

The key 'a' is in both. The values are dicts. The level is 1, so new_level is 0.

The sub-difference is called with level 0 between v1 and v2 (the 'a' sub-dicts).

In that sub-call, the key 'b' is present in both. The values are dicts. The current level is 0, so since the values are dicts, the code would check if level ==0 (yes), so we skip and continue. Thus, the sub_diff would have no keys. Therefore, the parent's 'a' key is not added to the result. So the result is empty.

But in reality, the 'b' sub-dicts have a difference in their 'c' values, but since the level was only 1, we can't reach that. So the function's result is correct as per the level parameter.

Another test case where level is 2:

Then, the first call's level is 2, so new_level becomes 1. The sub-difference would be called with level 1. Then, in that sub-call, the 'b' key's sub-dicts would be compared with level 0, which would check the 'c' values. Since level 0 allows comparing non-dicts, so the 'c' difference would be detected, leading to a non-empty sub_diff. Hence, the parent's 'a' would be added.

So that's correct.

Now, let's think about writing unit tests.

First, the user said to generate comprehensive unit tests first, then the code.

So let me outline some test cases.

Test case 1: no overlapping keys.

def test_no_overlap(self):

    d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

    d2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}

    expected = {'a':1, 'b':2}

    self.assertEqual(difference(d1, d2), expected)

Test case 2: some keys overlap with different values.

def test_overlapping_different_values(self):

    d1 = {'a': 1, 'b':2}

    d2 = {'a':3, 'c':4}

    expected = {'a':1, 'b':2}

    self.assertEqual(difference(d1, d2), expected)

Wait, because 'a' is present in both but values differ, so it's included. 'b' is not in d2, so included. So yes.

Test case 3: same keys and values.

def test_same(self):

    d1 = {'a':1, 'b':2}

    d2 = {'a':1, 'b':2}

    expected = {}

    self.assertEqual(difference(d1, d2), expected)

Test case 4: nested dicts, level -1.

def test_nested_diff_level_minus1(self):

    d1 = {'a': {'x':1}}

    d2 = {'a': {'x':2}}

    expected = {'a': {'x':1}}

    self.assertEqual(difference(d1, d2), expected)

Test case 5: nested dicts, level 0.

def test_nested_level0(self):

    d1 = {'a': {'x':1}}

    d2 = {'a': {'x':2}}

    expected = {}

    # because the sub-dicts are compared but level 0 prevents deeper check.

    self.assertEqual(difference(d1, d2), expected)

Test case 6: nested with deeper levels.

def test_nested_level1(self):

    d1 = {'a': {'b': {'c':1}}}

    d2 = {'a': {'b': {'c':2}}}

    expected = {'a': {'b': {'c':1}}}  # because with level 1, we go to level 0 for the next call.

    # Let's see:

    # The first call level=1: when processing 'a', the sub is called with level 0.

    # The sub-difference between the 'b' dicts with level 0:

    # The 'b' keys are present in both, and their values are dicts. Since level is 0, the code skips deeper check, so the sub-difference is empty? Wait, no.

    # Wait in the sub-difference call (difference(v1's 'b' and v2's 'b'), level=0):

    # The key 'c' is in both, and their values are non-dicts (1 vs 2). Since the level is 0 (which is the current level in the sub-call), but the values are not dicts, so they are compared directly. 1 !=2, so the sub_diff would have 'c' in it, so the sub-difference is non-empty. Therefore, the parent's 'a' would be added to the result.

    # Wait, let me retrace:

    The first call to difference(d1, d2, level=1):

    key 'a' is present in both.

    v1 is {'b': {'c':1}}, v2 is {'b': {'c':2}} (both dicts)

    new_level is 0 (since level was 1, subtract 1).

    So call difference(v1, v2, 0). 

    In that sub-call:

    key 'b' is present in both. Their values are dicts.

    current level is 0. So since the values are dicts, and level is 0, the code skips deeper (level ==0, so continue). Thus, the sub_diff would not check deeper. Hence, the sub-difference between the 'b's is empty. Therefore, the sub_diff is empty. Hence, the parent's 'a' is not added to the result. 

    Wait, so the result is empty?

    Wait, let me think again:

    The sub-call (difference between the 'b' sub-dicts with level 0):

    The key 'c' is present in both. The values are 1 and 2 (non-dicts). So comparing them, they are different, so the sub_diff (for the 'b' dicts) would include 'c', because the values are different. 

    Wait, no. Wait, in the sub-call (difference between the 'b' sub-dicts, which are {'c':1} and {'c':2} with level 0):

    The key 'c' is in both. The values are non-dicts. So the code would check if their values are different. Since 1 !=2, so the sub_diff for the 'b's would have 'c', so the sub_diff is non-empty. Hence, the parent 'a' is added to the result.

    So why?

    Let me step through the code for the sub-call (difference between the 'b's with level 0):

    For each key in the first 'b's dict (which is 'c'):

        key is present in the second 'b's dict.

        The value is 1 vs 2, which are not dicts. So compare them. They are different. So 'c' is added to the sub_diff. Hence, the sub_diff has {'c':1}, so it's non-empty. Therefore, the parent 'a' would be added to the result.

    Ah right! So in the sub-call between the 'b's, the level is 0, but their values are non-dicts, so they can be compared directly, so the difference is non-empty. Therefore, the parent 'a' is added to the result.

    So the test case 6's expected would be {'a': {'b': {'c':1}}}.

    So the test case should pass.

    So the test case 6 would pass.

Hmm, okay. So that's a correct case.

Another test case: level 0 with non-dicts.

def test_non_dict_values_level0(self):

    d1 = {'a': [1,2], 'b':3}

    d2 = {'a': [1,3], 'b':4}

    # level 0: compare the top-level values. Since the values are lists and integers.

    # For 'a', the lists are different (since [1,2] vs [1,3]), but they are not dicts, so compared directly. So they are different, so 'a' is added.

    # 'b' is also different, so added.

    # So the result would have both keys.

    # But wait, when level is 0, the code for non-dicts would compare directly. So yes.

    expected = {'a': [1,2], 'b':3}

    self.assertEqual(difference(d1, d2, 0), expected)

Another test case for level=-1 with lists (non-dicts):

def test_non_dict_values_level_minus1(self):

    d1 = {'a': [1,2], 'b':3}

    d2 = {'a': [1,3], 'b':4}

    # level -1: same as before, since lists are not dicts, so compared directly. So the result is same as above.

    expected = {'a': [1,2], 'b':3}

    self.assertEqual(difference(d1, d2, -1), expected)

Another case where a key exists in d1 but not in d2.

def test_key_absent(self):

    d1 = {'a':1}

    d2 = {}

    expected = {'a':1}

    self.assertEqual(difference(d1, d2), expected)

Now, the code should handle these test cases.

Now, the code itself. Let me write it based on the logic above.

Wait, in the code outline earlier, the code for the dict case is:

if level ==0:

   continue

else:

   compute sub_diff, and if non-empty, add to result.

Wait, but in the code, the 'continue' is in the else clause for the key in d2? Or in the case where the value is a dict and level is 0?

Wait, the code for that part would be:

if isinstance(v1, dict) and isinstance(v2, dict):

    if level ==0:

        continue

    else:

        ... compute sub_diff ...

else:

    ... compare values ...

Wait, but the 'continue' is inside the loop over the keys. Wait no, the code is inside the loop for each key in d1. The 'continue' is part of the else clause for the key in d2.

Wait, the code structure is:

for key in d1:

   if key not in d2:

       add to result.

   else:

       check values.

       if both are dicts:

           if level is 0:

               continue (so skip adding the key to the result)

           else:

               check sub_diff.

               if sub_diff is non-empty, add to result.

       else:

           if values differ, add to result.

Wait, no. The 'continue' would skip adding the key to the result. Let me think again.

In the code:

for key in d1:

   if key not in d2:

       add to result.

   else:

       v1 = d1[key]

       v2 = d2[key]

       if both are dicts:

           if level ==0:

               # can't go deeper, so treat as equal.

               # so the key is not added to the result.

               continue (this would mean, in the else clause, after checking, we do nothing here, so the key is not added?)

               # Wait, no. The 'continue' is inside the loop for the key. So after checking, the code would proceed.

               # Wait, no. The 'continue' is inside the if level ==0 clause. So in that case, the code would skip adding the key to the result.

               # So the code would proceed to the next key.

               # So in the case where the values are dicts and level is 0, then the code skips adding the key to the result.

           else:

               compute sub_diff. if sub_diff exists, add the key to the result.

       else:

           if v1 !=v2:

               add to result.

Wait, but the 'continue' is inside the else clause for the key being present. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, the code for the dict case when level is 0:

In the case where the key is present in both and the values are dicts:

   if level ==0:

       # so can't go deeper. The code should not add the key to the result because the sub-dicts are not checked. Hence, the code must not add the key.

       # So the code would proceed to the next key.

       continue ?

Wait, no. The 'continue' is not correct here. The 'continue' would skip the rest of the code inside this else clause for the key.

Wait, the code is structured as:

for key in d1:

    if key not in d2:

        add to result.

    else:

        v1 = d1[key], v2 = d2[key]

        if both are dicts:

            if level ==0:

                # so we can't compare deeper. So we treat them as equal, so the key is not added to the result.

                # So the code should do nothing here and proceed to the next key.

                continue  # but continue would skip to the next key in the loop.

                # Wait, no, 'continue' here would skip the rest of the code in this else clause, but since this is inside the else clause (key is present), it would move to the next key in the loop.

                # That's correct, because we don't add the key to the result.

            else:

                compute sub_diff, and if it exists, add the key to the result.

        else:

            compare and add if different.

Wait, but in the case where the values are dicts and level is 0, then the code would 'continue', which skips the rest of the code for this key (the else part), so the key is not added to the result.

But in the case where the values are non-dicts, and the key is present, then the code would compare and add if different.

So the 'continue' is correct here.

Hmm, okay. So the code should work as intended.

Now, implementing the code.

Wait, the 'continue' is inside the if level ==0 clause. But in that case, the code would skip adding the key to the result. That's correct.

Now, writing the code:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    result = {}
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            result[key] = d1[key]
        else:
            v1 = d1[key]
            v2 = d2[key]
            if isinstance(v1, dict) and isinstance(v2, dict):
                if level == 0:
                    continue
                else:
                    new_level = level -1 if level != -1 else -1
                    sub_diff = difference(v1, v2, new_level)
                    if sub_diff:
                        result[key] = v1
            else:
                if v1 != v2:
                    result[key] = v1
    return result

Wait, but in the case where the values are dicts but level is not 0, but the sub_diff is empty, then the key is not added. Correct.

Another edge case: when the value is a dict but the other's is not.

Like d1 has key 'a' with value {'x':1}, d2 has 'a' with value [1,2]. 

Then, since v1 is a dict and v2 is not, the code will treat them as different, so the key is added to the result.

Because in the 'isinstance' check, since one is dict and the other isn't, the code will go to the else clause (the 'else' after checking the dict types). Wait, let's see:

The code checks if both are dicts. So if v1 is a dict and v2 is not, then the code proceeds to the else clause (the 'else' after the 'if isinstance...').

In that else clause, we compare v1 and v2. Since a dict and a list are not equal, so the key is added.

Yes, that's correct.

Another case where one value is a dict and the other is not. 

Thus, the code should handle that.

Another case: level is 1 and the sub-dicts have different keys.

d1 = {'a': {'x':1}}, d2 = {'a': {'y':2}}

Calling with level=1:

The sub_diff for 'a's sub-dicts would be difference({'x':1}, {'y':2}, 0).

In that sub-call, level is 0.

The keys 'x' is not in the second sub-dict, so it's added to the sub_diff. So sub_diff is non-empty. Hence, the parent 'a' is added to the result.

So the result is correct.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Now, the unit tests.

The user wants me to output only the code in Python markdown, but first to generate the tests, then the code.

Wait, the user's instruction says to first generate comprehensive unit tests, then the actual code, but output only the code (the function) in Python markdown format. 

Wait the user says:

"Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. /think"

Wait, but the tips say to first generate tests, then code. But the user wants only the code output.

Hmm, perhaps the user is following test-driven development, but the actual output should be the code for the function. So the code I wrote above is the correct function, so I should output that.

Thus, the final code is as written above.
