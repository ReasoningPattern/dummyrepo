Okay, I need to generate Python code for the from_raw_values class method based on the given docstring. Let's start by understanding what the method is supposed to do. The docstring says it creates a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values. So, first, I should figure out what a Bookmarks object looks like. Probably, it's a class that holds multiple bookmarks, maybe each as an instance of another class like Bookmark. The raw values are probably strings in some format, maybe like "title,url,notes" or something similar.

Since the user mentioned test-driven development, I should first think about the unit tests. Let me outline what the tests might cover. The tests should check that when given a list of raw values, the method correctly parses each into a Bookmark instance and collects them into the Bookmarks object. Also, edge cases like empty lists, invalid entries (though maybe that's handled elsewhere), or different formats.

Wait, but how are the raw values structured? Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I have to make some assumptions. Let's assume each raw value is a string that can be split into parts to create a bookmark. For example, each string could be comma-separated values representing title, URL, and maybe other fields. Alternatively, maybe each raw string is a single URL, and the Bookmark class can parse that. But without more info, perhaps the Bookmark class has an __init__ that takes a raw string and parses it.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class is a collection, and each raw value is a string that the Bookmark class can initialize from. So the from_raw_values method would loop through each string in values, create a Bookmark instance for each, and collect them into a list stored in the Bookmarks object.

So, the method would be a class method that returns an instance of Bookmarks containing all the parsed bookmarks. The actual code would be something like:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = []
    for raw in values:
        bm = Bookmark(raw)  # assuming Bookmark has such an init
    return cls(bookmarks)

But I need to make sure that the Bookmark class can be initialized from the raw string. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the Bookmark class has a class method of its own, like from_raw, so perhaps:

for raw in values:
    bm = Bookmark.from_raw(raw)
    bookmarks.append(bm)
return cls(bookmarks)

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmark's __init__ takes the raw string. The exact structure depends on the Bookmark class, but since the problem doesn't give that, perhaps the code can be written in terms of cls, assuming that the Bookmark instances can be created from each raw value.

Now, for the tests. Let's think of a sample test case. Suppose we have a list of raw strings, each representing a bookmark. The test would create a Bookmarks instance using from_raw_values and then check that each entry in the list is correctly parsed.

First, the test would need to mock or have the Bookmark class. But since this is a unit test for the Bookmarks class's method, perhaps the test would assume that the Bookmark class can be instantiated properly. Alternatively, maybe the test would check that the Bookmark instances are created correctly.

Wait, but how to structure the tests? Let's think of an example. Suppose each raw value is like "Google,https://google.com", and the Bookmark class can split on commas to get title and URL.

So, the test could be something like:

def test_from_raw_values(self):
    raw_values = [
        "Google,https://www.google.com",
        "GitHub,https://github.com",
    ]
    bookmarks = Bookmarks.from_raw_values(raw_values)
    assert len(bookmarks) == 2
    assert bookmarks[0].title == "Google"
    assert bookmarks[0].url == "https://www.google.com"
    # and similar for the second one.

But to write this test, the test case would need to have access to the Bookmark class's attributes. So, the Bookmark class must have title and url attributes set when initialized from the raw string.

Therefore, the code for from_raw_values would loop through each raw string, create a Bookmark instance, and collect them into a list, then pass that to the Bookmarks constructor.

Now, the actual code. The method is a class method of Bookmarks. So inside Bookmarks:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    parsed = []
    for value in values:
        # assuming Bookmark can be instantiated from the value
        parsed.append(Bookmark(value))
    return cls(parsed)

But maybe the Bookmark class requires parameters. Let's say the Bookmark has an __init__ that takes title and url. Then, the code would need to parse the raw string into those parts. For example, splitting on a comma.

Wait, but the problem states that the from_raw_values is part of the Bookmarks class, so perhaps the Bookmark class has a method to parse the raw string. Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class's from_raw_values method is responsible for parsing each string into a Bookmark instance, which could involve splitting the string.

Hmm, the problem says "raw bookmark string values" but doesn't specify the format, so maybe the Bookmark class is designed to accept a raw string and parse it. So the code would be as above.

Alternatively, if the Bookmark class expects parameters, the Bookmarks' from_raw_values would need to split each raw string into parts. For example:

Each raw string is "title,url", so split into parts, then pass to Bookmark's __init__(title, url).

In that case, the code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = []
    for raw in values:
        parts = raw.split(',', 1)  # split into two parts
        title, url = parts
        bm = Bookmark(title, url)
        bookmarks.append(bm)
    return cls(bookmarks)

But this depends on the format. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the Bookmark class has its own way of handling the raw string, so the code is simpler.

But given that the problem doesn't specify the internal structure of the Bookmark class, the code can be written under the assumption that each raw string can be directly passed to the Bookmark constructor. So the code would be as the first version.

Now, the unit tests. The user wants me to first generate the tests. So, in the test case, I need to mock or have the Bookmark class, but perhaps for the test, we can just check that the list is created properly. Alternatively, the test could use a mock.

Alternatively, the test could be written as:

import unittest
from bookmarks import Bookmarks, Bookmark  # assuming these are in the module

class TestBookmarks(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_from_raw_values(self):
        raw_data = [
            "Example Title,https://example.com",
            "Another Title,https://another.com",
        ]
        bookmarks = Bookmarks.from_raw_values(raw_data)
        self.assertEqual(len(bookmarks), 2)
        self.assertIsInstance(bookmarks[0], Bookmark)
        self.assertEqual(bookmarks[0].title, "Example Title")
        self.assertEqual(bookmarks[0].url, "https://example.com")

    def test_empty_list(self):
        raw_data = []
        bookmarks = Bookmarks.from_raw_values(raw_data)
        self.assertEqual(len(bookmarks), 0)

    def test_single_item(self):
        raw_data = ["Test,https://test.com"]
        bookmarks = Bookmarks.from_raw_values(raw_data)
        self.assertEqual(len(bookmarks), 1)
        self.assertEqual(bookmarks[0].url, "https://test.com")

But to make this work, the Bookmark class must have attributes like title and url set correctly when initialized from the raw string. So the test assumes that the Bookmark's __init__ can process the raw string into those attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmark class has a class method from_raw, so the code would call Bookmark.from_raw(raw) for each entry. Then the test would check that.

In any case, the code for from_raw_values would loop through each value in the input list, create a Bookmark instance for each, collect them into a list, and then pass that list to the Bookmarks constructor (since cls is the Bookmarks class).

So the code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = [Bookmark(raw) for raw in values]
    return cls(bookmarks)

But again, this depends on how the Bookmark is initialized. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed with this approach.

Now, putting it all together. The user wants the code in Python markdown format, only the code. So the actual code for the method would be:

But wait, the function is inside the Bookmarks class. So the code would be part of that class.

Wait, the function signature is def from_raw_values(cls, values):. So it's a class method, so in the class:

class Bookmarks:
    def __init__(self, bookmarks):
        self.bookmarks = bookmarks

    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        """Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values."""
        parsed = []
        for value in values:
            # assuming Bookmark can be initialized from the raw string
            parsed.append(Bookmark(value))
        return cls(parsed)

But the Bookmark class is needed. However, the problem doesn't require writing that, so the code is as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmark is a separate class, and the code is as written. The user's question only requires the code for the from_raw_values method, so maybe the rest is assumed.

Thus, the final code would be the class method as written. The tests are part of the TDD process but the user only asked for the code based on the signature and docstring. So the code is:

Wait, the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So I need to present the code for the from_raw_values method. The markdown format would be:

```python
@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    """
    Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
    """
    bookmarks = []
    for value in values:
        # Assuming each raw value can be converted into a Bookmark instance
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(value))
    return cls(bookmarks)
```

But the problem is, the Bookmark class might not be imported, so perhaps the code should be written in a way that's generic. Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmark is a nested class, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the Bookmark is part of the same module, so the code is as above.

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmark is a dataclass or similar, but without more info, I'll proceed with this code.

Wait, but in the test-driven approach, the tests would drive the implementation. So the tests would first be written, then the code. But the user wants the code for the method, so I just need to write the method's code.

Another possible point: the Bookmarks class might store the bookmarks in a list, so the __init__ would take a list. The from_raw_values creates that list by parsing each string.

So the code is correct as above, assuming Bookmark can be initialized from the raw string.

But maybe the Bookmark requires parameters, so splitting the raw string. For example, if each raw string is "title,url", then:

bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title=parts[0], url=parts[1]))

So the code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    parsed = []
    for raw in values:
        parts = raw.split(',', 1)
        title, url = parts
        parsed.append(Bookmark(title, url))
    return cls(parsed)

But since the problem didn't specify the format, this is an assumption. The problem's docstring says "raw bookmark string values" without specifics, so perhaps the Bookmark's __init__ takes a single string. Hence, the first approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmark has a class method from_str, so:

parsed.append(Bookmark.from_str(raw))

In that case, the code would use that method.

But without knowing, I'll proceed with the first approach. The code as written.

So the final answer is the code block for the method, using a loop to create each Bookmark instance and return a new Bookmarks instance.
