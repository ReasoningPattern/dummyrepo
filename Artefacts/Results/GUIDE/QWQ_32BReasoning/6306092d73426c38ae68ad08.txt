Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _get_conditionally_required_args method based on the provided docstring and parameters. Let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The goal is to list the argument names from options_spec where the required_when condition is met based on the provided args. 

First, I should think about the parameters. The command_name is probably part of the context but maybe not directly used here. The options_spec is a list of command options, each of which might have a 'required_when' condition. The args are the user-provided arguments, which we need to check against these conditions.

Hmm, each option in options_spec probably has a 'name' and a 'required_when' attribute. The required_when might be a condition that checks if certain arguments are present. For example, an argument might be required when another argument exists. So the function needs to iterate over each option in options_spec, check if the required_when condition is true based on the args, and collect those names where it is true.

Wait, how exactly are the required_when conditions structured? Maybe each required_when is a list of conditions, like a list of (arg_name, value) pairs, or maybe it's a function. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the required_when is a list of strings that represent other argument names that must be present. Or maybe each condition is a tuple indicating that if another argument exists (regardless of its value), then this argument is required. Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of (argument, value) that must be present in the args.

Alternatively, perhaps the required_when condition is a string that evaluates to a boolean when the args are checked. But without more info, maybe I need to make an assumption here. Let's assume that required_when is a list of (arg_name, value) pairs. For the condition to be met, all of these pairs must exist in the args. So the argument is conditionally required if all of the required_when conditions are met.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of other argument names, and if any of those are present in the args, then this argument is required. Or perhaps it's a list of conditions where each is a (arg, operator, value) triplet. Hmm, this is unclear. The problem's docstring says "required_when condition matched" but doesn't specify the structure. Since this is part of a larger codebase, perhaps the options_spec is structured such that each option has a 'required_when' attribute which is a list of conditions that need to be checked against the args.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of (arg_name, expected_value) pairs, and all of them must be present in the args for the condition to be met. Or maybe it's a list of (arg_name) that must exist in the args. Let me think of a possible structure. For example, an option like:

option = {
    'name': 'my_arg',
    'required_when': [('another_arg', 'exists'), ...]
}

Wait, perhaps the required_when is a list of (arg_name, operator, value) tuples. But without knowing the exact structure, maybe the problem expects that the required_when condition is simply a list of argument names that, if present in the args, trigger this argument to be required. So for example, if an option has required_when=['--flag'], then if '--flag' is in the args, then this argument must be required.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of (arg, value) pairs, and the argument is required if all those pairs are present in the args. But how do we check that? Let's think of the args as a dictionary where the keys are the argument names and the values are their values. For example, if args is {'--flag': 'true', '--option': 'value'}, then checking for required_when conditions would involve checking if certain keys are present, or have specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps the required_when is a list of conditions expressed as strings that can be evaluated in the context of the args. But that might be overcomplicating. Since the problem is to generate code based on the docstring, perhaps the required_when is a list of argument names that must be present in the args. So, for an option to be in the returned list, all of its required_when arguments must be present in the args. Or maybe any of them?

Hmm, the problem says "required_when condition matched". Let me think of an example. Suppose an option has required_when = [('arg1', 'value1'), ('arg2', 'value2')]. Then, the condition is met if arg1 has value1 and arg2 has value2. Alternatively, maybe it's a list of (arg, operator, value) tuples, but that's getting too detailed. Since the problem's docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the required_when is a list of (arg, value) pairs, and the condition is met if all those pairs are present in the args.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of (arg_name) strings, and the condition is met if any of those args are present in the args. So, for example, if an option has required_when=['--flag', '--another'], then if either of those flags are present in the args, then this option's argument is required.

Wait, the function's return is the list of argument names where their required_when condition is matched. So the function needs to go through each option in options_spec, check if their required_when condition is true given the args, and collect their names.

To proceed, perhaps the required_when is a list of conditions where each condition is a tuple (arg_name, value), and the condition is that the arg must have that value. Or maybe it's just the presence of the argument. Let's make a reasonable assumption here. Let's say that required_when is a list of (argument, value) pairs, and for the condition to be met, all of those pairs must exist in the args. Alternatively, maybe each condition is a string that can be evaluated in the context of the args, but that's probably more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps required_when is a list of (arg_name) strings, and the condition is that any of those args are present in the args. Or maybe all of them.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of (arg_name, operator, value) tuples, but without knowing the exact structure, maybe the problem expects that required_when is a list of (arg_name, value) pairs, and the condition is that all of those pairs must be present in the args. So, for example, if an option has required_when = [('--flag', 'on'), ('--option', 'some_value')], then the argument is required only if both --flag is present with value 'on' and --option is present with 'some_value'.

In that case, the code would need to check each option's required_when list, and for each condition in that list, check if the arg is present in the args and has the correct value. If all conditions are met, then add the option's name to the result list.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of (arg_name) strings, and the condition is that any of those args are present in the args. So, for example, required_when = ['--flag', '--another'], then if either is present, the argument is required. In that case, the code would check if any of the required_when args are present in the args.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Since the problem's docstring doesn't specify, perhaps I should make a safe assumption. Let's proceed with the idea that required_when is a list of (arg, value) tuples, and the condition is that all those pairs are present in the args. Alternatively, maybe each required_when is a list of (arg_name) strings, and the presence of any of them in the args triggers the condition.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of conditions expressed as strings, like "arg1 == 'value'". But that would require evaluating those strings, which could be unsafe. Probably, the options are structured with required_when as a list of (arg, value) pairs, and the function checks each pair.

Assuming that, here's how the code might work:

- For each option in options_spec:
   - If the option has a 'required_when' attribute (i.e., it's not None or empty)
      - Iterate through each condition in required_when
      - For each condition, check if the arg exists in the args and has the correct value
      - If all conditions are met, add the option's name to the result list.

Alternatively, maybe each condition is a simple presence check (the arg must exist, regardless of its value). So required_when is a list of arg names, and the condition is that all of them are present in the args. Or any?

Alternatively, perhaps required_when is a list of (arg_name) strings, and the condition is that any of those args are present in the args. So for example, if required_when is ['--flag', '--another'], then if either is present, then this option is required.

In that case, the code would check if any of the required_when args are present in the args. So for each option in options_spec, if any of the required_when arguments are in the args, then include the option's name in the result list.

This seems plausible. Let me think of an example. Suppose an option has required_when = ['--flag'], and the args include '--flag', then the option's name would be added to the list. So the function would return the name of that option.

Alternatively, maybe it's required when all the required_when args are present. That would change the logic.

The problem's docstring says "required_when condition matched". The exact condition is not clear, but perhaps the required_when is a list of (arg_name, value) pairs, and all must be true. Alternatively, the required_when could be a list of (arg_name) strings, and any of them being present in the args would trigger the condition.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the simplest approach is to assume that required_when is a list of (arg_name) strings, and the condition is that any of those args are present in the args. That way, the function can check for any presence of those arguments.

So, the steps would be:

1. Iterate over each option in options_spec.
2. For each option, check if it has a 'required_when' attribute (maybe it's a list).
3. For the option's required_when list, check if any of the arguments in that list are present in the args.
   - Or check if all are present, depending on the condition's logic.
4. If the condition is met (e.g., any of the required_when args are present), add the option's name to the result list.

Wait, but the problem's function returns a list of argument names where their required_when condition is met. So each option that has a required_when that is satisfied gets added to the list.

Assuming that required_when is a list of arguments that, if present in the args, trigger this option to be required. So the condition is met if any of the required_when arguments are present.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of (arg, value) pairs, and the condition is that each of those pairs is present (i.e., arg is in args and has the value). For example, if required_when is [('arg1', 'value1')], then the condition is met only if arg1 is present and equals 'value1'.

But how are the args structured? Are they a list or a dictionary?

The parameters say args is the received input arguments. Probably, args are in the form of a dictionary where keys are the argument names (like '--flag') and values are their values. Or perhaps it's a list of strings where each argument is a string like '--flag=value' or '--option', but parsing that would be needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the args are parsed into a dictionary where each key is the option name and the value is its value. For example, if the user input is ['--flag', '--option=value'], then the args dictionary would be {'--flag': True, '--option': 'value'}, or something like that. But the exact structure depends on how the command-line arguments are parsed.

Assuming that args is a dictionary, then checking for the presence of an argument is straightforward: if the key is in the dictionary. To check the value, you'd have to compare the value stored in the dictionary to the required value in the condition.

So, perhaps the required_when is a list of (arg, value) tuples, and for each such tuple, the arg must be present in the args and have a value equal to the specified value. The condition is met if all of the required_when's tuples are satisfied.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of (arg) strings, and the condition is that the arg exists in the args (regardless of its value). Then, for the required_when condition to be met, all of the args in the required_when list must be present in the args.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when is a list of (arg) strings, and the condition is that any of them is present. In that case, if any of the required_when args are present, the condition is met.

This is a critical point. Without knowing the exact structure of required_when and how the conditions are evaluated, it's hard to proceed. Let me try to think of the most plausible scenario based on common practices.

In many command-line interfaces, a required_when condition might mean that another argument must be present for this one to be required. For example, if an argument is required when another flag is set. So, for instance, if an option has required_when=['--flag'], then if '--flag' is present in the args, then this option is required. So the required_when is a list of argument names, and the condition is that any of them are present. Or all of them?

Alternatively, it could be that the required_when is a list of (arg, value) pairs, and all must be true. But that's more complex.

Given that the problem is to write code based on the docstring, perhaps the required_when is a list of (arg) strings, and the condition is that any of them is present in the args. So the code would check for any presence of those arguments.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of (arg) strings and the condition is that all are present. But that's a different logic.

Hmm. The function's return is a list of argument names where the required_when condition is matched. So each such argument is conditionally required because their required_when conditions are met.

Assuming that the required_when for an argument is a list of other argument names, and if any of those are present in the args, then this argument is required. So for example, if an argument's required_when is ['--flag', '--option'], then if either '--flag' or '--option' is present in the args, then this argument is required and thus added to the list.

Alternatively, maybe it's a list of (arg, value) pairs, and all must be present. But without more info, perhaps the simplest approach is to assume that required_when is a list of argument names, and the condition is that any of them are present in the args. So the code would check for any of the required_when arguments in the args.

So the steps would be:

For each option in options_spec:

- If the option has a 'required_when' list (i.e., it's not None or empty)
   - Iterate over each condition in required_when (each is an arg name)
   - Check if any of those args are present in the args (as keys in the args dict)
   - If any is present, add the option's name to the result list

Alternatively, if all of the required_when args must be present, then check if all are in the args.

The problem says "required_when condition matched". So the condition is met when the required_when criteria are satisfied. Without knowing the exact criteria, perhaps the code should assume that required_when is a list of arg names, and the condition is that any of them are present in the args.

Alternatively, maybe required_when is a list of (arg, operator, value) tuples, but that complicates things. Let's proceed with the simplest assumption.

Now, let's think about the parameters again. The function's parameters are:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):

The options_spec is a list of command options. Each option in options_spec has a 'name' attribute and a 'required_when' attribute. The 'required_when' is a list of other argument names (strings) that must be present for this argument to be required.

So for each option in options_spec:

if 'required_when' is a list and not empty:

   for each arg_name in required_when:

      check if arg_name is in args (the args parameter is a dictionary of argument names to their values?)

Assuming that args is a dictionary, then checking if arg_name in args.keys() would suffice.

Wait, but the args parameter is passed as 'args', which might be a list or a dict. The problem's docstring says "the received input arguments", which is vague. In many command-line parsing scenarios, the arguments are stored in a dictionary where each key is the option name (like '--option'), and the value is its value. So for the code, perhaps args is a dictionary.

Thus, the code can proceed as follows:

Initialize an empty list to collect the required argument names.

Loop over each option in options_spec:

   if the option has a 'required_when' list (maybe check if it's not None and has elements):

      for each condition in required_when:

          if condition (the arg name) is in the args:

              add the option's name to the result list and break, since we just need any match.

          else:

              continue to check other conditions in required_when?

Wait, no. For each condition in required_when, perhaps the condition is that any of the required_when arguments are present. So if any of them is present, then the condition is met, so add the option's name to the list.

So for an option, the required_when is a list of argument names. The condition is met if any of those names is present in the args.

Thus, for each option in options_spec:

   if hasattr(option, 'required_when') and option.required_when:

      for arg_name in option.required_when:

          if arg_name in args:

              add option.name to the result list, then break out of the loop to avoid duplicates.

              (since once any of the required_when conditions are met, we don't need to check others)

Thus, the code would look something like:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        required_when = getattr(option, 'required_when', None)
        if required_when:
            for arg_name in required_when:
                if arg_name in args:
                    required_args.append(option.name)
                    break  # no need to check other required_when args for this option
    return required_args

Wait, but this could have an option added multiple times if multiple required_when conditions are met, but since we break after the first match, each option is added once at most.

This seems plausible. However, perhaps the required_when is structured differently. For example, perhaps required_when is a list of (arg, value) pairs, and we need to check that the arg is present and has the value. In that case, the code would need to check both the presence and the value.

But given the ambiguity, and the lack of further information, the code above might be the way to go.

Now, the user also mentioned to use test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So I should think of test cases first.

Let me draft some test cases:

Test Case 1: No options with required_when.

options_spec = [Option(name='opt1'), Option(name='opt2', required_when=[]), ...]

args has some arguments. The result should be empty list.

Test Case 2: An option with required_when=['arg1'], and arg1 is present in args.

So the option's name should be in the result.

Test Case 3: An option's required_when has multiple args, but none are present. So it's not added.

Test Case 4: An option's required_when has ['arg1', 'arg2'], and arg2 is present. So it's added.

Test Case 5: An option with required_when, but the required_when is not a list (maybe None?), so it's skipped.

Test Case 6: The args is an empty dict. So none of the required_when conditions are met, so no options are added.

Now, writing the tests:

Assuming that the code is part of a class, so the tests would be in a test class.

But for the code generation, the user wants only the code, but in the thinking process, the tests are part of the TDD approach.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the final code is the method, but perhaps the code includes the test cases? No, the user probably wants just the function.

Wait, the user says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code is just the function _get_conditionally_required_args.

Therefore, the code should implement the logic I outlined above.

Now, considering possible edge cases.

What if an option's required_when is an empty list? Then the condition is not met, so it's not added.

What if the required_when is a list with a single arg that's present? Then added.

What if the required_when has multiple args, but none are present? Not added.

What if the required_when has a list with a mix of present and not present args? As long as any is present, it's added.

Another edge case: the required_when is None. Then we skip processing that option.

So in code, we need to check that required_when is not None and has elements.

Wait, in the code I wrote earlier, 'required_when = getattr(option, 'required_when', None)'

then, if required_when (the value) is truthy, i.e., it's not None and not empty?

Wait, no. For example, if required_when is an empty list, then the condition is not met. So in the code:

if required_when:

   then proceed.

So if required_when is an empty list, the 'if' condition is false, so it's skipped.

Thus, the code correctly skips options with empty required_when lists.

Another possible mistake: in the code, the 'args' are checked for the presence of the arg_name as a key. But what if the arg is present but the value is None? That's okay, since the presence is what matters.

Thus, the code should be:

def _get_conditionally_required_args(self, command_name, options_spec, args):
    required_args = []
    for option in options_spec:
        required_when = getattr(option, 'required_when', None)
        if required_when:
            for arg_name in required_when:
                if arg_name in args:
                    required_args.append(option.name)
                    break  # stop checking other required_when args for this option
    return required_args

Wait, but what if the 'name' of the option is not an attribute? The problem's docstring says "list of argument names with matched required_when condition". So each option in options_spec must have a 'name' attribute. So assuming that the option objects have a 'name' and 'required_when' attributes.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, what about the 'command_name' parameter? The function's parameters include command_name, but the code doesn't use it. Is that an error?

The problem's function signature includes command_name as a parameter, but the docstring says it's the command name, but the description doesn't mention using it. So perhaps it's part of the function's signature but not used in the current logic. That could be an oversight, but given the problem's description, perhaps the command name is not needed here. The function's purpose is to return arguments whose required_when condition is met, and that condition may depend only on the args provided, not the command name. So the code doesn't need to use command_name, which is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the required_when conditions could depend on the command name, but without that info in the problem, it's not considered here.

Thus, the code as written is correct given the assumptions.

Therefore, the final code is as above.
