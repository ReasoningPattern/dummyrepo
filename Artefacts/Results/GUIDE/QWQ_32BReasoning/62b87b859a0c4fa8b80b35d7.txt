Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the to_csv method based on the given signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding the requirements. The method is part of a class, probably a Graph class, since the doc mentions converting a graph's points to CSV. 

The parameters are separator (default comma) and header. The header, if provided, is the first line of the output. The method is deprecated, so maybe it should have a warning? But the docstring says it's deprecated since Lena 0.5, so perhaps the code should include a deprecation warning.

The method's job is to convert the graph's points into a CSV format. Each point has coordinates and values. For each point, the coordinates are converted to strings, separated by the separator, then followed by the value parts. So if a point is (x, y) with value (v1, v2), the line would be "x,y,v1,v2" with the separator instead of commas here.

Wait, the exact structure: the coordinates come first, then the value parts. So each point's coordinates are converted to strings, separated by the separator, then each part of the value. So for a 2D point with a 3-value array, it would be coord_x, coord_y, val1, val2, val3?

The output is a string. The header is added as the first line if not None. Then each point line follows, each ending with a new line. The separator is used between the elements.

First, I need to think about how the points are stored in the graph. Assuming the graph has a points attribute which is an iterable of tuples (coordinates, values). For example, each point is a tuple where the first element is the coordinate (maybe a tuple itself) and the second is the value (another tuple or list?).

So for each point in self.points:

Take the coordinates, which might be a tuple like (x1, x2, ...), convert each element to a string, then join with the separator. Then take the value parts (maybe a list or tuple) and add each element's string. So all those are joined with the separator. Then add a newline.

Putting this all together, the steps are:

1. Check if header is provided. If so, start the output with header + newline.
2. Iterate over each point in the graph's points.
3. For each point, process the coordinates and values into a string line.
4. Join all lines with newlines.

Now, code-wise, the method is part of a class, so self must have a points attribute. Let's assume that each point in self.points is a tuple (coordinates, value). The coordinates could be a tuple (like (x, y)), and the value could be a list or tuple (like (v1, v2)).

So for a point (coords, vals):

line = separator.join(map(str, coords + vals)) ?

Wait, coords is a tuple, vals is another. So concatenating them gives a single tuple, then converting each element to a string, separated by the separator.

Yes. So each line is the coordinates followed by the values, all as strings separated by the separator.

Now, the code structure:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    # deprecation warning?
    # generate the lines
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coords, vals = point
        # convert to strings and join with separator
        parts = list(map(str, coords)) + list(map(str, vals))
        line = separator.join(parts)
        lines.append(line)
    # join all lines with newlines
    return '\n'.join(lines) + '\n' ?

Wait, but when joining with '\n', the last line will already have the newline. Hmm, maybe better to just join with '\n'. Let me think. Suppose lines is [header, line1, line2], then '\n'.join(lines) will put header\nline1\nline2. But if the lines start with the header, then the first line is header, then the rest follow. That's correct.

Wait, if header is present, then the first line is header. So the lines list starts with header, then each line for the points. So the join will be correct.

But what if the points are empty? The header would still be present, but no data lines. That's okay.

Now, the deprecation note. Since the method is deprecated, the code should emit a warning. The docstring says it's deprecated since Lena 0.5, so perhaps using warnings module.

In Python, to issue a deprecation warning, we can do something like:

import warnings
warnings.warn("to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use ToCSV in sequences instead.", DeprecationWarning)

But when should this warning be issued? Every time the method is called. So inside the method, before proceeding, add that.

But sometimes, in some versions, the DeprecationWarning might be silent by default. So maybe we should use a different category, like PendingDeprecationWarning, or a custom warning. But according to the docstring, it's already deprecated in 0.5, so perhaps the standard DeprecationWarning is okay. Alternatively, the user might need to see it, so maybe use a warning that's not ignored by default. But the code must include the warning.

So adding that at the start of the method.

Now putting it all together:

The code:

import warnings

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn(
        "to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use ToCSV in sequences instead.",
        DeprecationWarning
    )
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coords, value = point  # assuming each point is (coordinates, value)
        # convert coordinates and value to strings, joined by separator
        parts = []
        parts.extend(map(str, coords))
        parts.extend(map(str, value))
        line = separator.join(parts)
        lines.append(line)
    return '\n'.join(lines) + '\n'  # ensures a trailing newline?

Wait, no. '\n'.join adds newlines between elements. So if lines has elements [header, line1, line2], then the result is header\nline1\nline2. But the user probably expects that each line is on its own line. So the code is okay. However, the final line will not have a trailing newline. Wait, the join does not add a trailing newline. For example, if there are three lines, the result is "header\nline1\nline2".

But in some CSV cases, a trailing newline is desired. Alternatively, maybe the code should add one. Hmm. The docstring says that the header, if not None, is the first string with a new line added automatically. Wait, the doc says:

"header, if not None, is the first string of the output (new line is added automatically)."

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So if header is provided, the first line is the header, followed by a new line. Then the data lines follow. So the header is written as "header\n" and then the rest?

Wait, the wording is: "the first string of the output (new line is added automatically)". So the header is written as is, and a new line is added. So the first line is header followed by a new line, then the rest of the lines.

Wait, the code as written appends the header to lines, then the other lines. Then the join with '\n' would have the header followed by a newline and the next line. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the header is written without a new line, and the next line is added with a new line. Wait, the wording is ambiguous. Let me read the doc again:

"header, if not None, is the first string of the output (new line is added automatically)."

So the first string is the header, then a new line is added. So the header is the first line, followed by a new line. The rest of the lines are added with their own newlines via the join. So the code is okay.

Now, the code structure. The method is part of a class, so self must have a points attribute. The code assumes that each point in self.points is a tuple (coords, value), where coords is a tuple (like (x,y)), and value is a sequence (like a list or tuple). So the code uses map(str, coords) to get their string representations.

Wait, but in the code, parts is extended with coords first, then the value. So the coordinates come first, then the value's elements. That matches the doc's requirement: "for each point first its coordinate is converted to string (separated by separator), then each part of its value".

Yes, that's exactly what the code does.

Potential edge cases:

- What if a point has no coordinates? Unlikely, but if coords is empty, then the line starts with the value parts. But according to the problem's specs, the graph can be multidimensional, so coordinates can be of any length.

- What if the value is a single number? Then it's converted to a string, and added as a single element.

Testing would be important here, but the problem says to generate the code. So I think this code should work.

Now, the deprecation warning. The code includes that. Also, the method's docstring mentions that the to_csv is part of Lena 0.5 and is not used, and that in a sequence, one should use ToCSV. So the warning message should match that.

Now, the code as written should work. Let me check again:

The code starts with the import warnings. But the method is part of a class. So the warnings module must be imported in the scope where the method is defined. Assuming that the class is in a module where warnings is imported, that's okay. So the code should include the import.

Wait, but in the function signature given, the method is part of a class. So the code for the method must be inside the class. Therefore, the import must be at the top of the module. Since the user is asking for the code generation, the code should include the necessary imports.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So perhaps the code block should include the necessary imports. However, in the function's code, the method can't have the import inside it. So the import must be outside the class.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me think again. The code to generate is the method's code, but the import has to be in the class's module. Since the user is asking for the code for the method, perhaps the code should include the import inside the method? But that's not allowed in Python. So perhaps the code should assume that the warnings module is already imported.

Alternatively, the code as written in the method can't have the import. So the code must have the import at the top of the file. Since the user is asking for the method's code, perhaps the code should include the necessary part, but I can only write the method's code. Wait, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is a method, so it's part of a class. The code provided must be the method's code, but the deprecation warning requires an import. So perhaps the code must include the import inside the method, but that's invalid syntax. Therefore, the code can't include the import. Wait, but that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps the code will have the import at the top, but since the user only wants the method code, maybe I can ignore the import and just include the warning as part of the method, assuming that the module has already imported warnings. Alternatively, perhaps the code can have the import inside the method, but that's not allowed. So, perhaps the code will have the warning without the import, but that's an error. 

Wait, perhaps the user expects the code to have the import statement. Let me see. The code must be self-contained. So the method's code can't have the import. Therefore, the code must include the import at the top of the class's module. Since the user is asking for the method's code, maybe the code should be written as part of the class, with the necessary imports. But in the problem statement, the function signature is given as def to_csv(...), so the code to write is the method's code. Therefore, the method must have the warning, but the import must be present. So the code must include the import, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without the import, but that would cause an error. Hmm, this is a problem. Let me think again. The code for the method must be inside the class. The import must be at the top. Since the user wants only the code generated (the method's code), perhaps I can proceed by writing the method code, assuming that the warnings module is imported. Alternatively, perhaps the code can have the import inside the method, but that's invalid. 

Alternatively, maybe the deprecation warning can be omitted in the code, but the docstring already states that it's deprecated. But the code should still issue a warning. 

Hmm, perhaps the code must include the import inside the method, but that's not allowed. So maybe the code will have to have the import in the class's module. Since I can't write the entire module, but only the method's code, perhaps the code should include the import as a comment, but the user says to output only the code. 

Alternatively, maybe the code can use a try-except to import, but that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the code can proceed without the warning, but that's not correct. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that the deprecation warning is part of the code, so the code must include the warnings.warn call. Therefore, the code must have the import, but since it's part of the method's code, perhaps the code should have the import as part of the class's module. Since I can't write the entire module, but only the method's code, I have to include the import in the code block. Wait, in Python, you can't have an import inside a function if it's a class method. So the code would look like:

import warnings

class SomeClass:
    def to_csv(...):
        ... 

So the code for the method is the def to_csv part, but the import is outside. Since the user wants the code for the method, perhaps the code can proceed without the import, but that would cause an error. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should include the import inside the method, but that's invalid syntax. 

Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe the problem expects that the deprecation warning is included via the docstring, but the code doesn't need to emit a warning. But the docstring says it's deprecated, so the code should include the warning. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use a deprecation warning without the import, but that's impossible. 

Wait, maybe the code is part of a module where warnings is already imported. Since the problem is about generating the code for the method, perhaps the code is written within the class, and the import is in the module. So the code for the method is correct as written, with the warnings.warn call. The user can include the import in their module. 

In that case, the code is okay as written. So I can proceed with the code as written earlier.

Another point: the header is added to lines, then the lines are joined with newlines. So the header is the first line, followed by the data lines. Each data line is the coordinates followed by the values, separated by the separator. 

Another edge case: if a point's value is not an iterable? Like if value is a single number, not in a list. Then map(str, value) would fail. But according to the problem's doc, the graph can be multidimensional, so the value is probably a tuple or list. But the code expects that the value can be iterated over. So if the value is a scalar, it would fail. But perhaps the problem assumes that each point's value is an iterable. 

Alternatively, the code could handle that by converting the value to a list if it's a single element, but that's beyond the current problem's scope. The code as written is correct based on the given specifications.

Now, putting it all together, the code is:

import warnings

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn(
        "to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use ToCSV in sequences instead.",
        DeprecationWarning
    )
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coords, value = point
        parts = list(map(str, coords)) + list(map(str, value))
        line = separator.join(parts)
        lines.append(line)
    return '\n'.join(lines)

Wait, but in the code above, the return is '\n'.join(lines). Suppose lines has the header and some lines. The joined string will have the header followed by \n and the rest. So the first line is the header, then each data line. That's correct. 

Wait, but the doc says that the header's new line is added automatically. So the header is written as is, and then a new line is added. But in the code, the header is just added to the lines list, then when joined with newlines, it becomes header followed by a newline. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the header is followed by a newline, so the first line is header + '\n', but the code's approach is okay because when you join with '\n', the first line is header, then the next line is the first data line. So the output would be:

header
data_line_1
data_line_2
...

Which is correct. So the code is okay.

Wait, but in the code, if there's a header, the first element in lines is header, then the data lines. So the joined string would be "header\ndata1\ndata2..." which is correct. 

Yes. So the code is correct. 

Now, the code in markdown format. The user wants only the code, in Python markdown, so:

```python
import warnings

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn(
        "to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use ToCSV in sequences instead.",
        DeprecationWarning
    )
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coords, value = point
        parts = list(map(str, coords)) + list(map(str, value))
        line = separator.join(parts)
        lines.append(line)
    return '\n'.join(lines)
```

Wait, but the first line is 'import warnings' which is outside the method. So in the class's code, the method is inside the class. The import is at the top of the module. So the code as written would have the import inside the method, which is invalid. Wait no, the code as written here is correct if the import is at the top of the module. But in the code block, the user is supposed to write the method's code. The problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, so the method's code must include the warning, which requires the import. But in Python, the import must be outside the function. 

Ah, here's the problem. The code I wrote includes the import inside the method, which is invalid. Wait no, in the code block above, the 'import warnings' is outside the function, so it's part of the module's code. But when presenting the code for the method, the import is necessary but not part of the method. 

Hmm. The user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. The function signature given is def to_csv(...), so the code should be the method's code, but the import is needed for the warnings. 

Therefore, the code must include the import, but in the method's code, you can't have an import. Therefore, the code must be written as part of the class, with the import at the top. Since the user wants the code for the method, perhaps the code should include the import as part of the method's code, but that's invalid. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without the import and the warning, but that would not fulfill the deprecation note. 

Alternatively, maybe the code can use a string-based warning, but that's not standard. 

Hmm, this is a problem. Perhaps the code can omit the import and the warning, but the problem's docstring requires the deprecation note. 

Alternatively, maybe the code's method can use a try block to import, but that's not feasible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code can have the import inside the method, but that's not allowed in Python. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the code:

The correct code would have the import at the top of the module. So in the code for the method, the import is not present. But the method uses warnings.warn. So the code for the method is as written, but the import must be in the module. 

Since the problem requires only the code for the method, the import is not part of it, so the code is:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn(...)
    ...

But the code can't have the import. So the user must include the import in their module. 

Therefore, in the code generated, the import is not part of the method's code, but the method uses warnings. 

So the code is as written, but without the import line. Wait, but then in the method, 'warnings' is undefined. 

Ah, right. That's a problem. So in the code provided, the import must be present. But since the code is for the method, perhaps the code should include the import within the method, but that's invalid. 

Hmm, this is a dilemma. Perhaps the problem expects that the deprecation warning is part of the code, so the code must have the import. But since the method is inside a class, the import has to be at the top of the module. Therefore, the code for the method cannot include the import. 

In that case, perhaps the code is written as:

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn(...)
    ... 

But this requires that the module has the import. Since the user is to generate the code for the method, the code is as above, assuming the import is present. 

Therefore, the correct code for the method is the one without the import line. But then, in a real module, the import is needed. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the code is written in a way that the import is inside the method, but that's invalid syntax. 

Hmm, perhaps the code should proceed without the deprecation warning, but the problem's docstring says it's deprecated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the deprecation warning is optional, and the code can proceed without it. 

But the docstring explicitly mentions the deprecation, so the code should include it. 

Hmm. Maybe I have to proceed with the code including the import, even if it's outside the method. Since the user wants the code in Python markdown format, perhaps the code includes the import and the method. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. The function signature is given as def to_csv(...), so the code is the method's code. 

But the method's code requires the import. Therefore, the code must include the import. But in Python, the import must be outside the function. So the code would look like:

import warnings

class SomeClass:
    def to_csv(...):
        ...

But the user wants only the code for the method. Therefore, the code for the method is the def block, but the import is needed in the module. Since the user can't write the entire module, perhaps the code should include the import as part of the code block. 

Therefore, the code is written with the import at the top of the code block. 

In that case, the code would be:

```python
import warnings

def to_csv(self, separator=",", header=None):
    warnings.warn(
        "to_csv is deprecated since Lena 0.5. Use ToCSV in sequences instead.",
        DeprecationWarning
    )
    lines = []
    if header is not None:
        lines.append(header)
    for point in self.points:
        coords, value = point
        parts = list(map(str, coords)) + list(map(str, value))
        line = separator.join(parts)
        lines.append(line)
    return '\n'.join(lines)
```

Yes, this is correct. The import is at the top of the code block (so the module has it), and the method uses it. The code is self-contained in the sense that it includes all necessary parts. 

Therefore, this is the correct code to generate.
