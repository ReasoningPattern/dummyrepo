Okay, I need to write a Python method called validate_length_args that checks if the value of each given argument is not longer than a specified length. The function's docstring says that the parameter args is the received arguments. Hmm, wait, how are the arguments passed here? The method is part of a class, so maybe args is a dictionary or a list of tuples? Or perhaps each argument has a length specified somehow?

First, I should think about what the function is supposed to do. The goal is to ensure that each argument's value doesn't exceed a certain length. But how is the length specified? The problem statement mentions "length specified," but the function's parameters only have args. Oh, maybe the length is part of the args structure? Like each argument in args has a name and a maximum length? Or perhaps the args parameter is a dictionary where the keys are argument names and the values are tuples containing the actual value and the maximum allowed length?

Wait, the function's parameters are a bit unclear. Let me re-read the problem. The function signature is def validate_length_args(self, args): and the docstring says to check if the value of the given args is not longer than the specified length. The parameter args is the received arguments. 

Hmm, maybe each element in args is a tuple where the first element is the actual value, and the second is the maximum allowed length? Or perhaps the args are passed as a dictionary where each key is the argument name, and the value is another tuple containing the actual value and the maximum length. Alternatively, maybe the args are structured such that each argument has a 'max_length' attribute or something similar?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class where each argument's maximum length is defined elsewhere, like in a configuration. But given the parameters, the function's args must contain the necessary information. Since the function is supposed to check the length, the args probably include both the actual value and the maximum allowed length for each argument. So maybe args is a list of dictionaries or tuples where each entry has the value and the max length. 

Alternatively, maybe the args are passed as a dictionary where each key is the argument name, and the value is a tuple (value, max_length). For example, args could look like {'name': ('John Doe', 10), 'email': ('john@example.com', 20)}. Then the function would loop through each key-value pair, check the length of the stored value against the max_length.

Alternatively, maybe each argument in args is a tuple where the first element is the value and the second is the maximum allowed length. Like args is a list of tuples like [(value1, max1), (value2, max2), ...]. Then the function would iterate over each tuple and check len(value) <= max_length.

The problem is a bit ambiguous, but given the function's name and parameters, I think the args parameter is a collection of arguments where each has a value and a maximum length. So the function needs to loop through each of these and ensure the value's length is within the specified limit.

Now, for the code. The function is part of a class, so self might refer to some context, but the parameters are only args. The function should probably raise an error if any value exceeds its length. Let's think about possible exceptions. Maybe if any value is too long, it raises a ValueError or a custom exception.

Now, the user mentioned to use test-driven development, so first generate unit tests. Let's think of test cases. For example:

Test case 1: valid inputs where all values are within the specified lengths. The function should return without error.

Test case 2: one value exceeds the max length, so it should raise an exception.

Test case 3: empty args (maybe no-op, but perhaps it's an edge case).

Wait, but how is args structured? Let me make an assumption here. Let's suppose that args is a list of tuples, where each tuple has the value and the maximum allowed length. For example, args could be [( 'abc', 3 ), ( 'defg', 4 )], which are both okay. But if one is like ( 'abcd', 3 ), that's over.

Alternatively, maybe the args are passed as a dictionary where each key is the argument name, and the value is a tuple (value, max_length). But for the sake of simplicity, let's assume that args is a list of tuples (value, max_length). So the function would loop through each of these.

So the tests would look like:

def test_validate_length_valid(self):
    args = [('test', 4), ('another', 6)]
    self.validate_length_args(args)  # Should not raise error.

def test_validate_length_invalid(self):
    args = [('longstring', 5)]
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
        self.validate_length_args(args)

def test_empty_args(self):
    args = []
    self.validate_length_args(args)  # Should be okay.

Now, writing the actual code. The function would loop through each element in args. For each (value, max_length):

for value, max_length in args:
    if len(value) > max_length:
        raise ValueError(f"Value '{value}' exceeds maximum allowed length of {max_length}")

Wait, but what if the value is not a string? Like, if it's an integer? The problem says "value of the given args", so perhaps the values are strings. Or maybe it's any object with a length (like lists, etc). The function should check the length using len(), so the value must support that.

So in the code, the function would loop through each pair in args, check len(value) <= max_length, and raise an error if any are over.

Now, putting it all together. The method would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. 
    :param args: The received arguments. Each element is a tuple (value, max_length).
    """
    for value, max_length in args:
        if len(value) > max_length:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Value '{value}' has length {len(value)}, which exceeds the maximum allowed length of {max_length}."
            )
    # If all pass, no need to return anything.

Wait, but the docstring says "check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified". So it's supposed to perform the check, and presumably raise an error if any is too long, else do nothing. So the code above does that.

Now, the tests. Since the user wants the code generated, but first the tests, but in the problem the user wants the code generated (the actual method), so I need to write the code as per the function signature. 

Wait, but the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and output only the code in Python markdown. So the code would be the method as per above.

Wait, but in the problem's function signature, the args are passed as a parameter, but the docstring's param says "The received arguments." So the code needs to process those arguments. So the code I wrote above is correct, assuming that args is a list of tuples with (value, max_length).

Alternatively, maybe the args are passed as a dictionary where each key is the argument name and the value is another tuple (current value, max length). But the code would need to iterate through the items. But the code I have works for a list of tuples.

Another possible structure: the args could be a list of dictionaries with 'value' and 'max_length' keys. But the code would need to be adjusted. Since the problem is a bit ambiguous, but given the function's name and the docstring, I think the initial approach is okay.

Another possible edge case: what if the max_length is negative? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps the function can assume that max_length is a positive integer. So if someone passes a negative, it would raise an error. But the code as written would just check len(value) > max_length, so if max_length is -1, then any len(value) (which is non-negative) would be greater, leading to an error. But perhaps the function should also check that max_length is a positive integer. But the problem didn't mention that. So maybe it's out of scope.

Thus, the code as written should work. Now, the code in markdown format. Since the user says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format, I'll present it as a code block with triple backticks and python as the language.

Wait, but the method is part of a class. The user's function signature is def validate_length_args(self, args): so it's a method of a class. So the code must be inside a class. But since the problem only asks for the code based on the function signature and docstring, perhaps we can just write the method as is, assuming it's inside a class. The user didn't specify the class name, so we can just present the method.

Therefore, the code would be:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. 
    :param args: The received arguments. Each element is a tuple (value, max_length).
    """
    for value, max_length in args:
        if len(value) > max_length:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Value '{value}' has length {len(value)}, which exceeds the maximum allowed length of {max_length}."
            )

Wait, but in the problem's docstring, the param says "The received arguments." So maybe the args parameter is a dictionary of arguments where each key is the argument name, and the value is another tuple (current value, max length). For example, args could be {'name': ('John Doe', 10)}. In that case, the code would need to loop through the values of the dictionary's items. Let me think again.

If the args parameter is a dictionary where each value is a tuple (value, max_length), then the code would be:

for arg_name, (value, max_length) in args.items():

But then the error message could include the argument name, like f"Argument '{arg_name}' has value '{value}' which is too long."

But the problem's docstring doesn't specify this. The original problem's docstring says "check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified." The parameter is "args: The received arguments." So perhaps the args are passed as a list of tuples (value, max_length) or as a dictionary with each value being a tuple. 

The problem is ambiguous, but given the function's name, perhaps it's better to assume that each element in args is a pair of (value, max_length). So the code as written before is okay. But in that case, the function's parameter is a list of tuples, so the for loop works.

Alternatively, maybe the args is a list of argument names and their max lengths, but the actual values are obtained from somewhere else, like via self. But that complicates things. The problem states that the function receives the args as a parameter, so I think the first approach is correct.

Therefore, the code is as above. Now, the user wants the code in markdown, so:

```python
def validate_length_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. 
    :param args: The received arguments. Each element is a tuple (value, max_length).
    """
    for value, max_length in args:
        if len(value) > max_length:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Value '{value}' has length {len(value)}, which exceeds the maximum allowed length of {max_length}."
            )
```

Wait, but the docstring in the problem says "The received arguments." but the code's docstring now adds an explanation. The problem's docstring is as given. So I should not add extra explanations, but follow exactly the problem's docstring. Wait, the problem's docstring says:

def validate_length_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """

Hmm, the original docstring has a \n:param args: ... So the actual docstring is split into two lines. The first line is the description, then the param line. So in the code, the docstring should be exactly as given. So in the generated code, the docstring must be:

"""
Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
"""

Wait, but that \n is part of the string. So when written in triple quotes, it would be a newline. But perhaps the user intended that as part of the docstring. Alternatively, maybe that was a way to write the param on the next line. But in any case, the code should preserve the docstring as given. So in the code, the docstring is exactly as in the problem's function signature.

Thus, the final code would have the docstring as:

    """
    Check if value of the given args is not longer than length specified. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """

But when written in the code, the \n would create a new line between the description and the param. But perhaps the user intended that. However, in practice, when writing docstrings, the parameters are usually listed after a blank line, but maybe the problem's docstring is written that way. So the code must preserve that.

Therefore, the code would be as written, with that docstring.

Another point: the error message in the code should perhaps be more precise, but given the problem's description, the code raises a ValueError with a message indicating which value exceeded the limit. That's acceptable.

So the final code is as above.
