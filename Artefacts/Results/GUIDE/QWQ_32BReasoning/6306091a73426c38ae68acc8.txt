Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function list_of_file_names based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). Hmm, first I should think about what cli.ListOfFileNames does. Probably, it's a class or a factory function that creates an IniType instance which can handle lists of file names. 

The parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option. I'm not entirely sure what these parameters mean. Maybe settings_dirs is a list of directories where the configuration files are located, and spec_option could be an option that specifies how the file names are to be processed. 

Wait, the docstring is pretty brief. Let me see. The function's purpose is to create an IniType via that cli function. So perhaps the actual code will just call cli.ListOfFileNames with those parameters. But maybe there's more to it. Let me think about possible unit tests first, as per the test-driven approach.

The user mentioned generating comprehensive unit tests before the code. So I should first outline what the tests would look like. For example, testing that the function returns an instance of IniType, checking that the settings_dirs and spec_option are passed correctly to the underlying cli function. 

Wait, but I don't know the exact implementation of cli.ListOfFileNames. Assuming that cli.ListOfFileNames takes those parameters, maybe the function just passes them along. So the code would be something like:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But maybe the cli function is a class, so perhaps it's instantiated like cli.ListOfFileNames() and then some configuration? The docstring says "via cli.ListOfFileNames()", so maybe the function is a factory. 

Alternatively, maybe the IniType is created by passing the settings_dirs and spec_option as arguments to the cli.ListOfFileNames. So the code is straightforward. 

Now for the unit tests. Let's think of a test case where we mock the cli.ListOfFileNames function. For example, using unittest.mock to patch it and check that it's called with the correct arguments. 

The test would look like:

import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mymodule import list_of_file_names

class TestListOfFileNames(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch('mymodule.cli.ListOfFileNames')
    def test_returns_correct_instance(self, mock_list_of_file_names):
        result = list_of_file_names(['dir1', 'dir2'], 'option')
        mock_list_of_file_names.assert_called_once_with(['dir1', 'dir2'], 'option')
        self.assertIsInstance(result, mock_list_of_file_names.return_value.__class__)

    def test_parameters(self):
        # Or other tests, but maybe the main point is the first test.

Wait, but the actual code's structure may depend on how the cli function is structured. Since I don't have the actual cli module details, I have to proceed with the information given. 

So the code for the function is probably as simple as returning the result of cli.ListOfFileNames with the given parameters. 

Therefore, the generated code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. 

Now, the user also mentioned generating the unit tests first. But since I'm to output only the code, maybe I can proceed to write the function as above. 

Wait, but the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So just the function, enclosed in ```python ... ```.

Hmm, but I should make sure that I'm not missing any details. The function's docstring says it returns a new IniType via that cli function, so the code should indeed call that function with the given parameters. 

I think that's all. The code is straightforward once the parameters are correctly passed.
