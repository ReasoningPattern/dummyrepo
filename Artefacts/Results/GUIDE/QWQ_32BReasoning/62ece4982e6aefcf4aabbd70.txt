Okay, I need to write a Python function called os_is_mac that checks if the operating system is macOS. The function should return True if it's macOS, else False. Let's think about how to do this.

First, I remember that in Python, the os module can help determine the OS. The os.name gives a basic identifier, but maybe that's not enough. Alternatively, the platform module has more detailed info. Like, platform.system() returns the system/OS name, which for macOS is 'Darwin'. So maybe checking if platform.system() starts with 'Darwin' would work.

Wait, right, macOS's platform.system() returns 'Darwin', so the function could check for that. So the steps are: import platform, then get platform.system() and see if it's 'Darwin'. But should it be case-sensitive? Probably, since platform.system() returns 'Darwin' with a capital D. So the code would be something like:

return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

But I need to make sure to import the platform module first. So the function would start with importing platform, then that return statement.

Now, the user mentioned test-driven development. So first, I should write unit tests. Let me think of possible test cases. For example, when running on macOS, the function should return True. On Linux or Windows, it should return False. But how to mock the platform.system() in tests without changing the actual OS?

The tests would need to use the unittest.mock module's patch to mock the platform.system() method. So in the test, I can patch it to return 'Darwin' and check the function returns True. Then patch it to return another value like 'Linux' and check returns False.

So the unit tests would look like this:

Import unittest, and maybe patch from unittest.mock.

The test class would have two test methods: one where platform.system() is 'Darwin' and expects True, another where it's something else (like 'Windows' or 'Linux') and expects False.

Wait, but in the tests, since the actual platform.system() might not be Darwin, but we can mock it. So the tests would use @patch to mock the platform.system() function.

But I need to structure the tests properly. Let me outline the test cases:

Test case 1: When the OS is macOS (platform.system() returns 'Darwin'), the function returns True.

Test case 2: When the OS is not macOS (like 'Linux' or 'Windows'), returns False.

So the test code would be something like:

from unittest.mock import patch
import unittest

class TestOsIsMac(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_true(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Darwin'
        self.assertTrue(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Linux'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

But wait, in the test, the function os_is_mac is in the same module, so the import might be an issue. But assuming the tests are in the same file, or properly imported, that's okay. Also, the patch is for 'platform.system', which is the correct target.

Hmm, also need to make sure that the tests are comprehensive. Maybe check for other possible returns, but the main case is 'Darwin' vs others. That should cover it.

Now, writing the actual code. The function is straightforward:

import platform

def os_is_mac():
    """
    Checks if the os is macOS

    :return: bool, True is macOS, otherwise False.
    """
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

Wait, but maybe the function should be case-insensitive? Like, if someone returns 'darwin' in lowercase. But according to the docs, platform.system() returns the actual system name, which for macOS is always 'Darwin' with a capital D. So exact match is okay.

So that's the code. Let me check again. The function returns True when platform.system() is exactly 'Darwin', else False. The tests cover both cases. That should work.

I think that's all. Now, output the code as per the user's instruction. They want the code in Python markdown format, only the code generated. The tests first, then the actual code?

Wait, the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and to use test-driven development, so first the tests, then the code. But the output should be only the code generated. So I need to write the tests as part of the code? Or the code includes the tests? 

Wait, the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So probably, the code includes both the tests and the function. But in TDD, you write tests first, then the code. So the code would have the tests and the function. But in Python, the tests are usually in a separate file or in a test class. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the code to include the function and the tests. So the code would look like:

The function definition, then the test class with the two test methods using patch.

Wait, but in the code, the tests would need to be run via if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main(). So putting all together, the code would be:

import platform
from unittest.mock import patch
import unittest

def os_is_mac():
    ...
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

class TestOsIsMac(unittest.TestCase):
    ... tests here ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

But the user wants the code generated. So that's the structure. Let me structure it properly.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the function's docstring is given, so the code must include the function with that docstring. The tests must be written first, but in code, the tests are written after the function, or in a separate part.

Hmm, perhaps the code is written as:

First the function, then the tests. But in TDD, the tests are written first, but in the code, the function comes first. So perhaps the code would have the tests as part of the same file. 

Alternatively, the user might want the code to include both the tests and the function. So putting all together, the code would be:

The code block would include the function and the test cases. 

Putting it all together, here's the code:

The function:

import platform

def os_is_mac():
    """
    Checks if the os is macOS

    :return: bool, True is macOS, otherwise False.
    """
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

Then the test class:

from unittest.mock import patch
import unittest

class TestOsIsMac(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_true(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Darwin'
        self.assertTrue(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Linux'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Wait, but in this code, the tests are in the same file as the function. The imports would need to be correct. The function is in the same module, so when the tests are run, they can access it. 

Yes, that should work. So the code includes both the function and the tests. The user wants the code in Python markdown format, so using triple backticks. 

Wait, the user says "output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the final answer should be the code inside a markdown code block with ```python ... ```.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

```python
import platform

def os_is_mac():
    """
    Checks if the os is macOS

    :return: bool, True is macOS, otherwise False.
    """
    return platform.system() == 'Darwin'

from unittest.mock import patch
import unittest

class TestOsIsMac(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_true(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Darwin'
        self.assertTrue(os_is_mac())

    @patch('platform.system')
    def test_os_is_mac_false(self, mock_system):
        mock_system.return_value = 'Linux'
        self.assertFalse(os_is_mac())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Wait, but the order here is function first, then the tests. But in TDD, the tests are written first. However, in the code structure, the function has to be defined before the tests can reference it. So the code is written with the function first, then the tests. That's okay.

Wait, but when writing the tests first, in TDD, you would first write the test code, which would cause an error because the function doesn't exist yet. Then you write the function to make the tests pass. But in the code as written above, the function is present. So the code as written includes both the tests and the function. 

I think that's correct. The user wants the code generated following TDD, so the tests are present, and then the code. So the code block includes both. 

Another point: in the test, the patch is applied to 'platform.system', which is the correct way because the function is using platform.system(), so mocking that directly works. 

I think this is correct. Let me double-check everything. The function returns True for 'Darwin', which is macOS. The tests mock the system to return those values. The code seems correct.
