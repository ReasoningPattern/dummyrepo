Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _get_resource_name_regex, which returns regular expressions for validating Krake resource names. Let me start by understanding what Krake expects for resource names. 

First, I remember that Kubernetes, which Krake is inspired by, uses DNS subdomain names for resource identifiers. The standard DNS subdomain label rules state that the name must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character. Also, the maximum length is 63 characters. But I should check if Krake has any specific variations. 

Assuming Krake follows similar conventions, the regex should enforce these rules. The regex needs to match a string that starts with [a-z0-9], ends with [a-z0-9], and has middle characters as [a-z0-9-], with a total length between 1 and 63 characters. 

So the regular expression would look something like ^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*?[a-z0-9])?$, but also considering the length. Wait, how to incorporate the length? Maybe using {1,63} but grouped properly. Alternatively, the entire string should be 1 to 63 characters long. 

Wait, the regex can be constructed as ^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ because the total length including the first and last characters can't exceed 63. Let me think: the first character is 1, the last is 1, so the middle part can be up to 61. Because 1 + (middle) + 1 <= 63 → middle ≤ 61. 

Alternatively, maybe the entire regex should be ^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ and also ensure the total length is <=63. Hmm, but regex can't directly enforce length unless using a look-ahead. Wait, perhaps the regex should start with ^ and end with $, with the entire pattern matching the constraints. 

Another approach: the entire string must be between 1 and 63 characters, starting and ending with [a-z0-9], and the rest can be alphanumeric or hyphens. So the regex could be ^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ but also including the case where the string is exactly one character. 

Wait, let's break it down:

- The name must be 1-63 characters long.
- The first character must be [a-z0-9].
- The last character must be [a-z0-9].
- Middle characters can be [a-z0-9-], but can't be all hyphens (but that's probably not required here; the regex might not need to check that as long as the hyphens are between alnum characters).

Alternatively, the regex can be written as:

^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$

But this allows for a total length of up to 1+62+1? Wait no, the first character is 1, the middle part can be up to 61 (since 0 to 61), then the last character adds another 1. So total maximum is 1 + 61 +1 = 63. Exactly.

So that regex would work. 

But maybe it's better to split into two parts: the length check and the character checks. However, in regex, combining both might be possible. 

So the regex string would be r'^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$'

Wait, but what about the case where the entire string is only one character? The middle part would have 0 characters, so the regex would match. That's okay. 

Also, the [a-z0-9-]{0,61} part can include hyphens but must end with an alnum. 

Hmm, maybe that's correct. 

Now, the function is supposed to return the regular expressions used to validate the name. Wait, plural "expressions". So perhaps the function returns a list or a dictionary of regex patterns. But the docstring says "return the regular expressions", so maybe it's a list. 

Wait, looking at the function's docstring: "Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources". Maybe there are multiple regexes? Or perhaps it's a single regex. 

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a compiled regex, but the problem says "regular expressions" plural. Perhaps in some cases, there are multiple patterns, but in this case, perhaps it's just one. Let me think again. 

Assuming that the function returns a single regex, but the problem says "regular expressions" (plural), maybe there are multiple patterns for different cases? Or perhaps the function returns a dictionary with different regex for different parts? 

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return a regex that covers all the necessary constraints. Let me check the problem again. The function's docstring says "Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources". The plural might be a mistake, but perhaps the actual code expects a single regex. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a list containing a single regex. 

In any case, I'll proceed to write the regex as described. 

Now, to test this, I need to generate unit tests first. 

The unit tests should check:

- Valid names: like "my-resource", "a", "abc-def", "123test", "test123"

- Invalid names: start with hyphen (e.g. "-test"), end with hyphen, contain uppercase letters (e.g. "Test1"), contain invalid characters like "_", or exceed length. 

So, for the unit tests, I would create a function test_get_resource_name_regex, and use assertRegex or assertNotRegex, but in Python's unittest framework, perhaps using re.fullmatch. 

Wait, since the regex should match the entire string, using re.fullmatch is important. 

So, the test cases would be:

Test case 1: valid name "valid-name" → should match. 

Test case 2: name with hyphen at start → should not match. 

Test case 3: uppercase letter → invalid. 

Test case 4: length 64 → too long. 

Test case 5: exactly 63 characters → valid. 

Test case 6: hyphen in the middle but not at start/end → okay. 

Test case 7: name with only hyphens → invalid. 

Wait, but hyphens in the middle are allowed as long as they are between alnum. 

So, the regex should not allow names like "a-b-c", but that's allowed. Wait, no, "a-b-c" is okay because it starts and ends with alnum. 

Wait, "a-b-c" is valid. 

But "a--b" is allowed? The regex allows hyphens as long as they are between alnum characters. 

Wait, the regex allows hyphens but the hyphens can't be at the start or end. 

Wait, the regex's middle part can have hyphens, but the entire string must start and end with alnum. 

So, "a--b" is okay because the hyphens are in the middle. 

Hmm, okay. 

Now, for the tests, I can write:

def test_valid_name():
    regex = _get_resource_name_regex()
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "valid-name") is not None

def test_invalid_start_hyphen():
    regex = _get_resource_name_regex()
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "-invalid") is None

def test_invalid_uppercase():
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "Invalid") is None

def test_too_long():
    long_name = "a" * 64
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, long_name) is None

def test_exact_length():
    valid_length = "a" *63
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, valid_length) is not None

def test_middle_hyphens():
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "a-b-c") is not None

def test_hyphen_between():
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "a-b") is not None

def test_hyphens_only():
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "a--b") is not None  # allowed
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "a---b") is not None  # allowed

But also test cases where the hyphen is surrounded by alnum:

Wait, "a-b" is okay. 

What about "a-b-c-d" → okay. 

But "a-b-c-d-e" with 5 parts, as long as length is okay. 

Also, test case where the name is exactly 1 character:

def test_single_char():
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "a") is not None

Test case with invalid character like underscore:

def test_invalid_char():
    assert re.fullmatch(regex, "a_b") is None

Okay, so the unit tests would check these cases. 

Now, the function _get_resource_name_regex must return the regex as a string, probably as a raw string. 

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return r'^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$'

Wait, but the function says "regular expressions" plural, but this returns a single regex. Maybe the function is supposed to return a list or a dictionary. 

Looking back at the problem statement: the function's docstring says "Return the regular expressions" (plural), but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe there are multiple regex for different purposes, but in the context of resource names, it's likely a single regex. 

Alternatively, maybe it's expecting a compiled regex, but the function's return is a string. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function returns a list containing the regex string. 

Hmm, the problem's function signature says to return the regex, so maybe it's just a string. 

Assuming that the correct approach is to return a single regex string. 

Thus, the code is as above. 

Now, to write the tests first as per TDD. 

But the problem says to generate the code based on the signature and docstring, so the code is the function. 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the code is the function _get_resource_name_regex returning the regex string. 

So the final code is:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return r"^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$"

Wait, but in Python, the r prefix is important for raw strings. 

Wait, in the regex, the ^ and $ are necessary to ensure the entire string is matched. 

Also, the regex is case-sensitive, so lowercase only. 

Yes, this should work. 

Wait, but why 0,61 in the middle? Let me double-check:

The total length is 1 (first char) + (middle part) + 1 (last char) ≤ 63 → middle part can be up to 61. 

The middle part is [a-z0-9-]{0,61}, so the total length can be 2 (1+0+1) up to 63. 

If the middle part is 0, then the total length is 2? Wait, no. Wait, the first part is [a-z0-9], then the next group is optional (since it's in parentheses with ?). 

Wait, the regex is ^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ 

Breaking it down:

The first character is [a-z0-9], then the group ( [a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9] ) can be present or not (due to the ?). 

Wait, the group is optional. So the entire regex can be either:

- Just the first character plus the last part (if the group is present), but that's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the regex is written as:

^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$ with a length check. But that might not limit the length. 

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the regex structure. 

Let me think again. The regex needs to enforce the total length of the entire string to be between 1 and 63. 

Wait, the current regex as written allows:

The first character is required (since it's outside the group). The group is optional. 

If the group is not present (due to the ?), then the entire string is just the first character. 

So, the minimum length is 1, maximum is 1 + (61+1) = 63. 

Because the group's part is [a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9], which is (up to 61 characters for the middle, plus the last character). 

Wait, the group's part is two parts: the middle characters (up to 61) and the last character. 

Wait, the group is [a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9], so the first part is 0 to 61 characters (the hyphens and alnum), then the last character must be alnum. 

So the group's total length is between 1 (if the first part is 0) and 62 (61 +1). 

Thus, when the group is present, the total length is 1 (first char) + group's length (1 to 62) → total up to 63. 

When the group is not present (because of the ?), then the total length is 1. 

So that's correct. 

Therefore the regex is correct. 

Thus, the code is as written. 

Now, the user also mentioned that I should first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the code, but the problem says to output only the code generated. 

So the final code is the function returning the regex string.
