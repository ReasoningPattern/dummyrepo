Okay, I need to write a Python method called popitem that removes and returns a random (key, value) pair using __choice. Wait, the docstring says to use __choice in the class. Hmm, so first, I should think about how this method fits into a class. Probably, the class has a dictionary stored, like a regular dict, and popitem is supposed to pick a random item from it.

But wait, the method is supposed to use __choice. Oh, maybe __choice is a method in the class that returns a random key? Or maybe it's an attribute? The wording is a bit unclear. Let me read the docstring again: "Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So maybe the __choice function is part of the class's methods or attributes. Perhaps the class has a __choice method that selects a random key from the dictionary. 

Assuming that the class has a dictionary (like a subclass of dict), then popitem would first select a random key using __choice, then remove that key and return the (key, value) pair. But how does __choice work here? Let me think of possible implementations. 

Alternatively, maybe __choice is a method that returns a random key, so the popitem method would first call self.__choice() to get the key, then pop it from the dictionary. But how is __choice implemented? Since the user didn't provide that method, perhaps the __choice is part of the class and is supposed to be a helper function here. Wait, maybe the __choice is a method that selects a random key from the keys of the dictionary. So the steps would be:

1. Use __choice to get a random key from the current keys.
2. Then, remove that key from the underlying dictionary (using pop() method, perhaps).
3. Return the (key, value) pair as a tuple.

But I need to make sure that the class has a way to track the keys. Since this is a method of the class, perhaps the class has an internal dictionary, like data, and __choice is a method that picks a random key from self.data.keys(). 

Wait, but how does __choice work exactly? Let me think of possible code structures. Let's suppose the class has a dictionary stored in self.items or something similar. Then, the __choice method would be something like:

def __choice(self):
    return random.choice(list(self.items.keys()))

But then, in the popitem method, you would first get the key via __choice, then pop it from self.items and return the key-value pair. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice function is supposed to return a (key, value) pair directly? The wording says "via __choice in the class". Hmm. The docstring says "Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So maybe the __choice is a method that selects a random key-value pair. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice is a helper method that returns a random key, and then the popitem uses that key to get the value and remove it. 

Assuming that, the steps would be:

key = self.__choice()
value = self.items.pop(key)
return (key, value)

So the code for popitem would look like that. 

But first, I need to make sure that the class has an __choice method. Since the problem statement doesn't provide that, perhaps the __choice is part of the class's existing code. The user is just asking to implement popitem based on that existing __choice method. 

Therefore, the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return (key, self.pop(key))

Wait, but maybe the __choice returns a key, then you can pop it and return the key and value. Alternatively, maybe the __choice returns a tuple (key, value), but that's less likely. The wording says "via __choice in the class", so perhaps the __choice is the way to get the random pair. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a method that returns a random key, so the code is as above. 

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice is an attribute that holds a function, but that's probably overcomplicating. 

So the code for popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

Wait, but in a dictionary, the pop method returns the value. So yes, that would work. 

But how does the __choice method work? Let me think. The __choice method would have to return a random key from the current dictionary. So if the class has a dictionary stored in self.data, then __choice would be something like:

import random

def __choice(self):
    if not self.data:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")
    return random.choice(list(self.data.keys()))

But the user hasn't provided that method. Since the problem is to write the popitem method based on the given docstring, I can assume that the __choice method is already implemented in the class. 

Therefore, the popitem method's code is as I wrote above. 

Now, the user also mentioned to use test-driven development, first writing unit tests before the code. But the output should only be the code, not the tests. So the code for the popitem method is as above. 

Wait, but perhaps the __choice method is part of the same class, and the popitem is supposed to use that method. 

Wait, another thought: the problem says "via __choice in the class", so maybe __choice is a static or class method? Or perhaps it's a method that the class has. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a helper function that returns a random key from the dictionary. 

In any case, the code for popitem is straightforward once __choice is available. 

Now, considering possible edge cases. What if the dictionary is empty? Then, __choice might raise an error, and popitem should as well. So, the __choice method should check if there are elements first. 

But since the problem is just to write the popitem method, assuming that __choice works correctly, then the code is as above. 

Therefore, the code for the popitem method is:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return (key, self.pop(key))

Alternatively, using a tuple:

return (key, self.pop(key))

Wait, the pop method removes the key and returns the value. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the __choice returns a key-value pair, but then you have to remove the key. But that would require different code. 

The wording of the docstring says "Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So perhaps __choice is the method that finds and returns the (key, value) pair, and then the popitem removes it. 

Wait, in that case, the process would be:

pair = self.__choice()
key, value = pair
del self[key]
return pair

But that would require that __choice returns a (key, value) pair. 

Alternatively, maybe __choice returns a key, and then you can get the value and remove it. 

Hmm. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again:

"Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class"

The "via __choice" implies that __choice is the means by which the pair is found. So perhaps __choice is the method that finds the pair. 

Alternatively, the __choice could be a method that selects a random key, and then the rest is handled by popitem. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the first approach is better. Let's proceed with the first approach where __choice returns a key, then pop it. 

So the code is as written. 

Now, to structure this in a class, assuming that the class has a __choice method and that the popitem is part of that class. 

Therefore, the code for the popitem method is as I have. 

Wait, but in the code, the pop method is called on self. So perhaps the class is a subclass of dict, and so pop is inherited. 

Alternatively, if the class has its own storage (like a dictionary in self.items), then the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return (key, self.items.pop(key))

But the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the method is part of a class that already has the __choice method and uses a dictionary. 

Given the problem's instruction to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return (key, self.pop(key))

Alternatively, maybe the __choice returns a key, and the code should first get the value, then delete the key. 

Wait, but using pop is better because it does both. 

Yes, so that's correct. 

Another possible approach: the __choice might return a key, so then:

key = self.__choice()
value = self[key]
del self[key]
return (key, value)

But that's less efficient than using pop. 

The first approach is better. 

Therefore, the code is as above. 

Now, let me think about possible errors. If the dictionary is empty, __choice might raise an error, and then pop would also raise KeyError. So the code would handle that. 

Thus, the final code is as written.
