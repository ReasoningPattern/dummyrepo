Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function 'gaussian' based on the given signature and docstring. The function should calculate the Gaussian with u (mean) as 0.2 and sigma (standard deviation) as 0.1. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the Gaussian formula is (1/(sigma * sqrt(2π))) * e^(- (x - μ)^2 / (2σ²)). So substituting μ=0.2 and σ=0.1 into that formula.

Wait, right. The parameters are fixed here, so the function doesn't take them as arguments. The function 'gaussian(x)' will compute the value at point x using those specific μ and σ.

Hmm, I should make sure to use the correct values. Let me note down the constants: μ is 0.2, σ is 0.1. The exponent part becomes -(x - 0.2)^2 / (2*(0.1)^2). The denominator in the exponent is 2*(sigma squared), so 2*(0.01) = 0.02. The numerator is (x-0.2)^2. 

The coefficient in front is 1 divided by (sigma * sqrt(2π)). Let's compute that coefficient first. Sigma is 0.1, so 0.1 * sqrt(2 * π). So 1/(0.1 * sqrt(2*pi)). 

Wait, maybe it's better to code this step by step to avoid calculation errors. Let me structure the code:

Import math for the exponential and square root functions.

def gaussian(x):
    mu = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    return coefficient * math.exp(exponent)

That should work. Let me check if the order of operations is correct. The exponent is correctly calculated, and the coefficient is properly computed. 

Now, following the test-driven approach, I need to first write unit tests. Let's think of some test cases. 

First, test the value at the mean (x=0.2). The exponent becomes 0, so e^0 is 1. The coefficient would be 1/(0.1 * sqrt(2π)). Let me compute that numerically. Let's see: 0.1 * sqrt(2 * 3.14159) ≈ 0.1 * 2.5066 ≈ 0.25066. So 1/0.25066 ≈ ~3.99. So the result at x=0.2 should be approximately 3.99. 

Another test case: maybe at x = 0.2 + 0.1 (one sigma away). The exponent would be -(0.1)^2/(2*(0.01)) → -0.01/(0.02) → -0.5. So e^-0.5 is about 0.6065. Multiply by coefficient (same as before) gives approx 3.99 * 0.6065 ≈ 2.42. So that could be a test case. 

Also, edge cases: very large x, but since the Gaussian drops off rapidly, maybe not necessary. Alternatively, check for x as a float.

Wait, but how precise should the tests be? Maybe using approximate values with a tolerance. Let's see:

Test 1: x = 0.2. Expected value is 1/(0.1 * sqrt(2*pi)) → Let me calculate it more precisely. 

Let me compute the coefficient:

sigma = 0.1

sqrt(2*pi) ≈ 2.506628275

so denominator: 0.1 * 2.506628275 ≈ 0.2506628275

1 / that is approx 3.989422804. So the expected value at x=0.2 is 3.989422804. So in the test, we can have an assertion that the function returns approximately this value with, say, 7 decimal places.

Another test case: x = 0.3 (0.2 + 0.1). The exponent is -(0.1)^2/(2*(0.1)^2) → -0.01/(0.02) → -0.5. So e^-0.5 is about 0.60653066. Multiply by 3.9894228 gives approx 2.418. So that could be another test.

Another test case: x=0.0. Then (x -0.2) is -0.2 → squared is 0.04. Exponent is -0.04/(2*0.01) → -0.04/0.02 → -2. So e^-2 is ~0.1353. Multiply by the coefficient gives 3.989 *0.1353 ≈ 0.539.

So the tests would use these values with some decimal precision.

Now, to write the tests using the unittest module. Let's structure the test class.

First, import unittest.

Then, the test cases:

class TestGaussian(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_at_mean(self):
        self.assertAlmostEqual(gaussian(0.2), 3.989422804016417, places=7)

    def test_one_sigma(self):
        # x = 0.3 (0.2 + 0.1)
        expected = 3.989422804016417 * math.exp(-0.5)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(gaussian(0.3), expected, places=7)

    def test_negative(self):
        # x = 0.0
        expected = 3.989422804016417 * math.exp(-2)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(gaussian(0.0), expected, places=7)

Wait, but in the second test, the expected can be calculated directly via the formula. Alternatively, compute it numerically. Let me see:

Alternatively, in the test_one_sigma, the exponent is - (0.1)^2/(2*(0.1)^2) → - (0.01)/(0.02) → -0.5, so the exponent term is e^(-0.5). So the expected is coefficient * e^-0.5. Since the coefficient is 3.989..., the expected is exactly 3.989... * exp(-0.5). So to get the precise value, maybe calculate it in the test.

Alternatively, in code, perhaps use math.exp(-0.5) multiplied by the coefficient.

Wait, but when writing the test, perhaps it's better to compute the expected value using the same formula as the function, to avoid discrepancies. Alternatively, hardcode the expected value to a certain decimal.

Alternatively, use the function's own code to compute the expected value? No, because the test is for the function, so that would be circular.

Hmm, maybe just hardcode the values with sufficient precision. For example, in the first test, the expected value is known to be approximately 3.9894228, so we can write that as the expected value with enough decimal places. Similarly, for the second test, 3.9894228 * exp(-0.5) → let's calculate that:

exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.60653066

3.9894228 * 0.60653066 ≈ 3.9894228 * 0.60653066 ≈ let's compute:

3.9894228 * 0.6 = 2.39365368

3.9894228 * 0.00653066 ≈ approx 0.02606, so total approx 2.4197. So to 7 decimal places, perhaps 2.4189...

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the exact value using the math functions in the test code.

Alternatively, in the test code, compute the expected value using the same formula as the function, but perhaps that's not possible because the function is the one being tested. Wait, but in the test, the function is not yet written, so the test code can't rely on it. So perhaps better to hardcode the expected values with enough precision.

Alternatively, perhaps the test can use the formula to compute the expected value. Let me see: in the test, since the parameters are known, we can compute the expected value directly.

Like in the first test case:

mu = 0.2

sigma =0.1

x =0.2

exponent = - ( (0.2-0.2)**2 )/(2*0.1**2) → 0 → e^0 is 1.

coefficient = 1/(0.1 * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))

so expected = coefficient * 1 → which is exactly the coefficient. So in code, the test can compute the expected value as:

expected = 1/(sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))

where sigma is 0.1.

Wait, but in the test, how can I do that without referencing the function? Well, in the test code, I can compute the expected value using the same formula as the function, but that's okay. Because the test is written before the function. So the test can compute the expected value independently.

Yes, that's better. So in the test_at_mean:

def test_at_mean(self):
    mu = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    x = mu
    exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    expected = coefficient * math.exp(exponent)
    actual = gaussian(x)
    self.assertAlmostEqual(actual, expected, places=7)

This way, the test computes the expected value using the same formula, so it's accurate.

Similarly for the other tests. For example, the test_one_sigma:

def test_one_sigma(self):
    mu = 0.2
    sigma =0.1
    x = mu + sigma
    exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    expected = coefficient * math.exp(exponent)
    actual = gaussian(x)
    self.assertAlmostEqual(actual, expected, places=7)

This way, the test is independent of the function's implementation and uses the same parameters.

So the tests would be written in this way. That's better because it avoids hardcoding values which might have precision issues.

Another test case: check that the function returns a float. Or perhaps check for negative sigma? But sigma is fixed as 0.1, so that's not an issue here.

Another edge case: x is very far away, but the Gaussian should be near zero, but maybe that's not necessary for basic tests.

So, the test cases would include:

- At the mean (x=0.2)
- At one sigma away (x=0.3)
- At a point left of the mean (like x=0.0)
- Maybe another point, like x=0.4 (two sigmas away?), but perhaps that's overkill.

Also, check that the function returns a float. But the tests using assertAlmostEqual would already check that.

So the tests would be written first. Then the code is written to pass those tests.

Now, putting this into code. The user wants the code in Python markdown format, only the code. So the code would be the test module and the function.

Wait, but the user's function is called 'gaussian' and the tests should be in a separate test module. However, for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps the code to be generated is the function and the tests. But in TDD, you write the tests first, then the code. So the user wants the code generated, which includes both tests and the function. But how to present that?

Wait, the problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Hmm. So perhaps the code should include both the test and the function. But in practice, the tests would be in a separate file, but maybe here we can have the tests and the function in the same code block.

Alternatively, the code is the function, but according to the problem's instruction, the user wants the code generated, which includes the function. But the tips mention to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code, so the code should include both the tests and the function?

Wait the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in Python markdown format."

So probably, the code to output is the function and the tests. But the tests would be written as a unit test class, and the function as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is the function, but the test code is not part of the code to output? But the tips say to first write the tests before the code. But the user wants the code generated, which would be the function. However, perhaps the problem expects the function and the tests as the code to output, in the order of first tests then code.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the function code only. But the tips mention test-driven, so the code should include the tests. But the problem says "output only the code generated", so maybe the code is the function plus the tests. Let me check the problem again.

The problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So the code to output is the function's code. But the test-driven approach requires writing tests first. However, perhaps the user wants the code for the function, and the tests are part of the code to be generated. So the code would include both the test class and the function.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are considered part of the code. So the answer would be the function and the tests.

Yes, that makes sense. So the code would have the test class, then the function, and maybe a main block to run the tests.

Wait, but in Python, you can't have the function and the test class in the same file unless you structure it properly. Let me think:

The code would start with the test class, then the function, then a main block to run the tests if the script is executed directly.

Alternatively, the function is written, then the tests are written as a separate class, and then the code is structured so that when run, the tests execute.

Putting it all together:

import math
import unittest

class TestGaussian(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_at_mean(self):
        mu = 0.2
        sigma = 0.1
        x = mu
        exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
        coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
        expected = coefficient * math.exp(exponent)
        actual = gaussian(x)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(actual, expected, places=7)

    def test_one_sigma(self):
        mu = 0.2
        sigma = 0.1
        x = mu + sigma
        exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
        coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
        expected = coefficient * math.exp(exponent)
        actual = gaussian(x)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(actual, expected, places=7)

    def test_negative_x(self):
        mu = 0.2
        sigma =0.1
        x = 0.0
        exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
        coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
        expected = coefficient * math.exp(exponent)
        actual = gaussian(x)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(actual, expected, places=7)

def gaussian(x):
    """
    Calculate Gaussian centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1.
    """
    mu = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    return coefficient * math.exp(exponent)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Wait, but in the code above, the function 'gaussian' is defined after the test class, but the test methods reference 'gaussian' before it's defined. That would cause a NameError, because in Python, the function is not yet defined when the test class is parsed. So the code needs to be ordered such that the function is defined before the test class.

Ah right! So the correct order is: first import statements, then the function, then the test class. Because the test class needs to reference the function.

So rearranged:

import math
import unittest

def gaussian(x):
    """
    Calculate Gaussian centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1.
    """
    mu = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    return coefficient * math.exp(exponent)

class TestGaussian(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_at_mean(self):
        mu = 0.2
        sigma = 0.1
        x = mu
        exponent = - ( (x - mu)**2 ) / (2 * sigma**2)
        coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
        expected = coefficient * math.exp(exponent)
        actual = gaussian(x)
        self.assertAlmostEqual(actual, expected, places=7)

    # other test methods here...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

Yes, that way the function is defined before the test class, so the tests can reference it.

So the code is ordered correctly. Now, checking the calculations in the function: the exponent and coefficient are correctly calculated using the given mu and sigma. The math.exp is used for the exponent.

Now, I think this should work. The tests will check that the function's output matches the expected value calculated via the same formula, so if the function is implemented correctly, the tests should pass.

Another thing to consider: in Python, the math module must be imported, which it is.

Testing edge cases like very large x would be good, but maybe not necessary here. The tests provided should cover the main cases.

Therefore, the code should be as above.
