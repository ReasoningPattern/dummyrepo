Okay, so I need to write a Python function called load_configurations based on the given docstring and signature. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. 

The function takes config_filenames, which is a sequence of filenames. Then there's an overrides parameter, which is optional and defaults to None. There's also resolve_env, a boolean that defaults to True. The goal is to load each configuration file, validate them, handle any errors (like permission issues or parsing errors), and return a dictionary mapping each filename to its parsed config, along with a list of LogRecords for any errors.

First, I need to think about how to structure this. Let's see. The function needs to process each file in config_filenames. For each file, it has to try to read it. If there's a permission error, that's an error to log. Then parse the config. If parsing fails, log that error too. The overrides parameter might be used to override some values in the config, but the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe it's part of the function's behavior that's not detailed here. Wait, the docstring says "overrides" but the description doesn't explain how they're used. Hmm, maybe the overrides are key-value pairs that override the parsed config? Or perhaps they are applied after loading the files. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe I should assume that overrides are a dictionary that gets merged into the configuration, but perhaps that's part of the function's logic. Wait, the docstring says "load and validate each configuration file", but maybe overrides are applied after loading? Not sure, but the function's return is the parsed configurations, so maybe the overrides are applied in some way. Since the problem says to generate code based on the given docstring, perhaps the overrides are parameters that override the configuration values. But since the docstring doesn't mention it, maybe it's part of the function's behavior to handle them. Wait, the function's description says "return the results as a tuple of: dict of configuration filename to corresponding parsed configuration", so the overrides might be applied to each config, or perhaps they are parameters that can override the config files. Since the function's parameters include overrides, perhaps when a config is loaded, the overrides are applied to it. But how? Maybe the overrides are a dictionary that's merged into the config. But since the problem says to generate code based on the given info, perhaps I can proceed by ignoring the overrides for now, unless the docstring mentions it. Wait, looking back, the docstring says "Given a sequence of configuration filenames, load and validate each configuration file. If the configuration file cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file, the error log will be recorded. Otherwise, return the results as a tuple..." So the overrides might be parameters that are applied after loading the files, but the function's main job is to load and validate each file. Maybe the overrides are used to override the parsed config, but since the docstring doesn't say, perhaps it's part of the function's behavior but not affecting the error logging. Since I have to generate code, perhaps the overrides are parameters that are used to override the configuration values, but the main focus is on loading and error logging.

Let me think step by step:

1. The function loops over each filename in config_filenames.

2. For each filename, try to open and read the file. If can't due to permissions (like FileNotFoundError or PermissionError?), log the error.

Wait, the doc says "insufficient permissions or error parsing". So maybe it's a PermissionError (like no read access) or a parsing error (like invalid JSON/YAML, depending on the format). But the function's code isn't given, so maybe the config files are in a specific format? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is supposed to handle any parsing errors, but the actual parsing method isn't specified here. Wait, the problem is to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to parse the config files in some way, but the exact format isn't specified. Since the problem is about writing the code, maybe the parsing is left to a helper function, but in the code I have to write, perhaps I can assume that the config is a simple format like JSON, or that the parsing is handled by some generic method. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the file as a string and return that, but that's unlikely. Wait, the return is a dict of filename to parsed configuration. So the parsed config must be a data structure, like a dictionary. So perhaps the function reads the file, parses it (like JSON or YAML), and returns that. But since the problem doesn't specify the format, perhaps the code can assume that the config is a JSON file, or maybe the parsing is just loading the file into a string? Probably, the function is supposed to parse the config into a dictionary, but the exact method isn't specified. Since this is a code generation task, perhaps I can proceed by using a generic parser, or perhaps the code will use a simple approach like using json.load, but the actual format is up to the code.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the file's contents as a dictionary, but the specifics are abstracted. Since the problem is to generate code, perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the config files are in a format that can be parsed into a dictionary, and that the parsing can raise exceptions (like JSONDecodeError for JSON). So in code, for each filename:

- try to open the file, read its contents.

- parse the contents into a dictionary (using some method, like json.loads, but perhaps the code will use a generic function here, or raise a ValueError if parsing fails).

- if any error occurs (like IOError for file not found or permission denied, or parsing error), create a LogRecord and add to the errors list.

- collect all the parsed configs into a dictionary (filename to config).

- return the configs dict and the errors list.

Now, the overrides parameter: the function has an overrides parameter. The docstring doesn't mention how they're used. Since the function is supposed to return the parsed configurations, perhaps the overrides are applied to each config. For example, if a config is loaded, then any key in overrides would replace the config's value. But since the problem says to generate code based on the given info, maybe the overrides are supposed to be applied. But the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps that's part of the function's behavior. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are parameters that can override the config files, but the function's main task is to load and validate each file. Since the problem's description doesn't mention it, maybe the overrides are part of the function's parameters but their handling isn't required for the error logging. The function's main job is to load and return the parsed configs, applying overrides, but the docstring's focus is on the errors. Since the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring", perhaps the overrides are parameters that are used to override the configuration values, but how exactly? Maybe the overrides are a dictionary that is merged into each configuration's data. So for each config, after parsing, the overrides are applied, overwriting existing keys. Alternatively, the overrides could be a list of key=value strings, but since the parameter is named overrides and the default is None, it's probably a dictionary. So in code, after parsing the config, we would update it with the overrides. But how to handle that? Let's see:

The function's parameters are overrides=None. So if overrides is provided (and is a dict), then for each config, we need to apply those overrides. But perhaps the overrides are applied after merging all the config files? Or per file? The function's description says "Given a sequence of configuration filenames, load and validate each configuration file". The return is a dict of filename to parsed config. So each file's config is stored separately. The overrides might be applied to the final merged configuration, but since the return is per-file, perhaps the overrides are applied to each individual config. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied after combining all the configs. But the problem isn't clear. Since the docstring doesn't mention it, maybe the overrides are not part of the error logging, and the function just needs to handle them in the parsed config. Since the problem requires code generation, perhaps the code will need to handle overrides by merging them into each config's data. But I'm not sure. Since the problem's docstring doesn't specify, maybe the overrides can be ignored in the code, but the parameter must be present. Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are used to override the configuration files in the order, but the function's return is the parsed configs, so maybe the overrides are applied to the final configuration, but the problem's return is a dict per file, so maybe each file's config is stored as-is, and the overrides are not applied. Hmm, this is a bit unclear, but since the problem says to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, perhaps the overrides are parameters that are passed but not used in the current code, except for possibly affecting the parsed config. Since the docstring doesn't mention it, maybe the code can ignore them, but I need to check the function's purpose. Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are parameters that can override the config files' settings. For example, if a config file has a key 'port', and overrides has 'port': 8080, then the parsed config would have that value. But how exactly? Since the function's return is a dict of filename to parsed config, perhaps each config is processed with the overrides. So for each config in the files, after parsing, the overrides are applied. So:

config_data = parsed_config.copy()
if overrides:
    config_data.update(overrides)
But that's just a guess. Since the problem's docstring doesn't explain, maybe I should proceed without handling overrides for now, but include the parameter in the code. Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are command-line arguments or environment variables that override the config values, but that's more complex. Since the resolve_env parameter is there, which is a boolean. The docstring says "resolve_env=True" as default. So maybe that parameter indicates whether to resolve environment variables in the config. For example, if the config has a value like ${VAR}, and resolve_env is True, then it should be replaced with the value of the environment variable. But that's another part. The function's code needs to handle that.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the steps again, focusing on what's in the docstring.

The function must:

- For each filename in config_filenames:

   a. Try to read the file. If can't (due to permissions), log an error (a LogRecord).

   b. If read successfully, parse the config. If parsing fails (e.g., invalid JSON), log an error.

   c. If both steps a and b are successful, add the parsed config to the result dict.

- Collect all errors (from any step a or b) into a list of LogRecords.

- Return the config dict and the error list.

The overrides and resolve_env parameters are part of the function's parameters, but their handling is not detailed in the docstring. Since the problem is to generate code based on the given info, perhaps the overrides are parameters that are not used in this function (maybe they are for a different part of the system?), but the function must include them in the signature. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are used to override the parsed configuration, but since the docstring doesn't mention that, perhaps they are ignored in the current code. The resolve_env parameter might mean that environment variables are substituted in the config, but again, the docstring doesn't specify. Since the problem says to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, perhaps the overrides and resolve_env parameters are not part of the error handling, but the code must accept them. So in the code, perhaps overrides is a parameter but not used, and resolve_env is similarly not used, unless the parsing requires it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the resolve_env parameter is to indicate whether environment variables in the config should be resolved. For example, if the config has a value like "database: ${DATABASE_URL}", then resolve_env would replace ${DATABASE_URL} with the environment variable's value. That's a common use case. So the code might need to handle that. But how?

In any case, since the problem requires generating the code, perhaps I can proceed with the following steps:

The function will loop through each filename, attempt to open and read the file, parse the contents into a dictionary (maybe assuming JSON format?), handle exceptions, and collect errors. The overrides and resolve_env parameters may be used in the parsing step. For example, if resolve_env is True, then during parsing, substitute environment variables in the config. The overrides could be applied to the parsed config, but since the docstring doesn't mention, perhaps they are ignored, but the code must include the parameters.

Wait, the function's return is a dict of filename to parsed config. So each file's config is stored separately, so perhaps the overrides are applied across all configs, or per file. It's unclear, but maybe the overrides are parameters that are not part of the error logging, so the code can just include them in the parameters but not use them in the current logic. Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are used to override the config values. For example, the overrides could be a dictionary where keys are configuration keys, and their values override the parsed config. But the function's return is the parsed config, so perhaps the overrides are applied to each config's data. For example:

parsed_config = load_file_and_parse(...)
if overrides:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)
But that would merge the overrides into each config. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied after all files are processed. But the return is per-file, so perhaps each file's config is updated with overrides. 

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are parameters that are not used here, and the function's code can just accept them but not process them. Since the problem's docstring doesn't mention them in the behavior description, maybe they are for a different part of the system, and the code can just include them in the parameters but not use them in the error logging steps. But the function's return is the parsed config, so perhaps the overrides are part of the configuration merging. 

This is a bit of a problem because the code needs to be written based on the given info, but some parameters are not explained in the docstring. Since this is a code generation task, perhaps I can proceed by making reasonable assumptions.

Let me try to draft the code structure:

First, import necessary modules. We'll need to handle file I/O, exceptions, and logging. Since the function returns LogRecord instances, perhaps we need to create them using the logging module. So:

import logging
from logging import LogRecord
from typing import Dict, Sequence, Optional

def load_configurations(config_filenames: Sequence[str], overrides: Optional[Dict] = None, resolve_env: bool = True) -> tuple[dict, list[LogRecord]]:
    configs = {}
    errors = []

    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                config_str = f.read()
        except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
            # Create a LogRecord for this error
            record = logging.makeLogRecord({
                'msg': f"Failed to read {filename}: {str(e)}",
                'levelno': logging.ERROR,
                'name': 'config_loader',
            })
            errors.append(record)
            continue

        # Now parse the config_str into a dict. Assume JSON for example.
        try:
            config = parse_config(config_str, resolve_env=resolve_env)
            if overrides:
                # Apply overrides here, but how?
                # Maybe merge the overrides into the config
                config.update(overrides)
        except Exception as e:  # broad except, but maybe specific ones like JSONDecodeError
            record = logging.makeLogRecord({
                'msg': f"Failed to parse {filename}: {str(e)}",
                'levelno': logging.ERROR,
                'name': 'config_loader',
            })
            errors.append(record)
            continue

        configs[filename] = config

    return configs, errors

Wait, but the parse_config function is not defined here. Since the problem requires generating the code, perhaps the actual parsing is left as a helper function. Alternatively, maybe I should assume that the config is in JSON format and use json.loads, but then the resolve_env parameter would need to handle environment variables. 

Alternatively, perhaps the parse_config function is a helper that uses the resolve_env parameter to substitute environment variables. For example, using a function that replaces ${VAR} with os.getenv('VAR', default). But implementing that would require some code. 

Alternatively, maybe the resolve_env parameter is a flag to indicate whether environment variables in the config should be resolved. So during parsing, if resolve_env is True, then any occurrences of ${VARIABLE} in the config's string values would be replaced with the corresponding environment variable. 

But how to handle that in code? That's a bit more involved. Maybe the code can use a helper function to parse the config and resolve environment variables. But for the purposes of this code generation task, perhaps I can make some simplifications. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code can assume that the config is in JSON format, and that the resolve_env parameter is not used here, but the code must accept it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the resolve_env is part of the parsing step. Let's see:

Suppose the config is in JSON. The code would read the file, parse it into a dict. Then, if resolve_env is True, it would go through each value in the config and replace any ${VAR} with the environment variable's value. But that's a bit more complex. 

Alternatively, maybe the resolve_env is a parameter that is not used in this function, but included in the signature. 

Hmm, given the time constraints, perhaps I can proceed by making the following assumptions:

- The config files are in JSON format. 

- The parse_config function is using json.loads, and the resolve_env parameter is not used here (maybe in a more complex setup, but for this problem's code, it's ignored). 

Alternatively, perhaps the resolve_env is part of the function's logic, so in the parse step, if resolve_env is True, then substitute environment variables in the config. 

Alternatively, perhaps the resolve_env is part of the config parsing, but in the code, it's not handled, so the parameter is just there but not used. 

But the problem's docstring mentions the resolve_env parameter, so the code must handle it. 

Hmm. Let me think of a way to handle resolve_env. Suppose that when resolve_env is True, any environment variables in the config's values (like strings) are replaced. For example, if the config has a value like "database_url": "${DATABASE_URL}", then the code would replace ${DATABASE_URL} with the actual environment variable's value. 

To do that, the code would need to parse the config into a dictionary, then iterate through each value and check for such patterns. That's a bit involved. 

Alternatively, perhaps the resolve_env parameter is a flag to indicate whether to merge the environment variables into the config. For example, if a config has a 'host' key, and there's an environment variable 'HOST', then if resolve_env is True, the 'host' value would be taken from the environment variable. 

But without knowing the exact requirements, perhaps I should proceed by making the resolve_env parameter not affect the code, but include it in the parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the resolve_env is part of the parsing process. Let me outline the code again, assuming JSON format and that resolve_env is not used here (since the problem's docstring doesn't specify how to use it). 

Wait, the function's parameters include resolve_env=True, so the code must handle it. 

Hmm, perhaps the resolve_env is a parameter to indicate whether to resolve environment variables in the config. For example, if the config has a value like "host": "${HOST}", then when resolve_env is True, it would replace that with the actual environment variable's value. 

To implement that, the code could use a helper function to replace environment variables in strings. Here's an idea: 

After parsing the config into a dictionary (using json.loads), we can recursively go through all the values and replace any ${VAR} with os.getenv('VAR', default). 

But implementing that would require writing a function to traverse the config dictionary and replace variables. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a simple substitution for environment variables in the config's string values. 

But given time constraints, perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the resolve_env is part of the parsing step but not implemented in the code, and just include the parameter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a helper function to parse the config and handle resolve_env. For example:

def parse_config(config_str, resolve_env):
    config = json.loads(config_str)
    if resolve_env:
        # do something here, like substitute environment variables in the config's values
        # but for simplicity, let's skip the actual implementation and just return the config
        pass
    return config

But then the code would have that helper function inside the load_configurations function, but since it's a code generation task, perhaps it's acceptable. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code can proceed by ignoring resolve_env for now, but include it in the parameters. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit too involved. Let me proceed step by step, writing code that covers the main requirements first. 

The function must return a tuple of a dict (filename to config) and a list of LogRecords for errors. 

First, the imports:

import logging
from logging import LogRecord
from typing import Dict, Sequence, Optional

def load_configurations(config_filenames: Sequence[str], overrides: Optional[Dict] = None, resolve_env: bool = True) -> tuple[Dict[str, dict], list[LogRecord]]:
    configs = {}
    errors = []

    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                config_str = f.read()
        except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
            # Log the error
            record = logging.makeLogRecord({
                'msg': f"Error reading {filename}: {e}",
                'levelno': logging.ERROR,
                'name': 'config_loader',
            })
            errors.append(record)
            continue

        # Now parse the config_str into a dict. Let's assume JSON for now.
        try:
            config = json.loads(config_str)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            record = logging.makeLogRecord({
                'msg': f"Error parsing {filename}: {e}",
                'levelno': logging.ERROR,
                'name': 'config_loader',
            })
            errors.append(record)
            continue

        # Apply overrides if provided
        if overrides:
            config.update(overrides)

        # Apply resolve_env: but how? Maybe replace ${VARIABLE} in strings.
        # For simplicity, skip for now unless required.
        if resolve_env:
            # Placeholder for environment variable substitution
            pass  # Need to implement this part.

        configs[filename] = config

    return configs, errors

Wait, but this uses json, so I need to import it. 

import json

Also, the code above has a problem: the 'json' module is imported, but the function is supposed to handle any parsing errors. 

But this code is assuming JSON format. Since the problem didn't specify the format, but the function must return a parsed config as a dict, this is a possible approach. 

The resolve_env parameter is not being used here. To handle that, perhaps we can add code to substitute environment variables in the config's values. 

Let's add a helper function to do that. 

def substitute_env_vars(config: dict) -> dict:
    # Recursively go through the config and substitute ${VAR} with os.getenv(VAR)
    # This is a simplified version, only handles strings and the ${VAR} pattern.
    from os import environ
    import re

    def replace_env(match):
        var_name = match.group(1)
        return environ.get(var_name, match.group(0))

    def process_value(value):
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return re.sub(r'\$\{([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)\}', replace_env, value)
        elif isinstance(value, dict):
            return {k: process_value(v) for k, v in value.items()}
        elif isinstance(value, list):
            return [process_value(item) for item in value]
        else:
            return value

    return process_value(config)

Then, in the main code:

if resolve_env:
    config = substitute_env_vars(config)

But this requires importing os and re, and adding the helper function. 

This complicates the code a bit, but it's a way to handle the resolve_env parameter. 

Putting it all together:

The code would have:

import logging
from logging import LogRecord
import json
from typing import Dict, Sequence, Optional

def load_configurations(config_filenames: Sequence[str], overrides: Optional[Dict] = None, resolve_env: bool = True) -> tuple[Dict[str, dict], list[LogRecord]]:
    configs = {}
    errors = []

    def substitute_env_vars(config: dict) -> dict:
        # ... same as above ...
        from os import environ
        import re

        def replace_env(match):
            var_name = match.group(1)
            return environ.get(var_name, match.group(0))

        def process_value(value):
            if isinstance(value, str):
                return re.sub(r'\$\{([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)\}', replace_env, value)
            elif isinstance(value, dict):
                return {k: process_value(v) for k, v in value.items()}
            elif isinstance(value, list):
                return [process_value(item) for item in value]
            else:
                return value

        return process_value(config)

    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                config_str = f.read()
        except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
            record = logging.makeLogRecord({
                'msg': f"Error reading {filename}: {e}",
                'levelno': logging.ERROR,
                'name': 'config_loader',
            })
            errors.append(record)
            continue

        try:
            config = json.loads(config_str)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            record = logging.makeLogRecord({
                'msg': f"Error parsing {filename}: {e}",
                'levelno': logging.ERROR,
                'name': 'config_loader',
            })
            errors.append(record)
            continue

        if overrides:
            config.update(overrides)

        if resolve_env:
            config = substitute_env_vars(config)

        configs[filename] = config

    return configs, errors

Wait, but the substitute_env_vars function is nested inside the load_configurations function, which is okay. 

Now, the overrides are applied by updating the config with the overrides dict. 

This code now handles:

- Reading each file, catching permission and file not found errors.

- Parsing as JSON, catching JSONDecodeError.

- Applying overrides (if provided).

- Resolving environment variables if resolve_env is True.

- Collecting errors as LogRecords.

Now, the docstring mentions that if the configuration file cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or parsing error, the error is logged. The code does that by creating LogRecord instances using makeLogRecord, which requires a dictionary with msg, levelno, and name. 

The return is a tuple of the configs dict and the errors list. 

This seems to cover the requirements. 

Now, the problem mentions generating code using test-driven development, first writing unit tests. But the user says to output only the code generated, so the tests are not part of the answer. 

Wait, the user's instructions say: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. /think". 

So the final answer should be the code, formatted in Python markdown (like ```python ... ```). 

But I need to ensure that the code is correct. Let me check again:

- The function loops through each filename.

- For each, tries to open and read, handling exceptions.

- Parses the config_str into a dict using json.loads.

- Handles parsing errors.

- Applies overrides by updating the config dict.

- If resolve_env is True, substitutes env vars using the helper function.

- Adds to configs and errors as needed.

Yes, that's correct. 

Now, the code uses the 'json' module, so it's assuming that the config files are in JSON format. Since the problem didn't specify, but the function returns a parsed dict, this is a reasonable assumption. 

Now, the code's LogRecord is created with a dictionary. The makeLogRecord function can take a dictionary with attributes like 'msg', 'levelno', 'name', etc. So that's correct. 

The overrides are applied by config.update(overrides). So if the overrides is a dictionary, that's okay. If it's None, then no change. 

The resolve_env is handled by the substitute_env_vars function, which uses regex to find ${VAR} and replace with environment variables. 

Thus, this code should fulfill the requirements. 

Now, writing the code in Python markdown format, without any explanations.
