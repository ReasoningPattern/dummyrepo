Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called ttl_cache based on the given function signature and docstring. The goal is to wrap a function with a memoizer that uses LRU with a maxsize and each entry has a TTL. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, the decorator needs to accept parameters: maxsize, ttl, timer, and typed. The default timer is time.monotonic, which is good because it's monotonic and not affected by system time changes. The typed parameter probably means that different argument types (like 1 vs 1.0) are considered different keys if typed is True.

The challenge is to manage the cache entries with both LRU and TTL. Each entry should have a timestamp so that when it's accessed, we can check if it's expired. The LRU part requires tracking the order of accesses, so maybe using an OrderedDict? Or a linked list? But in Python, using a collections.OrderedDict could be helpful here.

Wait, the standard lru_cache uses a dictionary and an order tracking structure. For the TTL part, each entry in the cache will need to store the result and the time it was stored. So the cache can be a dictionary where each key maps to a (value, expiration_time) pair. The expiration_time would be the current time plus the TTL.

But then, when someone accesses the function, we need to check if the entry is still valid. Also, when the cache reaches maxsize, we need to remove the oldest entry that hasn't expired yet. Wait, but how do we efficiently find the oldest entry that's still valid? Or maybe when the maxsize is reached, we evict the least recently used entry regardless of its TTL, but before adding the new entry, we have to check if the entry is still valid. Hmm, maybe the steps are:

1. When the function is called, check if the arguments are in the cache.
2. If they are, check if the stored time plus TTL is still within the current time. If not, remove the entry and proceed as a miss.
3. If it's still valid, return the stored value and move it to the front of the LRU (so that it's marked as recently used).
4. If it's a miss, compute the result, store it with the current time, and add to the cache.
5. If the cache exceeds maxsize, remove the oldest entry (LRU), but before removing, check if it's expired. If it's expired, just remove it. Otherwise, check if it's expired and if not, maybe we shouldn't evict it yet? Wait, no, because the maxsize is the maximum number of entries allowed. So even if an entry is still valid, once the cache is full, we have to evict the LRU entry, even if it's not expired. So the TTL is per-item, but the LRU is the main eviction policy once maxsize is hit.

So, the structure of the cache would be an OrderedDict or a similar structure to track the order of insertion/access. Each entry in the cache would have a key (the function arguments), and the value would be (result, expiration_time).

Now, how to implement the decorator. The decorator function will take the parameters and return a wrapper function that manages the cache.

Wait, the standard approach for decorators with parameters is to have a factory function. So the ttl_cache function is the decorator factory. So the signature is def ttl_cache(...), and it returns a decorator that can be applied to a function.

The steps for the decorator:

The actual decorator (returned by ttl_cache) will wrap the function. Let's think of the structure:

def ttl_cache(maxsize=128, ttl=600, timer=time.monotonic, typed=False):
    def decorating_function(user_function):
        # create the cache here
        # maybe using a class to hold the cache and other state?
        # or use a closure
        # need to track the cache (with LRU and TTL)
        # perhaps using an OrderedDict for the LRU order, and a dictionary for the entries?
        # Or combine both into an ordered dict where the keys are the function's args, and the values are (result, expiration_time)
        # but then the order in the ordered dict would track the access order.
        # So, the cache is an OrderedDict where each entry is (key: tuple of args, value: (result, expiration_time))
        # Also, when accessing, we need to check the expiration and evict expired entries before proceeding.

        # Maybe the steps are:
        # 1. When the decorated function is called, process the arguments into a key (considering 'typed' parameter)
        # 2. Check if the key is in the cache.
        # 3. If present, check if the expiration time is in the future (using the timer). If expired, remove the entry.
        # 4. If not expired, return the stored value, and move the entry to the end of the ordered dict (to mark as recently used)
        # 5. If not in cache or expired, compute the result, store it with the current time + ttl, add to the cache.
        # 6. If the cache exceeds maxsize, remove the first entry in the ordered dict (the least recently used)
        #    but before removing, check if it's expired? Or just remove it regardless?
        #    Since when we access the cache, we first check for expired entries, but when evicting due to size, maybe we have to remove it even if it's still valid.

        # Also, handling the 'typed' parameter: if True, the argument's type is part of the key. So, for example, 1 and 1.0 would be different keys.
        # To handle that, when building the key, we can include the type of each argument and the value.

        # So the key is built by converting each argument to a tuple that includes the type and the value. So for a positional argument, like (1, 'a'), the key would be (type(1), 1, type('a'), 'a')? Or maybe for each argument, (type(arg), arg), then combined into a tuple.

        # So for the key creation:

        def make_key(*args, **kwargs):
            key_args = args
            if typed:
                key_args = [(type(arg), arg) for arg in args]
            key_kwargs = [(k, type(v), v) for k, v in kwargs.items()]
            return (tuple(key_args), tuple(sorted(key_kwargs)))

        # Wait, but the order of the keyword arguments needs to be consistent, so sorted by key name. Also, the **kwargs part needs to be handled properly.

        # Anyway, the key building part is important. The 'typed' parameter requires that the type of each argument is part of the key.

        # Now, the actual function:

        # Let's define the wrapper function:

        class TTLCache:

            def __init__(self, maxsize, ttl, timer, make_key):
                self.cache = OrderedDict()
                self.ttl = ttl
                self.timer = timer
                self.maxsize = maxsize
                self.make_key = make_key

            def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                # Build the key
                key = self.make_key(*args, **kwargs)
                now = self.timer()
                # Check if the key is in the cache
                if key in self.cache:
                    # Get the entry (value, expire_time)
                    value, expire_time = self.cache[key]
                    if expire_time > now:
                        # Valid, so move to end (mark as recently used)
                        del self.cache[key]
                        self.cache[key] = (value, expire_time)
                        return value
                    else:
                        # Expired, remove it
                        del self.cache[key]
                # Compute the result
                result = user_function(*args, **kwargs)
                expire_time = now + self.ttl
                self.cache[key] = (result, expire_time)
                # If over maxsize, remove the first item
                if len(self.cache) > self.maxsize:
                    self.cache.popitem(last=False)
                return result

        # Wait, but using an OrderedDict, when you delete and re-add, it moves the key to the end. So when we find a valid entry, deleting and re-adding would place it at the end. Wait, in the code above, when the key is found, and it's valid, we delete it and re-insert it. That way, it's moved to the end of the ordered dict. But maybe that's necessary to maintain the LRU order.

        # Alternatively, when you access a valid entry, you can just move it to the end. Like, self.cache.move_to_end(key). But the problem is that in an OrderedDict, you can do that. So perhaps:

        # When checking the key:
        if key in self.cache:
            value, expire_time = self.cache[key]
            if expire_time > now:
                # move to end
                self.cache.move_to_end(key)
                return value
            else:
                del self.cache[key]

        # That would be more efficient, as you don't have to delete and re-add. So maybe that's better.

        # Also, the make_key function needs to be correctly implemented.

        # So putting this together, perhaps the decorator uses a class to hold the state (cache, maxsize, etc), and the __call__ method is the wrapper.

        # Alternatively, using a closure without a class. Let's see.

        # Let me try to structure this as a decorator:

        # The decorating function (user_function is the function to be decorated)
        # So inside decorating_function:

        # Create the cache as an OrderedDict, and variables for the parameters.

        # So here's an attempt:

        # First, the key creation:

        def make_key(*args, **kwargs):
            key_parts = []
            # handle args
            if typed:
                key_parts.extend( (type(arg), arg) for arg in args )
            else:
                key_parts.extend( arg for arg in args )
            # handle kwargs
            sorted_items = sorted(kwargs.items())
            for k, v in sorted_items:
                if typed:
                    key_parts.append( (k, type(v), v) )
                else:
                    key_parts.append( (k, v) )
            return tuple(key_parts)

        # Wait, maybe that's a better way. For args, each element is either (type, value) or just the value. For keyword args, each is a tuple (key, (type, value) or (key, value)). But the key must be hashable, so tuples are okay.

        # Now, the actual wrapper function:

        cache = OrderedDict()
        expire_time = 0
        # Wait, perhaps better to have a closure with these variables.

        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # compute the key
            key = make_key(*args, **kwargs)
            now = timer()
            # Check if key is in cache
            if key in cache:
                value, et = cache[key]
                if et > now:
                    # move to end to mark as recently used
                    del cache[key]
                    cache[key] = (value, et)
                    return value
                else:
                    # expired, remove
                    del cache[key]
            # compute the result
            res = user_function(*args, **kwargs)
            # store it
            et = now + ttl
            cache[key] = (res, et)
            # check size
            if len(cache) > maxsize:
                # pop the first item (oldest)
                cache.popitem(last=False)
            return res

        return wrapper

        # Wait, but this is inside the decorating_function. So variables like timer, maxsize, ttl, typed are in the closure. Wait, but the parameters to the decorator are fixed when the decorator is applied. So yes.

        # But using an OrderedDict in the closure may be okay. But what about concurrency? The problem is that the decorator is not thread-safe. But the user might not care, or the docstring doesn't mention thread-safety, so perhaps it's acceptable.

        # Now, the problem is that the make_key function is defined inside the decorating_function, using the 'typed' parameter. So in the code above, the 'typed' parameter is part of the closure. So the make_key function would correctly use the typed parameter.

        # So putting it all together, the ttl_cache function would return the wrapper function.

        # Wait, but in the code above, the 'make_key' function is defined inside the decorating_function, so it has access to the 'typed' parameter from the outer scope (the parameters passed to the ttl_cache).

        # So that should work.

        # Now, let's see if there are any issues.

        # One potential problem is that when the cache is pruned because it's too big, the oldest entry (first in the ordered dict) is popped. But when you delete an entry (like when it's expired), that doesn't affect the order of the other entries. The ordered dict's order is maintained as per insertion and move operations.

        # Also, the key for the cache is built correctly. For example, if two calls have the same args but different types when typed is True, they are treated as separate keys.

        # Now, the timer is passed in, defaulting to time.monotonic. That's correct.

        # Now, what about the case where the TTL is 0? Then entries are immediately expired, so the cache is effectively disabled. But the code would handle that since et = now + 0, so et is now, so the entry is considered expired immediately. So the next call would recompute. So that's okay.

        # Another edge case: maxsize=0? Then the cache is disabled. But the code would check len(cache) >0, so after storing the entry, it would immediately remove it. So the result is not cached. So that's okay.

        # Now, the code structure. The decorating function (the one returned by ttl_cache) would return the wrapper function, which has access to the parameters (maxsize, ttl, timer, typed) and the cache.

        # So putting it all together, the code would look like this:

Wait, but I need to structure this properly. Let me try to write the code step by step.

First, the ttl_cache function is the decorator factory. It takes the parameters and returns the decorating function, which in turn returns the wrapper.

The code would be something like:

import functools
import time
from collections import OrderedDict

def ttl_cache(maxsize=128, ttl=600, timer=time.monotonic, typed=False):
    def decorating_function(user_function):
        cache = OrderedDict()  # key: (result, expiration_time)
        # Need to capture the parameters
        # Also, the key making function
        def make_key(*args, **kw):
            # code to create the key based on 'typed' parameter
            key_parts = []
            # handle args
            if typed:
                for a in args:
                    key_parts.append( (type(a), a) )
            else:
                key_parts.extend( args )
            # handle keyword arguments
            sorted_items = sorted(kw.items())
            for k, v in sorted_items:
                if typed:
                    key_parts.append( (k, type(v), v) )
                else:
                    key_parts.append( (k, v) )
            return tuple(key_parts)
        @functools.wraps(user_function)
        def wrapper(*args, **kw):
            key = make_key(*args, **kw)
            now = timer()
            # Check the cache
            if key in cache:
                value, expire_time = cache[key]
                if expire_time > now:
                    # move to end to mark as recently used
                    # since it's in an OrderedDict, we can move_to_end
                    cache.move_to_end(key)
                    return value
                else:
                    # expired, remove it
                    del cache[key]
            # compute the result
            result = user_function(*args, **kw)
            expire_time = now + ttl
            cache[key] = (result, expire_time)
            # Check size
            if len(cache) > maxsize:
                # remove the first item (oldest)
                cache.popitem(last=False)
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorating_function

Wait, but in the code above, the 'cache' variable is inside the decorating_function, so each call to the decorator (i.e., each function decorated with @ttl_cache) will have its own cache. That's correct.

Also, the 'make_key' function is defined inside the decorating_function, so it has access to the 'typed' parameter. That's good.

Wait, but in the 'make_key' function, for the positional arguments, when typed is False, the key_parts are just the args themselves. But tuples can't be part of a hash if the arguments are unhashable. Wait, but the key must be hashable. So if the function's arguments include unhashable types like lists or dicts, then they can't be part of the key. So the user must ensure that the function's arguments are hashable. That's a common issue with memoization, so it's probably acceptable as per the standard lru_cache's behavior.

Another thing: when handling the keyword arguments, they are sorted by key, so that the same parameters in different orders are considered the same key. That's correct.

Now, testing this code. Let's think of unit tests. Since the user said to use test-driven development, first write the tests before writing the code.

But the user wants me to generate the code, so I need to proceed.

Wait, but in the code above, when checking the key in the cache, after getting the value and expire_time, the code uses cache.move_to_end(key). Because in the OrderedDict, move_to_end moves the key to the end, which marks it as the most recently used. That's better than deleting and re-adding, which is O(1) as well, but using move_to_end is more efficient and correct.

Yes, so that's a better approach.

Another point: the 'timer' is passed as a parameter, so the user can use a different timer if needed, like time.time() or a mock for testing.

Also, the 'typed' parameter is handled correctly in the key creation.

Wait, let me check the key creation again. For the positional args:

If typed is True, each argument is represented as (type(a), a). So for example, 1 and 1.0 would be different, since their types are int vs float.

For the keyword arguments, each (k, v) pair is sorted by key. For each value v, if typed is True, then (type(v), v) is part of the key. So for a keyword argument 'x' with value 5, the entry would be (k, type(v), v), which would distinguish between 5 (int) and 5.0 (float).

So that's correct.

Now, the code uses functools.wraps to preserve the function's name and docstring. That's important for usability.

Now, possible issues:

- The cache is an OrderedDict, but when you delete a key, the order is maintained for the remaining keys. The move_to_end is correct.

- The 'maxsize' check: when adding a new entry, if the length exceeds maxsize, we pop the first item (the oldest), which is correct for LRU.

- The expiration is checked before returning the value. So even if the entry is in the cache, but expired, it's removed and the function is called again.

Now, possible edge cases:

Test case 1: a function with a small maxsize and TTL. Call it multiple times with the same arguments, and check that the result is cached until TTL expires.

Test case 2: different arguments (even with same values but different types when typed=True) should have separate entries.

Test case 3: when maxsize is 0, no caching happens.

Test case 4: when an entry is accessed just after its TTL, it's expired and recomputed.

Test case 5: when the cache reaches maxsize, the oldest entry (LRU) is evicted even if it's not expired.

But since the user wants the code, I need to write it correctly.

Another thing: in the code above, when the key is present but expired, we delete it, and proceed to compute the new result. So the new result is stored with a new expiration time.

Wait, what about when the cache is full, and we have to evict an entry? The code checks if the length exceeds maxsize after adding the new entry. So when adding the new entry, if the length is over, then we pop the first item. The first item is the oldest in the LRU order, which may or may not be expired. But since when we check the cache entries, expired ones are automatically removed when accessed. However, when the cache is full, the eviction is based purely on LRU, regardless of the expiration time.

That's correct because the LRU is the eviction policy, and the TTL is a separate per-item expiration.

Another point: the 'now' is captured at the time of the function call, so the expiration is based on that.

Now, the code structure. The code uses the functools.wraps to preserve the function's metadata. The 'cache' is stored in the closure of the wrapper function. That should work.

Wait, in the code I wrote earlier, the 'cache' is inside the decorating_function, which is correct because each decorated function will have its own cache.

Wait, the code is:

def decorating_function(user_function):
    cache = ...  # this is a new cache for each decorated function
    def wrapper(...):
        ...
    return wrapper

So yes, each function decorated with @ttl_cache will have its own cache. That's correct.

Now, what about the parameters? For example, if the user specifies a different timer, like timer=time.time, that's okay.

Now, let me check for possible bugs.

In the 'make_key' function:

For positional arguments when typed is False:

key_parts.extend( args ) → but args is a tuple of the arguments. So for example, if args is (1, 2), then key_parts becomes [1,2]. So the key is ( (1,2), ... ), but the key for the cache is a tuple of (tuple of args parts, tuple of sorted kw parts).

Wait, in the code above, the key_parts is built as a list, and then the key is the tuple(key_parts). Wait no, looking back:

Wait in the code I wrote for make_key:

key_parts = []
for a in args:
    if typed:
        append (type(a), a)
    else:
        append a
then for the keyword args:
for each (k, v):
    if typed:
        append (k, type(v), v)
    else:
        append (k, v)
then the key is tuple( key_parts )

Wait, no. Wait, the code I had in the make_key function was:

key_parts = []
for a in args:
    if typed:
        key_parts.append( (type(a), a) )
    else:
        key_parts.extend( args ) → Wait, no, that's a mistake.

Wait, in the code above, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-express that.

Original code (the part for the args):

if typed:
    for a in args:
        key_parts.append( (type(a), a) )
else:
    key_parts.extend( args )

Wait, that's incorrect. The 'else' clause is at the same level as the 'for' loop, but that would only run once. Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Original code (my mistake):

def make_key(*args, **kw):
    key_parts = []
    if typed:
        for a in args:
            key_parts.append( (type(a), a) )
    else:
        key_parts.extend( args )  # this is a problem because this is outside the for loop
    # similarly for the keyword args

Wait, no, that's wrong. Because if 'typed' is False, then for the args, we need to add each element of the args as is (since they are hashable). But the code above, in the else clause, would do key_parts.extend( args ), which would work for the else case, but in the case of 'typed' being False, the loop is skipped, and the else is executed. So that's okay. Wait, for example, if args is (1, 2), then when typed is False, the else clause runs once, and adds 1 and 2 to key_parts. So that's correct.

Wait, but the code for the args part is:

if typed:
    for a in args:
        append (type(a), a)
else:
    key_parts.extend( args )

Yes, that's correct. So for the args part, when typed is False, the key_parts will have the args as a list of the arguments themselves, not wrapped in tuples.

For the keyword arguments part:

sorted_items = sorted(kw.items())
for k, v in sorted_items:
    if typed:
        key_parts.append( (k, type(v), v) )
    else:
        key_parts.append( (k, v) )

Yes, that's correct. So the key for the keyword arguments is a tuple of ( (k1, v1), (k2, v2), ... ), sorted by key name. So the order is consistent regardless of how the keyword arguments were passed.

Thus, the key is properly formed.

Now, the code seems correct. Let me think of possible typos or errors.

In the code:

def make_key(*args, **kw):

Wait, the parameter is **kw, so the function uses kw.items().

Yes.

Another point: in the code for the 'cache', when you do cache[key] = (result, expire_time), the expire_time is now + ttl. So if the TTL is 600, that's correct.

The 'now' is obtained via the timer() function, which could be time.monotonic.

Now, the code uses:

cache.move_to_end(key)

Which is a method of the OrderedDict. So that's correct.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, the user's function signature mentions the parameters maxsize, ttl, timer, and typed. The code includes all of them.

The docstring says the decorator saves up to maxsize results based on LRU with per-item TTL. That's what the code does.

Thus, the code should be correct.
