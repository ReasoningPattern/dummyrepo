Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method _create_converter based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to return an instance of _converting._Converter. But first, the user mentioned using test-driven development, so I should start by writing unit tests.

Hmm, the function is part of a class, so the tests should be in a TestCase class. Let's think about what the tests need to check. The main thing is that when _create_converter is called, it returns an instance of _Converter. But how do I test that without knowing the implementation details?

Wait, maybe the test would mock the _Converter class to see if it's instantiated correctly. Or perhaps the test just checks the type of the return value. Since the actual creation process isn't specified, maybe the test is straightforward.

So the test case could be something like:

def test_create_converter_returns_converter(self):
    converter = self.instance._create_converter()
    assert isinstance(converter, _converting._Converter)

But how do I set up the instance? The test would need to create an instance of the class that contains _create_converter. Let's assume that the class under test is called SomeClass, but since the actual class name isn't given, maybe I can use a placeholder.

Alternatively, perhaps the test is part of a unittest.TestCase subclass, and the test method would create an instance of the class being tested, then call the method and check the return type.

Wait, but the function is part of a class. So in the test, the test case would have to create an instance of that class first. Let me think of the structure:

The test class would be something like TestCreateConverter(unittest.TestCase). Then, in the setUp method, create an instance of the class that has the _create_converter method. Then, the test method would call that method and check the return type.

But since the actual code for the class isn't written yet, the test might need to use a mock or patch. Alternatively, maybe the _Converter is a known class, so the test can just check the instance.

Alternatively, perhaps the _create_converter method is supposed to return a new instance each time, or maybe it's a singleton. The docstring doesn't specify, so I'll assume it returns a new instance each call.

So the test would look like:

from unittest import TestCase
from your_module import YourClass, _converting  # Adjust the imports as needed

class TestYourClass(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.instance = YourClass()

    def test_create_converter_returns_converter_instance(self):
        converter = self.instance._create_converter()
        self.assertIsInstance(converter, _converting._Converter)

But the exact imports depend on the module structure, which isn't specified here. Maybe the _converting module is part of the same package, so the test can import it.

Now, moving on to the actual code. The method _create_converter needs to return an instance of _Converter. The simplest implementation would be to instantiate _Converter and return it. But maybe there's some configuration needed. Since the docstring doesn't specify any parameters or special setup, the code can be as simple as:

def _create_converter(self) -> _converting._Converter:
    return _converting._Converter()

But wait, maybe the _Converter has an __init__ method that requires parameters? The docstring doesn't mention that. Since the return type is specified, the code has to create an instance correctly. Assuming that _Converter can be instantiated without arguments, that's the code.

Alternatively, maybe the _Converter is a class that needs to be initialized with some parameters from the instance's attributes. But without more info, the simplest code is to just return a new instance.

So putting it all together, the code for the method is straightforward. The tests would ensure that it does so correctly.

Wait, but in the test, how do we know that the _Converter is being called correctly? If the test is written before the code, then when you run the tests, they should fail until the code is written. The test would check that the returned object is an instance of _Converter, so the code needs to return that.

So the final code for the method is just returning a new _Converter instance. That's probably all that's needed here.
