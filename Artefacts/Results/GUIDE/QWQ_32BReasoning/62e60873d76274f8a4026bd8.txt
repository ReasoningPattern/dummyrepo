Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is called protocol_handlers and it's a class method. It should return a dictionary of Bolt protocol handlers, keyed by version tuples. If a specific protocol_version is provided, the dictionary should have either zero or one items, depending on whether that version is supported. If no version is given, return all available versions. Also, it must raise a TypeError if the protocol_version isn't a tuple.

First, I need to think about how this function would be structured. The function is part of a class, so maybe the actual handlers are stored as class attributes or in some internal structure. Since the problem doesn't specify where the handlers are stored, I might have to make an assumption here. Let's say there's a class-level dictionary called _handlers that maps version tuples to handler classes. The function would then access this dictionary.

Now, the function's logic: if protocol_version is None, return a copy of the entire _handlers dict. If a version is provided, check if it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError. Then, filter the _handlers to see if that exact version exists. Return a dict with that version and handler, or empty dict if not present.

Wait, the docstring says to return a dict with zero or one items. So, when a version is given, the returned dict will have the version as key if supported, else empty. So, the code would check if the version is in the _handlers, and if so, return a dict with that single entry, else an empty dict.

But how do I handle the _handlers? Since this is a class method, maybe the handlers are stored as a class variable. Let me structure the code with that in mind.

Now, the unit tests. The user mentioned to use test-driven development, so first write tests before the code. But since I need to output the code, I should first think of the tests to ensure the code is correct.

Possible test cases:

1. Test that when no protocol_version is given, all versions are returned. For example, if _handlers has (3,4) and (4,1), the result should include both.

2. Test with a valid protocol_version, so the result is a dict with that version if present. Like, if (3,5) is in _handlers, then passing that should return the handler for it. If it's not present, returns empty dict.

3. Test with a non-tuple protocol_version, like a list or integer, should raise TypeError.

4. Edge cases: passing a tuple of the wrong length (like (3,)), but maybe the _handlers only have tuples of two elements. Not sure if that's a case to test, but the function's responsibility is just to check that the input is a tuple, regardless of length? The docstring says the parameter is a tuple, so the function must check that it's a tuple, but not necessarily the length. So, if someone passes (3,), which is a tuple, but not a version in _handlers, that's okay.

Wait, the error is raised if the protocol_version is not passed as a tuple. So, if the user passes an integer, list, or other non-tuple, it should throw TypeError. So in the code, first check if protocol_version is not None and not an instance of tuple, then raise.

Now, the actual code structure. The function is a class method, so it takes cls as the first argument. The protocol_version is optional.

So, inside the function:

- Check if protocol_version is not None and not a tuple: raise TypeError.

- If protocol_version is None: return a copy of the entire handlers dict. But why a copy? To prevent external modifications. So maybe use .copy().

- Else, create a new dict. Check if the protocol_version exists in the handlers. If so, add it to the new dict. Else, return empty.

Wait, the docstring says "the dictionary will contain either zero or one items, depending on whether that version is supported." So the returned dict will have either 0 or 1 entries. So, when a specific version is given, the returned dict is {version: handler} if present, else empty.

So the code would be something like:

handlers = getattr(cls, '_handlers', {})  # Assuming that the class has this attribute.

if protocol_version is None:
    return handlers.copy()
else:
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
    return {protocol_version: handlers[protocol_version]} if protocol_version in handlers else {}

Wait, but how is the _handlers stored? The function is part of a class, so perhaps the _handlers are stored as a class-level dictionary. So the code needs to access cls._handlers. But what if the class doesn't have that attribute? Then getattr can be used with a default, but maybe the function expects that the class has this attribute. Alternatively, perhaps the code should raise an error if _handlers isn't present, but the problem doesn't mention that. Probably, the _handlers is a class variable that the function relies on.

So perhaps the code is:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = cls._handlers  # assuming this exists
    # then proceed...

But if the class doesn't have _handlers, then this would cause an AttributeError. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps the code can proceed under the assumption that the class has this attribute. The function's responsibility is to return the handlers based on that.

So, putting it all together:

The code:

class BoltProtocol:
    _handlers = {
        (3, 4): Handler34,
        (4, 1): Handler41,
        # etc.
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        if protocol_version is not None:
            if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
                raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
            if protocol_version in cls._handlers:
                return {protocol_version: cls._handlers[protocol_version]}
            else:
                return {}
        else:
            return dict(cls._handlers)  # or copy?

Wait, but in the code, the function is supposed to return a dictionary. So when protocol_version is None, returning a copy of the handlers. Using dict(cls._handlers) creates a copy if _handlers is a dictionary. Alternatively, cls._handlers.copy().

So, the code for the function:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    [docstring as given]
    """
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
        return {protocol_version: cls._handlers[protocol_version]} if protocol_version in cls._handlers else {}
    return dict(cls._handlers)

Wait, but what if the protocol_version is a tuple not in the handlers? Then the return is an empty dict, which is correct.

Wait, but in the code above, when protocol_version is present, the code checks if it's in cls._handlers, and returns the dict accordingly. But in the code, the line uses a dictionary comprehension-like structure. Alternatively, perhaps:

    if protocol_version in cls._handlers:
        return {protocol_version: cls._handlers[protocol_version]}
    else:
        return {}

But in code, that would be written as:

    if protocol_version in cls._handlers:
        return {protocol_version: cls._handlers[protocol_version]}
    return {}

That's clearer.

Putting it all together:

The function:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
        if protocol_version in cls._handlers:
            return {protocol_version: cls._handlers[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}
    else:
        return dict(cls._handlers)

Wait, but the docstring says "return a dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all relevant and supported protocol versions". So when protocol_version is None, returning a copy of the _handlers. Using dict(cls._handlers) creates a new dictionary, so modifications to the returned dict won't affect the original, which is good.

Now, the TypeError is raised when the protocol_version is not None and not a tuple. So, for example, if someone passes a list, or an integer, that's caught.

Now, the tests. Since the user wants to use TDD, the tests should be written first. Let me think of possible test cases.

Test case 1: test that with no protocol_version, all versions are returned.

Assuming the _handlers has entries for (3,4) and (4,3), the test would check that the returned dict has both keys.

Test case 2: test a valid protocol_version returns the correct handler.

If _handlers has (3,5) mapped to a handler, then calling with (3,5) should return that.

Test case 3: invalid protocol_version (not a tuple) raises TypeError.

Test case 4: request for a protocol_version not present returns empty dict.

Test case 5: check that the function is a class method.

Wait, but how to test the class method? Maybe that's part of the code structure.

Now, the code for the tests would be something like:

import unittest

class TestProtocolHandlers(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_all_versions(self):
        class MockBoltProtocol:
            _handlers = {
                (3, 4): 'Handler34',
                (4, 1): 'Handler41'
            }
        result = MockBoltProtocol.protocol_handlers()
        self.assertEqual(result, {(3,4): 'Handler34', (4,1): 'Handler41'})

    def test_specific_version_present(self):
        class MockBoltProtocol:
            _handlers = {
                (3, 5): 'Handler35'
            }
        result = MockBoltProtocol.protocol_handlers((3,5))
        self.assertEqual(result, {(3,5): 'Handler35'})

    def test_specific_version_absent(self):
        class MockBoltProtocol:
            _handlers = {
                (4, 0): 'Handler40'
            }
        result = MockBoltProtocol.protocol_handlers((3,5))
        self.assertEqual(result, {})

    def test_invalid_protocol_version_type(self):
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            class MockBoltProtocol:
                _handlers = {}
            MockBoltProtocol.protocol_handlers("3.5")

    def test_protocol_version_list(self):
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            class MockBoltProtocol:
                _handlers = {}
            MockBoltProtocol.protocol_handlers([3,5])

These tests cover the main cases. The MockBoltProtocol is used to simulate the class with the _handlers attribute.

But in the code that I need to write, the actual function is part of a class. The tests ensure that the function behaves as expected.

Now, the code that I need to generate is just the function. The user wants only the code in Python markdown format, so the function definition inside a class.

Wait, the function is part of a class. So the code would look like:

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # implementation here

But the problem's function signature says def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), which is a class method. So the code should be written as a class method.

Putting all together, the code would be:

class BoltProtocol:
    _handlers = {
        # this would be filled with actual handler classes, but for the code's purpose, maybe it's left as a placeholder.
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        """
        Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers, keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items, depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

        :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
        :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all relevant and supported protocol versions
        :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
        """
        if protocol_version is not None:
            if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
                raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
            if protocol_version in cls._handlers:
                return {protocol_version: cls._handlers[protocol_version]}
            else:
                return {}
        else:
            return dict(cls._handlers)

Wait, but the _handlers is a class variable. The code assumes that the class has this variable. The user's problem didn't mention it, but the function's logic depends on it. So perhaps the code is written with the understanding that the class has this _handlers attribute. The code is correct as per the given function's requirements.

So that's the code. The user wants only the code, so the final answer is the code block above.
