Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method validate_fixity based on the given docstring. Let's start by understanding what the method is supposed to do. The doc says it should validate the fixity block in an inventory. So first, check the structure of the fixity block. Then ensure that only files listed in the manifest are referenced. The return is error() in the class, which probably means returning an error object or some indication of failure.

Hmm, the parameters are 'fixity' and 'manifest_files'. The fixity block structure might have certain required keys, like 'algorithm' or 'value' for each file. The method should check that each entry in fixity refers to a file that's present in the manifest_files list. 

First step: structure validation. Let's think of possible structure requirements. Maybe each entry in fixity is a dictionary with 'file_name' and 'checksum' keys? Or perhaps the fixity is a dictionary where keys are filenames and values are checksums? The exact structure isn't clear, but the method needs to ensure that each entry has the necessary fields. 

Wait, maybe the fixity is a list of dictionaries, each containing the file name and its checksum. So for each entry in fixity, check that it has the required keys. Let's assume required keys are 'file_name' and 'checksum' or similar. 

Then, the second part is ensuring that all the files in the fixity are present in the manifest_files. So, for each file in fixity's entries, check that its filename is in the manifest_files list. 

The method should return an error if any of these checks fail. Since the method is part of a class, maybe the error() function is a method in the same class that returns an error message or raises an exception. 

Now, for the unit tests. Since we need to follow TDD, first write the tests. Let me think of test cases:

Test 1: Valid fixity structure and all files in manifest. Should pass, return no error?

Wait, the method's return is to return error(), so perhaps it returns an error object if there's an issue, or None if it's okay? Or maybe it's supposed to raise an error? The doc says "Return error() in the class", so maybe when there's an error, it calls self.error() with a message and returns that. 

So, in the tests, we can have cases where:

- Fixity is missing a required key (like 'checksum'), so the structure check fails.

- A file in fixity is not in the manifest_files list.

- Everything is correct, so no error is returned.

So the tests would check these scenarios. 

Now, the code. The method would loop through each entry in fixity. For each entry, check that it has the necessary keys. Then check that the file name is in manifest_files. 

Wait, what's the structure of fixity? Since the parameters are 'fixity' and 'manifest_files', perhaps fixity is a list of dictionaries. So each entry in the fixity list must have a 'file_name' key. 

Alternatively, maybe the fixity is a dictionary where the keys are filenames and the values are checksums. Then the structure check would verify that each key in the fixity dict is present in the manifest_files. 

The problem is the exact structure isn't specified, but given the method's name and the problem description, I have to make some assumptions. Let's assume that fixity is a list of dictionaries, each with 'file_name' and 'checksum' keys. 

So steps in the method:

1. Iterate over each entry in fixity:
   a. Check if each entry has the required keys. If any entry is missing a key, return an error.
   b. Check that the 'file_name' of the entry is in the manifest_files list. If not, return an error.

The method would need to return an error if any of these checks fail. 

Now, for the error() method, since it's part of the class, perhaps the method is something like self.error("message") which constructs an error object or raises an exception. But since the method is supposed to return the error, maybe it just returns that error object. 

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to raise an exception, but the doc says "return error()", so likely returning an error object. 

Putting this together, the code would look something like this:

def validate_fixity(self, fixity, manifest_files):
    # Check each entry in fixity has required keys
    required_keys = {'file_name', 'checksum'}  # assuming these are required
    for entry in fixity:
        if not isinstance(entry, dict):
            return self.error("Fixity entry is not a dictionary")
        missing_keys = required_keys - entry.keys()
        if missing_keys:
            return self.error(f"Fixity entry missing keys: {missing_keys}")
        # Check file is in manifest
        if entry['file_name'] not in manifest_files:
            return self.error(f"File {entry['file_name']} in fixity not found in manifest")
    # If all checks passed
    return None  # or some success indicator?

Wait, but the doc says to return error() in the class. So perhaps the method returns the error object when there is an error, and maybe returns None or True otherwise. 

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think of a test case where the fixity has an entry without a required key. 

Another test case where a file in fixity is not in the manifest. 

A test case where everything is okay. 

Now, the code. But the user wants the code generated, so I have to write the method. 

Wait, but the parameters are 'fixity' and 'manifest_files'. The manifest_files is probably a list or a set of filenames. 

In the code, the method must loop through each entry in fixity. 

Potential edge cases: empty fixity list? The method might not need to check that, unless the inventory requires at least one entry. But according to the problem statement, perhaps the fixity can be empty, but each entry must be valid. 

So the code would look like that. 

Now, the code. Let's structure it:

def validate_fixity(self, fixity, manifest_files):
    """Validate fixity block in inventory. Check the structure of the fixity block and makes sure that only files listed in the manifest are referenced. Return error() in the class."""
    # Required keys for each fixity entry
    required_keys = {'file_name', 'checksum'}
    for entry in fixity:
        # Check entry is a dictionary
        if not isinstance(entry, dict):
            return self.error("Fixity entry is not a dictionary")
        # Check all required keys are present
        missing = required_keys - entry.keys()
        if missing:
            return self.error(f"Missing required keys in fixity entry: {missing}")
        # Check file is in the manifest
        if entry['file_name'] not in manifest_files:
            return self.error(f"File {entry['file_name']} in fixity not present in the manifest")
    # If all checks passed, return no error
    return None  # Or perhaps return a success code? But according to doc, return error() when there is an error, else maybe nothing?

Wait, the doc says "Return error() in the class." So perhaps the method is supposed to return an error when there's an issue, and maybe return True or some success otherwise. But the code above returns None on success, which might be acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to return an error object or raise an exception, but the exact behavior depends on the class's error method. 

Assuming that the error() method returns an error object, then returning that is correct. 

Now, the code seems okay. 

Wait, but what if the fixity is not a list? Like if it's a single entry? The method expects fixity to be an iterable (like a list). So the code assumes fixity is a list of entries. 

Another possible edge case: if manifest_files is empty, but fixity has entries. Then those entries would be invalid. 

The code should handle that. 

Now, the code is as above. 

But let me think again about the structure. The required keys could vary, but the problem didn't specify. So assuming 'file_name' and 'checksum' are required. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fixity is a dictionary where keys are filenames and the values are checksums, so the structure check would be different. 

Wait, the problem says "fixity block", which might be structured as a list of entries. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fixity is a list of tuples (filename, checksum). But then the structure check would be different. 

Hmm, this ambiguity is a problem. But given the problem statement, I have to proceed with an assumption. 

Given the method's parameters, 'fixity' is likely a list of entries, each being a dictionary with the necessary keys. 

Therefore, the code I wrote earlier is appropriate. 

Now, the user also mentioned to first write unit tests. 

But the user wants the code generated, so I need to just output the code. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to output ONLY the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code for the method, based on the above logic. 

Wait, but perhaps the error() method is part of the class, so the validate_fixity method can call self.error(). 

Thus, the code would be as written above. 

So putting it all together, the code is:

def validate_fixity(self, fixity, manifest_files):
    """Validate fixity block in inventory. Check the structure of the fixity block and makes sure that only files listed in the manifest are referenced. Return error() in the class."""
    required_keys = {'file_name', 'checksum'}
    for entry in fixity:
        if not isinstance(entry, dict):
            return self.error("Fixity entry is not a dictionary")
        missing = required_keys - entry.keys()
        if missing:
            return self.error(f"Missing required keys in fixity entry: {missing}")
        if entry['file_name'] not in manifest_files:
            return self.error(f"File {entry['file_name']} not found in the manifest")
    return None

Wait, but the manifest_files parameter is probably a list or set. Checking if a string is in a list can be O(n), but that's acceptable for the problem's scope. 

Alternatively, if manifest_files is a set, it's O(1). But the code handles it either way. 

Another thing: the error messages should be precise. 

Yes. 

This should be the code. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format. So enclosed in ```python ... ```? 

Wait, the user said "output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I think they want the code as a markdown code block with the Python syntax highlighting. 

Thus, the final answer is:

```python
def validate_fixity(self, fixity, manifest_files):
    """Validate fixity block in inventory. Check the structure of the fixity block and makes sure that only files listed in the manifest are referenced. Return error() in the class."""
    required_keys = {'file_name', 'checksum'}
    for entry in fixity:
        if not isinstance(entry, dict):
            return self.error("Fixity entry is not a dictionary")
        missing = required_keys - entry.keys()
        if missing:
            return self.error(f"Missing required keys in fixity entry: {missing}")
        if entry['file_name'] not in manifest_files:
            return self.error(f"File {entry['file_name']} not found in the manifest")
    return None
```
