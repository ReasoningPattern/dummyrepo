Okay, I need to write a Python function called _normalizeargs that takes a sequence and an optional output parameter. The docstring says it's for normalizing declaration arguments, expanding anything that's not an individual interface or implements spec. Hmm, so the function's purpose is to process the input sequence and possibly flatten it, making sure that each element is a basic interface specification rather than more complex structures like tuples or declarations.

First, I should think about what the inputs could be. The sequence could contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. The output should be a list where each element is an individual interface or implement spec. So, the function probably needs to iterate through each element in the sequence and check if it's a complex type (like a tuple or Declaration) that needs to be expanded. If so, it should unpack those into individual items. The output parameter is optional, so if provided, the function should append to it, else create a new list.

Wait, the function's parameters are sequence and output=None. So the output is an optional list to append the results to. The function should return the normalized list, either by appending to the given output or creating a new one.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Initialize the output list. If output is provided, use it. Else, create a new list.
2. Iterate over each element in the input sequence.
3. For each element, check if it's a complex type (like a tuple, or some Declaration object) that needs to be expanded. If it is, then recursively process it (maybe by calling _normalizeargs again with that element and the current output list). If it's a simple interface, just add it to the output.
4. Return the output list.

But how do I determine what's a complex type? The docstring mentions "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So the base cases are individual interfaces (like strings, maybe?) or implements specs (maybe objects of a certain class). Wait, perhaps the Declarions are objects that have their own attributes, and tuples are sequences that need to be flattened.

Alternatively, perhaps the function treats any element that is a tuple or a list as something to be expanded. But the problem is that the exact criteria for what needs to be expanded isn't clear. The docstring says "Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces." So maybe Declarions are objects that have their own interfaces to expand, and tuples are sequences to be flattened. Single interfaces are just added as is.

Hmm, maybe the logic is: if an element is a Declarion, then we need to get its interfaces and expand them. If it's a tuple or list, then we recursively process each element of that. Otherwise, it's an individual interface and added directly.

Wait, but the function's name is _normalizeargs, so perhaps it's part of a larger system where Declarions have an 'interfaces' attribute or something similar. Since I don't have the actual classes, maybe I can assume that a Declarion is an object that can be treated as a sequence, or has a method to get its interfaces.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to handle any element that is an iterable (like tuples, lists) by expanding them, except for strings, which are considered individual interfaces. But the problem is that the exact criteria are not clear from the docstring. Since this is a code generation task, perhaps I should proceed with the most logical approach given the information.

Let me think of possible test cases first, as per the test-driven approach. The user mentioned to generate unit tests first. Let's think of some scenarios:

Test case 1: Input is a list containing a tuple. The tuple should be flattened. For example, sequence = [('A', 'B'), 'C'] should become ['A', 'B', 'C'].

Test case 2: Input is a list containing a Declarion object. Suppose a Declarion has an __iter__ method that returns its interfaces. So, sequence = [DeclarionA], the result would be the interfaces of DeclarionA.

Wait, but how to represent Declarion in the tests? Since we can't have the actual class, maybe in the tests we can mock it or use a simple class that acts as a Declarion. Alternatively, perhaps the Declarion is considered as an object that is not an instance of a string or a tuple, but needs to be expanded into its own elements. Alternatively, perhaps the function treats any non-string, non-single-element as needing to be expanded. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the function treats any element that is an instance of a Declaration (like a class) as needing to have their __iter__ called, or their interfaces extracted. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the function is supposed to recursively flatten any sequences except for strings (since strings are sequences of characters but shouldn't be treated as such here). So the function is similar to a flatten function that handles any iterables except strings, and perhaps other specific types like Declarions, which may also be treated as iterables.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to process elements that are not "individual interfaces". So, for example, a tuple is not an individual interface, so it's expanded. A string is an individual interface, so it's added as is. A Declarion is not an individual interface, so its contents are expanded.

So the logic would be:

for item in sequence:

   if it's a Declarion or a tuple or list (but not a string), then process each element recursively.

   else, add to the output.

But how to check if it's a Declarion? Since in the code, perhaps Declarion is a class that the function recognizes. But in the code, the function can't know unless there's some way to check. Since this is a code generation task, maybe the function is designed to treat any element that is an instance of a particular class (like Declaration) as needing to be expanded, but without the actual class, perhaps the code can only handle tuples and lists, or maybe it's supposed to treat any non-string, non-single-element as needing expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to treat any element that is an iterable (except strings) as needing to be expanded, so the code would recursively process any element that is an instance of Iterable, but not a string. But in Python, strings are iterable, so we need to check for that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to treat Declarions as objects that have an 'interfaces' attribute which is a list, so we can iterate over that. But without knowing, perhaps the code can be written to handle iterables except strings, and perhaps other specific types.

Hmm, perhaps the function's logic is:

Initialize the output list.

For each item in the input sequence:

   if the item is a tuple or list, then recursively call _normalizeargs on that item and add the results to the output.

   elif it's a Declarion (but how to check?), then perhaps the Declarion has an __iter__ method, so we can iterate over it and process each sub-item.

   else, append the item to the output.

But in code, how do we check if it's a Declarion? Since we can't know the actual class, perhaps the code will treat any object that is not a string and is an instance of a class that is considered a Declaration. Alternatively, maybe the code just treats any non-string, non-single-element as needing expansion, but that's ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to handle any element that is not a string (assuming that individual interfaces are represented as strings), so tuples and lists are flattened, and other objects (like Declarion instances) are treated as needing to be expanded. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to treat any element that is an instance of a class with a specific method, but without that, perhaps the code can only handle tuples and lists. So the function is to flatten all iterables except strings, so that's the logic.

Let me proceed with that approach. So the code will recursively flatten any element that is an iterable (like a list, tuple) except for strings, which are added as-is. So the function is a recursive flattener, except for strings. Also, the output is an optional list to append to.

Wait, but the function's name is _normalizeargs, which suggests that the arguments are being normalized, perhaps by expanding any nested structures into a flat list of interfaces. So the code would be something like:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):

    if output is None:

        output = []

    for item in sequence:

        if isinstance(item, (list, tuple)):

            _normalizeargs(item, output)

        else:

            output.append(item)

    return output

Wait, but that would flatten all lists and tuples. However, the docstring mentions Declarions as well. So perhaps Declarion instances are also considered as something to be expanded, but how to represent that in code. Since the problem statement doesn't provide the Declarion class, maybe in the code, we can assume that Declarion has an __iter__ method, so that we can check if it's an iterable. Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to treat any element that is an iterable (other than strings) as needing to be expanded. So the code would check if the item is an instance of collections.abc.Iterable and not a string, then process it recursively.

So modifying the code:

from collections.abc import Iterable

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):

    if output is None:

        output = []

    for item in sequence:

        if isinstance(item, Iterable) and not isinstance(item, (str, bytes)):

            _normalizeargs(item, output)

        else:

            output.append(item)

    return output

But this would include any iterable except strings and bytes. So tuples, lists, and other iterables (like Declarion instances if they are iterable) would be expanded. That seems to fit the docstring's description.

Now, the unit tests. Let me think of test cases:

Test 1: input is a list with a tuple and a string. Expected output is the elements of the tuple plus the string.

E.g., sequence = [('A', 'B'), 'C'], expected ['A', 'B', 'C'].

Test 2: input is a list containing a list. Should flatten it.

Test 3: input has a mix of lists and tuples.

Test 4: input has a Declarion instance that is iterable. Let's say Declarion has an __iter__ that returns ['D', 'E']. So sequence = [Declarion], output should be ['D', 'E'].

But in unit tests, since we can't have the actual Declarion class, perhaps we can mock it by using a class that acts as an iterable.

Alternatively, maybe the tests can be written using tuples and lists, and assume that Declarion is handled similarly.

So the unit tests would be:

import unittest

class TestNormalizeArgs(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_flatten_tuple_in_list(self):

        input_sequence = [('A', 'B'), 'C']

        expected = ['A', 'B', 'C']

        self.assertEqual(_normalizeargs(input_sequence), expected)

    def test_flatten_list_in_list(self):

        input_sequence = [[1, 2], 3]

        expected = [1, 2, 3]

        self.assertEqual(_normalizeargs(input_sequence), expected)

    def test_mixed_types(self):

        input_sequence = [('X', 'Y'), [1, 2], 'Z']

        expected = ['X', 'Y', 1, 2, 'Z']

        self.assertEqual(_normalizeargs(input_sequence), expected)

    def test_single_element(self):

        input_sequence = ['A']

        expected = ['A']

        self.assertEqual(_normalizeargs(input_sequence), expected)

    def test_string_is_not_flattened(self):

        input_sequence = ['AB']

        expected = ['AB']

        self.assertEqual(_normalizeargs(input_sequence), expected)

    def test_empty_list(self):

        input_sequence = []

        expected = []

        self.assertEqual(_normalizeargs(input_sequence), expected)

    def test_nested(self):

        input_sequence = [[[1], 2], 3]

        expected = [1, 2, 3]

        self.assertEqual(_normalizeargs(input_sequence), expected)

    def test_with_output_list(self):

        output = []

        _normalizeargs([1, (2, 3)], output)

        self.assertEqual(output, [1, 2, 3])

But wait, in the code, the function uses recursion, so each element that is an iterable is processed by calling _normalizeargs again, passing the same output list, so it appends correctly.

Now, what about the Declarion case? Since in code, any iterable that's not a string is treated as needing expansion, so if Declarion is an instance of an iterable, then it would be handled. So the test could be:

    def test_declarion_instance(self):

        class Declarion:

            def __init__(self):

                self.interfaces = ['D', 'E']

            def __iter__(self):

                return iter(self.interfaces)

        d = Declarion()

        input_sequence = [d]

        expected = ['D', 'E']

        self.assertEqual(_normalizeargs(input_sequence), expected)

But including that in the test would require defining the Declarion class in the test. So that's a valid test case.

Now, putting this all together, the code would need to import the Iterable from collections.abc. But in the code, the user might not have that imported. Wait, but in Python, for checking if something is an iterable, the code can use the isinstance check with collections.abc.Iterable.

So the code would need to import that. However, sometimes in Python 2 vs 3, but assuming it's Python 3.

Thus, the code would look like:

from collections.abc import Iterable

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):

    if output is None:

        output = []

    for item in sequence:

        if isinstance(item, Iterable) and not isinstance(item, (str, bytes)):

            _normalizeargs(item, output)

        else:

            output.append(item)

    return output

Wait, but what about other types like bytes? The docstring mentions interfaces, which are likely strings, so bytes would be a corner case. Maybe the code can ignore bytes unless specified, but the problem doesn't mention it, so perhaps just checking for str is sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended for strings as interfaces, so bytes are not considered here.

Alternatively, maybe the 'output' parameter is a list that can hold any elements, not just strings. So the code should work with any elements except those that are non-string iterables.

So the code above should work.

Now, the user wants the code generated as per the function signature and docstring. The code must output only the code in Python markdown format. So the final code would be the function with the import, and the function definition.

Wait, but the function's docstring must match the given one. Let me check:

The given docstring is:

"""
Normalize declaration arguments

Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
interfaces.

Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.
"""

Hmm, the docstring mentions "Declarions" (maybe a typo for Declarations?), but the code's logic handles any iterables except strings. So the docstring's first paragraph says that the input might contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. The second line says anything except individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded. So the code's approach of expanding any iterable except strings (assuming that individual interfaces are non-iterables or strings) aligns with that.

Thus, the code should be as written above. Now, putting it all together.
