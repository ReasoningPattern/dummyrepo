Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document based on the given signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The function is supposed to return a formatted dictionary that includes the url and document_path. The parameters are url and an optional document_path. The docstring mentions that the returned dict should have information like the url and document_path. 

First, I should think about what the function actually does. Since the docstring is a bit vague, maybe the function is supposed to construct a URL pointing to the nodeinfo well-known document. Typically, the .well-known/nodeinfo endpoint is used, so perhaps the document_path is part of the URL structure. 

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to combine the base URL with the document path. For example, if the URL is "https://example.com" and the document_path is "/.well-known/nodeinfo", then the combined URL would be "https://example.com/.well-known/nodeinfo". But the function returns a dictionary, so perhaps it includes both the original URL, the path, and the combined URL?

Alternatively, maybe the document_path is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to the standard nodeinfo path. Let me think: the standard is that the well-known nodeinfo document is at /.well-known/nodeinfo, so perhaps if document_path isn't given, it appends that to the base URL. 

So the function might be constructing the full URL by combining the base URL and the document_path. The returned dictionary would then have entries like 'url' (the base), 'document_path' (the path provided or default), and 'full_url' as the combination. 

But the docstring says "including information such as url and document_path". Maybe the dictionary just includes those two keys. Wait, the parameters are url and document_path. So the function probably returns a dict with at least those two keys. 

So the code would be something like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = "/.well-known/nodeinfo"  # default path?
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path,
        'full_url': url + document_path  # or maybe url ends with / and path starts with /, so need to handle that?
    }

Wait, but the problem says "formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path". The exact structure isn't specified, but maybe the function just returns a dict with those two keys. But the full_url might be necessary. Let me check the standard.

The nodeinfo spec says that the well-known document is at /.well-known/nodeinfo, so perhaps the function is supposed to construct that path if document_path isn't provided. So the default document_path is "/.well-known/nodeinfo".

Therefore, the function would take the URL, and if document_path is given, use that, else use the default. Then the returned dict would have 'url' as the input url, 'document_path' as the path, and maybe a 'full_url' combining them. But the docstring says "including information such as url and document_path" â€” maybe the full URL isn't part of the dict? Or perhaps the function just returns the two parameters as a dict. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dict with the url and the document_path, regardless of defaults. So if document_path is not provided, it's None in the dict. But that might not make sense. 

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the url and the document_path, with the document_path defaulting to the standard path. So the code would set document_path to the default if it's None, then return a dict with both. 

So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path,
    }

But the problem's docstring says "formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path." So maybe that's all. 

Now, considering test-driven development, first write tests. Let's think of test cases.

Test 1: when document_path is provided, the dict includes both. 

Test 2: when document_path is not provided, it uses the default. 

Test 3: Check that the keys are correct. 

So the unit tests would look like:

import unittest

class TestGetNodeinfoWellKnownDocument(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_with_document_path(self):
        url = "https://example.com"
        path = "/custom/path"
        expected = {
            "url": url,
            "document_path": path,
        }
        result = get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, path)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_without_document_path(self):
        url = "https://example.com"
        expected_path = "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
        expected = {
            "url": url,
            "document_path": expected_path,
        }
        result = get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url)
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_default_path(self):
        # same as above, maybe redundant but okay

    def test_parameters_are_strings(self):
        # check that it handles url properly, maybe edge cases like trailing slashes?

    Maybe test when the URL has a trailing slash and the path starts with a slash, but perhaps the function doesn't need to handle that. Since the function just combines them as given, maybe it's up to the user. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the code doesn't handle that and just returns the given path as is.

So the tests would check that when document_path is given, it's stored, and when not given, the default is used. 

Therefore, the code would be as I outlined earlier. 

Wait, but the function's return is a formatted dictionary. The parameters are passed as is? So if the user provides a document_path that's None, but the function's default is the standard path. So in the case when the user explicitly passes None, does that override the default? Wait, in the function signature, document_path is optional with default None. So if the user passes None, then the code would check if document_path is None, which it is, so set to default. So that's okay. 

Yes, so the code is as written. 

Now, to write the code. The function must return a dict with the two keys. The default path is "/.well-known/nodeinfo".

So the code is straightforward. 

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, but only the code. So the answer is the code with the function and the tests. Wait, the question says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, the problem says to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So the user is following TDD. So first write the tests, then the code. But the code to be output is the function, but the tests are part of the code? Or does the code include both tests and the function?

Wait, the question says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Hmm, perhaps the code to be output includes both the tests and the function. Because in TDD, you write the tests first, then the code. So the user expects the code to include both the test cases and the function implementation.

Wait, but the problem says "output ONLY the code generated". So the code would be the function's code. But the instructions say to first generate the tests before writing the actual code. But the code to be output is the function. However, perhaps the problem expects the code to include both the test code and the function code. Because in TDD, the tests are written first, then the code. So the code to be output is the complete code including tests and the function.

Alternatively, maybe the code is just the function, but the tests are written first in the process. But the user wants the final code. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So perhaps the code to output is the function. But the TDD approach requires writing tests first, but the code to output is the function. But maybe the code includes the tests as well. Because the user might need to have the tests as part of the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is the code to output, and the tests are part of the code that's generated. So the code would have the test class and the function.

Wait, the problem says to "generate the code based on the signature and docstring", so the function is the main part. But the tests are part of the code that's written as part of TDD. So the code to be output includes both the tests and the function. 

Therefore, the code would look like:

But let's structure it properly. The code would start with the function, then the tests. Or the tests are in a separate section. But in Python, tests can be in the same file using unittest.

So here's the code:

The function first, then the tests.

Wait, in TDD, you write the test first, then the code. But when writing the code, you can have the tests in the same file.

So the code would look like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path,
    }

import unittest

class TestGetNodeinfoWellKnownDocument(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_with_document_path(self):
        url = "https://example.com"
        path = "/custom/path"
        expected = {"url": url, "document_path": path}
        self.assertEqual(
            get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, path),
            expected
        )

    def test_without_document_path(self):
        url = "https://example.com"
        expected_path = "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
        expected = {"url": url, "document_path": expected_path}
        self.assertEqual(
            get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url),
            expected
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()

Wait, but in Python, the test class needs to be after the function is defined, otherwise the test can't import it. So this structure is okay.

Alternatively, the tests could be written first, but in code, the function has to be defined before the test class. So the code would have the function first, then the tests.

Therefore, the code is as above.

Wait, but the user might expect the code to be in a way that the tests are written first in the TDD process, but the code to be output includes both.

Therefore, the final code includes the function and the test cases.

Hence, the answer is the code above.
