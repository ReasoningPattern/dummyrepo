Okay, so I need to write the Python method _convert_non_cli_args based on the given docstring and function signature. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do. The doc says it casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict, since by default they are all strings. The parameters are parser_name and values_dict. 

First, I should figure out how to determine the correct types for each argument. Since the parser_name is given, maybe there's some predefined structure or configuration for each command (like main, virsh, etc.) that specifies which arguments should be integers, booleans, floats, etc. But the problem is, the code example isn't provided, so I have to make some assumptions here.

Hmm, perhaps the values_dict contains keys that correspond to the arguments, and each of these keys has a known type based on the parser_name. So the method needs to look up the expected types for each argument in the current parser's configuration and then cast the string values to those types.

Wait, but how does the method know the expected types? Maybe there's a separate method or data structure that maps argument names to their types for each parser. For example, maybe in the class there's a dictionary like self._arg_types which has entries like {'main': {'--count': int, '--verbose': bool}, ...}. But since I don't have access to that, I have to make this up as part of the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the method uses some other way, like checking the options added to the parser. Maybe each argument in the parser has a type specified when it was added, and the method can retrieve that. But again, without knowing the rest of the codebase, I have to proceed with a plausible approach.

Let me think of a possible structure. The method could loop through each key in values_dict, check the expected type for that key based on the parser_name, and then cast the value accordingly. For example, if an argument is supposed to be an integer, convert the string to int. If it's a boolean, maybe it's a flag, so present in the values_dict as a string 'True' or 'False'? Or perhaps the boolean is handled differently, like checking if the option was present.

Wait, but in CLI arguments, boolean options are often flags that just set a True/False value. But in the values_dict, they might be stored as strings like 'True' or 'False', or maybe the actual boolean. Hmm, perhaps the code will have to handle that. Alternatively, maybe the values_dict already has some indicators. But the doc says all values are strings by default, so I need to cast them.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each key in values_dict:
   a. Determine the expected type for that key/parser_name combination.
   b. If the type is known, cast the value to that type.
   c. If the value can't be cast (like invalid int), perhaps raise an error, but the method's responsibility might be just to try and cast, maybe letting exceptions happen? Or maybe it's supposed to handle errors gracefully? The doc isn't clear. Since the problem says to generate code based on the doc, which doesn't mention error handling, maybe just proceed with casting where possible.

But how to get the expected types? Since the method is part of a class, perhaps the class has a way to retrieve the argument types for each parser. Let me assume that there's a helper method or a data structure in the class that maps parser names to their argument types.

Alternatively, maybe the method is part of a larger system where each parser's arguments have a known type, and the method can access that via some attribute. For example, each parser might have a list of arguments with their types, stored in self.parsers[parser_name].args, where each arg has a 'type' field.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the code will need to use a predefined mapping. Let me proceed by creating a sample mapping inside the method, but that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, the method could have access to a class-level dictionary that holds the type information.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses the argparse module's knowledge. Like, if the arguments were added via an argparse.ArgumentParser, then each action has a type. But that's a possible direction.

Wait, perhaps the values_dict comes from an argparse.Namespace converted to a dictionary, and each argument's type was set when adding to the parser. But if the parser is using the default type (string), then the method is supposed to re-cast them based on some other criteria.

Hmm, maybe the method is part of a system that uses a configuration where each argument's type is specified, so the code would look up the type for each argument in the current parser's configuration and then cast accordingly.

Let me try to outline the code structure:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    # Get the list of arguments for this parser_name and their types
    arg_types = self.get_argument_types(parser_name)  # hypothetical method
    for arg, value in values_dict.items():
        if arg in arg_types:
            target_type = arg_types[arg]
            try:
                values_dict[arg] = target_type(value)
            except ValueError:
                # Handle error? Maybe raise, or log, but the doc doesn't specify
                # So perhaps just let it propagate?
                raise ValueError(f"Cannot convert {value} to {target_type} for argument {arg}")

But how to implement get_argument_types? Since that's part of the class's existing structure, which I don't have, I have to make an assumption. For the purpose of generating code, perhaps the method will have a predefined dictionary in the class.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to use some other way. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the method checks for certain keys and knows their types. But that's too specific.

Alternatively, perhaps the method uses a helper function that checks the value. For example, if the value is a string that looks like an integer, convert it. But that might be too simplistic and error-prone. The problem says "casts to correct types", so probably the types are known, not inferred.

Hmm. Since the problem doesn't give more context, I have to make some assumptions. Let's proceed by assuming that the method has access to a dictionary that maps each parser's name to a dictionary of argument names to their types. For example:

self.parser_types = {
    'main': {'--count': int, '--verbose': bool},
    'virsh': {'--memory': int, '--xml': str},
    # etc.
}

Then, in the method, for each argument in values_dict, check if it exists in the parser's type dict, and if so, cast it.

So the code would be something like:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    # Get the type mapping for the current parser
    arg_types = self.parser_types.get(parser_name, {})
    for arg, value in values_dict.items():
        if arg in arg_types:
            target_type = arg_types[arg]
            try:
                values_dict[arg] = target_type(value)
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                # Maybe log an error, but the doc says to cast, so perhaps just let it fail?
                raise ValueError(f"Failed to convert {value!r} to {target_type} for {arg}")

But where does parser_types come from? Since this is part of a class, maybe the class has an __init__ method that initializes it. But the problem doesn't mention that, so perhaps the code is part of a larger class where parser_types is already defined.

Alternatively, maybe the method uses some other way, like introspection on the parser's actions. For example, if the parser is an instance of argparse.ArgumentParser, then each argument's type can be found in the parser's _actions.

Wait, if the parser is an instance of an argparse parser, then each argument added with add_argument has a 'type' parameter. So, perhaps the method can get the parser's actions, find the one with the option string matching the argument name, and get its type.

That might be a more dynamic approach. Let me think of that.

Suppose that each parser_name corresponds to an actual ArgumentParser instance stored in self.parsers. Then:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    parser = self.parsers.get(parser_name)
    if not parser:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown parser: {parser_name}")
    # Iterate over all the actions in the parser to find the type for each argument
    for action in parser._actions:
        # The option_strings are like ['--count'], so maybe the dest is the key?
        # Or maybe the option_strings[0] is the key in values_dict?
        # For example, if the action was added with --count, then the dest might be 'count',
        # but the key in values_dict would be '--count'?
        # Hmm, this is getting complicated.
        # Alternatively, the dest is the key in the Namespace, but the values_dict might have keys as the option strings.
        # Maybe the values_dict uses the option strings as keys, like '--count'.
        # So for each option in action.option_strings:
        for option in action.option_strings:
            if option in values_dict:
                # Get the type from action.type
                target_type = action.type
                if target_type is not None:  # because some might be None (default is str)
                    try:
                        values_dict[option] = target_type(values_dict[option])
                    except (ValueError, TypeError):
                        raise ValueError(f"Could not convert value {values_dict[option]} for {option} to {target_type}")

    # Also handle positional arguments? Or maybe they are not part of this method's concern.

Wait, but in argparse, the destination (dest) is the name of the attribute in the Namespace, which might not be the same as the option string. For example, if you have --count, the dest might be 'count', so the key in the Namespace would be 'count', but in the values_dict, maybe the key is the option string '--count'.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too involved. The problem might be expecting a simpler approach, perhaps using a predefined mapping.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to look for certain keys and cast them based on known types. For example, any key ending with 'count' is an integer. But that's not reliable.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a helper function to determine the type based on the value. For example, trying to parse as int, float, etc., but that could lead to ambiguity. The doc says "casts to correct types", implying that the types are known, not inferred.

Hmm. Given the ambiguity, maybe the correct approach is to assume that there's a predefined dictionary in the class that maps each parser's arguments to their types, and the method uses that.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to handle some common cases, like boolean flags, integers, etc. For example, if the value is "True" or "False", convert to a boolean. Or if it's a number, convert to int or float. But without knowing the exact requirements, this is risky.

Wait, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring says that by default all values are strings, and the method should cast them to correct types. The parameters are parser_name and values_dict. So the method needs to know, for each argument in values_dict, what its type should be, based on the parser_name.

Perhaps the code will have a dictionary in the class that maps parser names to a dictionary of argument names to their types, and the method loops through each argument in values_dict and applies the type.

So, assuming the class has a structure like:

class SomeClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parser_types = {
            'main': {'--count': int, '--verbose': bool},
            'virsh': {'--memory': int, '--xml': str},
            # etc.
        }

Then the method would be as I outlined earlier.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    # Get the type mapping for the current parser
    arg_types = self.parser_types.get(parser_name, {})
    for arg, value in values_dict.items():
        if arg in arg_types:
            target_type = arg_types[arg]
            try:
                values_dict[arg] = target_type(value)
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                # Reraise with a more informative error message
                raise ValueError(
                    f"Could not convert value {value!r} for argument {arg} to type {target_type.__name__}"
                )

But where does self.parser_types come from? Since the problem is only asking for the method, perhaps the class has that attribute, and the code is correct as such. Alternatively, maybe the method uses another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a function to get the types based on the parser's configuration. But without more info, I think this is the best approach.

Wait, but in the problem's tips, it says to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. So maybe I should think about how the tests would look, which might inform the code structure.

Let's imagine writing a test. For example, a test case where for parser 'main', the argument '--count' should be an int, and '--verbose' a boolean.

Test code could be:

def test_convert_non_cli_args(self):
    # Setup
    class_instance = YourClass()
    class_instance.parser_types = {
        'main': {'--count': int, '--verbose': bool}
    }
    values_dict = {'--count': '42', '--verbose': 'True', '--name': 'test'}
    expected = {'--count': 42, '--verbose': True, '--name': 'test'}

    # Call the method
    class_instance._convert_non_cli_args('main', values_dict)

    # Assert
    assert values_dict == expected

Another test case where conversion fails:

def test_convert_invalid_value(self):
    class_instance = YourClass()
    class_instance.parser_types = {'main': {'--count': int}}
    values_dict = {'--count': 'forty-two'}

    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        class_instance._convert_non_cli_args('main', values_dict)
    assert "Could not convert 'forty-two' to int" in str(exc_info.value)

So the code must correctly handle these cases. The code I outlined earlier would work with these tests, assuming that the parser_types are set up properly.

Therefore, the generated code should follow that structure.
