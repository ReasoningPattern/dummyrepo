Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _create_in_regex method based on the given docstring. Let's start by understanding what this method is supposed to do. The docstring says it creates an "in-style" parameter regular expression. Hmm, in-style parameters are usually like when you have a parameter that takes a list of values, like in SQL queries where you might have something like "WHERE column IN (value1, value2, ...)".

So the regular expression should match such a pattern. Let me think about the typical structure. The parameter name would be followed by ' IN ', then a list of values enclosed in parentheses. Each value could be a string or number, separated by commas. Maybe something like:

param_name IN (value1, value2, 'value with spaces', 42)

The regex needs to capture the parameter name and the list of values. Wait, but how exactly? The goal might be to capture the parameter name and the individual values. Let's see. The regex should probably match the entire IN clause, capturing the parameter name and each value. Alternatively, maybe it's designed to extract the parameter name and the list of values as a group.

Let me think of the components:

- The parameter name: a word (letters, numbers, underscores?), followed by ' IN ' (case-sensitive? Maybe, but sometimes people use case-insensitive, but the doc doesn't specify. Since the return is a re.Pattern, maybe the default is case-sensitive unless specified. Hmm, but the example in the docstring uses "IN" in uppercase, so perhaps the regex should be case-sensitive. Wait, but maybe the user input could have varying cases. The problem is unclear here, but perhaps the method is designed to match the exact " IN " with space around it. Let's assume that.

So the regex would start with a pattern for the parameter name, then ' IN ', then parentheses with comma-separated values.

The parameter name part: maybe something like [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]* to match variable names. But maybe the method is more permissive, like any sequence of non-space characters? Not sure. The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the parameter name is a word, so \w+.

Then, after the parameter name and ' IN ', comes the parentheses. The values inside can be quoted strings or unquoted, maybe with commas as separators. The regex needs to capture each value, but how?

Wait, maybe the regex is meant to capture the parameter name and the entire list of values as a group, so that the values can be extracted later. Alternatively, perhaps the regex is structured to match the entire IN clause and capture the parameter name and the list of values.

Alternatively, the regex could be something like:

r'(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]+)\)'

But that would capture the parameter name and the entire content inside the parentheses as a group. However, splitting the values would require further processing. But maybe the function's purpose is just to create the regex, not to parse the values further.

Alternatively, the regex might need to account for possible whitespace around the IN and parentheses. Like:

r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(\s*(?:[^,\s]+\s*,\s*)*[^,\s]+\s*\)'

But that's getting complicated. Maybe the regex is intended to be more general. Alternatively, perhaps the regex is designed to capture the parameter name and the list of values as individual elements. But that might require a more complex regex with groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex is designed to match the entire IN clause, capturing the parameter name and the list of values as a group, so that the application can split the list later. For example, the regex could be something like:

r'(\w+)\s+IN\s+\((.*)\)' 

But the .* would match everything until the next ) but not accounting for nested parentheses. Wait, but in the IN clause, the parentheses are only for the list. So maybe the regex should be:

r'(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]*)\)' 

This way, the second group captures everything inside the parentheses, excluding the closing ). However, this would still include any commas and spaces between the values. 

The problem is that the exact requirements aren't clear from the docstring, but the method's purpose is to return a regex that can identify in-style parameters. 

Assuming that the regex should capture the parameter name and the list of values (the content inside the parentheses), perhaps the regex should be:

r'(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]*)\)' 

But since the returned regex is a compiled pattern, the method would return re.compile(pattern). 

Wait, but the function is part of a class, so self might be needed, but the parameters don't take any arguments. So the method is self-contained. 

Wait, the function's return type is re.Pattern, so the code should compile the regex. 

Putting this together, the code would be something like:

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    pattern = r'(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]*)\)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

But maybe the IN is case-insensitive? The docstring doesn't say, so perhaps not. 

Alternatively, maybe the parameter name can have more characters, like hyphens or periods? The example in the docstring isn't given, but perhaps the \w+ is sufficient. 

Another consideration is the whitespace handling. The IN keyword might have spaces around it, so \s+ is okay. 

Wait, but the regex needs to be as precise as possible. Let me think of test cases. For example:

Test case 1: "user_id IN (1, 2, 3)" should match. The parameter name is "user_id", the values are "1", "2", "3".

Test case 2: "name IN ('John', 'Doe')" should match, capturing "name" and the quoted strings.

Test case 3: "PARAM IN (value)" should also match, with single value.

Test case 4: "invalid IN (1, 2 3" should not match because the parentheses aren't closed, but the regex would still match up to the missing ), but the group would include up to that point. Wait no, because the [^)]* would stop at the missing ). Wait, the regex would match up to the end of the string if there's no ), but since the closing ) is required in the pattern, the entire regex would only match if there's a closing ). 

Wait, in the pattern, after the opening (, the regex has ( [^)]* ) followed by \). So the closing ) is required, so the regex requires that the IN clause is properly closed. So that's good.

But in the regex, the second group is everything inside the parentheses, except the closing ). 

So that seems okay.

Now, the unit tests would need to check this. Since the user mentioned to use test-driven development, first write tests before the code. Let me think of how the tests would look.

First, the test would check that the regex correctly captures the parameter name and the values inside the parentheses.

Example test cases:

Test 1: "user_id IN (1, 2, 3)" should match, with groups 'user_id' and '1, 2, 3'.

Test 2: "Name IN ('a', 'b')" should capture 'Name' and "'a', 'b'".

Test 3: "PARAM IN (value)" should capture 'PARAM' and 'value'.

Test 4: "id IN ()" should not match because there are no values inside, but the regex would still match with an empty string inside. Wait, the pattern allows for zero or more characters inside the parentheses? Because the [^)]* is zero or more. So in this case, the regex would match, but the second group would be empty. Depending on the application's requirements, that might be an issue, but the regex as per the current pattern would allow it. 

Another test case where the IN is lowercase: "id in (1)" would not match because the regex is case-sensitive. But maybe the problem expects it to be case-sensitive, as per the docstring's example. 

So the tests would need to check for that.

Now, the code for the tests would use the regex returned by _create_in_regex(). 

But since the user wants me to first generate the tests before writing the code, I need to think of how to structure them. 

Assuming that the tests are part of a test class, like using pytest or unittest. Let's outline some test functions:

def test_create_in_regex_captures_parameter_and_values(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("user_id IN (1, 2, 3)")
    assert match is not None
    assert match.group(1) == "user_id"
    assert match.group(2) == "1, 2, 3"

def test_create_in_regex_handles_quoted_values(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("name IN ('John', \"Doe\")")
    assert match is not None
    assert match.group(1) == "name"
    assert match.group(2) == "'John', \"Doe\""

def test_create_in_regex_case_insensitive_fails(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("ID in (5)")
    assert match is None  # because 'in' is lowercase

def test_create_in_regex_missing_parenthesis(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("id IN 1, 2")
    assert match is None  # no parentheses

def test_create_in_regex_empty_values(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("param IN ()")
    assert match is not None
    assert match.group(2) == ""

These tests would check various scenarios. 

Now, considering the regex pattern, the current pattern might not account for optional whitespace around the IN keyword or the parentheses. For example, in the test case with "user_id IN ( 1, 2 )", the regex would still match because of the \s+ between IN and the parentheses. 

Wait, the current pattern is:

(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]*)\)

So between the parameter name and IN, there must be at least one whitespace (due to \s+). Similarly between IN and the (, also at least one whitespace. So a string like "user_idIN(1)" would not match, but "user_id IN(1)" would have the space between IN and the (, but the \s+ after IN would require at least one space. Wait, the regex has \s+ between the parameter name and IN. Wait no, let me re-express the regex:

The regex is broken down as:

- (\w+) : capture group 1 (the parameter name)
- \s+ : one or more whitespace
- IN : the literal string 'IN'
- \s+ : one or more whitespace
- \( : a literal '('
- ( [^)]* ) : capture group 2, which matches any characters except ')', zero or more times
- \) : closing ')'

So in the case where there's no space between the parameter name and IN, like "user_idIN(...", the regex would fail. So the tests should include such cases. 

Another test case:

def test_no_whitespace_after_parameter(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("user_idIN (1,2)")
    assert match is None

Because the parameter name and IN are adjacent without a space.

So perhaps the regex should allow for optional whitespace between the parameter name and IN, but the current regex requires at least one. 

Alternatively, maybe the regex should use \s* instead of \s+ for the spaces between the parameter name and IN. Let me think. The docstring says "in-style parameter", which typically in SQL requires the IN keyword to be separated by spaces from the parameter name and the parentheses. But perhaps the regex should be more flexible. 

Alternatively, maybe the regex should allow optional whitespace. Let's adjust the regex to:

r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]*)\)' 

This way, there can be zero or more whitespace between the parameter name and IN, between IN and the parentheses. 

That would make the regex more flexible. Let me adjust the pattern accordingly. 

So the corrected regex would be:

r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]*)\)' 

Then the test case "user_idIN (1,2)" would match because there's a space between IN and the (, but the parameter name and IN are adjacent. Wait, no, in that example, "user_idIN" is the parameter name? Wait, no. In the string "user_idIN (1,2)", the parameter name is "user_idIN", followed by a space, then the IN keyword? Wait no, that's not possible. Because the regex would first capture the parameter name as "user_idIN" because it's a word (since "IN" is part of the parameter name). But the actual IN keyword would be part of the parameter name. 

Ah, right, that's a problem. Because in the regex, the parameter name is any word, so if the actual parameter is named "user_idIN", then the regex would capture that as the parameter name, and then the rest would not form an IN clause. So that's an edge case. 

Alternatively, maybe the regex should require that the parameter name is followed by " IN " (with spaces). But perhaps the correct approach is to require that the IN is a separate keyword. 

Alternatively, perhaps the parameter name should be a word, then followed by " IN " (with spaces around), but that would require that the parameter name must be followed by at least one space, then IN, then at least one space, then the parentheses. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think again. The regex should capture the IN clause where the parameter name is followed by the IN keyword (case-sensitive), and the parentheses enclose the values. 

So perhaps the spaces around IN are optional? Like, the IN can have zero or more spaces before and after. 

So, the regex could be:

r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]*)\)' 

This way, spaces are optional between the parameter name and IN, between IN and the parentheses, etc. 

Testing that, the previous example "user_id IN (1,2)" would work, as well as "user_idIN(1,2)" where the IN is adjacent to the parameter name but there's no space. Wait, in that case, the parameter name would be "user_idIN" and then the regex would look for IN after that? No, because after the parameter name (which is "user_idIN"), the regex would look for " IN ", but the next characters are the (, so it wouldn't find the IN keyword. 

Hmm, so perhaps the regex needs to be adjusted so that the IN is a separate keyword. To ensure that the IN is not part of the parameter name, the regex should have a word boundary before the IN? 

Alternatively, the parameter name is a word, then IN is the next token, so perhaps the regex should have \b before IN? 

Wait, maybe the IN has to be a separate word. So the regex could be:

r'(\w+)\s+IN\s+\(([^)]*)\)' 

with the \s+ between the parameter name and IN. 

In that case, "user_idIN (..." would not match because the parameter name would be "user_idIN", followed by the space and then the IN, but the IN is part of the parameter name. 

Alternatively, maybe the IN should be surrounded by word boundaries. 

Alternatively, perhaps the parameter name can't include the letters "IN" as part of its name, but that's an application-specific constraint not mentioned here. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the initial approach is sufficient, and the test cases can clarify. 

Assuming the regex is as follows:

r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]*)\)' 

Then the tests can check for cases with and without spaces. 

Now, going back to the code. The function should return re.compile of that pattern. 

So the code would be:

import re
from typing import Pattern

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    pattern = r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]*)\)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

Wait, but the parameters may have underscores or other characters? The \w includes underscores, so that's okay. 

Another consideration: the values inside the parentheses can contain any characters except the closing parenthesis. So the [^)]* captures everything except the closing ). 

But this would include commas and spaces, so the second group would include the entire list as a single string. The application can then split on commas to get individual values, but that's beyond the scope of the regex. 

So this should satisfy the requirements as per the docstring. 

Now, the unit tests. Let me outline some possible tests:

First, a test that matches a simple case:

def test_simple_match(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("param IN (value1, value2)")
    assert match is not None
    assert match.group(1) == "param"
    assert match.group(2) == "value1, value2"

Another test with quoted values:

def test_quoted_values(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("name IN ('John', \"Doe\")")
    assert match is not None
    assert match.group(2) == "'John', \"Doe\""

Test with no spaces between parameter and IN:

def test_no_space_before_IN(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("idIN (1,2)")
    assert match is not None
    assert match.group(1) == "idIN"  # because the parameter name is 'idIN'

Wait, in that case, the parameter name would indeed be "idIN", followed by a space, then the IN keyword? Wait no, because the regex's IN is the literal 'IN', so in the string "idIN (1,2)", the regex would see:

The first group is "idIN", then after that, the next part is " (1,2)", which doesn't have the IN keyword. So the regex would not find a match here. Wait, no, the parameter name is "idIN", then the regex looks for " IN " (but in the string, after "idIN", there's a space and then "(", so the IN part is not there. So the regex would not match that case. 

Hmm, so the regex as written with the \s* between the parameter and IN allows for zero or more spaces, but the IN must still be present as a separate token. Wait, no, the IN is part of the regex, so the string must have the 'IN' letters after the parameter name and spaces. 

So in the case of "idIN (1,2)", the parameter name is "idIN", and then the regex is looking for 'IN' after that, but there's no 'IN' there. So the regex would not match. 

Therefore, the test for "id IN (1,2)" would be okay, but "idIN (1,2)" would not match, which is correct because there's no IN keyword there. 

Another test case where the IN is in lowercase should not match:

def test_case_insensitive(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    assert regex.match("id in (1)") is None

Test case with missing closing parenthesis:

def test_missing_parenthesis(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    assert regex.match("id IN (1, 2") is None  # no closing )

Test case with empty values:

def test_empty_values(self):
    regex = self._create_in_regex()
    match = regex.match("id IN ()")
    assert match is not None
    assert match.group(2) == ""

These tests should cover various scenarios. 

Now, putting it all together, the code for the function seems okay. 

Wait, but the regex as written may allow for leading or trailing whitespace inside the parentheses. For example, " IN ( 1, 2 )" would still capture "1, 2 " as the group. That's acceptable because the regex's job is to capture everything inside the parentheses except the closing ). 

Therefore, the code should be as I wrote earlier. 

So the final code is:

import re
from typing import Pattern

def _create_in_regex(self) -> Pattern:
    pattern = r'(\w+)\s*IN\s*\(([^)]*)\)'
    return re.compile(pattern)
