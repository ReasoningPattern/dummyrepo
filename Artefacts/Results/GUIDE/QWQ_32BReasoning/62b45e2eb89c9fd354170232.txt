Okay, I need to write a Python function called next_version that takes a version string and returns the next version following the same pattern. Hmm, let's think about how version numbers usually work. Oh right, typically they're something like "1.2.3", and the next would increment the last part, so "1.2.4". But maybe there are other patterns? Like maybe with more parts or different separators?

Wait the problem says "following existing pattern". So I need to parse the current version, figure out how to increment it properly. Let's think of common versioning schemes. Usually, versions are divided into parts separated by dots. Each part is a number. The next version increments the last part by 1. But sometimes, if the last part is zero, maybe other parts? Wait no, probably the standard approach is to increment the last numerical part. Like semantic versioning where you have major.minor.patch. So the next version would increment the patch number each time.

So the steps would be: split the version string into its numerical components. Then, increment the last component by 1. Then rejoin them with dots.

But what if the version has more parts, like "0.9.12"? Then next is "0.9.13". If it's "2.5", then next is "2.6". What about edge cases? Like "1.9.9" would become "1.9.10", which is correct. Also, leading zeros? Like "001.002.003" — should the output keep the leading zeros? The problem says "following existing pattern", so probably yes. So when parsing, we need to keep each part as strings, split by dots, then increment the last one as a number, but keep the original formatting (like leading zeros?) Hmm, but how?

Wait, for example, if the input is "1.2.3", next is "1.2.4". If input is "1.2.9", next is "1.2.10". But the parts are stored as strings, so when we increment, we have to convert to integer, add one, then convert back to string. That way leading zeros would be lost. But the problem says "following existing pattern". So maybe leading zeros in the parts should be preserved?

Wait, the problem might not require that. Let me think. Suppose the version is "010.02.03", then next would be "010.02.04"? But when you increment 03 as a number, it becomes 4, so the string would be "04"? Or "4"? Hmm, not sure. The problem statement is a bit vague here. But perhaps the correct approach is to treat each part as a number, so leading zeros are not preserved. Because otherwise, how would you handle that? Like, if the part is "003", adding 1 would become "004", but how do you know how many leading zeros to keep? That requires tracking the number of digits in each part. That complicates things, but maybe the problem expects that?

Alternatively, maybe the version is treated as a sequence of numbers separated by dots, and each part is an integer. So the next version increments the last part. So leading zeros are not considered part of the number, so when you increment, the leading zeros would be lost. For example, "010" would be 10, so next would be 11, so "011" would not be the case. Wait, but how to know how many digits to keep? The problem might not require that, so maybe it's acceptable to treat each part as an integer, so leading zeros are stripped.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the standard approach where each part is a number, so leading zeros are not part of the version. So, for example, "0.1" becomes "0.2", but "001.2" would be treated as 1.2, so next is 1.3, so the output would be "1.3" which doesn't have leading zeros. But the original input might have leading zeros. So the function would change the number of digits in the parts. But the problem says "following existing pattern", so maybe the pattern is the number of parts and the separators. So the parts are split by dots, and each part is a number, but the next version just increments the last part, and the parts are represented as numbers, so leading zeros are lost.

Alternatively, perhaps the parts are kept as strings, so when incrementing, the last part is treated as a number, then converted back to a string with the same number of digits. For example, "03" becomes "04". That would require checking the length of the last part's string representation. But how?

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the simplest approach where the parts are split into integers, the last is incremented, then joined with dots as strings, without leading zeros. Let's proceed with that unless there's a reason to think otherwise.

So the steps for the function:

1. Split the input version string into parts by splitting on '.'.
2. Convert each part to an integer. So parts = [int(p) for p in parts]
3. Increment the last element by 1.
4. Re-join the parts with '.' between them as strings.
5. Return the new string.

Wait, but let's see test cases. For example:

Test case 1: "1.2.3" → "1.2.4" ✔️

Test case 2: "0.9.9" → "0.9.10" ✔️ (since 9+1=10)

Test case 3: "1.2.3.4" → "1.2.3.5" ✔️

Edge case: "0.0.9" → "0.0.10" ✔️

Another edge case: "1" → "2" (since it's just one part). So if the input is a single number, increment that.

Another case: "2.4.9.999" → "2.4.9.1000" ✔️

But what about leading zeros in parts? Let's say input is "01.002.003". Split into ["01", "002", "003"], converting to integers gives [1, 2, 3]. Increment last to 4 → parts become [1,2,4]. So the new version is "1.2.4". But the original had leading zeros. So the output loses those. But according to the problem's requirement, does the next version need to follow the same pattern in terms of leading zeros?

The problem's description is a bit ambiguous. The docstring says "following existing pattern". The existing pattern would be the structure of the version. The pattern here is the number of parts and the separators. The leading zeros are part of the string representation, but when treated as numbers, they are lost. So perhaps the function is supposed to treat each part as a number, so leading zeros are not considered. Therefore, the correct approach is to convert to integers, increment, then rejoin as strings without leading zeros.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the parts are kept as strings, so that leading zeros are preserved. For example, if the input is "001.002", the next would be "001.003". To do that, the increment would have to be done on the string, but that complicates things. How?

Hmm, maybe the problem expects that the parts are numbers, so leading zeros are not part of the version. Therefore, the first approach is correct.

Therefore, the code would be something like:

def next_version(version):
    parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))
    parts[-1] += 1
    return '.'.join(map(str, parts))

Wait, but let's test some cases. For example, "1.9.9" → 1.9.10 → correct. "0.9.9" → 0.9.10. "1" → 2. "2.0" → 2.1. "2.9.9" → 2.9.10.

But what about a version like "1.2" → next is "1.3". That's correct.

But what about "1.0.0" → next is "1.0.1", which is correct.

Another case: "9.9.9" → "9.9.10".

So this code seems to handle those cases.

Now, the user mentioned to use test-driven development, first generating comprehensive unit tests before writing the code. So I should think of the tests first.

Let me think of possible test cases:

Test 1: Single part version "1" → next is "2".

Test 2: Two parts "0.9" → "0.10".

Wait, wait, "0.9" would split into [0,9], increment last → 10 → "0.10".

Yes, that's correct.

Test 3: Three parts "1.2.3" → "1.2.4".

Test 4: Increment leading to carry over in parts? Like "9.9.9" → "9.9.10".

Wait, but if it's "9.9.9", the next is 9.9.10, which is correct.

Another test case where the last part is zero: "1.2.0" → "1.2.1".

Edge case with a single part "0" → next is "1".

What about "2.4.9.999" → "2.4.9.1000".

Another edge case: version with all parts except last being zero, like "0.0.9" → "0.0.10".

What about version like "1.0.5" → next is "1.0.6".

Another test case with leading zeros in the string but treated as numbers: "01.02.003" → split into [1,2,3], so next is "1.2.4". So the output loses leading zeros. But the problem says "following existing pattern". The existing pattern's parts may have leading zeros, but the next version's parts are numerical. So perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects leading zeros to be preserved. But how?

Hmm, maybe the problem expects that the parts are treated as strings, so that leading zeros are kept. But then how to increment? For example, "03" as a string, incrementing would be "04", but how to do that?

Alternatively, perhaps each part is a string, and the increment is done as a number, but the length of the string part is maintained. For example, "03" is 2 digits, so the next is "04".

But that would require checking the length of each part. For example, if the part is "03", its length is 2. So when we increment 3 to 4, we need to pad it with leading zeros to have 2 digits. But how to know how many digits each part had?

Ah, so the problem could be interpreted that the version parts are numbers, but their string representations may have leading zeros, and the next version should maintain the same number of digits in each part as the input. For example, if the input is "01.002", then each part has 2 and 3 digits respectively, so the next version would be "01.003".

But that complicates the code. Because to do that, you need to track the length of each part's string. So:

def next_version(version):
    parts = version.split('.')
    # get the last part as integer, others as strings with their lengths
    # but how to track the lengths?

    # maybe:

    # split into parts, then for each part, store the original string and its value
    # then, increment the last value, then reconstruct the parts with their original lengths.

    # for example:

    parts_list = []
    for p in parts:
        parts_list.append( (p, int(p)) )
    # last value is parts_list[-1][1] +1

    new_last = parts_list[-1][1] + 1
    # need to format the new_last with the same number of digits as the original part.

    # but if the new_last has more digits than the original, then the format would change.

    # For example, original part is "09" (2 digits), new_last is 10 (3 digits). So the new part would be "10" which is longer, so the pattern changes.

    # But according to the problem's description, the next version should follow the existing pattern. So perhaps in this case, the pattern would no longer be followed, but the function must still return the next version, even if the length increases.

    # So maybe the problem's pattern refers to the number of parts and the separators, not the length of each part.

    # So the initial approach where parts are converted to integers, then joined as strings is correct.

Hmm, given that the problem's description is a bit ambiguous, but given the examples I can think of, the first approach is probably the intended one.

So the code would be as follows. Now, the user also wants me to generate the unit tests first. Let me think of test cases and write them as unit tests.

Possible tests:

Test case 1: Single part version.
Input: "0" → "1"
Input: "1" → "2"

Test case 2: Two part version.
Input: "1.2" → "1.3"
Input: "0.9" → "0.10"

Test case 3: Three parts.
Input: "1.2.3" → "1.2.4"
Input: "9.9.9" → "9.9.10"

Test case 4: Leading zeros in parts (but treated as numbers).
Input: "01.02.03" → "01.02.04" → but according to the first approach, the code would return "1.2.4". So this is a problem. Wait, the code splits into integers, so "01" becomes 1, so the output would be "1.2.4". But the test expects "01.02.04"? Or does it not?

Ah, this is the crux. The problem's docstring says "following existing pattern". So the existing pattern is the structure of the version, i.e., the number of parts and the separators. The leading zeros are part of the string, but when incremented, they may change. So the correct approach is to treat each part as a number, so leading zeros are lost. So in this case, the test would expect "1.2.4".

Alternatively, if the problem expects leading zeros to be preserved, then the code must handle that. But how?

In that case, the code would have to track the length of each part's string. For example:

def next_version(version):
    parts = version.split('.')
    # get the last part's value and its length
    last_part_str = parts[-1]
    last_num = int(last_part_str)
    new_num = last_num +1
    # format new_num with the same length as last_part_str, padding with leading zeros if needed
    new_str = f"{new_num:0{len(last_part_str)}d}"
    # replace the last part with new_str
    new_parts = parts[:-1] + [new_str]
    return '.'.join(new_parts)

Wait, that would handle leading zeros. For example:

Test case "01.02.03" → parts are ["01", "02", "03"], last_part_str is "03" (length 2). new_num is 4 → new_str is "04". So new parts are ["01", "02", "04"], joined as "01.02.04".

Another test case where the new number has more digits than the original:

Input "09.09" → last part is "09" (length 2). new_num is 10 → new_str is "10" (still length 2? No, 10 has two digits. Wait, 09 is length 2. 10 is two digits. So that's okay. But if input is "9.9", then the last part's length is 1. new_num 10 → formatted to 2 digits? No, because the original length is 1. So f"{10:01d}" would be 10, but that's two digits. Wait, no, the format string {01d} means pad with zeros to at least 1 digit. But 10 is two digits, so it would be "10". So the length would increase. But the existing pattern requires that the number of parts stays the same, but the length of individual parts can change? Or is the pattern including the length of each part?

Hmm, this complicates things. The problem's description is unclear. The user's function's docstring is "Given next version identifier following existing pattern". So the existing pattern probably refers to the number of parts and the separators. The leading zeros in individual parts are part of the pattern's formatting but when incrementing, leading zeros may drop if the number becomes longer. Or maybe not.

This is a bit ambiguous. But given the problem's possible intention, perhaps the first approach (without leading zeros) is better, unless the problem expects that leading zeros are kept.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the standard semantic versioning approach where parts are numbers, leading zeros are not considered. So the first approach is correct.

Therefore, the tests should be written under that assumption.

So let's write some test cases.

Test case 1: "1" → "2".

Test case 2: "0.9.9" → "0.9.10".

Test case 3: "2.0" → "2.1".

Test case 4: "9.9.9" → "9.9.10".

Test case 5: "0" → "1".

Test case 6: "1.2.3.4" → "1.2.3.5".

Edge case where incrementing causes a part to have more digits than before, like "9.9" → "9.10".

Another test case with leading zeros in parts but treated as numbers:

Input "01.002.003" → expected output is "1.2.4".

But if the test expects that, then the test would pass with the first approach.

Alternatively, if the test expects "01.002.004", then the first approach would fail. So the problem's requirements are unclear here.

Given that the problem's instruction says "following existing pattern", and given that the function's name is next_version, I think the standard approach is to treat each part as a number, leading zeros are lost, so the first approach is correct.

Therefore, the unit tests would be:

import unittest

class TestNextVersion(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_single_part(self):
        self.assertEqual(next_version("0"), "1")
        self.assertEqual(next_version("1"), "2")

    def test_two_parts(self):
        self.assertEqual(next_version("0.9"), "0.10")
        self.assertEqual(next_version("1.2"), "1.3")

    def test_three_parts(self):
        self.assertEqual(next_version("1.2.3"), "1.2.4")
        self.assertEqual(next_version("9.9.9"), "9.9.10")

    def test_multiple_parts(self):
        self.assertEqual(next_version("2.0.1.9"), "2.0.1.10")

    def test_zero_version(self):
        self.assertEqual(next_version("0"), "1")

    def test_edge_case(self):
        self.assertEqual(next_version("9.9"), "9.10")
        self.assertEqual(next_version("0.0.0"), "0.0.1")

    def test_leading_zeros(self):
        # Here, leading zeros are stripped in the output
        self.assertEqual(next_version("01.02.03"), "1.2.4")

Now, the code that passes these tests would be the function that splits into integers, increments, then joins as strings.

So the code would be:

def next_version(version):
    parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))
    parts[-1] += 1
    return '.'.join(map(str, parts))

Wait, but what about when the version is empty? Or invalid? But the problem probably assumes valid input.

Thus, the code is as above. So I need to output this code in Python markdown format, only the code.
