Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method validate_choices_args based on the given function signature and docstring. The user also mentioned using test-driven development, so I should first think about the unit tests before writing the actual code. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function's purpose is to check if the value of the given arguments (args) is one of the available choices. The parameter args is the received arguments. Hmm, so maybe this is part of a class where there are predefined choices for certain arguments, and this method validates that the provided arguments are within those choices.

First, I should think about how the function would work. Let's assume that the class has a dictionary or some structure that maps argument names to their allowed choices. The method would probably loop through each argument in args, check if that argument has allowed choices, and then verify if the provided value is in those choices. If any argument's value is not in the allowed choices, it should probably raise an error or return a boolean indicating validity.

Wait, the function's name is validate_choices_args, so maybe it's supposed to perform the check and possibly raise an exception if there's an invalid choice? Or maybe it returns a validation result? The docstring isn't clear on that. Since the user provided a function signature without a return type, maybe it's supposed to raise an error when invalid, and do nothing otherwise. That's a common pattern in validation methods.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each argument in args (the received arguments), check if that argument has a list of allowed choices. This would require the class to have a way to store the allowed choices for each argument. Maybe something like self.choices is a dictionary where keys are argument names and values are lists of allowed values.

2. For each arg in args:
   a. Get the value from args (since args is a dictionary? Or maybe it's a list of arguments? Wait, the parameter is named args. In Python, when a method receives args, it's often a dictionary like **kwargs, but here the parameter is called args. The docstring says "the received arguments" so perhaps it's a dictionary of argument names to their values.

3. For each key in args:
   i. Check if that key exists in the choices (like self.choices.get(arg_name, None)). If there are no choices defined for that argument, maybe it's okay.
   ii. If there are choices, check if the value is in the allowed list. If not, raise an error, perhaps a ValueError with a message indicating which argument is invalid and what the allowed choices are.

Now, to think about the tests. Since TDD is required, first write the tests.

First, the test case where all arguments are valid. For example, if choices are set for 'color' with ['red', 'blue'], and the args passed are {'color': 'red'}, then the method should do nothing.

Second, a test where an argument's value is not in the choices. Like {'color': 'green'}, which should raise an error. The test should assert that the error is raised with the correct message.

Third, test an argument that doesn't have any choices defined. If the argument 'size' isn't in self.choices, then it should pass without any issue.

Fourth, maybe test multiple arguments, some valid and some invalid. But in that case, the method should probably check all and raise an error if any are invalid. Or maybe it stops at the first one? The function's purpose is to validate all, so it should check all and collect errors? Hmm, but in a simple case, maybe it just checks each and raises as it goes. So the first invalid argument would trigger an error.

Wait, the function's name is validate_choices_args. Maybe it's supposed to process all arguments and collect all errors, but in the code, it's more straightforward to check each argument and raise immediately upon the first failure. Because raising an exception stops the process. So perhaps the function is designed to check each argument, and if any is invalid, raise an error.

So, in the test cases, we can test that when an invalid argument is present, the function raises an exception, and when all are valid, it does nothing.

Now, considering the class structure. The method is part of a class. So the class must have a way to store the allowed choices. Let's assume that the class has a __init__ method that sets self.choices as a dictionary. For example:

class SomeValidator:
    def __init__(self, choices):
        self.choices = choices

    def validate_choices_args(self, args):
        ...

In the tests, we can create an instance with certain choices and then call the method with different args.

So, the unit tests would be written using a testing framework like unittest or pytest. Since the user didn't specify, but in Python, unittest is common. Let me structure the tests using unittest.

First, the test for valid arguments:

def test_valid_choices(self):
    choices = {'color': ['red', 'blue'], 'size': ['small', 'medium']}
    validator = self.ValidatorClass(choices)
    args = {'color': 'red', 'size': 'medium'}
    validator.validate_choices_args(args)  # Should not raise any error.

Then, a test for invalid choice:

def test_invalid_choice(self):
    choices = {'color': ['red', 'blue']}
    validator = self.ValidatorClass(choices)
    args = {'color': 'green'}
    with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as cm:
        validator.validate_choices_args(args)
    self.assertEqual(str(cm.exception), "Invalid value 'green' for 'color'. Allowed choices: red, blue")

Another test for an argument without choices defined:

def test_argument_without_choices(self):
    choices = {'color': ['red', 'blue']}
    validator = self.ValidatorClass(choices)
    args = {'size': 'large'}  # 'size' not in choices, so it's okay.
    validator.validate_choices_args(args)  # Should not raise.

Wait, but in that case, since the argument is not in choices, the method should ignore it. So that's acceptable.

Another test case with multiple invalid arguments. But since the function might raise on the first one, the test could check that the first error is raised. Or maybe collect all errors and raise a combined message. But the code might be simpler to raise on the first occurrence.

Now, putting this into code. The actual code for the method would loop through each key in args, check if it's in self.choices. If it is, check if the value is in the allowed list. If not, raise a ValueError with the appropriate message.

Wait, but the function's parameter is called 'args'. The parameter is named args, but in Python, when you pass arguments, it's often a dictionary. So the args parameter is probably a dictionary of arguments.

Thus, the code would be something like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg_name, value in args.items():
        allowed = self.choices.get(arg_name)
        if allowed is not None and value not in allowed:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid value '{value}' for '{arg_name}'. Allowed choices: {', '.join(map(str, allowed))}")

Wait, but the function's docstring says "the received arguments" as the parameter, so the args parameter is the arguments to validate. The choices are stored in the instance (like self.choices).

Therefore, the code needs to loop over each argument in args (the dictionary), check if that argument's name exists in self.choices. If so, check if the value is in the allowed list. If not, raise ValueError with a message.

Now, considering edge cases:

- What if args is empty? Then the loop does nothing, so it's okay.

- What if a choice list is empty? Probably, but the code would check value in allowed, which is an empty list, so any value would be invalid. But that's up to the user's setup.

- What if allowed is None (the argument isn't in self.choices)? Then no check is done, which is correct.

Now, writing the code.

But the user's function signature is def validate_choices_args(self, args): so the code must be inside a class. The code must assume that the class has a 'choices' attribute, perhaps set in __init__.

So the code would be as I outlined above.

Now, the user also wants the code in Python markdown format, but only the code generated. So the final code would be the method's code, but within a class.

Wait, but the user's function is a method, so the code must be part of a class. However, the problem is that the user hasn't provided the full class structure. So perhaps the code should be written as the method, assuming that the class has the necessary attributes (like self.choices).

Therefore, the code for the method would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices. 
    :param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg_name, value in args.items():
        allowed = self.choices.get(arg_name)
        if allowed is not None and value not in allowed:
            raise ValueError(
                f"Invalid value '{value}' for '{arg_name}'. Allowed choices: {', '.join(map(str, allowed))}"
            )

Wait, but in the docstring, the parameters are described as "The received arguments." So the args parameter is a dictionary.

So that's the code. But to make sure, the test-driven approach requires writing tests first. But the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the signature and docstring, so the code is as above.

Wait, but in the code above, the loop is over args.items(), which requires that args is a dictionary. So the parameter args is a dictionary. That's acceptable.

Another possible edge case: if the allowed list is not a list, but a set or tuple. But the code uses 'in allowed', so that's okay.

Yes, this should work. So the final code is as written.
