Okay, I need to write a Python function called _dictsum that takes a list of dictionaries and sums the values for each common key. Let's see. The example given is two dictionaries, but the function probably works with any number of them. 

First, I should think about how to approach this. The function needs to iterate through each dictionary in the input list, then for each key in those dictionaries, accumulate their values into a result dictionary. 

Wait, right. So the steps would be: initialize a result dict. For each dict in the input list, loop through its keys. For each key, add the value to the result's entry. If the key isn't in the result yet, start a new entry with that value.

But how to handle different data types? The example uses integers, but what if other types are present? The problem statement says "sum values", so I think all values should be numbers. So perhaps the function can assume that all values are numeric (int or float) and just proceed. No error checking needed unless specified. The docstring doesn't mention it, so probably just proceed.

Now, the input is called 'dicts' which is a list of dictionaries. So the function's parameter is a list of dicts.

Let me think about possible edge cases. What if the list is empty? Then return an empty dict. What if some dictionaries have keys others don't? Those keys just get their single value. What if a key appears in multiple dicts but with different types? Like one is a string and another an int? Then adding would cause an error. But again, the problem says "sum", so maybe the function assumes all values for a key are summable (like same type, or at least compatible). The example uses integers, so perhaps we can proceed under that assumption.

Now, the unit tests. Since the user mentioned TDD, first write tests. Let's think of test cases:

1. The example given: two dicts with overlapping keys. The sum should be correct.
2. Empty list of dicts: returns empty dict.
3. One dict in the list: returns the same dict (but maybe as a new dict? Because modifying the original isn't done).
4. Different keys in different dicts: like one has 'a', another 'b', so the sum has both.
5. Zero in one of the values, like in the example's 'b' being 0, so sum remains 2.
6. Negative numbers, or larger numbers to test that it's not just simple addition.
7. Different data types? Wait, but maybe that's beyond the scope. The problem might not require handling that, so perhaps the tests can stick to numbers.

So for the tests, using the unittest module, perhaps:

Test case 1: example input. The output should be {'a':6, 'b':2}.

Test case 2: empty input. So _dictsum([]) returns {}.

Test case3: single dict. Let's say input is [ {'x':3} ] then the output is same as that dict.

Test case4: different keys. Like [{'x':1}, {'y':2}] → {'x':1, 'y':2}.

Test case5: overlapping and new keys. Like [{'a':1, 'b':2}, {'a':3, 'c':4}] → {'a':4, 'b':2, 'c':4}.

Test case6: zero values. Like [{'a':0}, {'a':5}] → {'a':5}.

Test case7: multiple dicts with same keys. Like three dicts each with 'a':1 → sum is 3.

Now, how to structure the code. The function:

Start with an empty result dict. For each d in dicts:

   for key, value in d.items():

       result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + value

Wait, but what if the initial value is 0? Like if a key hasn't been in the result before, then get returns 0. So that should work. But what if the value is a float? Like if one of the values is 1.5, then adding to 0 (int) would be okay, as in Python that would become a float. So the code should handle that automatically.

Yes, this approach should work.

Now, code:

def _dictsum(dicts):
    result = {}
    for d in dicts:
        for key, value in d.items():
            result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + value
    return result

Wait, but what if the input is not a list of dicts? The function's parameter is called 'dicts', so perhaps the code expects that. The problem's docstring says "sum values with the same key in the dictionaries", so the parameter is a list of dictionaries. So the code can assume that.

So that's the code.

Now, the user wants the code in a Python markdown format, but just the code. So the code block with the function.

But first, the tests. Wait, the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but using TDD. So the process is to first write tests, then code. But the user is asking for the code (the function) here, not the tests. The tests are part of the TDD process but the code to output is the function.

So the code to output is the _dictsum function as above.
