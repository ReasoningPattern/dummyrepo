Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _get_err_indices method based on the given docstring. The function's purpose is to find all error indexes corresponding to a coord_name. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since the user mentioned test-driven development, I should start by writing unit tests. But the problem says to output only the code, so maybe I can skip that part here and focus on the actual code. Wait, the instructions say to generate the code based on the signature and docstring. Let me see.

The method is an instance method, so it has 'self' as the first parameter. The parameter is coord_name, which is a string. The goal is to find error indices related to that coordinate name. 

Hmm, I need to figure out what data structures or attributes the class might have. Since the method is part of a class, perhaps there's an errors dictionary or a list that tracks errors by coordinate names. For example, maybe the class has an attribute like self.errors which is a dictionary where each key is a coordinate name and the value is a list of indices where errors occurred for that coordinate.

So the _get_err_indices function would look up the coord_name in self.errors and return the list of indices. If the coord_name isn't present, maybe return an empty list or raise an error? The docstring says "find all error indexes", so probably returning an empty list if none are found makes sense.

Wait, maybe the errors are stored in a different structure. Like, perhaps each error is stored with its coordinate name and index, so the method needs to collect all the indices where the coord_name matches. 

Alternatively, maybe the class has a list of errors, each being a dictionary with 'coord_name' and 'index' fields. Then, the function would iterate through all errors, collect indices where the coord_name matches. But that's a different structure. 

The most straightforward approach would be assuming that self.errors is a dictionary mapping coord names to lists of indices. So the code would be something like:

def _get_err_indices(self, coord_name):
    return self.errors.get(coord_name, [])

But maybe the problem expects more complexity. Let me think again. The function is part of a class, so perhaps the errors are stored in a different way. For example, maybe each error has an index and a coordinate name, so the class has a list of all errors, and the method filters that list.

In that case, the code would be:

def _get_err_indices(self, coord_name):
    return [err['index'] for err in self.errors if err['coord_name'] == coord_name]

But without knowing the exact data structure, the first approach (using a dictionary) is more efficient and straightforward. So assuming that the errors are stored as a dictionary, the code is simple.

Alternatively, maybe the method needs to check some other attributes. But given the information, the first approach is better. Let me proceed with that.

So the code would check if the coord_name is in self.errors, and return the list. If not, return an empty list. Using the get method with default as empty list.

Wait, but what if the errors dict could have None values? Probably not. So the code would be as written before.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

def _get_err_indices(self, coord_name):
    """
    Find all error indexes corresponding to coord_name.
    """
    return self.errors.get(coord_name, [])

But I need to make sure that the method is correctly implemented. Let me also consider edge cases. For example, if coord_name is not present in self.errors, then it returns an empty list, which is correct.

Alternatively, if the errors are stored in another way, but given the information, this seems the most logical approach. I think this should be the code.
