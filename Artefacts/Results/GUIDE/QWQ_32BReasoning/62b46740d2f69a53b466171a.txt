Okay, so I need to generate the Python code for the pretty() method based on the provided function signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding what the user is asking for here. The method is supposed to return a pretty-formatted string representation of the object. The parameters are indent and debug. 

Looking at the docstring's example, it seems like the method constructs a string that includes the class name, some debug details (if debug is True), and the object's representation. The obj part is formatted as a string if it's a string, otherwise using repr(). Then, there's an indentation based on the indent parameter.

First, I should parse the docstring's code example. The example shows:
return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Wait, the actual code in the docstring's example might have some typos or missing parts. Let me re-read the problem. The user provided the function signature and the docstring. The docstring includes some code that might be part of the desired implementation. The return line in the docstring's example shows how to format the string, but there's a mention of debug_details which isn't defined in the example. So I need to figure out how to compute that.

Hmm, the debug parameter is supposed to include debug details. Maybe debug_details is a variable that's only present when debug is True. Let me think. The code in the docstring's return line probably expects that when debug is True, some additional information is added, otherwise it's omitted. So perhaps the debug_details is something like a string that includes other attributes of the object when in debug mode.

Wait, the problem statement's code block shows the return line as part of the function's implementation. The user probably wants the pretty() method to be implemented such that:

- The obj is formatted as a string (enclosed in quotes) if it's a string, else use repr().
- The debug_details would be something like including the object's __dict__ or other attributes when debug is True. But since the example's return line includes debug_details in the string, but the code provided in the docstring doesn't show how it's computed, perhaps I need to infer that.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is just an empty string when debug is False, and when True, it adds some details. The exact details might be part of the problem's requirement. Let me look again at the problem's description.

The problem's docstring says: "Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})" "

Wait, the docstring's content seems to include some code lines. The first line after the description is an assignment to obj. Then the return line. So the actual code for the method is supposed to follow that structure. So the method's code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Wait, but where is debug_details coming from? Because in this code, debug_details is used in the f-string but not defined. That suggests there's a missing part here. Maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring, and the actual code should have some condition based on the debug flag to include additional details.

Alternatively, perhaps debug_details is a variable that's set conditionally. Let me think: maybe when debug is True, debug_details includes some extra information, like other attributes of the object, and when it's False, it's an empty string. So the code would need to compute debug_details based on the debug flag.

Wait, in the problem's example code, the return line uses debug_details, but that variable isn't defined in the code shown. So that must be part of the actual code that needs to be written. So perhaps the user expects that debug_details is a string that is empty unless debug is True, in which case it includes some details.

So putting it all together, the method should:

1. Check if self.obj is a string. If so, format it with single quotes, else use repr().
2. If debug is True, include some debug information (maybe the __dict__ or other attributes) in the debug_details variable.
3. The final string is the class name, followed by the debug_details (if any), then the obj, all indented by ' ' * indent.

But how exactly to compute the debug_details? Since the problem's docstring shows that the return line includes {debug_details}{obj}, perhaps when debug is False, debug_details is an empty string, and when True, it's something like a comma-separated list of attributes. Alternatively, maybe it's a string like "debug: ...".

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's only present when debug is True. For example, in the code:

if debug:
    debug_details = f"debug=True, id={id(self)}, "
else:
    debug_details = ""

Then, in the f-string, it would include that. But the problem's example code in the docstring doesn't have this, so perhaps I need to infer that the debug_details is part of the implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and the debug_details variable is actually the debug parameter, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake and the code should have debug_details as a variable that's set based on the debug flag.

Let me think of possible scenarios. The problem's docstring shows the code:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if ... else repr(self.obj)
return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the debug_details must be a variable that's constructed before the return. Since the user's example includes that variable, but doesn't show how it's computed, perhaps the actual code needs to include that.

Assuming that when debug is True, debug_details includes some extra info, like the object's id or other attributes. Since the problem's description is a bit unclear, perhaps the debug_details is an empty string unless debug is True, in which case it adds some debug info. For example, maybe debug_details is "debug=True, " or includes other attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is the string "debug: " or something else. Since the problem's example code is incomplete, perhaps I need to make an assumption here.

Wait, perhaps the debug_details is supposed to be an empty string when debug is False, and when True, it's a string that includes additional attributes of the object. For example, maybe it's a string like "debug=True, obj_id=id(self), " so that the output includes those details.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is just an empty string unless debug is True, in which case it adds a comma and some other info. But without more info, I need to proceed with the best guess.

Another possibility is that the debug_details is a string that is empty unless debug is True, in which case it adds some attributes. For instance, maybe it's something like " debug=True" or includes the object's __dict__.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that when debug is True, it adds a comma and some details, like " debug=True, obj=obj" but that would conflict with the obj variable.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended for the debug_details to be a string that is empty unless debug is True, in which case it adds something like " (debug)".

Alternatively, maybe the problem's code is missing a line that defines debug_details. Let me think of possible code structure.

The code in the docstring's example starts with:

def pretty(...):
    obj = ...
    return ...f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the missing part is the definition of debug_details. The code must have that variable.

So perhaps:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if ... else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = ""
    if debug:
        debug_details = " debug=True, "  # or some other info
    return ... 

Alternatively, maybe debug_details is a string that, when debug is True, includes other attributes. For example, the object's __dict__ except for 'obj'? Or perhaps it's just a placeholder that the user expects to be empty unless debug is True.

Since the problem's description is a bit unclear, perhaps the debug_details is simply an empty string unless debug is True, in which case it adds a comma and some info. Let's suppose that when debug is True, the debug_details includes something like "debug=True, " followed by other attributes. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the simplest approach is to set debug_details to an empty string when not in debug mode, and when in debug mode, include some relevant info.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that debug_details is the string " debug=True" when the debug flag is set, but that would require checking.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is not needed and the user made a typo, and the code should have something else. But given the problem's code example, I need to work with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a mistake and the code should have something like:

if debug:
    debug_part = f"debug={debug}, "
else:
    debug_part = ""
return ... f"{debug_part}{obj}"

Wait, but in that case, the return would be something like Class(debug=True, 'obj'). But the problem's example shows that the obj is part of the string. So perhaps the debug details are additional parameters inside the parentheses, separated by commas. So when debug is True, the debug_details would be something like " debug=True, " and then the obj is added after. So the final string would be "Class(debug=True, 'obj')" with indentation.

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is just the string "debug" when debug is True, so that the output includes that. But without more info, I'll proceed by assuming that when debug is True, the debug_details is "debug=True, " and otherwise it's an empty string. 

Wait, but the problem's code example in the docstring includes the return line with debug_details and then the obj. So the total inside the parentheses would be debug_details followed by obj. So if debug is True, then the debug_details would add something before the obj. For example, if debug_details is "id=..., ", then the obj comes after. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that when debug is True, adds some attributes, and when not, is empty. Let's suppose that the debug_details is the empty string unless debug is True, in which case it's a string like "debug=True, id=...".

But since the problem's example doesn't specify, perhaps the minimal approach is to set debug_details to an empty string when not in debug mode, and when in debug mode, add a comma and some info. Since the problem's example uses debug_details in the string, perhaps the code should have:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    debug_details = ""
    if debug:
        # add some debug info here. For example, the id of the object?
        debug_details = f"id={id(self)}, "
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

This way, when debug is True, the debug_details includes the id and a comma, so the output would be something like "ClassName(id=..., 'obj')". When debug is False, the debug_details is empty, so it's "ClassName('obj')".

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is supposed to be "debug=True, " when debug is set, so that the output includes that. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is not needed and it's a mistake in the problem's example. But given the problem's code, I have to include that variable. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem's code in the docstring is part of the desired implementation. So the user's code example shows that the debug_details variable is used but not defined. Therefore, I need to define it based on the debug parameter.

Perhaps the correct approach is to set debug_details as follows: when debug is True, it includes some information like the object's id or other attributes. For example:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    debug_details = ""
    if debug:
        debug_details = f"debug=True, id={id(self)}, "  # add other attributes if needed
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

This way, the debug_details adds some debug info when enabled. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is empty when not in debug mode, and when in debug mode, adds a comma and some attributes. 

Now, considering that the problem requires generating the code based on the given function signature and docstring, and the user's example code shows that the debug_details is used but not defined, I need to make sure that the code properly defines that variable.

Another possible approach: perhaps the debug_details is the string " (debug)" when debug is True. But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that the debug_details is the string "debug=True" when debug is True, and thus the parentheses would have "debug=True,obj" but that would need a comma. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that when debug is True, it adds a comma and some info, and otherwise is empty. For instance:

if debug:
    debug_details = f"debug=True, "
else:
    debug_details = ""

Then the return line would have the class name, followed by the debug_details and the obj. So the total inside the parentheses would be the debug details plus the obj. 

But how does that look? Suppose the obj is 'hello', and debug is True, then the string would be "Class(debug=True, 'hello')". That makes sense. 

So that's probably the correct approach. The debug_details would be an empty string unless debug is True, in which case it adds "debug=True, " before the obj. 

Therefore, the code should first set debug_details to that. 

Putting it all together:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    debug_details = ""
    if debug:
        debug_details = "debug=True, "
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Wait, but in the problem's example, the return line is written as f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})", so the debug_details and obj are concatenated. So if debug is True, the parentheses would have "debug=True, obj's value", but the obj's value is either in quotes or via repr. 

This should work. 

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven approach: first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. 

So first, I need to think of the unit tests. Let's think of different scenarios:

Test case 1: obj is a string. 

Example: self.obj is "test", debug is False, indent is 0. The output should be "ClassName('test')".

Test case 2: obj is an integer, say 42. debug is False, so the output is "ClassName(42)".

Test case 3: debug is True. Then the output should include "debug=True, " before the obj. So for a string "test", it would be "ClassName(debug=True, 'test')".

Test case 4: indent is 2, so leading spaces. 

Test case 5: Check that the class name is correctly used.

Edge case: obj is a string with quotes, like 'a"b', so the representation would be with escaped quotes? Wait, since we're using f"'{self.obj}'", that would put the string inside single quotes. So if the string has a single quote, it would need escaping, but using the f-string might not handle that properly. Wait, maybe the correct way is to use repr() for strings. Wait the problem says: "obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)". 

Wait, that line in the docstring's code example uses f"'{self.obj}'", which is putting the string in single quotes, but if the string contains single quotes, that would cause issues. But perhaps the problem expects that, so the code should follow that. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct way is to use repr(self.obj) for strings as well. But according to the problem's code example, the first part uses f"'{self.obj}'", which is not the same as repr(). For example, if the string is "hello", then using f"'hello'" would give 'hello', but using repr("hello") also gives 'hello'. However, if the string contains a single quote, like "he's", then using f"'he's'" would produce 'he's' which is invalid syntax, but using repr() would give '"he\'s"'.

Wait, perhaps the problem's code is using a simplified approach where for strings, it just wraps in single quotes, but that might not handle all cases correctly. However, the problem's docstring shows that code, so I have to follow it. 

So the code for obj is as per the problem's example. 

Now, the unit tests would need to cover these cases. 

So, the unit tests would look something like this (assuming the class is called SomeClass):

class TestPrettyMethod(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_string_obj_no_debug(self):
        obj = SomeClass(obj="test")
        expected = "SomeClass('test')"
        self.assertEqual(obj.pretty(), expected)

    def test_int_obj_no_debug(self):
        obj = SomeClass(obj=42)
        expected = "SomeClass(42)"
        self.assertEqual(obj.pretty(), expected)

    def test_string_obj_with_debug(self):
        obj = SomeClass(obj="test")
        expected = "SomeClass(debug=True, 'test')"
        self.assertEqual(obj.pretty(debug=True), expected)

    def test_indent(self):
        obj = SomeClass(obj="indented")
        expected = "  SomeClass('indented')"  # two spaces
        self.assertEqual(obj.pretty(indent=2), expected)

    def test_combined(self):
        obj = SomeClass(obj="test")
        expected = "    SomeClass(debug=True, 'test')"
        self.assertEqual(obj.pretty(indent=4, debug=True), expected)

    def test_non_string_with_debug(self):
        obj = SomeClass(obj=[1,2,3])
        expected = "SomeClass(debug=True, [1, 2, 3])"
        self.assertEqual(obj.pretty(debug=True), expected)

But also need to ensure that the class name is correctly used. 

Wait, but how is the class structured? The code is a method of a class, so the tests would need to create instances of that class with an obj attribute. 

So the test setup would involve creating a class with an obj attribute. For example:

class SomeClass:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.obj = obj

    def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
        # the code here

So the tests would use SomeClass instances. 

Now, generating the tests first, then the code. 

But the user wants me to output the code only, in Python markdown format. So perhaps I should first write the code for the pretty() method as per the above reasoning. 

Wait, let me recheck the problem's code example again. The docstring says:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    """
    Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
    """

Wait, the docstring's content is written as a comment, but the code lines are part of the docstring's content? Or is the docstring's content the description plus the code lines? Because in the problem statement, the user shows the docstring as including those code lines. So perhaps the code inside the docstring is part of the function's implementation. So the actual code should have:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But that's missing the definition of debug_details. So the problem's example is incomplete. Therefore, the user must have made an error in the docstring's code example. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details variable is a mistake, and the correct code should have something else. Let me think again. 

Looking at the problem's docstring, perhaps the line after the description is the actual code lines. The first line is:

obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)

Then the return line. So the code for the method is those two lines. But then, the return line uses debug_details which isn't defined. So that must be part of the problem's mistake. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a typo and should be something else. Like maybe it's supposed to be an empty string, and the code should have:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({obj})"

But that would ignore the debug parameter. So that can't be right. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is part of the parameters, but no. 

Hmm, this is a bit of a problem. Since the code in the docstring is incomplete, perhaps the intended code is that debug_details is an empty string when debug is False, and something else when True. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that is " debug=True" when the debug flag is set, but then the return line would have the class name followed by ( debug=True, obj). 

Wait, perhaps the correct code is that debug_details is a string that is empty unless debug is True, in which case it is " debug=True". But then the obj would come after. 

Wait, looking at the return line in the problem's example:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

So the contents inside the parentheses are the concatenation of debug_details and obj. 

Therefore, when debug is True, debug_details must be a string that, when combined with obj, forms the desired content. 

Perhaps the debug_details is the string "debug=True, " when debug is True, and empty otherwise. 

Therefore, the code should have:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    debug_details = ""
    if debug:
        debug_details = "debug=True, "
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

This makes sense. That's the code I should generate. 

Now, the tests would check that when debug is True, the debug_details is added. 

Now, the user also mentioned to follow a test-driven approach, first writing the tests, then the code. But the problem asks to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So I need to write the code for the pretty() method as per the above reasoning. 

So the final code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    debug_details = "debug=True, " if debug else ""
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

Wait, that's better. Using a conditional expression to set debug_details to "debug=True, " when debug is True, else an empty string. 

Yes, that should work. 

Let me check the test cases again with this code:

Test case 1: no debug, string obj:

debug_details is empty. The obj is 'test' → formatted as 'test'. The class name is SomeClass. So the return is "SomeClass('test')".

Test case 2: debug=True, string:

debug_details is "debug=True, " → the return is "SomeClass(debug=True, 'test')".

Test case 3: non-string obj (like 42):

obj is 42 → repr(42) is '42', so the return with debug is "SomeClass(debug=True, 42)".

Yes, that's correct. 

So the code is as above. 

Therefore, the generated Python code for the pretty() method is:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    debug_details = "debug=True, " if debug else ""
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

I think this is correct.
