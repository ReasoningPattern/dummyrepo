Okay, I need to write a Python function called `_extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element` that takes an `issue` parameter and returns possible values for number and sup from the issue's contents. Hmm, first I should figure out what the input `issue` looks like. Since the function's docstring mentions "contents of issue," maybe it's a string or some structured data like a dictionary?

Wait, the function name suggests that it's parsing an element related to an issue, perhaps from some structured data like an HTML element or a parsed JSON object. Maybe the `issue` is a dictionary with keys like 'number' and 'sup'? Or maybe it's text that needs to be parsed for numbers and supplements?

The function's purpose is to extract possible values. So maybe the issue contains some text that has a number and a supplement, and the function needs to parse that text into those components. For example, if the issue is a string like "Vol 5, Suppl 2", then number would be '5' and sup would be '2'? Or maybe the format varies, so the function has to handle different cases.

Since the user mentioned generating unit tests first using TDD, I should think of possible test cases first. Let me think of some scenarios:

Test Case 1: The issue has a straightforward number and supplement. Like "12 Suppl 3" → number '12', sup '3'.

Test Case 2: The issue has only a number, no supplement. Like "7" → number '7', sup None or empty string?

Test Case 3: The issue has a supplement but no number? Unlikely, but maybe "Suppl 4" → number None, sup '4'?

Test Case 4: The issue has both but in a different format, like "3-4 Suppl 5a" → maybe number '3-4', sup '5a'? Need to see how to parse hyphens or other characters.

Test Case 5: The issue is empty or invalid, returns None for both?

Hmm, the function's return is "possible values", so maybe it returns a tuple (number, sup), where each could be a string or None.

Now, how to parse the input. Let's assume the input is a string. The function needs to extract the number part and the supplement part. The number might come before "Suppl" or "Supplement". Maybe using regular expressions?

The regex could look for a number pattern before "suppl" and another after. Like:

Looking for something like (\d+)[^suppl]*suppl[^d]*(\d+), but case-insensitive. Or maybe split the string into parts.

Alternatively, split on "suppl" and then take the parts before and after. For example:

Split the string into two parts at "suppl" (case insensitive?), then the first part is the number, and the second is the supplement.

But need to handle variations in case and spacing. Like "Suppl 2" or "suppl2" or "Supplement 3".

Maybe the regex would be something like:

r'(?i)(.*?)(?:suppl|supplement)\s*(\d+)' 

Wait, let me think. The pattern could look for "suppl" or "supplement" (case-insensitive), then capture the number after it. The part before the keyword is the number, and the part after is the supplement.

Wait, but the number could be before the keyword. So for example, in "Vol 5, Suppl 2", the number is 5, the sup is 2. So the regex would need to capture the number before "suppl" and the number after.

So perhaps split the string into two parts: everything before "suppl" and the part after. Then process each part to extract numbers.

Alternatively, the regex could be:

r'(?i)(.*?)(?:suppl|supplement)\s*(\d+)' 

This would match any characters before the "suppl" or "supplement", then capture the digits after. The first group would be the number part (before the keyword), and the second group is the supplement.

Wait, but the first part might have non-numeric characters. So we need to extract the number from the first group. For example, in "Vol 5, Suppl 2", the first group would be "Vol 5, " and we need to extract "5".

Hmm, this is getting a bit complex. Maybe the approach is:

1. Look for the presence of "suppl" or "supplement" in the string, case-insensitive.

2. Split the string into parts before and after the "suppl" keyword.

3. The part before the keyword is the number part. Extract the first number from that part.

4. The part after the keyword is the supplement part. Extract the first number from that part.

Alternatively, maybe the number is the first number found in the entire string, and the supplement is the next number after the keyword.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is everything before the keyword, stripped of non-numeric characters, and the supplement is the number after.

Wait, perhaps the function can be structured as follows:

- Search the input string for the keyword "suppl" or "supplement".

- Split into two parts: before and after.

- The number is the first numeric part in the before part.

- The supplement is the first numeric part in the after part.

But how to handle cases where the keyword isn't present? Then maybe the entire string is the number, and no supplement.

So steps:

1. Convert the input to lowercase to make it case-insensitive.

2. Find the index of the first occurrence of "suppl" or "supplement".

3. If found, split into before and after.

4. Extract number from before part: find the first sequence of digits.

5. Extract supplement from after part: first sequence of digits.

6. If not found, then the supplement is None, and the number is the first digits in the entire string.

Wait, but the input could have multiple numbers. Like "12-3 Suppl 4a5" → number could be "12-3" or just the first number "12", and the supplement "4".

Hmm, perhaps the number is the first numeric part before the keyword, and the supplement is the first numeric part after.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is the first numeric part in the entire string, and the supplement is the next numeric part after the keyword.

Alternatively, maybe the function just looks for the first number in the string as the number, and the next number after "suppl" as the supplement.

Alternatively, perhaps the function uses regex to capture both numbers.

Let me think of a regex approach:

The regex could be something like:

r'(?i)(\d+).*?(?:suppl|supplement).*?(\d+)'

This would capture the first number before the keyword, and the first number after the keyword.

But this might not work if there are numbers between the first and the keyword, or after.

Alternatively, maybe:

r'(?i)(\d+).*?(?:suppl|supplement).*?(\d+)'

Wait, but that would require that the first number is before the keyword, and the second is after. But how to handle cases where there are multiple numbers before?

Alternatively, the regex could look for any digits before the keyword (capturing the last one?), or the first digits before.

Alternatively, perhaps split on the keyword and process each part.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Check if the issue string contains "suppl" or "supplement" (case-insensitive).

   - If not, then the supplement is None. The number is the first number found in the entire string.

   - If yes, split into before_part and after_part.

      - The number is the first number in before_part.

      - The supplement is the first number in after_part.

But how to extract the first number from a string?

To get the first number in a string, we can use a regex like r'\d+', find the first occurrence.

So for example:

def get_first_number(s):
    match = re.search(r'\d+', s)
    return match.group(0) if match else None

So putting it all together:

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    # Assuming issue is a string.
    # Let's process it.
    import re

    number = None
    supplement = None

    # Check for 'suppl' or 'supplement' in the string, case-insensitive.
    match = re.search(r'(?i)(suppl|supplement)', issue)
    if match:
        # Split into before and after parts.
        before = issue[:match.start()]
        after = issue[match.end():]

        # Extract number from before part.
        number_match = re.search(r'\d+', before)
        if number_match:
            number = number_match.group()

        # Extract supplement from after part.
        supplement_match = re.search(r'\d+', after)
        if supplement_match:
            supplement = supplement_match.group()
    else:
        # No supplement keyword found. Look for the first number in the entire string.
        number_match = re.search(r'\d+', issue)
        if number_match:
            number = number_match.group()

    return (number, supplement)

Wait, but maybe the keyword is part of a larger word, like 'supplements'? The regex would still match 'suppl' as the first part. Hmm, but the 'supplement' part in the regex would capture 'supplement' as a full word.

Alternatively, maybe the regex should look for the exact word, but that complicates things. Alternatively, the current approach is okay.

Now, considering some test cases:

Test case 1: "Vol 5, Suppl 2" → before is "Vol 5, ", after is "2". So number is "5", supplement "2".

Test case 2: "7" → no match, so number is "7".

Test case3: "Suppl 4" → the before part is empty (since the match starts at 0). So number is None, but after is "4", so supplement "4". But the function would return (None, "4"). Is that acceptable?

Hmm, maybe in that case, the number is considered to be missing, but the supplement is present. That's possible.

Another test case: "12 Suppl 3a5" → number is "12", supplement "3".

Another case: "Issue 4-5, Supplement 6" → split on "Supplement", before is "Issue 4-5,", so number is "4" (first digit?), or "4-5"? Wait, the regex for number would find the first occurrence of digits. So in "4-5", the first number is "4", but maybe we want to capture "4-5" as the number? Hmm, perhaps the function should capture all digits and hyphens? Or maybe the number can include hyphens, like in "4-5" is the number.

Hmm, perhaps the regex for extracting numbers should include hyphens? Like [\d-]+ ?

Wait, the current code uses \d+, which only matches digits. So "4-5" would be split into "4" and "5", but the first occurrence would be "4".

So in "Issue 4-5, Supplement 6", the number would be "4" and the supplement "6".

But maybe the number should be "4-5" as a single number. So perhaps the regex for numbers should be more flexible, like [\d-]+ ?

Alternatively, the problem's requirements might consider the number as the first sequence of digits, ignoring hyphens.

Hmm, perhaps the function should return whatever the first digits are, even if they are part of a hyphenated range. But the problem's description is vague, so perhaps the code should capture the first contiguous digits.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyphen is part of the number. So maybe the regex for numbers should be [\d-]+?

In that case, the regex for extracting the number would be r'[\d-]+'.

So modifying the get_first_number function to:

re.search(r'[\d-]+', s)

But then, in "Vol 5-6, Suppl 2", the number would be "5-6".

That might be better.

So adjusting the code:

In the code:

number_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', before)

supplement_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', after)

Wait, but maybe the supplement can also have letters? Like "3a".

In the example "Suppl 3a5", the first number after would be "3a5"? Or perhaps only digits? The problem's description says "number and sup", so maybe sup can be alphanumeric? The function's return is "possible values", so perhaps it should capture the first sequence of digits and letters?

Alternatively, the supplement is any characters after the keyword, but the function captures the first number (digits) there.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is okay, but the problem is a bit ambiguous. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I have to make assumptions.

Another test case: "Suppl 2a" → after part is "2a", so the first digits are "2".

So supplement would be "2".

Now, let's think of edge cases:

Test Case 4: "Suppl 2a" → number is None, supplement "2".

Test Case 5: "123Suppl456" → split at "Suppl", before is "123", after is "456", so number "123", supplement "456".

Test Case 6: "No number here Suppl 7" → number None, supplement "7".

Test Case 7: "Vol 10-Suppl 2" → the "Suppl" is part of the keyword. The before part is "Vol 10-", so the number is "10".

So the code would handle that.

Now, considering writing the unit tests first.

The user said to generate the tests first. So for example, in the test module, using pytest:

def test_extract_number_and_supplement():

    # Test case 1: both present
    issue = "Vol 5, Suppl 2"
    expected = ("5", "2")
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Test case 2: only number
    issue = "7"
    expected = ("7", None)
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Test case 3: only supplement
    issue = "Suppl 4"
    expected = (None, "4")
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Test case 4: hyphenated number
    issue = "Issue 4-5, Supplement 6"
    expected = ("4-5", "6")
    # Wait, in the code's current regex, the number would be the first digits? Or first [\d-]+?

    Wait, in the code, the regex for the number is [\d-]+?

    Wait, in the code I wrote earlier, the regex is using \d+, so in "Issue 4-5", the first number is "4".

    So the test case would expect ("4", "6"), but if the code is modified to use [\d-]+, then it would capture "4-5".

    Hmm, so I need to decide what the regex should be. Let's see.

The user's function is supposed to return "possible values of number and sup". So perhaps the number can include hyphens, like "4-5".

Thus, the regex for the number should include hyphens between digits.

So the regex for numbers should be r'[\d-]+', which captures sequences of digits and hyphens.

Therefore, in the code:

number_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', before)

supplement_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', after)

Wait, but that would also match things like "12-34-5" as a single number. Which is okay.

So revising the code:

Now, the code would need to use that regex.

So the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    number = None
    supplement = None

    # Search for the keyword in a case-insensitive manner
    keyword_match = re.search(r'(?i)(suppl|supplement)', issue)
    if keyword_match:
        before_part = issue[:keyword_match.start()]
        after_part = issue[keyword_match.end():]

        # Extract number from before_part
        number_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', before_part)
        if number_match:
            number = number_match.group()

        # Extract supplement from after_part
        supplement_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', after_part)
        if supplement_match:
            supplement = supplement_match.group()
    else:
        # Look for the first number in the entire string
        number_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', issue)
        if number_match:
            number = number_match.group()

    return (number, supplement)

Wait, but the supplement could have letters? Like "Suppl 2a". The regex here would capture "2a" if using [\d-]+? No, because letters aren't included. Wait, the regex is [\d-]+ so letters are excluded. So in "Suppl 2a", after_part is "2a", the first [\d-]+ is "2".

Thus supplement would be "2".

So that's acceptable.

Now, testing the case where the supplement has letters:

Test case 8: "Suppl 3a5" → the after_part is "3a5", so the first [\d-]+ is "3".

Thus supplement is "3".

Hmm, but maybe the user wants the entire numeric part including letters? But the problem's description says "number and sup from the contents", so perhaps the sup is whatever comes after the keyword, but the code is capturing the first numeric sequence.

Okay, proceeding with that.

Now, the test case for "Issue 4-5, Supplement 6" would now return ("4-5", "6"), which is better.

Another test case: "123-Suppl456" → before_part is "123-", so the number is "123-"? Wait, no. Because the regex is [\d-]+, so "123-" would match "123-" because it has digits and hyphen. So the number would be "123-".

Hmm, but maybe that's not intended. For example, in "123-Suppl456", the before_part is "123-", so the number is "123-".

But maybe the hyphen at the end is part of the number. So that's acceptable.

Another test case: "Vol 10-Suppl 2" → before_part is "Vol 10-", so the regex finds "10-" as the number? Or "10"?

Wait, the regex is [\d-]+. So "Vol 10-" → the first occurrence of digits and hyphens is "10-".

So number would be "10-".

Hmm, but maybe the hyphen is not part of the number here. So maybe the regex should be looking for digits possibly followed by hyphens and digits?

Alternatively, maybe the number is the first sequence of digits, ignoring non-digits except hyphens between digits.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to capture any sequence of digits and hyphens that form a number, but perhaps the hyphen must be between digits. But that complicates the regex.

Alternatively, perhaps the number can be any combination of digits and hyphens, even if the hyphen is at the start or end, but the function's job is to return whatever is found.

Well, given the problem's lack of specifics, I think the current approach is okay.

Now, writing the tests:

def test_extract_number_and_supplement():

    # Test case 1: both present
    issue = "Vol 5, Suppl 2"
    expected = ("5", "2")
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Test case . only number
    issue = "7"
    expected = ("7", None)
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Test case 3: only supplement
    issue = "Suppl 4"
    expected = (None, "4")
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Test case 4: hyphenated number
    issue = "Issue 4-5, Supplement 6"
    expected = ("4-5", "6")
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Test case 5: supplement with letters
    issue = "Suppl 2a"
    expected = (None, "2")
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Test case 6: no supplement keyword
    issue = "10a"
    expected = ("10", None)
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Edge case: keyword at the start
    issue = "Supplement 3"
    expected = (None, "3")
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

    # Edge case: multiple numbers before
    issue = "Vol 1 and 2, Suppl 3"
    expected = ("1", "3")  # because the first number is 1
    assert _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue) == expected

Wait in that last case, "Vol 1 and 2, Suppl 3", the before_part is "Vol 1 and 2, ", the regex for [\d-]+ would capture "1" as the first occurrence, then "and" blocks the next 2. So the number is "1".

Hmm, but maybe the user wants the entire "1 and 2" as the number? Probably not, so the first number is correct.

Another test case where after_part has multiple numbers:

issue = "Suppl 3a5" → after_part is "3a5", so the first [\d-]+ is "3".

Thus supplement is "3".

Another test case where there are multiple supplements:

issue = "Suppl 3 and 4" → the first number after is "3".

Thus supplement is "3".

Okay, with these tests in mind, I can proceed to write the code.

Now, the code must be in Python, and the function's name is correct.

Wait, the function's name in the problem is _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. Wait, there's a typo in the function name? The user wrote "supplment" instead of "supplement".

Looking back:

The function's signature is:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):

Ah, yes, the user has a typo in the function name: "supplment" (missing 'e').

But the docstring says "sup from the contents", so maybe that's a typo.

So the function name is as given, with the typo. So in the code, I must use that exact name.

Wait, the user's question says:

Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring.

The function's name is as given, with the typo in 'supplment'.

Therefore, the code must have the function named exactly as given, including the typo.

So in the code, the function is called _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element, with 'supplment'.

Hmm, that's important. So in the code, I must use that name.

Now, the code:

Wait, in my previous code, I used the correct spelling 'supplement' in the function name. But the problem's function has a typo. So I need to adjust.

So the function's name is:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):

So in the code, the function is named with 'supplment'.

Also, in the regex, the keyword would be looking for 'suppl' or 'supplement', but since the function's name has 'supplment', perhaps the intended is 'suppl'?

Wait, perhaps the typo is in the function name, but the actual keyword to look for is "supplement" or "suppl".

The problem's docstring says "sup from the contents", where "sup" is the abbreviation for supplement.

Therefore, the code's regex should still look for 'suppl' or 'supplement'.

Thus, the code's function name has a typo but the regex is correct.

Okay, proceeding to code.

Now, the code:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    number = None
    supplement = None

    # Search for the keyword in a case-insensitive manner
    keyword_match = re.search(r'(?i)(suppl|supplement)', issue)
    if keyword_match:
        before_part = issue[:keyword_match.start()]
        after_part = issue[keyword_match.end():]

        # Extract number from before_part
        number_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', before_part)
        if number_match:
            number = number_match.group()

        # Extract supplement from after_part
        supplement_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', after_part)
        if supplement_match:
            supplement = supplement_match.group()
    else:
        # Look for the first number in the entire string
        number_match = re.search(r'[\d-]+', issue)
        if number_match:
            number = number_match.group()

    return (number, supplement)

Wait, but in the function's name, it's 'supplment' (missing the 'e' in 'supplement'). So the function's name is correctly spelled as per the problem's instruction.

Now, checking for possible errors:

- The regex for the keyword includes 'supplement', which is correct even though the function's name has a typo. The function's name typo is probably a mistake, but we have to follow it.

Yes.

Another possible issue is that the function returns (number, supplement), but the name has 'supplment' in the function's name. That's okay.

Now, the code uses the regex to find 'suppl' or 'supplement', so that's correct.

Testing the function with the first test case:

issue = "Vol 5, Suppl 2" → the keyword_match is at 'Suppl', so before_part is 'Vol 5, ', after_part is '2'.

number is found as '5', supplement '2'.

Another test case with 'supplement':

issue = "Vol 6, Supplement 3" → the keyword is 'Supplement', so before_part 'Vol 6, ', number '6', supplement '3'.

Edge case where the keyword is 'suppl' as part of a longer word? Like 'supplemental'? The regex would still match 'suppl'.

Hmm, but 'supplemental' has 'suppl' as part of it, so the match would occur at the start of 'supplemental', but perhaps that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the regex should be more precise, but given the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.

Thus, the code should work as required.
