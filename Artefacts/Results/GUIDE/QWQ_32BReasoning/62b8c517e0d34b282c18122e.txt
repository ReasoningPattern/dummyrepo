Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function extostr based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The function is a class method that takes an exception 'e', and two optional parameters: max_level and max_path_level. Its purpose is to format the exception into a string. 

First, I should think about how to approach this. The standard way to get an exception's string representation is using str(e) or maybe the traceback module. But since there are parameters like max_level and max_path_level, perhaps the function is supposed to format the exception with a traceback, but limit the depth of the stack frames or the path components. 

Wait, maybe max_level refers to the maximum number of stack levels to include in the traceback, and max_path_level refers to how much of the file path to show. Like, instead of the full path, just the last few directories. For example, instead of '/usr/local/lib/project/app.py', maybe just '.../app.py'.

Hmm, the function is part of a class, so it's a method. The parameters are the exception instance, and the two max levels. The function should return a string that represents the exception, possibly including its traceback, but with some truncation based on the max levels.

Let me think about the steps required. To get the traceback, I can use sys.exc_info(), but since the exception is passed in, maybe using traceback.format_exception. Wait, the standard way is to capture the traceback when the exception is raised, so perhaps the 'e' here is an instance that has a __traceback__ attribute. But in some cases, like in Python 3, when you catch an exception with 'except Exception as e', e.__traceback__ gives the traceback object. 

So the function should probably extract the traceback from the exception. Then, format it, truncating the stack frames to max_level levels. Also, for each frame's filename, maybe shorten the path to only show the last max_path_level components. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Get the traceback from the exception. If e has __traceback__, use that. Otherwise, maybe assume there's no traceback? Or raise an error? Not sure, but perhaps proceed as best as possible.

2. Use traceback.format_exception to get the list of strings representing the traceback. But that includes the exception type and message, along with each stack frame. However, the max_level would limit the number of stack frames. Wait, the format_exception function includes all frames by default, but how to limit that? Alternatively, maybe process the frames list directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the max_level refers to the number of stack levels to include. The traceback can be truncated to max_level entries. 

Wait, let me check the parameters again. The function's parameters are max_level=30 and max_path_level=5. The max_level might be the maximum number of stack frames to include in the traceback. The max_path_level is how many path components to show in each frame's filename. 

So, the approach would be:

- Get the exception's traceback.
- Iterate over the traceback's stack frames, up to max_level frames.
- For each frame, get the filename, and shorten it to the last max_path_level components (like splitting by '/' and taking the last parts).
- Then, format all that into a string, along with the exception type and message.

Alternatively, maybe the existing traceback functions can be used with some modifications. Let's see:

The traceback module has functions like format_tb, which returns a list of strings for each stack frame. Each string includes the filename, line number, etc. To shorten the filenames, we can process each line, split the filename, take the last few parts, and replace the full path with the shortened one.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Extract the traceback from the exception. If the exception has __traceback__, use that. Else, maybe use sys.exc_info()[2], but that's only if the function is called within an except block. Hmm, but the function is passed 'e', so maybe we can do:

tb = e.__traceback__ if hasattr(e, '__traceback__') else None

But if the traceback isn't available, then we can't format the stack frames. In that case, perhaps just return the exception's string.

2. Then, get the list of stack frames. The traceback's tb_next links form a linked list. To get all the frames, we can walk through the tb objects, up to max_level steps. But we need to limit the number of frames to max_level.

Alternatively, the format_exception function can be used, but it includes all frames, so perhaps we can truncate the list.

Wait, let me look at the traceback module's functions. The format_exception function takes type, value, and traceback, and returns a list of strings. Each line is a part of the traceback. The first line is the exception type and message. The next lines are the stack frames, each starting with '  File "filename", line number...'.

So to process this, perhaps:

- Use traceback.format_exception(cls, e, e.__traceback__)
- But then, truncate the list to include only up to max_level stack frames? Wait, the list includes the exception line first, then each frame. So the number of frames is the length minus 1 (since the first element is the exception type).

Alternatively, maybe the max_level is the maximum number of stack frames to include. So, after getting all the formatted lines, we can take the first line (the exception) plus up to max_level frames. 

But how to count the frames? The lines after the first are each a frame. So, if we have max_level = 3, we take first line + next 3 lines, but if there are more frames, we stop at 3.

Wait, perhaps the max_level is the depth of the stack. So, the top frame (the innermost call) is first? Or last? Let me think: the traceback is printed from the most recent call last, so the frames are listed in reverse order. So the first frame in the list (after the exception line) is the outermost, and the last is the innermost. Wait, no. Let me recall: when you print a traceback, it starts with the exception, then shows each frame starting from the first place the error was called, leading up to where it was raised. So the first frame in the list is the outermost, the last is the innermost. So the total number of frames is the length of the lines minus 1.

So to limit the number of frames to max_level, we can take the first line plus the next min(max_level, num_frames) lines.

Wait, perhaps the max_level is the maximum number of frames to include. So, for example, if max_level is 3, then the formatted string will include up to 3 stack frames. The rest are omitted.

Additionally, for each frame's filename, we need to shorten the path. The max_path_level is how many path components to show. So, for a path like '/usr/local/lib/project/app.py', if max_path_level is 2, it would become 'lib/project/app.py'? Or maybe split into parts, take the last max_path_level parts, then join with slashes. So, splitting on '/', then taking the last n elements, then joining with '/'.

So, for each frame line, which is a string like 'File "/usr/local/lib/project/app.py", line 10, in some_function', we can split the filename part, process it, then replace it in the line.

So, the steps would be:

- Get the exception's string using format_exception, which includes the traceback.

- Truncate the stack frames to max_level frames.

- For each frame line, process the filename to shorten the path.

- Then, join all the lines into a single string.

Now, implementing this in code.

First, need to import the traceback module.

The function is a class method, so 'cls' is the class. Wait, the function is part of a class, but the parameters are cls, e, etc. Wait, the function signature is def extostr(cls, e, max_level=30, max_path_level=5):. So it's a class method. That might be because the first parameter is 'cls', but perhaps the function is intended to be a helper that can be called on a class, but maybe the 'cls' is not used here. Maybe the original design intended to use it for exception types, but perhaps in the code, it's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps it's a static method, but the function is written as a class method. Hmm, but for the code, perhaps just proceed as per the given signature.

Now, the code outline:

def extostr(cls, e, max_level=30, max_path_level=5):
    # code here

First, get the traceback from the exception. e is the exception instance. The traceback can be obtained via e.__traceback__ if available. So:

tb = e.__traceback__ if hasattr(e, '__traceback__') else None

Then, use traceback.format_exception to get the lines. The format_exception function takes type, value, and traceback. The type would be the exception class (cls?), but actually, the exception's type can be obtained via type(e). Wait, but the function's first parameter is 'cls', but perhaps that's a mistake, since the function is a class method. Wait, perhaps the 'cls' is actually the exception class, but in the function signature, the parameters are (cls, e, ...). So the first argument is the class, then the exception instance. So for example, if this is a method on an exception class, then cls would be the exception's class, but in reality, the exception's class is type(e). So maybe the 'cls' is redundant here. Maybe it's a mistake, but I have to follow the given signature.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is meant to be a helper method in a base class for exceptions, but in any case, the code must use the parameters as given.

So, proceeding:

lines = traceback.format_exception(type(e), e, tb)

Then, process these lines. The first line is the exception type and message, followed by the stack frames.

Now, to truncate the stack frames to max_level levels. The total number of frames is len(lines) - 1 (since the first line is the exception). So, we can take the first line plus the next min(max_level, number_of_frames) lines.

Wait, but the order of the frames in the traceback is from the outermost to innermost. So the first frame after the exception line is the outermost, and the last is the innermost. So truncating to max_level would take the first max_level frames, or all if there are fewer.

So the lines after truncation would be:

truncated_lines = lines[:1] + lines[1:1+max_level]

Wait, but if the length is less than 1+max_level, then it's okay. So that's manageable.

Wait, the first element is lines[0], then the next elements are lines[1], lines[2], etc. So to get up to max_level frames, we can take lines[1:1+max_level], then add to lines[0], so the total is lines[:1] + lines[1:1+max_level].

Then, the next step is to process each frame line to shorten the filename.

For each line in the frame lines (from lines[1] onward), we need to extract the filename part, process it, then reconstruct the line.

Each frame line starts with 'File "', then the filename, followed by ', line ...' etc.

So for each line in the truncated lines (except the first?), wait no: the first line is the exception, then each subsequent line is a frame. So the lines after truncation would include the first line plus the selected frames.

So, for each line in lines[1:] (the frame lines), process the filename.

So, for each line in the frame lines (excluding the first element):

for line in lines[1:]:
    # process here

But in code, after truncating, the lines are in truncated_lines, so need to loop over each frame line (the elements after the first).

Processing the filename:

Split the line into parts. The filename is between 'File "' and the next '", line ...'.

So, perhaps split the line at 'File "', then take the second part, split on '"', to get the filename.

Alternatively, using string operations:

parts = line.split('", line ')
file_part = parts[0].split('File "')[1]
rest_part = parts[1]

Then, split the file_part into path components.

path_parts = file_part.split('/')
processed_path = path_parts[-max_path_level:] if max_path_level >0 else []
if not processed_path:
    # if max_path_level is zero, maybe show the full path? Or empty?
    # but according to the parameters, max_path_level defaults to 5, so maybe zero is allowed but would show nothing. Maybe better to have a check.

Wait, but the problem says max_path_level=5 is default. So if the user sets it to zero, perhaps we should just use the full path? Or maybe the code should handle it as zero meaning no truncation? Hmm, perhaps the code should take max_path_level as the maximum number of components to include. So, if max_path_level is 0, perhaps it's treated as 1? Or maybe it's allowed to be zero, but then the path is just the base name? Not sure. The problem's docstring doesn't specify, so I'll proceed as per the parameters.

So, for the path parts:

path = '/'.join(processed_path)

But also, need to handle drive letters on Windows, like 'C:\\Program Files\\...', but splitting on '/' might not work. Alternatively, use os.path.split or similar functions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to split on os.path.sep, but that might complicate. Alternatively, just split on both '/' and '\\', but that could be tricky. Hmm, perhaps for simplicity, split on both '/' and backslashes, but the problem might expect just splitting on '/'.

Alternatively, use os.path.split multiple times. For example, to get the last n components of a path:

def shorten_path(path, max_level):
    components = []
    while path and max_level > 0:
        path, tail = os.path.split(path)
        components.append(tail)
        max_level -=1
    components.reverse()
    return os.path.join(*components)

Wait, but this approach would take the last components. Let me think:

Suppose path is '/a/b/c/d/e/f.py', and max_level is 3. Then the last 3 components are d, e, f.py. So the shortened path would be 'd/e/f.py'.

But splitting the path into parts with '/' gives ['a','b','c','d','e','f.py'], so the last 3 parts would be d, e, f.py → joined as 'd/e/f.py'.

But the first component is the root (empty string?), so maybe need to handle that.

Alternatively, using the path.split('/'):

parts = path.split('/')
non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]
shortened = non_empty[-max_level:] if max_level >0 else []
if not shortened:
    # if max_level is 0, then return empty? Not sure. Maybe just the filename?
    # perhaps in that case, we can return the original path, but according to the parameters, max_path_level is 5 by default. So perhaps 0 is allowed but treated as 1?

Alternatively, perhaps the function just uses the split('/') approach, and proceeds.

So in code for the line processing:

filename_part = file_part.split('/')
non_empty = [p for p in filename_part if p]
if max_path_level <=0:
    # maybe use the full path? Or just the last part?
    # perhaps set max_path_level to 1 in that case?
    # but according to the problem, the default is 5, so perhaps 0 is allowed but would give nothing. Maybe better to use max(1, ...)?
    # Alternatively, just take the last 1 part?
    # Hmm, perhaps the code should handle it as the user's choice. Let's proceed as per the parameters.

shortened = non_empty[-max_path_level:] if max_path_level >0 else []
if not shortened:
    shortened = ['']  # but that would be empty. Maybe just keep the original?
    # perhaps better to avoid this and assume max_path_level is positive.
    # but the user can set it to zero, so perhaps we need to handle it.

Alternatively, perhaps if max_path_level is zero, we return the full path. Or perhaps just the base name.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use max(1, max_path_level) to avoid zero.

But perhaps the problem expects to just take the last max_path_level parts, so proceed with that.

Assuming max_path_level is positive, then:

shortened_path = '/'.join(shortened)

Wait, but the path could be on Windows with backslashes. Hmm, but the code is in Python, which handles paths with os.path functions. But in the line, the filename is represented with forward slashes even on Windows, perhaps? Because when formatting exceptions, the traceback uses forward slashes for path separators. Or maybe not. Maybe it's better to process using '/' as the separator.

Alternatively, to make it platform-agnostic, split on both '/' and '\\'?

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the code can just split on '/'.

Putting this all together:

for each frame line:

- extract the filename part between 'File "' and the next '"'

- split into parts, take last max_path_level parts

- reconstruct the filename with '/'.join(shortened)

- then reassemble the line.

So, in code:

for i in range(1, len(truncated_lines)):
    line = truncated_lines[i]
    # process the line's filename
    # split the line into parts
    if 'File "' in line:
        parts = line.split('", line ')
        if len(parts) < 2:
            # maybe not a frame line, but that's unlikely
            continue
        file_part = parts[0].split('File "')[1]
        rest_part = parts[1]
        # process the file_part
        path_components = file_part.split('/')
        non_empty = [p for p in path_components if p]
        max_level = max_path_level
        shortened = non_empty[-max_level:] if max_level >0 else []
        if not shortened:
            # handle case where max_level is zero or path has fewer components
            shortened = non_empty  # just use the full path?
        shortened_path = '/'.join(shortened)
        new_file_part = shortened_path
        new_line = f'File "{new_file_part}", line {rest_part}'
        truncated_lines[i] = new_line

Wait, but in the code above, the rest_part includes the rest of the line, including the line number and function name. So splitting on '", line ' gives the rest_part as ' line ...' but actually, the split would give parts[0] as the file part, and parts[1] would be everything after ', line ', so for example, if the line is 'File "a/b/c.py", line 10, in func', then parts[0] is 'a/b/c.py' (after splitting on 'File "'), and parts[1] is ' line 10, in func' ?

Wait, let me test:

original_line = 'File "/usr/local/lib/project/app.py", line 10, in some_function\n  something = 5\n'

split on '", line ' → the first part is '/usr/local/lib/project/app.py', and the second part is ' 10, in some_function\n  something = 5\n' (assuming the split is done correctly).

So parts[0] is the file part, and parts[1] contains the rest of the line.

So when reconstructing, the new line would be 'File "' + new_file_part + '", line ' + parts[1]

Wait, so the code should be:

new_line = f'File "{new_file_part}", line {rest_part}'

Wait, but rest_part is the part after the ', line ', so the ' line ' is already included? Wait, no. Let me see:

The original line has 'File "...", line ...', so when you split on '", line ', you get:

parts[0] is the file part (without the 'File ' and the quotes), and parts[1] is everything after ', line ' including the line number and the rest.

So putting it all together, the new line is:

new_line = f'File "{new_file_part}", line {rest_part}'

Yes.

Putting this into code:

for i in range(1, len(truncated_lines)):

    line = truncated_lines[i]

    # Extract the file part and the rest

    file_part_start = line.find('File "') 

    if file_part_start == -1:

        # Not a frame line, skip

        continue

    # Split into parts

    parts = line.split('", line ')

    if len(parts) < 2:

        # Not a frame line, skip?

        continue

    file_part = parts[0].split('File "')[1]

    rest_part = parts[1]

    # Process the file_part's path

    path_components = file_part.split('/')

    non_empty = [p for p in path_components if p]

    max_level = max_path_level  # the parameter passed in

    # Take last max_level components, but if negative or zero?

    if max_level <=0:

        shortened = non_empty  # full path?

    else:

        shortened = non_empty[-max_level:] or non_empty  # in case there are fewer than max_level components?

    shortened_path = '/'.join(shortened)

    new_line = f'File "{shortened_path}", line {rest_part}'

    truncated_lines[i] = new_line

Wait, but in the case where there are fewer components than max_level, like if max_level is 5 and the path has 3 parts, then we take all 3. So that's okay.

Also, note that if the path starts with a slash (like '/usr/local/file'), splitting on '/' gives ['', 'usr', 'local', 'file'], so non_empty would be ['usr', 'local', 'file'], so for max_level=2, that would give ['local', 'file'], so the shortened path would be 'local/file'.

So that works.

Putting all this together.

Now, the code outline:

import traceback

def extostr(cls, e, max_level=30, max_path_level=5):
    tb = e.__traceback__ if hasattr(e, '__traceback__') else None
    lines = traceback.format_exception(type(e), e, tb)
    # Truncate the stack frames to max_level
    num_frames = len(lines) - 1  # exclude the first line (exception)
    if num_frames > max_level:
        truncated_lines = lines[:1] + lines[1:1+max_level]
    else:
        truncated_lines = lines.copy()  # or just lines?

    # Process each frame line to shorten the path
    for i in range(1, len(truncated_lines)):
        line = truncated_lines[i]
        # check if it's a frame line (starts with 'File ')
        if 'File "' not in line:
            continue  # skip if not a frame line, maybe the last line of the trace
        parts = line.split('", line ')
        if len(parts) < 2:
            continue  # invalid line format
        file_part = parts[0].split('File "')[1]
        rest_part = parts[1]
        path_components = file_part.split('/')
        non_empty = [p for p in path_components if p]
        if max_path_level <= 0:
            shortened = non_empty
        else:
            shortened = non_empty[-max_path_level:]
        shortened_path = '/'.join(shortened)
        new_line = f'File "{shortened_path}", line {rest_part}'
        truncated_lines[i] = new_line

    return ''.join(truncated_lines)

Wait, but in the code above, the initial truncation is done as:

if num_frames > max_level:
    truncated_lines = lines[:1] + lines[1:1+max_level]
else:
    truncated_lines = lines.copy()

Wait, but lines is a list, so lines.copy() is okay, but perhaps just assigning to truncated_lines = lines.

Alternatively, perhaps:

truncated_lines = lines[:1 + min(max_level, num_frames)]

Wait, the first line is lines[0], then the next max_level lines. So the slice would be lines[0:1] (the first element) plus lines[1:1+max_level], but that's equivalent to lines[:1] + lines[1:1+max_level], which is the same as lines[:1+max_level], but only up to the available length.

Alternatively, perhaps:

truncated_lines = lines[:1] + lines[1:1+max_level]

But since list slicing in Python is up to but not including the end, so lines[1:1+max_level] gives the next max_level elements.

So, for example, if max_level is 3, and there are 5 frames, the frames would be lines[1], lines[2], lines[3], and then truncated to 3, so the first three frames.

Thus, that code should work.

Wait, but the first line is the exception line, then the frames are lines[1], lines[2], etc. So the code for truncating is okay.

Now, testing this code. Let's think of some test cases.

Test case 1: A simple exception with no traceback (like when e is raised without a traceback, but in practice, exceptions usually have a traceback.

Wait, but in Python 3, when you catch an exception in an except block, e has __traceback__. So the code should work.

Another test case: create a function that raises an exception, then call it, and check the formatted string.

For example:

def test_extostr():
    try:
        1/0
    except Exception as e:
        result = YourClass.extostr(e, max_level=1, max_path_level=2)
        assert "division by zero" in result
        assert "File \"test.py\", line" in result  # assuming the filename is test.py, but after truncation to 2 path components, it would depend on the actual path.

Hmm, but the test would need to be written first. Since the user mentioned using test-driven development, first write the tests, then the code.

But since I'm to write only the code, I can proceed.

Potential issues:

- The code may not handle Windows paths correctly, but the problem may not require that. Since splitting on '/' works for both Unix and Windows (since the traceback uses '/' as separators?), perhaps it's okay.

- The code uses 'cls' but doesn't use it. The function is a class method, but the code doesn't refer to 'cls' except in the parameters. Maybe the 'cls' is a mistake, and the function should be a static method, but the signature requires it as a class method. Since the problem's given signature includes 'cls', I must include it, even if unused.

- What if the exception's __traceback__ is None? Then the lines would have only the first line (the exception type and message). The code should still process that, but there would be no frames.

Another edge case: max_level is zero → no frames. The result would be just the exception line.

Another case: max_path_level is 0 → show full path.

Wait, in the code above, when max_path_level is zero or negative, we set shortened = non_empty. So the path remains as is.

Thus, the code should handle that.

Another possible issue is that when the path has fewer components than max_path_level, it still works.

Now, putting all together, the code would look like this.
