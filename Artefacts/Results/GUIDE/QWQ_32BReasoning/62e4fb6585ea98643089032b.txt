Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_version that takes a string and returns a tuple of integers. The docstring says it converts a dot-concatenated string into a tuple of integers. So, for example, if the input is "1.2.3", it should return (1, 2, 3). 

First, I should think about the steps needed. The function has to split the input string by dots, then convert each part to an integer, and collect them into a tuple. But wait, what if the input has leading or trailing whitespace? Like " 1.2.3 " should become (1,2,3). Also, what about cases like "1.2.3.4"? That's okay, as long as each segment is a number. What about empty strings? Like if the input is an empty string, maybe return an empty tuple? Or maybe that's an error? The problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps we just split and process as is. 

What about strings with non-numeric parts? Like "1.2a.3" would split into ["1", "2a", "3"], and trying to convert "2a" to an int would fail. Oh right, the function's docstring says it converts a string that's properly formatted. So perhaps the function assumes that the input is correctly formatted, and if not, it might throw an error. But the problem doesn't mention handling invalid inputs, so maybe we just proceed under the assumption that the input is valid. 

So the steps would be:

1. Split the input string 's' by '.' into parts.
2. For each part in the split list, convert it to an integer.
3. Return the tuple of these integers.

But how to handle each step in code?

First, splitting: s.split('.') gives a list of strings. Then, for each element in that list, we call int(). So the tuple would be tuple(int(part) for part in parts). 

Wait, but what about leading zeros? Like "00.1" would become (0, 1), which is fine. Since the problem says to return integers, leading zeros in the string are okay. 

Now, for test cases. The user mentioned to use test-driven development, so first write unit tests before the code. Let me think of some test cases.

Test case 1: "1.2.3" → (1,2,3). 

Test case 2: "0.9" → (0,9). 

Test case 3: empty string? Splitting an empty string with split('.') gives [''], so parts would be [''], and converting to int would be 0? But then the tuple would be (0,). Wait, no. Let's see: if s is empty, then s.split('.') would be [''], so each part is that, so int('') would throw ValueError. So in that case, maybe the function should return an empty tuple? Hmm, but the function's docstring says it converts a string "concatenated by dot"—so perhaps the input is always non-empty and properly formatted. But perhaps the function should handle empty string as returning empty tuple. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's an error case. Since the function's signature doesn't mention raising exceptions, perhaps the tests should include valid cases only.

Another test case: leading or trailing dots. Like "1.2.3." → split would give ['1','2','3',''], converting to int would fail on the last part. So that's an invalid input. But according to the problem's requirements, the function probably expects that each part is a valid integer. So in test cases, perhaps we only test valid inputs. 

Test case 4: "123" → split into ['123'], so tuple is (123,). 

Test case 5: "  1.2.3  " → after stripping whitespace, it's "1.2.3", so the tuple would be (1,2,3). But the function as written would first split on '.' but the original string has leading and trailing spaces. Wait, the function's input is s: str, so maybe the user expects that leading/trailing whitespace is stripped first? The problem says "concatenated by dot"—so maybe the input is already properly formatted. But perhaps the function should first strip whitespace. Let me check the problem's description again. The docstring says "converts a string concatenated by dot to a tuple". So maybe the input is like "1.2.3" without any extra spaces. So perhaps the function doesn't handle leading/trailing whitespace. But maybe the test cases should include that as a case where the function should ignore leading/trailing spaces. 

Alternatively, maybe the function should first strip the string. So the code would start with s = s.strip() before splitting. That's probably a good idea. Because otherwise, a string like " 1.2 " would split into parts with leading space, leading to an error. So the code should first strip the string. 

So adding that step: first, strip the input string. 

So the steps are:

s = s.strip() → then split into parts → convert each part to int → make tuple.

So in the code:

def parse_version(s: str) -> tuple[int, ...]:
    s = s.strip()
    parts = s.split('.')
    return tuple(int(part) for part in parts)

Now, for test cases. Let me think of some edge cases. 

Test case 6: "  0.1.2   " → after stripping, "0.1.2" → (0,1,2).

Test case 7: "1..2" → after splitting, parts would be ['1', '', '2'], which when converting to int would fail. So that's an invalid input. But the test cases should perhaps not include such cases since the function may not handle them. 

The tests should only cover valid cases. So the unit tests need to check the valid scenarios. 

Now, writing the unit tests. Since the user wants the code generated via test-driven development, first the tests, then the code. 

The unit tests would be in a test module, perhaps using pytest. 

Sample tests:

def test_parse_version_simple():
    assert parse_version("1.2.3") == (1,2,3)

def test_parse_version_leading_zeros():
    assert parse_version("01.2") == (1,2)  # Wait, but "01" as a string converted to int is 1, so yes. So the output would be (1,2).

Wait, but the input "01.2" would split into ["01", "2"], so converting to 1 and 2. So that's correct. 

Another test case for leading/trailing whitespace:

def test_parse_version_with_whitespace():
    assert parse_version("  3.4.5  ") == (3,4,5)

Test case for single component:

def test_single_part():
    assert parse_version("42") == (42,)

Test case for zero-length string? Well, if the input is empty string, after stripping, it becomes "", so split would be [''], then converting to int('') gives ValueError. So in that case, the function would raise an error. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention handling that. So perhaps the test should not include such a case, as it's invalid. 

So the tests should only test valid cases. 

Another test case with multiple zeros:

def test_multiple_zeros():
    assert parse_version("0.0.0") == (0,0,0)

Test case with numbers that have leading zeros but are still valid:

def test_leading_zero_in_part():
    assert parse_version("0001.02") == (1, 2)

So those are the tests. 

Now, the code. 

Wait, but the code as written would handle all these cases except when the input is empty. 

Now, putting it all together. The code is straightforward. 

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, but the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. Wait, perhaps they mean to write the code enclosed in triple backticks. 

Wait, the initial instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So probably, the code should be written as a code block. 

But the user also mentioned to first generate unit tests before the code. But in the problem, the user wants the code generated. Since the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring", so the code is just the function. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to first generate the tests, then the code. But the user wants the code output. So perhaps the code is the function, and the tests are part of the code? Or no, the user wants the code (the function) as the output. 

So the code is the function. 

Now, putting it all together. 

The function would be:

def parse_version(s: str) -> tuple[int, ...]:
    s = s.strip()
    parts = s.split('.')
    return tuple(int(part) for part in parts)

That's the code. 

Wait, but what about cases where a part is empty? Like if the input is "1.", after stripping, it's "1.", which splits into ['1', ''] → the second part would be converted to int, which is invalid. But the function will raise a ValueError. But according to the problem's docstring, the function is supposed to handle correctly formatted strings. So the tests should not include such cases. 

Therefore, the code is as above. 

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format. So perhaps:

```python
def parse_version(s: str) -> tuple[int, ...]:
    s = s.strip()
    parts = s.split('.')
    return tuple(int(part) for part in parts)
```

But I should also include the unit tests? Wait, the problem says to generate the code (the function) based on the signature and docstring, and the user's instruction says to output only the code. 

Therefore, the code is the function. 

But in the think section, the user mentioned that first generating comprehensive unit tests before the actual code. But the output is just the code. 

Therefore, the code is the function as written.
