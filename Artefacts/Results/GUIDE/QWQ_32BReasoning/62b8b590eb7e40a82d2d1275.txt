Okay, I need to write a Python function called _legacy_mergeOrderings that combines multiple orderings into a single list without duplicates, preserving the order of first occurrence. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's docstring says to combine the lists into a list with no duplicates, in the sequence of occurrence. So, the key points are: merge all elements from all orderings, but each element appears only once, and the order is determined by the first occurrence in the orderings.

Hmm, so for example, if the input is [[a, b], [b, c], [d]], the merged list should be [a, b, c, d]. Because a comes first in the first list, then b from first list (so the second list's b is ignored), then c from the second list, and d from the third.

The way to approach this is to iterate through each element in each ordering, and add them to the result list only if they haven't been added before. So we need a set to track the elements we've already seen.

The steps would be:

1. Initialize an empty list (result) and a set (seen).
2. Iterate over each ordering in the orderings list.
3. For each element in the current ordering:
   a. If the element is not in seen, add it to the result and the set.
4. Return the result once all orderings are processed.

Now, to make sure this works correctly, let's think of some test cases first, as per the TDD approach.

Test case 1: Basic case with overlapping elements. Like [[1,2], [2,3], [4]], expected [1,2,3,4].

Test case 2: Duplicate elements in the same ordering. For example, [[3,3,2], [2,1]] should result in [3,2,1]. Because in the first list, 3 is added first, then 3 is already in the set, then 2 is added. The second list's 2 and 1 are added only if not present. So the result would be [3,2,1].

Test case 3: Empty lists. What if one of the orderings is empty? Like [[], [5,6], [5]], the result should be [5,6].

Test case 4: All elements are duplicates except one. Like [[], [a], [a, a]], then the result is [a].

Test case 5: Order of insertion matters. Suppose the first list has an element that's later in another list. Like [[b, a], [a, b]], the first elements are b, a. The second list's a and b are already in the set, so the result is [b, a].

Now, writing these as unit tests using pytest or unittest. Let's use pytest for simplicity.

First, the tests:

def test_legacy_merge_orderings_basic():
    orderings = [[1,2], [2,3], [4]]
    assert _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings) == [1,2,3,4]

def test_duplicate_in_same_ordering():
    orderings = [[3,3,2], [2,1]]
    assert _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings) == [3,2,1]

def test_empty_lists():
    orderings = [[], [5,6], [5]]
    assert _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings) == [5,6]

def test_only_one_unique():
    orderings = [[], ['a'], ['a', 'a']]
    assert _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings) == ['a']

def test_order_precedence():
    orderings = [['b', 'a'], ['a', 'b']]
    assert _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings) == ['b', 'a']

These tests should cover the necessary cases.

Now, writing the actual function.

The function takes orderings as an argument, which is a list of lists.

Initialize result and seen:

def _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings):
    result = []
    seen = set()
    for ordering in orderings:
        for elem in ordering:
            if elem not in seen:
                result.append(elem)
                seen.add(elem)
    return result

Wait, but what if the elements are not hashable? Like if they are lists themselves. But the problem probably assumes elements are hashable, as it's common in such functions. The docstring doesn't specify, but since it's a legacy function, maybe it's intended for hashable types. So proceed with that code.

Testing with the test cases:

For the first test case, the code processes each ordering in order. The first ordering adds 1 and 2. The second adds 2 (already there) then 3 (new). Third adds 4. So the result is correct.

Second test case: first ordering adds 3 (then another 3, which is skipped), then 2. The next ordering adds 2 (already there) and 1 (new). So [3,2,1] as expected.

Third test: first ordering is empty. Next adds 5 and 6. Third ordering's 5 is already there. So [5,6].

Fourth test: the elements are 'a' strings, so the result is ['a'].

Fifth test: first ordering adds 'b' then 'a'. The second ordering's 'a' and 'b' are already in the set, so the result is ['b','a'].

All tests should pass.

Now, the function is written correctly. So the code is as above.
