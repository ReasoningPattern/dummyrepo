Okay, I need to write a Python function called split that takes a string and a platform parameter. The platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. The function should split the input string according to the specified platform's rules. Let me think about how each platform handles splitting.

First, for the 'this' case, I should auto-detect the current platform. Maybe using sys.platform? Like, if it's 'win32', then use Windows style, else POSIX. Wait, but the problem says if platform is 'this', auto-detect. So the function needs to check that.

Then, for platform 1 (POSIX), the splitting should consider spaces as delimiters, but maybe handle quotes so that words in quotes are kept together. Like, in bash, arguments are split by whitespace but quotes can group words. So for example, "a b" c would split into ['a b', 'c'].

For platform 0 (Windows/CMD), the splitting is a bit different. In CMD, the default is to split on spaces, but quotes can group, but there's some specifics. For example, if a quoted string has spaces inside, it's kept, but maybe the quotes are stripped. Also, in CMD, if the entire argument is quoted, the quotes are removed. But if there's an unquoted space, that splits. Also, maybe handling escaped quotes? Hmm, but the problem might not require handling escapes unless specified. The problem's docstring doesn't mention escaping, so maybe I can ignore that for now.

The main challenge is handling the quotes correctly for both platforms. Let me think about how to approach the splitting logic.

For POSIX style, the standard way is to split on whitespace, but words in quotes are kept as one. So perhaps using shlex.split would work here. Wait, because shlex.split is designed for exactly that purpose. So for POSIX, using shlex.split with posix=True might be appropriate.

For Windows/CMD style, shlex.split can also be used but with posix=False. Because when posix is False, it uses Windows-like parsing. That might be the way to go. So perhaps the core of the function is to use shlex.split with different parameters based on the platform.

Wait, let me check the shlex documentation. The shlex.split function has a posix argument. When posix is True (the default), it uses POSIX rules (quotes, backslashes, etc.), but when posix is False, it uses Windows rules, where quotes can be used but backslashes are treated as regular characters unless they precede a quote. So that might fit the requirements here.

So the plan is:

- Determine the platform:

   if platform is 'this', check sys.platform. If it's Windows (sys.platform is 'win32'), then use Windows style (shlex with posix=False). Else, use POSIX (shlex with posix=True).

   if platform is 1 (POSIX), use shlex with posix=True.

   if platform is 0 (Windows), use shlex with posix=False.

Then, the function can call shlex.split(s, posix=...) accordingly.

Wait, but the parameters are a bit different. Let me structure this:

First, handle the platform parameter:

def split(s, platform='this'):

    if platform == 'this':

        current_platform = sys.platform

        if current_platform.startswith('win'):

            platform_choice = 0

        else:

            platform_choice = 1

    else:

        platform_choice = platform

    # then, based on platform_choice, set the posix parameter

    if platform_choice == 1:

        posix = True

    elif platform_choice == 0:

        posix = False

    else:

        # invalid platform? But according to the doc, platform should be 0,1, or 'this'

        # but the function's parameters say platform can be 'this', 0, or 1. So maybe the else case is unreachable?

        # perhaps raise an error, but the problem didn't mention that, so maybe assume valid inputs.

    Then, return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

Wait, but the function's platform parameter is given as either 'this', 0, or 1. Wait the parameters say:

platform: 'this' = auto from current; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows.

Wait, the platform argument can be passed as an integer 0 or 1, or the string 'this'. So in the code, when platform is 'this', we auto-detect. Otherwise, if it's 0, use Windows; 1, use POSIX.

So the code would need to handle the platform parameter correctly. Let's code that.

Wait, the function's parameters have platform defaulting to 'this', so the user can pass platform='this', platform=0, or platform=1. So in code:

def split(s, platform='this'):

    if platform == 'this':

        # auto-detect

        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):

            posix = False

        else:

            posix = True

    elif platform == 1:

        posix = True

    elif platform == 0:

        posix = False

    else:

        raise ValueError("Invalid platform value")

    # then, use shlex.split with that posix value.

    return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

Wait, but shlex.split's parameters include 'posix' as a boolean. So this approach should work. Let me test some examples.

Test case 1: platform 0 (Windows style). Input is 'a "b c" d'. The expected output would be ['a', 'b c', 'd'] ?

Wait, in CMD, the quotes around "b c" would group the two words, so splitting would result in those as a single element. So yes. Using shlex.split with posix=False would do that.

Another example: 'a"b c d' (no closing quote). In that case, perhaps shlex would raise an error? But the function is supposed to split, maybe the input is well-formed. The problem's docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps assume that the input is properly quoted.

Another test case for POSIX: 'a"b c" d' would split into ['ab c', 'd']? Wait, no, in POSIX, the quotes enclose the entire word. So "b c" would be treated as 'b c', so the entire string would be split into ['a b c', 'd']? Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, let's see: in a POSIX shell, the command line "a b c d" would split into four elements. But "a'b c'd" (using single quotes) would be 'a', 'b c', 'd'? Or if it's "a 'b c' d", then the split would be ['a', 'b c', 'd'].

So using shlex.split on "a 'b c' d" with posix=True would give that.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the user wants the code to be generated, but first, they want the TDD approach: first write unit tests, then the code.

So, the first step is to generate comprehensive unit tests. Let me think of test cases.

Test case 1: Windows style (platform 0)

Input: 'a b "c d" e'

Expected: ['a', 'b', 'c d', 'e']

Test case 2: POSIX style (platform 1)

Input: 'a"b c" d'

Wait, in POSIX, the quotes are required to group. So "a"b c" d" would need to have quotes properly. Let's take 'a"b c" d' — the quotes here are enclosing "b c", so the split would be ['ab c', 'd']? Or maybe the quotes are just part of the string unless they are enclosing properly. Wait, in shlex.split, the quotes must enclose the entire token. For example, if the input is 'a"b c" d', the quotes are part of the first argument? Or does the shlex split it as 'a"b c"', 'd'? Because in POSIX, the quotes are used to include spaces. So in this example, the first token is 'a"b c"', which is kept as is, but the quotes are stripped. Wait, no, in shlex.split, when using POSIX mode, the quotes are stripped. So for the input 'a"b c" d', the first token would be a"b c" (the quotes are part of the string?), but perhaps the quotes are only stripping when they enclose the entire token. Hmm, maybe I should test with actual examples.

Wait, let me think of an example where the quotes are properly enclosing. For instance, "a b" c would split into ['a b', 'c'] in POSIX.

So the test case for POSIX would be:

s = 'a"b c" d' → perhaps the quotes are not enclosing, so the split would be ['a"b', 'c"', 'd']? Or does shlex require the quotes to be properly balanced?

Ah right, in shlex.split, the quotes must be properly closed. So if the input is 'a"b c', then that would be an error. But assuming the input is properly quoted, the test cases can be designed accordingly.

Another test case for Windows: input 'a"b c" d' → the Windows parser would treat the quotes as enclosing, so it would be ['a b c', 'd']? Or no, in Windows, the quotes enclose the entire token. So "a b c" would be kept as is. But in the input 'a"b c" d', the a is outside the quotes, so the first token is 'a', then "b c" is the next, then 'd'. So the result would be ['a', 'b c', 'd'].

Wait, in the input 'a"b c" d', the quotes are enclosing "b c", so the Windows parser would split into a (outside the quotes), then "b c" (inside quotes, so becomes 'b c'), and then d. So the list would be ['a', 'b c', 'd'].

So the code using shlex.split with posix=False would do that.

Another test case for platform 'this' on a non-Windows system: input 'a"b c" d' → treated as POSIX? So the quotes would need to be properly enclosing. Let's see, in POSIX, the input 'a"b c" d' would have the quotes around 'b c', so the first argument is a"b c" → but the quotes are not enclosing the entire token unless they are part of the quotes. Wait, perhaps in POSIX, the quotes can be inside the string if not escaped. For example, "a b" is enclosed, but a"b c" is not. So in that case, the quotes are just part of the string unless they are part of a quoted string.

Hmm, perhaps the test cases can be:

Test 1: Windows style (platform 0):

Input: 'one "two three" four'

Expected: ['one', 'two three', 'four']

Test 2: POSIX style (platform 1):

Input: 'one "two three" four'

Expected same as above?

Wait, in POSIX, that input would split into ['one', 'two three', 'four'] as well. Wait, no, in POSIX, the quotes are treated as enclosing, so the quoted part is kept as a single token. So the result is the same for both platforms in this case. So perhaps I need a test case where the behavior differs.

Ah, here's a better test case:

Windows: input 'a"b c" d'

In Windows style, the split would be ['a', 'b c', 'd'] because the quotes around "b c" group them, but the 'a' is outside, so it's a separate token.

In POSIX style, the same input 'a"b c" d' would split into ['a"b', 'c"', 'd'] because the quotes are not enclosing the entire token. The quotes are only around 'b c', but the a is before, so the first token is a"b, then c" is the next, and then d. Wait, but that's not correct. Maybe I need to use proper quoting.

Alternatively, perhaps a better test case is using a single quote in the middle. Let's think of something where the behavior differs.

Another example:

Input: 'a"b c d" e' → both platforms would group the quoted part.

Hmm. Let's think of a case where Windows and POSIX split differently.

Suppose the input is 'a"b c d e f' (missing closing quote). But that's an error, so perhaps not a good test case.

Alternatively, consider the input 'a"b c d e'f' — but that's complicated.

Alternatively, consider an input with spaces outside quotes. Like 'a "b c" d "e f" g' — that would split the same way in both.

Hmm, maybe another case where the quotes are not balanced in a way that matters for the splitting. Maybe when using spaces inside and outside quotes in a way that requires different parsing.

Wait, let's think of a case where in Windows, a quoted string can contain spaces, but in POSIX, it's different. Maybe not. Let me think of a different example.

Wait, in Windows, when you have quotes around a token, the quotes are stripped. But if a token is unquoted, then any spaces split it. For example, in Windows:

Input: 'a "b c" d e' → split into ['a', 'b c', 'd', 'e']

Same as POSIX in that case. So perhaps I need a case where the presence of quotes changes the result between the two.

Wait, perhaps in Windows, the following input: 'a"b c" d' → the a and "b c" are separate because the a is outside the quotes. So the first token is 'a', then the quoted "b c" is next, then 'd'.

In POSIX, the same input would split into ['a"b', 'c"', 'd'] because the quotes are not enclosing the entire token. So that's a good test case where the outputs differ.

So test case for platform 0 (Windows):

Input: 'a"b c" d' → expected ['a', 'b c', 'd']

Test case for platform 1 (POSIX):

Same input → ['a"b', 'c"', 'd']

So that's a good test case to differentiate.

Another test case for platform 'this':

Suppose the current OS is Windows, so platform 'this' uses 0. Then the input 'a"b c" d' should return the Windows split.

Another test case for when the platform is invalid, but according to the problem's docstring, the platform is supposed to be 0,1, or 'this', so maybe the code should raise an error for other values. But the problem says "if platform equals 1, use POSIX...", so perhaps the code should handle only those three options, and raise ValueError for anything else. So a test case for invalid platform (like 2) should raise an error.

Now, writing the unit tests.

First, import unittest and the function.

class TestSplit(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_windows_style(self):

        s = 'a"b c" d'

        expected = ['a', 'b c', 'd']

        result = split(s, 0)

        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_posix_style(self):

        s = 'a"b c" d'

        expected = ['a"b', 'c"', 'd']

        result = split(s, 1)

        self.assertEqual(result, expected)

    def test_this_windows(self):

        # assuming current platform is Windows (mock this?)

        # but in real testing, perhaps need to run on a windows system or mock.

        # For simplicity, maybe skip this test unless on Windows.

        # Alternatively, use a different test.

        pass  # maybe need to think of a better way.

    def test_invalid_platform(self):

        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):

            split('test', platform=2)

    def test_empty_string(self):

        s = ''

        expected = []

        self.assertEqual(split(s, 0), [])

        self.assertEqual(split(s, 1), [])

    def test_no_spaces(self):

        s = 'singleword'

        self.assertEqual(split(s,0), ['singleword'])

        self.assertEqual(split(s,1), ['singleword'])

    def test_posix_quotes(self):

        s = 'a "b c" d'

        expected = ['a', 'b c', 'd']

        self.assertEqual(split(s, 1), expected)

    def test_windows_quotes(self):

        s = 'a "b c" d'

        expected = ['a', 'b c', 'd']

        self.assertEqual(split(s, 0), expected)

    def test_mixed_quotes(self):

        s = 'a"b c" d"e f"'

        # Windows: split into ['a', 'b c', 'd', 'e f']

        # because the quotes around "b c" and "e f" are enclosed.

        # Wait, the input is 'a"b c" d"e f"'?

        # Let me think: in Windows, the quotes around "b c" and "e f" are each enclosed.

        # The first part is a"b c" → the a is outside the quotes, so the first token is 'a', then the "b c" is the next token (so 'b c'), then 'd' is outside, and the "e f" is enclosed → 'e f'.

        So the split would be ['a', 'b c', 'd', 'e f'].

        So the test would check that.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed to write the code first based on the shlex approach.

Wait, the code needs to import shlex and sys.

So the code would be:

import shlex
import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            posix = False
        else:
            posix = True
    elif platform == 1:
        posix = True
    elif platform == 0:
        posix = False
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform value")

    return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

Wait, but in Python, the platform parameter is passed as an integer (0 or 1) or 'this' as a string. So the code is correct.

Wait, but the platform parameter is passed as platform='this' by default. So in the code, when the user passes platform=0 or 1, it's okay.

Testing the function with the examples:

For the test case where s = 'a"b c" d' and platform=0 (Windows):

shlex.split(s, posix=False) → let's see.

The input string is 'a"b c" d'

When using shlex.split with posix=False:

The quotes are used to group the tokens. Let's see:

The first token is 'a"b c"', but since the quotes are not enclosing the entire string? Wait, perhaps I should run this through the code.

Wait, perhaps in the example 'a"b c" d', the shlex.split with posix=False would parse it as:

The first token is 'a"b c"', but that has unbalanced quotes? Or does shlex allow that?

Hmm, in that case, the input has a quote but no closing quote, which would be invalid. So perhaps the test case I thought of earlier is not a valid input. Maybe I should pick a valid input.

Let me think of a valid input where the quotes are properly closed.

For example, 'a"b c" d' is not properly closed. The quote after 'a' starts but the next quote is after 'c', so that's balanced? Wait, 'a"b c" d' has the quotes around 'b c', so the entire string is a"b c" d → the first quote is after the a, then the closing quote after c. So the quotes are properly closed. The a is outside the quotes, so the first token is 'a', then the quoted part is 'b c', then 'd'.

Yes, that's a valid input. So the shlex.split with posix=False would split that correctly.

So the code should work.

Now, the code uses shlex.split, which is exactly the right tool for this job. So the code seems correct.

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, only the code. So I'll present the code with the necessary imports and the function.

Wait, but in the problem's function signature, the platform parameter is given as 'this' as the default. So the code is correct.

Thus, the code is as written above.
