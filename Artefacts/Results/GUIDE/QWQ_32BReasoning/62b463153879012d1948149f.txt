Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _eval_file based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function takes a prefix and a file_path. Its goal is to determine the type of the file. The return values depend on certain conditions. Let me parse the requirements again.

First, return None if the file doesn't match the prefix or if the file type is XML. Wait, how do I check if the file matches the prefix? Maybe the prefix is part of the file path? Like, the file path should start with the prefix? Or perhaps the prefix is a directory path, and the file is within that directory? Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear. But the function's parameters are prefix and file_path. Maybe the prefix is a string that the file path should start with. So first, check if the file_path starts with the prefix. If not, return None.

Next, check the file type. How do I determine the file type? The doc mentions XML and PDF. So probably checking the file extension. Like, if the file ends with .xml, then return None. If it's .pdf, then return a dict with component_id and file_path. For other types (not XML or PDF?), return a dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again? Wait, the description says: "return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type is pdf. return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path if the type is not pdf." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read again.

The doc says: "Return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type of the file is 'pdf', return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path if the type of the file is not 'pdf'."

Wait, the second part says for non-pdf files (but not XML, because XML returns None). So the non-pdf case is when the file is not XML and not PDF? Because XML returns None, so the only other case is non-pdf (but non-XML) files. Wait, the first condition says to return None if the file doesn't match the prefix OR the type is XML. So if the file does match the prefix but is XML, then return None. So for the non-XML, non-pdf files, the return is a dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again? Wait, the keys listed are component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again? That can't be right. Maybe it's a typo. Let me read again.

The description says for non-pdf files (but not XML, since XML returns None), the return is a dict with keys component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path? That doesn't make sense because the keys can't have duplicates. Maybe it's a mistake in the description. Perhaps the intended keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. Because the wording might have a mistake. Let me see again:

"return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type of the file is 'pdf', return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path if the type of the file is not 'pdf'."

Hmm, maybe the second part's keys are component_id, file_path, ftype, and maybe another key? Or perhaps the user made a typo and meant to list component_id, ftype, and file_path? Or maybe the second dict includes component_id, file_path, and ftype. The duplicate "file_path" in the key list is probably a mistake. So assuming that for non-pdf (but not XML), the dict has component_id, file_path, and ftype. Because that makes sense. The first case for PDF includes component_id and file_path. The second case adds ftype. So the keys are component_id, file_path, ftype.

So the steps are:

1. Check if the file path starts with the prefix. If not, return None.

2. Determine the file type based on the extension. Let's see:

   - If the file is XML (ends with .xml), return None.

   - If it's PDF (ends with .pdf), return a dict with component_id and file_path.

   - Else (other types like .txt, .csv, etc.), return a dict with component_id, file_path, and ftype (the type, like 'txt', 'csv', etc.)

Wait, but how do I get the component_id? The function's parameters don't include component_id. Wait, the function's parameters are prefix and file_path, but the return requires component_id. The docstring doesn't specify where component_id comes from. That's a problem. Wait, maybe component_id is derived from the file path? Or perhaps the component_id is the same as the file's base name? Like, the part after the last slash and before the extension? For example, if the file is /path/to/file.pdf, component_id would be 'file'? Or maybe the entire file path? Or perhaps it's part of the prefix? Hmm, the problem description isn't clear here. Wait, looking back at the docstring:

The return for PDF is a dict with keys component_id and file_path. The return for non-pdf (non-XML) is component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path (probably a typo, so just component_id, file_path, ftype). So where does component_id come from? The function's parameters don't have it. Maybe component_id is the file's base name without the extension? Or maybe the prefix is used to generate it? Or perhaps the component_id is the same as the file_path? The problem statement is unclear. Wait, perhaps the component_id is the file's name (without path) without the extension. Let me assume that. For example, if the file is /some/path/to/file.txt, the component_id is 'file'. But how to get that from the file_path?

Alternatively, maybe component_id is the same as the file's name (with path) but without the extension. Or perhaps it's just the base name. Maybe the problem expects that component_id is the file's name without extension, and the function is supposed to extract that. Alternatively, maybe component_id is just the part after the last slash. Hmm, the problem's description is unclear here, but given the function's parameters, perhaps the component_id is derived from the file's name. Let's proceed under the assumption that component_id is the base name of the file without the extension.

So, steps again:

- Check if the file_path starts with the given prefix. If not, return None.

- Split the file_path to get the extension. For example, using os.path.splitext.

- The extension is the part after the last dot. So, for 'file.xml', the extension is 'xml'. For 'file.pdf', it's 'pdf', etc.

- If the extension is 'xml', return None.

- Else, if the extension is 'pdf':

   - create a dict with keys 'component_id' and 'file_path'.

   - component_id is the base name without the extension. So, using os.path.basename(file_path) to get the filename, then splitext again to remove the extension.

- For other extensions (non-xml, non-pdf):

   - create a dict with keys 'component_id', 'file_path', and 'ftype'.

   - 'ftype' is the extension (without the dot). So, 'txt' for .txt, etc.

Wait, but the problem says "ftype, file_path" again in the keys, but that's probably a mistake. So assuming ftype is the third key.

Now, writing the code.

First, the function:

def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):

But first, need to check if the file_path starts with prefix. So:

if not file_path.startswith(prefix):

    return None

Wait, but maybe the prefix is a directory, and the file is under it. But startswith would work if the prefix is the directory path. However, perhaps we need to handle case where the prefix is a directory, so the file_path should start with the prefix, but with a slash? Like, if the prefix is '/a/b', then the file path should start with '/a/b/'? Hmm, maybe the startswith check is sufficient. Let's proceed.

Then, get the extension:

base_name = os.path.basename(file_path)

root, ext = os.path.splitext(base_name)

ext = ext.lstrip('.').lower()  # to handle cases like .XML, etc.

Wait, but the problem's examples are in lowercase? Maybe we should make it case-insensitive. So converting to lowercase.

So:

_, ext = os.path.splitext(base_name)

ext = ext[1:].lower()  # because splitext returns with '.'.

So, for 'file.XML' → ext is 'xml'.

Then, if ext == 'xml', return None.

Else, if ext == 'pdf':

    component_id = root  # because root is the base name without the extension.

    return {'component_id': component_id, 'file_path': file_path}

Else (other extensions):

    return {'component_id': root, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': ext}

Wait, but what about if the file has no extension? Like 'file'? Then, ext would be empty string. So the code would process it as non-pdf and non-xml. So ftype would be empty string. But the problem says to return the ftype as the file type. So maybe that's acceptable. Or perhaps in that case, the ftype is empty. But the problem's description doesn't specify that.

Now, code steps:

import os

def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):

    if not file_path.startswith(prefix):

        return None

    base_name = os.path.basename(file_path)

    root, ext = os.path.splitext(base_name)

    ext = ext[1:].lower()  # remove '.' and lowercase

    if ext == 'xml':

        return None

    if ext == 'pdf':

        return {

            'component_id': root,

            'file_path': file_path,

        }

    else:

        return {

            'component_id': root,

            'file_path': file_path,

            'ftype': ext,

        }

Wait, but the else case includes non-pdf and non-xml files, which is correct.

Now, the problem says "the type of the file is xml" → return None. So that's handled.

Now, unit tests. Since the user mentioned to use TDD, first write tests.

Possible test cases:

1. File does not start with prefix → returns None.

Test case: prefix is '/a/b', file is '/c/d/file.txt' → returns None.

2. File is XML → returns None.

Test case: file is '/a/b/file.XML' → ext is 'xml', so returns None.

3. File is PDF → returns component_id and file_path.

E.g., file is '/a/b/report.pdf' → component_id is 'report', ftype not present.

4. Non-XML, non-PDF file → returns component_id, file_path, and ftype.

Like, file is '/a/b/data.csv' → component_id 'data', ftype 'csv'.

Edge cases: file with no extension (like '/a/b/file' → ftype is empty string?), or uppercase extensions.

Testing case where extension is uppercase, like .PDF → still gets converted to lowercase, so handled.

Another test: file path exactly matches the prefix (e.g., prefix is '/a/b', file is '/a/b' → but that's a directory? Maybe the code still processes it as a file. But the function probably treats the file as a file even if it's a directory. The problem doesn't specify that.

Another test: the file has multiple dots, like 'file.name.txt' → splitext gives 'txt' as the extension.

Now, writing the tests.

Using pytest:

def test_eval_file_does_not_match_prefix():

    result = _eval_file('/a/b', '/c/d/file.txt')

    assert result is None

def test_eval_xml_file():

    result = _eval_file('/a/b', '/a/b/report.XML')

    assert result is None

def test_pdf_file():

    result = _eval_file('/a/b', '/a/b/report.PDF')

    assert result == {

        'component_id': 'report',

        'file_path': '/a/b/report.PDF',

    }

def test_non_pdf_non_xml_file():

    result = _eval_file('/a/b', '/a/b/data.csv')

    assert result == {

        'component_id': 'data',

        'file_path': '/a/b/data.csv',

        'ftype': 'csv',

    }

def test_no_extension():

    result = _eval_file('/a/b', '/a/b/file')

    assert result == {

        'component_id': 'file',

        'file_path': '/a/b/file',

        'ftype': '',  # since there's no extension.

    }

def test_mixed_case_extension():

    result = _eval_file('/a/b', '/a/b/report.PdF')

    assert result == {

        'component_id': 'report',

        'file_path': '/a/b/report.PdF',

    }

Wait, because the code converts to lowercase. So 'PdF' → 'pdf', so it's treated as PDF.

Now, putting all together. The code seems to handle the cases.

Wait, but what about the component_id when the file has a path like '/a/b/c/file.txt'? The root is 'file', so component_id is 'file', correct.

Another thing: the function's parameters are prefix and file_path. The code uses startswith, but on some systems, the path separators may vary (like Windows uses backslashes). However, the problem probably expects that the prefix and file_path are given in a way that startswith works, like using consistent slashes. Or perhaps the code should use os.path.normcase or something, but maybe that's beyond the scope here. Since the problem doesn't specify, proceed as is.

Now, the code seems okay. Let me check the return for the non-pdf case. The keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. The docstring says "return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path" which is probably a mistake. But the code is correct as per the intended meaning.

So the final code should be as written above, including the import of os.
