Okay, I need to write a Python decorator called mru_cache that works similarly to the LRU cache but uses a Most Recently Used algorithm. The parameters are maxsize and typed, just like in the functools.lru_cache. But since it's MRU, the least recently used items are kept, and the most recent are evicted when the cache is full. Wait, no, actually MRU would evict the least recently used items, right? Wait, no. Wait, the MRU algorithm typically keeps the most recently used items, so when the cache is full, the least recently used is removed. So similar to LRU, but the eviction is based on the same criteria. Hmm, maybe the difference between MRU and LRU here is that in LRU, you evict the least recently used when the cache is full, and in MRU, maybe the most recently used stays and the older ones are evicted? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The MRU cache would evict the least recently used item when the cache is full. Wait, actually, that's the same as LRU. Hmm, maybe the difference is that in some contexts, like in operating systems, MRU might evict the most recently used, but that doesn't make much sense. Maybe the problem here is that the user wants an MRU cache that stores up to maxsize results, and when it's full, the most recently used items stay and the oldest are evicted? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check what the user's requirement is. The docstring says it's a decorator to wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves up to maxsize results based on MRU. So the MRU algorithm here probably means that the cache keeps the most recently used items, and when the cache is full, the least recently used is evicted. So similar to LRU, except that maybe the ordering is different? Wait no, LRU also evicts the least recently used. So maybe the difference is that in MRU, the order is maintained such that the most recent is kept first, so when the cache is full, the oldest entry is removed. That would be the same as LRU. Hmm, perhaps the user is using MRU as a synonym, or perhaps there's a different structure. Maybe the MRU cache is ordered such that the most recently used is at the front, and the least recently used is at the back, so when the cache is full, you remove from the back. So the order is maintained in a queue, with the most recent at the front, and the oldest at the end. So when the size exceeds maxsize, you remove the oldest. That would be the same as LRU. Hmm, perhaps the difference is that the user wants the most recently used to stay, so when you have a cache full, you evict the least recently used. So the algorithm is the same as LRU. Wait, then why the name MRU? Maybe the user made a typo and meant LRU? Or perhaps the problem is to implement an MRU cache where the most recently used are kept, and the least recently used are evicted. Wait, that's exactly what LRU does. Maybe the user is using MRU and LRU interchangeably here. Alternatively, perhaps the MRU cache stores the most recently used items, so when the cache is full, the oldest entry is removed. So the structure is similar to LRU. Therefore, the decorator should work like lru_cache but using an MRU algorithm, but maybe the order is maintained in a way that the most recent is first. So perhaps the code can be similar to the LRU cache, but using a different data structure or order. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the MRU to keep the most recent entries and evict the oldest ones, so the logic is the same as LRU. Therefore, perhaps the code can be similar to the LRU cache, but perhaps with a different name. But the problem is to implement it from scratch. 

So the approach is to create a decorator that wraps a function and caches its results using an MRU cache. The decorator must accept the parameters maxsize and typed, just like lru_cache. The cache should store up to maxsize entries. When the cache is full, the least recently used entry is evicted. 

The first step is to think about how to structure the cache. We need a data structure that can track the order of accesses. A common approach is to use a dictionary to hold the key-value pairs and a linked list (or an ordered dict) to track the order. Python's collections.OrderedDict can be useful here because it maintains the insertion order, but when you access an element, you can move it to the end. Wait, but for LRU, you move the accessed item to the end, so the least recently used is the first element. So for LRU, you remove the first element when the cache is full. For MRU, perhaps the eviction is the same as LRU? Because in both cases, the least recently used is evicted. Maybe the difference is just the name. 

Wait, maybe the problem is that the user wants an MRU cache that evicts the most recently used item when the cache is full? That would be counterintuitive. Probably the user intended the same as LRU. So perhaps the code can be written similarly to the LRU cache using an OrderedDict. 

The steps for the decorator:

1. The decorator function takes the function to be wrapped and the parameters (maxsize and typed). 

2. The cache will be an ordered dictionary, where the keys are the function's arguments (tuples), and the values are the results. 

3. The typed parameter, when True, will consider different argument types as different keys. So, for example, 1 (int) and 1.0 (float) would be treated as different even if they are the same value. 

4. When the function is called, the arguments are converted into a key (using inspect if necessary, but perhaps using the parameters directly as a tuple). However, for functions with variable arguments or keyword arguments, the key must account for all parameters. 

Wait, the standard approach for creating a cache key is to use the function's arguments as a tuple, but for keyword arguments, the keys must be included. The functools.lru_cache uses the signature to get the parameters. 

Hmm, but implementing this from scratch is going to require handling the parameters correctly. 

Alternatively, the decorator can use the function's arguments as the key, converting them into a hashable type, taking into account the 'typed' parameter. 

Wait, the 'typed' parameter in the lru_cache means that, for example, passing 1 as an int and 1 as a float would be treated as different. So, if typed is True, the type of each argument is part of the key. 

So for the key, each argument's type is also considered. 

Therefore, the key construction needs to handle that. 

So, the steps for the decorator:

The decorator function mru_cache will return a wrapper function that checks the cache for the key generated from the function's arguments. 

Implementing the cache:

We can use an OrderedDict to track the order of accesses. 

Each time the function is called with certain arguments, we generate a key. 

If the key is in the cache, we move it to the end (since it's the most recent access) and return the value. 

Wait, but in the MRU case, perhaps the order is maintained such that the most recent is at the end. So when you access an existing key, you move it to the end. When adding a new key, you append to the end. When the size exceeds maxsize, you pop the first item (the oldest). 

Wait, that's exactly how the LRU cache works. 

So perhaps the code is the same as the LRU cache, except that the name is MRU. 

Therefore, the code can be written using an OrderedDict, and the eviction is done by popping the first item when the cache is full. 

Now, the parameters:

The 'maxsize' is the maximum number of entries. 

The 'typed' parameter, when True, ensures that the types of the arguments are considered when creating the key. 

So, to create the key, we need to take each argument's type into account if 'typed' is True. 

Wait, how exactly does the 'typed' parameter work in lru_cache? Let me think. 

Suppose typed is False, then 1 (int) and 1.0 (float) would be considered the same key. 

If typed is True, then they are different. 

So the key needs to include the type of each argument. 

Therefore, for each argument, we can represent it as (type(arg), arg), but only if the argument is hashable. 

Alternatively, for each positional and keyword argument, we need to encode their type and value. 

This complicates the key creation, especially for functions with variable numbers of arguments and keywords. 

Alternatively, using the inspect module to get the signature of the function and then building the key from the parameters. 

Alternatively, using the function's parameters as a tuple, and for each element, if typed is True, include the type as part of the element. 

Wait, perhaps the key can be built as a tuple of (type(arg), arg) for each argument. 

But for functions with multiple arguments, this needs to be done for each. 

Alternatively, for each argument, we can create a tuple (type(arg), arg) and then combine all into a tuple. 

So, for example, if the function is called with (1, 'a'), and typed is False, the key would be (1, 'a'). If typed is True, it would be ((int, 1), (str, 'a')). 

This way, the key is unique when the types differ. 

Therefore, the key construction is as follows:

def make_key(args, kwargs, typed):
    key_parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if typed:
            key_parts.append( (type(arg), arg) )
        else:
            key_parts.append( arg )
    for k, v in sorted(kwargs.items()):
        if typed:
            key_parts.append( (k, (type(v), v)) )
        else:
            key_parts.append( (k, v) )
    return tuple(key_parts)

Wait, but the order of keyword arguments must be sorted to ensure that the same parameters in different orders produce the same key. 

Wait, in Python, the order of keyword arguments doesn't matter unless they are passed in a different order, but when stored as a dictionary, the order is not preserved. Hence, to make the key consistent, the keyword arguments should be sorted by their keys. 

Therefore, the code for the key would involve sorting the keyword arguments by their keys, then combining them into a tuple. 

This seems a bit involved, but necessary. 

Putting this together, the steps for the decorator:

The decorator function mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False) returns a wrapper function. 

The wrapper function will handle the actual caching. 

Inside the wrapper, we need to store the cache (an OrderedDict), the maxsize, and the typed flag. 

Wait, the wrapper will need to close over these variables. 

The structure is something like this:

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        # cache setup here
        cache = collections.OrderedDict()
        func.maxsize = maxsize
        func.typed = typed
        # ... other attributes if needed ...

        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # create the key
            key = create_key(args, kwargs, typed)
            if key in cache:
                # move to the end (most recent)
                cache.move_to_end(key)
                return cache[key]
            else:
                # compute the result
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                if len(cache) >= maxsize:
                    # remove the oldest (first item)
                    cache.popitem(last=False)
                cache[key] = result
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But first, need to implement the key creation. 

The create_key function must take into account the typed parameter. 

Wait, perhaps the code for the key would be:

def make_key(args, kwargs, typed):
    parts = []
    for a in args:
        if typed:
            parts.append( (type(a), a) )
        else:
            parts.append(a)
    for k, v in sorted(kwargs.items()):
        if typed:
            parts.append( (k, (type(v), v)) )
        else:
            parts.append( (k, v) )
    return tuple(parts)

But how to handle the keyword arguments correctly. 

Wait, in the code above, the keyword arguments are sorted by their keys, so their order is consistent. 

Yes. 

So in the wrapper function, the key is made by calling this function with the arguments. 

But in the code, the wrapper function can't have a helper function like that unless it's inside. 

Alternatively, inside the wrapper function, the key is built step by step. 

Alternatively, inside the wrapper function, when given *args and **kwargs, we need to process them. 

So putting all this together, the code would be:

Wait, but in the code, we need to use the 'typed' variable from the outer scope. 

Wait, in the code above, inside the wrapper, when creating the key, the 'typed' is the parameter passed to the decorator. 

So in the code:

Inside the wrapper:

key_parts = []
for a in args:
    if typed:
        key_parts.append( (type(a), a) )
    else:
        key_parts.append(a)
for k in sorted(kwargs.keys()):
    v = kwargs[k]
    if typed:
        key_parts.append( (k, (type(v), v)) )
    else:
        key_parts.append( (k, v) )
key = tuple(key_parts)

Wait, that's the logic. 

Now, the problem is that in Python, the arguments can be any type, but the key must be hashable. So, the parts must form a hashable type. 

The tuple of these elements will be hashable as long as each element is hashable. 

But for mutable types like lists or dictionaries, this might be a problem, but that's the same as the lru_cache's behavior, which also can't handle mutable arguments unless they are hashable. 

Therefore, the code proceeds under the assumption that the function's arguments can be converted into a hashable key. 

Now, the cache is an ordered dict. 

Each time a key is accessed (either a hit or a miss when adding a new entry), we need to move it to the end? 

Wait, no. 

Wait, when a key is found in the cache (hit), we want to mark it as the most recently used, so we move it to the end. 

When adding a new key, we append it to the end. 

So, in the case of a hit:

cache.move_to_end(key) 

so that it's placed at the end (most recent). 

Then, when the cache is full, when adding a new entry, we pop the first item (the oldest, since they are in order of insertion, with the most recent at the end). 

Wait, but the ordered dict in Python's collections has the move_to_end method, which moves the key to either end. 

So, in the case of a hit, moving to the end keeps it as the most recent. 

When adding a new entry, it's placed at the end. 

When the size exceeds maxsize, we pop the first item (the oldest). 

Therefore, the code for the wrapper function would be as follows:

def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    key = make_key(args, kwargs, typed)
    if key in cache:
        # move to end, mark as recently used
        cache.move_to_end(key)
        return cache[key]
    else:
        # compute the value
        res = func(*args, **kwargs)
        if len(cache) >= maxsize:
            # remove the oldest (first item)
            cache.popitem(last=False)
        cache[key] = res
        return res

Wait, but when adding a new key, we don't have to move it anywhere, since it's added at the end. 

Yes. 

Now, the cache is stored as an instance variable inside the wrapper's closure. 

Wait, in the code structure:

The decorator is a function that takes maxsize and typed, and returns a decorator (the inner function 'decorator') that takes the function and returns the wrapper. 

Inside the decorator function (the one that takes 'func'), the cache is initialized as an ordered dict. 

The problem is that the cache needs to be per-function, right? Because each function decorated with mru_cache will have its own cache. 

Yes, because the wrapper function is created per function. 

So the code structure should be correct. 

Now, the code also needs to handle the case where the function is called with different types but same values when typed is False. 

Testing this would require unit tests. 

The user mentioned to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. 

So, I need to think about how to write the tests. 

But since the problem requires me to output only the code, I can proceed to write the code based on this logic. 

Potential issues:

- The key creation must handle all possible argument types, including varargs and keywords. 

Wait, in the key creation, the code I outlined earlier handles positional arguments and keyword arguments, but what about *args and **kwargs in the function's signature? 

Hmm, the current approach treats all positional and keyword arguments as part of the key, which is correct. 

For example, if the function is called with *args, those are part of the args tuple. 

Similarly, **kwargs are part of the kwargs dict. 

Therefore, the code should handle that. 

Another consideration: the 'typed' parameter affects each argument's type. 

Another possible issue: the use of the sorted keyword arguments. 

Yes, because dictionaries in Python before 3.7 don't maintain insertion order, so sorting is necessary to ensure the same keys are generated when the same parameters are passed in different orders. 

So the code for the key is correct. 

Now, the code structure:

We need to import the necessary modules. 

We'll need collections.OrderedDict and functools.wraps. 

So the code starts with:

import functools
from collections import OrderedDict

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        cache = OrderedDict()
        func.wrapped = func  # Not sure if needed, but similar to lru_cache
        # Or maybe store attributes on the wrapper? 

        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # create key
            key_parts = []
            for a in args:
                if typed:
                    key_parts.append( (type(a), a) )
                else:
                    key_parts.append(a)
            for k in sorted(kwargs.keys()):
                v = kwargs[k]
                if typed:
                    key_parts.append( (k, (type(v), v)) )
                else:
                    key_parts.append( (k, v) )
            key = tuple(key_parts)
            
            if key in cache:
                # move to end
                cache.move_to_end(key)
                return cache[key]
            else:
                res = func(*args, **kwargs)
                if len(cache) >= maxsize:
                    # evict the oldest (first item)
                    cache.popitem(last=False)
                cache[key] = res
                return res
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but in the code above, the 'cache' is stored inside the decorator's closure. Each time the decorator is called (per function), a new cache is created. That's correct. 

Wait, yes. Each call to mru_cache returns a decorator (the 'decorator' function). When the decorator is applied to a function, it creates a new wrapper and a new cache. 

Yes. 

Another possible issue is that the 'cache' is part of the closure of the wrapper, so each function gets its own cache. 

Now, the code uses the 'typed' parameter correctly. 

Testing this code with some examples:

Example 1: 

@memoized with maxsize=2, typed=False.

def f(a, b):
    return a + b

Calling f(1, 2) gives 3. The key is (1,2). 

Then f(3,4) → key (3,4). 

Then f(1,2) again → hit, so the key is moved to end. 

Then calling f(5,6) → now the cache has 3 entries. So the oldest entry (the first one, which was (3,4) or (1,2)?) 

Wait, the first insertion is (1,2), then (3,4). 

Then when f(1,2) is called again, it's a hit and moved to end. The order in the cache would be [(3,4), (1,2)] after the second call. 

Then adding (5,6), the cache size is now 3, so the first item (3,4) is popped. 

Thus the cache now holds (1,2) and (5,6). 

Another example with typed=True. 

Calling f(1, 1.0) with typed=True would have key parts ( (int,1), (float, 1.0) ), so the key is ((int,1), (str('b'), (float,1.0)) )? Wait, in the function f(a,b), the first argument is a (int), second is b (float). So the key parts would be:

for a in args: (type(1) is int, so (int,1)), then for b, (float, 1.0). 

So the key is ( (int,1), (float, 1.0) ). 

If typed were False, the key would be (1, 1.0). 

Thus, the code handles typed correctly. 

Now, the code's use of the key parts is correct. 

Another possible issue: in the case of functions with *args and **kwargs. 

Suppose the function is defined as def f(a, b, *args, **kwargs): 

Then, when called with f(1,2, 3,4, x=5, y=6), the args tuple would be (1,2,3,4), and the kwargs would be {'x':5, 'y':6}. 

The key parts would include all of those, so the code handles that. 

Now, what about functions with default parameters? 

The default parameters are part of the function's definition, so as long as the arguments passed are captured in *args and **kwargs, the key is built correctly. 

Therefore, the code should handle that. 

Now, the code uses the functools.wraps decorator to preserve the function's name, docstring, etc. 

Now, the code's structure is correct. 

Now, what about the 'maxsize' being zero? 

If maxsize is zero, the cache is disabled. 

Wait, in the current code, if maxsize is zero, then when adding a new entry, len(cache) >=0 is always true, so when adding a new entry, it would pop an item. 

But if maxsize is zero, perhaps the cache should not store anything. 

Wait, in the current code, if maxsize is zero, then every time you add a new entry, you pop the first item (but the cache is empty, so it would throw an error). 

Hmm, so need to handle maxsize=0. 

The standard lru_cache handles maxsize=0 by disabling caching. 

So in the code, when maxsize is zero, the cache is not used. 

Therefore, the code should check if maxsize is zero and not use the cache. 

Wait, but in the current code, if maxsize is zero, then when the user tries to add a new entry (since the cache is empty initially), the 'if len(cache) >= maxsize' (0) would be true, so it would try to pop an item from an empty cache. 

Thus, that's a problem. 

Therefore, the code needs to handle the case where maxsize is zero. 

We can add a check for that. 

In the decorator function, perhaps:

def decorator(func):
    if maxsize <=0:
        # return a simple wrapper that just calls the function
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    else:
        # create the cache and the wrapper with the code above
        ...

Wait, that's a good point. 

So modifying the code to first check if maxsize is zero. 

So the code would be:

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        if maxsize <=0:
            @functools.wraps(func)
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            return wrapper
        else:
            cache = OrderedDict()
            @functools.wraps(func)
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                key_parts = []
                # ... the key creation code ...
                key = tuple(key_parts)
                if key in cache:
                    cache.move_to_end(key)
                    return cache[key]
                else:
                    res = func(*args, **kwargs)
                    if len(cache) >= maxsize:
                        cache.popitem(last=False)
                    cache[key] = res
                    return res
            return wrapper
        return decorator
    return decorator

Wait, but the code structure is a bit different. 

Wait, the outer function mru_cache returns the decorator function, which takes 'func'. 

Inside the decorator, first check if maxsize is <=0, and return a simple wrapper. 

Otherwise, proceed with the cache. 

Yes. 

That's an important fix. 

Another edge case: maxsize=1. 

Testing with that would be good. 

Another possible issue: when the cache is exactly at maxsize, adding a new item would evict the oldest. 

Now, the code should handle that. 

Another possible problem: the key creation for functions with no arguments. 

For example, a function with no parameters would have args as empty tuple and no kwargs. 

The key parts would be empty, so key is an empty tuple, which is hashable. 

Thus, that case is handled. 

Now, the code is almost correct. 

Wait, in the code for the key parts, when processing the keyword arguments, for each k in sorted(kwargs.keys()), then v is the value. 

The code appends (k, (type(v), v)) when typed is True, else (k, v). 

Wait, the key parts are a list of elements, which are the positional arguments and the keyword arguments. 

The positional arguments are first, then the keyword arguments. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Now, the code for the key is built as a tuple of all these elements. 

Thus, the key is correctly formed. 

Now, the code's use of the OrderedDict. 

Yes. 

Therefore, the code seems correct. 

Now, to write the code properly with the necessary imports and structure. 

Also, need to make sure that the code uses the correct variables. 

The code:

import functools
from collections import OrderedDict

def mru_cache(maxsize=128, typed=False):
    def decorator(func):
        if maxsize <= 0:
            @functools.wraps(func)
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            return wrapper

    return decorator

Wait, but there's an error in the structure. 

Wait, in the code above, the 'decorator' function (the inner function of mru_cache) returns the wrapper function. 

But in the code, after checking if maxsize <=0, the code returns the wrapper, but the code has an else clause that returns the wrapper. 

Wait, the structure is: 

def decorator(func):
    if condition:
        return wrapper1
    else:
        ... create wrapper2 and return it. 

    return decorator 

Wait, no, the code inside the 'decorator' function (the inner function of mru_cache) must return the wrapper. 

Wait, in the code above, after the 'else' clause, the code defines the wrapper and returns it. 

So the code is okay. 

Wait, the code for the decorator function (the one that takes 'func') is structured as:

def decorator(func):
    if maxsize <=0:
        ... return wrapper1
    else:
        ... create wrapper2 and return it. 

    return decorator 

Wait, no, the 'return decorator' is outside? 

Wait, the code for mru_cache is:

def mru_cache(...):
    def decorator(func):
        ... 
    return decorator 

So the code is correct. 

Another possible error: the 'cache' variable is inside the else clause, so it's only defined when maxsize is not zero. 

But in that case, when maxsize is not zero, the code creates the cache and the wrapper. 

Yes. 

Thus, the code is correct. 

Now, I need to output this code as per the user's instruction. 

Wait, but the user said to output only the code in Python markdown format, so within triple backticks. 

Also, the code should be properly formatted. 

So, the final code is as above, enclosed in ```python ... ``` .
