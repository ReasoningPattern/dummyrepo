Okay, I need to write a Python function called oneline that takes a script string and a separator, which defaults to " && ", and converts the script into a one-line command using that separator. The function's goal is to take each line of the input script, strip any whitespace from the ends, and then join them with the separator. 

First, I should think about how to process the script. The input is a string, so splitting it into lines can be done using splitlines(). Then, each line should be stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. So for each line in script.splitlines(), I'll do line.strip(). Then, join all those stripped lines with the separator.

Wait, but what if the script has empty lines or lines that are just whitespace? After stripping, those lines would become empty strings. So when joining, those would effectively be ignored? Or should they be included as empty parts? Let me check the requirements. The doc says "convert a script to one line command with the given separator". I think the idea is to take each non-blank line, maybe? Or perhaps even if a line is just whitespace, stripping it would make it empty, and then when joined, it would contribute a separator followed by an empty string. But maybe the user wants to ignore lines that are blank after stripping. Hmm, the problem statement isn't explicit. The example separator is " && ", which is typical for command-line commands where each command is separated. So in a shell script, empty lines probably wouldn't be part of the command chain. So maybe we should filter out any lines that are empty after stripping.

Wait, the function's doc says "the given separator" is used to join the lines. So perhaps every line is joined, even if after stripping they are empty. But maybe that's not desired. Let me think again. Suppose the input script is "echo start\n   \n echo end", splitting into three lines. The middle line is all whitespace. Stripping each line would give ["echo start", "", "echo end"]. Then joining with " && " would give "echo start &&  && echo end". That might not be intended. So perhaps the function should filter out any lines that are empty after stripping.

Therefore, the steps would be:

1. Split the script into lines using splitlines().
2. For each line, strip whitespace from both ends.
3. Filter out any lines that are empty after stripping.
4. Join the remaining lines with the separator.

So the code would look something like:

def oneline(script, separator=" && "):
    lines = (line.strip() for line in script.splitlines())
    non_empty = (line for line in lines if line)
    return separator.join(non_empty)

Wait, but using generators here might be efficient. Alternatively, list comprehensions. Let me see.

Alternatively:

stripped_lines = [line.strip() for line in script.splitlines()]
filtered_lines = [line for line in stripped_lines if line]
return separator.join(filtered_lines)

That would work too. The first approach uses a generator expression inside the join, but since the first lines generator is a generator, when you iterate over it again in the non_empty generator, it might not work as expected because the first generator would be exhausted. Wait, right. So in the first approach, if I chain the generators like that, the first lines generator is a generator, and when you do (line for line in lines if line), the lines is already being consumed once. So that approach might not work because the first generator would be exhausted before the second one can process it. So better to make it a list first, then filter.

So the correct approach is to first create a list of stripped lines, then filter out the empty strings, then join with the separator.

So the code would be:

def oneline(script, separator=" && "):
    stripped = [line.strip() for line in script.splitlines()]
    filtered = [line for line in stripped if line]
    return separator.join(filtered)

Hmm, but in the problem description, the function's Args are script (str) and separator (str). So the parameters are correct. Also, the return is a string. 

Now, I need to think about test cases. Since the user mentioned to use test-driven development, first write the tests. Let me think of some test cases.

Test case 1: A script with multiple lines, no leading/trailing whitespace. For example:

script = "echo hello\nls -l\ncd .."
Expected output: "echo hello && ls -l && cd .."

Test case 2: Script with lines that have leading/trailing spaces. Like:

script = "  echo start  \n   \n  echo end  "
After stripping each line: ["echo start", "", "echo end"], filtered becomes ["echo start", "echo end"], so joined with " && " gives "echo start && echo end".

Test case 3: Separator is different, like "; ". So same script as test case 1 would use that separator.

Test case 4: An empty script. The input is an empty string. Then splitlines() would be an empty list. Stripped is empty, filtered is empty. Then joining with any separator would be an empty string. So the function returns empty string.

Test case 5: A script with only whitespace lines. Like "   \n   \n    " → after stripping, all lines are empty, so filtered is empty → return empty.

Another edge case: a single line with leading and trailing spaces. Like script = "  ls -l  " → stripped becomes "ls -l", so the output is "ls -l".

Test case where the separator is something else, like " || ".

Now, in unit tests, using pytest:

First, the tests would be something like:

def test_oneline_multiple_lines():
    script = "echo first\nls -l\ncd .."
    expected = "echo first && ls -l && cd .."
    assert oneline(script) == expected

def test_leading_trailing_whitespace():
    script = "  echo start  \n   \n  echo end  "
    expected = "echo start && echo end"
    assert oneline(script) == expected

def test_empty_script():
    assert oneline("") == ""

def test_only_whitespace_lines():
    script = "\n   \t   \n    "
    assert oneline(script) == ""

def test_custom_separator():
    script = "a\nb"
    assert oneline(script, separator="; ") == "a; b"

These tests would cover the main cases.

Now, the code as per the function signature. The parameters are script (str) and separator (str). The function's return is a string. So the code I wrote earlier should work.

Wait, but in the code, the parameter is called 'seperator' in the function signature, but the docstring says 'separator' (with two 'r's). Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The function signature is def oneline(script, seperator=" && "): with a typo 'seperator' instead of 'separator'. The docstring's Args lists 'separator' (correct spelling) with Args: script: str, separator: str. So there's a discrepancy here. Oh wait, in the problem's function signature, the parameter is named 'seperator', but the docstring says 'separator' in Args. That's a mistake, but since the user provided that as the function signature, we have to follow it. Wait, let me check again.

Looking back:

The user wrote:

def oneline(script, seperator=" && "):
    """
    Convert a script to one line command with the given seperator.

        Args:
                script: str
                separator: str
        Returns:
                str, the one-line command.
    """

Wait, the parameter name is 'seperator', but in the Args list, it's written as 'separator' (with two r's). That's a typo in the problem statement. However, the function's parameter is named 'seperator', so the code must use that parameter name. So in the function definition, the parameter is 'seperator', but the docstring lists 'separator' as an arg. That's conflicting, but since the user provided that, perhaps the correct approach is to follow the function's parameter name. So the parameter is called 'seperator', but the docstring's Args mention 'separator' with two r's. That's a mistake, but the code must use the parameter name as given in the function signature. So the code must have the parameter 'seperator', but in the docstring's Args, it's written as 'separator'. That's a problem, but perhaps the user intended the parameter to be 'separator', but wrote 'seperator' by mistake. However, since the problem says to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, I have to follow exactly what is given. 

Wait, the function's parameter is 'seperator' (with one 'r'), but the docstring says 'Args: separator: str'. That's a discrepancy. So perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the parameter name in the code to 'separator' to match the docstring's Args. Because otherwise, the code would have a parameter named 'seperator' which is misspelled, but the docstring refers to it as 'separator'. That would be an error. So maybe it's a typo in the function signature, and the intended parameter is 'separator'. Therefore, the correct parameter name should be 'separator', and the function's definition should be def oneline(script, separator=" && "):. But the user provided the function signature with 'seperator', so perhaps I should follow it. But that would lead to inconsistency between the parameter name and the docstring's Args. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the function signature. Let me check again.

The user wrote:

def oneline(script, seperator=" && "):
    """
    ... 
    Args:
            script: str
            separator: str
    ...

So the parameter is 'seperator', but the docstring's Args says 'separator'. This is a mistake. To resolve this, the code must have the parameter name as 'seperator' (as per the function signature), but the docstring should mention 'seperator' instead of 'separator'. But since the user provided the docstring as is, I have to choose between two options: either correct the parameter name to 'separator' so that the docstring's Args matches, or keep the parameter as 'seperator' and have the docstring mention 'seperator' in the Args. Since the problem says to follow the given function signature and docstring, perhaps I should proceed with the parameter name as 'seperator', even though it's misspelled, and the docstring's Args has 'separator'. 

In the code, the function will have the parameter 'seperator', so the code must use that variable name. For example, in the code, the separator is passed as 'seperator' (the parameter name). So in the code, the variable is called 'seperator', but the docstring says 'separator'. 

So, in the code, the function definition is as given. So the code would be:

def oneline(script, seperator=" && "):
    stripped = [line.strip() for line in script.splitlines()]
    filtered = [line for line in stripped if line]
    return seperator.join(filtered)

Wait, but the parameter is 'seperator', so the code uses 'seperator' correctly. The docstring's Args mentions 'separator', but that's a typo in the problem's docstring. The user might have intended the parameter name to be 'separator', but the function signature has a typo. Since the problem says to generate code based on the provided signature and docstring, perhaps the code should follow the function's parameter name as 'seperator' even if the docstring has a typo. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the function signature's parameter name, and the correct parameter name is 'separator', so the function's parameter should be that. In that case, the code would use 'separator' as the parameter name, and the docstring's Args is correct. Since the problem's docstring says 'separator' in the Args, perhaps the function signature's parameter name was a typo, and the correct parameter is 'separator'. So maybe I should adjust the parameter name to 'separator', but the problem's function signature says 'seperator'. 

Hmm, this is a bit of a problem. The user might have made a typo. Let me check the problem again. The user's function signature is:

def oneline(script, seperator=" && "):

and the docstring says:

Args:
        script: str
        separator: str

So the parameter is named 'seperator' (with one 'r'), but the docstring says 'separator' (with two 'r's). This inconsistency must be addressed. Since the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the code should correct this inconsistency. Because otherwise, the parameter name in the function is wrong, leading to errors. So perhaps the correct approach is to adjust the parameter name to 'separator', as per the docstring, even though the function's signature has a typo. Alternatively, the code must follow exactly the function signature provided. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended 'separator' but mistyped it. Since the problem is about generating the code, perhaps the code should use the correct spelling, 'separator', and adjust the function signature accordingly. However, the user's instruction says to follow the given function signature and docstring. 

This is a problem. Since the user's function signature has 'seperator', the code must use that parameter name. Therefore, in the code, the parameter is 'seperator', and the code uses that variable. The docstring's Args mentions 'separator', but that's a mistake in the problem's input, but the code can't fix that. 

So the code would be as I wrote earlier, with the parameter 'seperator'. 

Testing that, in the test cases, when the parameter is called 'seperator', the code works. 

Therefore, the code is as follows. 

Now, putting it all together. The code should first have the function with the parameter 'seperator', and the rest as per the logic. 

Wait, another thing: in the function, the default separator is " && ", which is correct. 

So the final code would be:

def oneline(script, seperator=" && "):
    """
    Convert a script to one line command with the given seperator.

        Args:
                script: str
                separator: str
        Returns:
                str, the one-line command.
    """
    stripped = [line.strip() for line in script.splitlines()]
    filtered = [line for line in stripped if line]
    return seperator.join(filtered)

Wait, but in the docstring's Args, the parameter is called 'separator' (with two 'r's), but the actual parameter is 'seperator'. That's a problem. The docstring is misleading. But since the problem's given function signature has 'seperator', the code must use that. 

Therefore, the code is correct as written. 

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, but only the code. So the final code block would be enclosed in triple backticks with the python language tag. 

So the code is as above. 

Wait, let me check again: the function's parameters must be exactly as given. 

Yes. 

Another point: the splitlines() method. Does it handle different line endings? Well, splitlines() by default splits on universal newline, so that's okay. 

Edge case when the input has lines that are empty even after stripping: they are filtered out. 

Yes. 

So the code should work as intended.
