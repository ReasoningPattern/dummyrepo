Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function protocol_handlers based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns different forms of Bolt protocol handlers based on the protocol_version. So, probably this function is part of a class, maybe a factory method that selects the correct handler class based on the version provided.

First, I should think about how the handlers are structured. Maybe there are different classes like Bolt1xHandler, Bolt2xHandler, etc., each handling a specific protocol version. The function would check the protocol_version and return the appropriate handler class. If no version is given, maybe it returns all handlers or a default? The docstring isn't clear, but perhaps it's supposed to return all available handlers if no version is specified.

Wait, the function is a class method (since it's cls as the first parameter). So maybe it's part of a base handler class, and the method returns the appropriate subclass based on the version. So, the implementation would involve checking the protocol_version and returning the corresponding class.

Now, considering test-driven development, I should first write unit tests. Let me think of some test cases. For example, if protocol_version is 1, return Bolt1xHandler; if 2, return Bolt2xHandler; if None, maybe return a list of all handlers. But I need to know the possible versions and their corresponding classes. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's say the supported versions are 1, 2, 3, each with their own handler classes.

So, the tests would check that for each version, the correct class is returned. Also, test the case when protocol_version is None, expecting a list of all handlers. Also edge cases like invalid versions should raise an error, but the docstring doesn't mention that. Hmm, maybe the function just returns None or raises an error for invalid versions. But since the docstring says "based on the value", perhaps it's up to the caller to handle that. Or maybe the function returns the best possible handler or raises an exception. The problem isn't clear here, so maybe the function just returns the handler for the given version, or all if none.

Wait, the function is called protocol_handlers, plural. Maybe when no version is given, it returns a list of all available handlers. So, the tests should check that.

So, the first step is to write the test cases. Let me outline that.

First, import unittest. Then, create a test case class. Let's assume the handler classes exist. For example:

class TestProtocolHandlers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_returns_bolt1_handler(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(1)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, Bolt1xHandler)

    def test_returns_bolt2_handler(self):
        handler = MyClass.protocol_handlers(2)
        self.assertIsInstance(handler, Bolt2xHandler)

    def test_returns_all_handlers(self):
        handlers = MyClass.protocol_handlers()
        self.assertIn(Bolt1xHandler, handlers)
        self.assertIn(Bolt2xHandler, handlers)
        # etc for other versions

    def test_invalid_version_raises_error(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            MyClass.protocol_handlers(99)

Wait, but the function's return is "different forms" â€” perhaps each version has a specific handler class, so the function returns the class, not an instance. So in the tests, perhaps we check that the returned value is the correct class. So the first test would be self.assertIs(handler, Bolt1xHandler), assuming the function returns the class itself.

So the function's job is to map the protocol_version to the appropriate handler class. The actual code would have a dictionary mapping versions to classes. For example:

handlers = {
    1: Bolt1xHandler,
    2: Bolt2xHandler,
    3: Bolt3xHandler,
}

Then, the function would check if protocol_version is provided. If so, return the corresponding class. If not, return all values in the dict as a list.

Wait, but the function is a class method. So maybe the handlers are stored as a class attribute. So inside the cls, there's a _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS dictionary.

So putting it together, the code would look something like:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS
    if protocol_version is not None:
        return handlers[protocol_version]
    else:
        return list(handlers.values())

But then, the class would need to have the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS defined. But in the problem statement, the function is part of the class, so the code must be written within that class's context. Wait, the function is a class method of cls, so the function is part of a class, which presumably has the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS as a class attribute.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a base class, and the subclasses are the handlers. But that's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return instances, but given the docstring, I think returning the classes makes more sense here, especially since it's a factory method.

So, the tests would check that the correct class is returned for each version, and all are returned when none is given. Also, when an invalid version is given, perhaps a KeyError is raised, or a ValueError. The tests should check that.

Now, writing the code. The function would need to have access to the handler classes. So, the class (probably a base class for all handlers) would have a dictionary that maps versions to the handler classes.

So, in the code, the class would have something like:

class BoltProtocolHandler:
    _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS = {}

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        ...

Wait, but the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS would need to be populated by the subclasses. Alternatively, the base class could have a method to register handlers. But perhaps that's beyond the scope here. The problem is to write the function based on the signature and docstring, so perhaps the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is a class attribute of the cls that this method is part of.

Assuming that the cls has a class attribute _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS which is a dictionary mapping version numbers to handler classes, then the code is straightforward.

So, the code for the function would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS
    if protocol_version is not None:
        try:
            return handlers[protocol_version]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")
    else:
        return list(handlers.values())

Wait, but the docstring says "Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version." So if no version is given, it returns all the handlers. The function could return a list of all handler classes. But in the case where a version is given, it returns the specific handler class for that version.

So the code uses the cls's _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS to look up. Also, when protocol_version is not given, returns all handlers as a list.

Now, the tests would need to check that. For example, in the test case, the test would need to have the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS set up. But in the test, perhaps we can mock that or set it up in the test class.

Alternatively, in the test, we can create a subclass of the class under test and set the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS for testing.

Hmm. Let me think of how to structure the test. Let's say the function is part of a class called ProtocolHandlerFactory. Then the test would be:

class TestProtocolHandlers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_returns_correct_handler_for_version_1(self):
        class TestFactory:
            _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS = {
                1: Bolt1Handler,
                2: Bolt2Handler
            }
            @classmethod
            def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
                # the code here
            }
        handler = TestFactory.protocol_handlers(1)
        self.assertIs(handler, Bolt1Handler)

But this requires that the test sets up the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS. Alternatively, the test could patch the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS. But perhaps for simplicity, in the tests, the test class can set up a mock or use a test class with known handlers.

Alternatively, the code's test would have to assume that the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is properly set. So maybe in the test, the test case sets the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS as part of the test setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the code's _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is a class-level dictionary, and the test can set it before running the tests.

Hmm, perhaps the tests would look like this:

class TestProtocolHandlers(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.handlers = {
            1: 'Bolt1Handler',
            2: 'Bolt2Handler',
            3: 'Bolt3Handler'
        }
        # Assuming the class under test has a _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS attribute
        # So, for the test, we can set it on the test class.
        # Let's say the function is part of a class called ProtocolHandler:
        self.ProtocolHandler._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS = self.handlers

    def test_returns_specific_handler(self):
        handler = ProtocolHandler.protocol_handlers(2)
        self.assertEqual(handler, self.handlers[2])

    def test_returns_all_handlers(self):
        all_handlers = ProtocolHandler.protocol_handlers()
        self.assertEqual(all_handlers, list(self.handlers.values()))

    def test_invalid_version(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            ProtocolHandler.protocol_handlers(4)

Wait, but in Python, to set a class attribute, you can do ProtocolHandler._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS = ... So that's manageable.

So, the tests would need to set up the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS for the class being tested. The actual code for the function would then rely on that dictionary.

Now, the code for the function itself, as per the problem, is the protocol_handlers method. So putting it all together:

The code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS
    if protocol_version is not None:
        try:
            return handlers[protocol_version]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")
    else:
        return list(handlers.values())

That's the code. Now, the user asked to output only the code in Python markdown format. But first, the test-driven approach requires generating the tests first, then the code. But since the user wants the code generated, I think the code is the function as above, assuming that the class has the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS dictionary.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps the code is the function's implementation, along with the necessary setup (like the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS dictionary). But the problem states that the function is part of the class, so the code would need to be within the class definition, including the class attribute.

Wait, the function is a class method. So the code would be part of a class, perhaps like this:

class ProtocolHandlersFactory:
    _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS = {
        1: Bolt1Handler,
        2: Bolt2Handler,
        3: Bolt3Handler,
    }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # the code here

But the problem's function signature is def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), so that's correct.

Therefore, the code to be output is the function's implementation, assuming that the class has the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS dictionary.

But the user didn't mention the rest of the class structure, so perhaps the code is just the function as written, with the necessary error handling and the use of the class's _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.

So the final code is as written above. Now, I should present it in Python markdown format. The user said to output only the code, in Python markdown, so probably using triple backticks with the Python language tag.

Wait, but the user also mentioned to first generate comprehensive unit tests before the code. But since the user wants the code generated, perhaps the code includes the function, and the tests are part of the process but not part of the output. Wait, the problem says to generate the code based on the signature and docstring. The tips mention to follow TDD by first generating tests before code, but the output should only be the code. So I think the code is the function's implementation, as above.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

class WhateverTheClassIs:
    _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS = { ... }

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        handlers = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS
        if protocol_version is not None:
            try:
                return handlers[protocol_version]
            except KeyError:
                raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")
        else:
            return list(handlers.values())

But since the problem only asks for the function's code, given the signature, perhaps the code is just the function's body, assuming the class has the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.

Therefore, the final code is the function as written, enclosed in the class.

Wait, the function is a class method. So the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS
    if protocol_version is not None:
        try:
            return handlers[protocol_version]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported protocol version: {protocol_version}")
    else:
        return list(handlers.values())

But that's the code for the function. The user probably expects that the code is written as part of the class, but the problem's function signature is given as def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), so the code is as above.

Therefore, the code to be output is the function as written, enclosed in a markdown code block with Python syntax highlighting.
