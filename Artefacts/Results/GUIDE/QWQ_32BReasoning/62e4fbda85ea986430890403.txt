Okay, I need to write a Python function called _shuffled that takes a sequence of strings and returns a shuffled list of them, but using a fixed random seed. The user mentioned test-driven development, so first I should think about the unit tests.

Hmm, the function should shuffle the sequence but in a deterministic way because of the fixed seed. So every time you call it with the same input, the output order should be the same. Let's think of possible test cases.

First, maybe test with a simple list like ["a", "b", "c", "d"]. What's the expected shuffled result? Since the seed is fixed, the order should be predictable. Let me think: if I use random.shuffle with a seed, how does that work? Oh right, you have to set the seed before shuffling. Wait, but the function's doc says to use the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. Oh, right, so the seed is a constant in the function. So the function must use a specific seed every time, like seed(42) or something.

Wait, the problem says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED" but the function signature doesn't have a parameter for the seed. So perhaps the seed is hardcoded inside the function. So the test needs to check that the same input always returns the same output.

So for the test, let's pick an example input and see what the output would be. Let me try in a Python shell to figure out the expected result. Let's say the fixed seed is 42. Let's see:

Suppose the input is ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]. Let's set the seed to 42, then shuffle a copy of this list. Let me try that:

import random

random.seed(42)
original = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
shuffled = original.copy()
random.shuffle(shuffled)
print(shuffled)

Wait, but when I run this, what's the output? Let me see. I can actually run this code in my head or recall that with seed 42, the shuffle would produce a specific order. Alternatively, maybe I should just proceed and code it, but the test case needs to know the expected result. Alternatively, maybe the seed is a different number, but the problem doesn't specify which seed to use. Wait, the problem's docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED" but there's no parameter for it. So perhaps the seed is a constant, like 0 or 42, but the problem doesn't say. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to use a fixed seed, but the actual value isn't specified. So perhaps in the code, the seed is set to a particular value, like 0, and the tests need to reflect that.

Wait, but how can I write tests without knowing the seed? The user must have intended that the seed is a fixed value, so perhaps in the code, the seed is set to 42, and the tests will check the expected output based on that. So I need to choose a seed, say 42, and then write tests based on that.

Let me proceed. Let's assume the seed is 42. Let me create a test case where the input is [1,2,3,4,5], but wait, the function's input is a sequence of strings. Let's use ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]. Then, after shuffling with seed 42, what order would they be in? Let me compute that.

Wait, I can't do that in my head. Let me think of a simple example. Let's take a smaller list. Let's try with ["a", "b", "c", "d"], seed 42. Let me code this:

import random

random.seed(42)
lst = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
random.shuffle(lst)
print(lst)

When I run this, what would be the output? Let me try to simulate:

The random.shuffle uses the random's internal state. The seed(42) would set it so that the shuffle is deterministic. Let me actually run this in my mind. Alternatively, maybe I should just proceed to code the function, but the problem requires the tests first.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach, like using the random module's functions with a seed, but the seed is fixed. So the function would be something like:

def _shuffled(seq):
    result = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(result, random=lambda: 0.5)  # Not sure, but maybe with a fixed seed.

Wait, no. The correct way is to set the seed before shuffling, but that would affect the global state of the random module. Oh right, but if the function is called multiple times, each call would advance the random number generator's state, leading to different results unless the seed is reset each time. Wait, so to make the shuffle deterministic regardless of previous calls, the function should reset the seed each time it's called. But that's not thread-safe, but given the problem's constraints, perhaps that's the way.

Wait, so the function must, every time it's called, set the seed to the fixed value, then shuffle the sequence. So the code would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq):
    fixed_seed = 42  # Or some other number?
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(fixed_seed)
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result

Wait, but if you call this function multiple times, the seed is reset each time, so each call will produce the same result as the first. That's correct, because the shuffle should be the same every time given the same input. So that's okay.

But then, in the tests, the expected output must be based on that seed. So the first test case would be, for example, input ["a", "b", "c", "d"], the output after shuffling with seed 42 would be a specific order.

Wait, but I need to know what that order is. Let me think of a small example. Let me try with the list [1,2,3,4,5] (but since the function requires strings, maybe using letters). Let me imagine that with seed 42, the shuffle of ['a','b','c','d'] gives a certain order. For example, let's say when I run the code with that seed, the result is ['d', 'a', 'c', 'b'] (this is just a made-up example, but I need to compute the actual one).

Alternatively, perhaps the seed is 0, but I have to pick a seed and stick with it. Let me choose 42 as the seed. Let me try to compute the actual output for a sample input.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the random.shuffle's behavior. The shuffle uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm, and the random numbers are generated by the random module's .random() function, which, after seeding, will produce a fixed sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just write the code, but the problem requires that the tests are written first. So the user wants me to generate the tests first, then the code.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, the unit tests. Let's think of a few test cases.

Test 1: Input is empty list. The output should also be an empty list.

Test 2: Input is a single-element list. The output should be the same as the input, since shuffling a single element doesn't change it.

Test 3: Input with multiple elements. Let's pick a sample input and compute the expected output.

Suppose the fixed seed is 42. Let's pick the input ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'].

We can compute the expected shuffled list by writing a small script:

import random

def test_case():
    test_input = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    expected = []
    # compute expected using seed 42
    random.seed(42)
    temp = test_input.copy()
    random.shuffle(temp)
    expected = temp
    return expected

Running this would give the actual expected list. Let me actually do this in code (since I can't in my mind):

Let me run this code snippet. Let me see:

In Python, when you seed with 42 and shuffle a list of ['a','b','c','d','e'], what happens?

Let me run this:

import random

random.seed(42)
lst = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
random.shuffle(lst)
print(lst)

The output would be something like ['e', 'd', 'b', 'a', 'c'] (but I need to actually compute this).

Wait, I can't run this right now, but perhaps I can recall that the first call to random() after seed(42) is 0.6394267988572232. Let's see:

The shuffle works by iterating from the end to the start, swapping each element with a random index between 0 and the current index.

For the list of 5 elements, the steps are:

Start with [0,1,2,3,4] (indices).

For i from 4 down to 1:

At i=4, pick a random index j between 0 and 4.

The first random() value after seed(42) is 0.6394267988572232. Multiply by 5 (since i is 4, the max is 4, so the range is 0 to 4 inclusive). 0.6394 *5 ≈ 3.197, so integer part is 3. So j = 3.

So swap elements at 4 and 3: original elements at positions 4 (e) and 3 (d). The list becomes [a, b, c, e, d].

Next, i=3: pick a random number between 0 and 3. The next random() after the first is?

Let me see: the first call after seed(42) gives 0.6394267988572232.

The next would be the second number. Let me think: perhaps the next is 0.025010751991053953 (this is from actual testing in a Python environment, but I'm trying to recall).

Assuming that the second random() is ~0.025, so multiplied by 3 (i=3) gives ~0.075, so j=0.

So swap element 3 and 0: current elements at position 3 is e (from previous step) and position 0 is a. So swapping them gives [e, b, c, a, d].

Next i=2: pick a random between 0 and 2. Let's say the next random is 0.045 (just making up numbers). 0.045 *3 is ~0.135 → j=0.

Swap elements at 2 and 0. The elements at 2 is c and 0 is e → swap → [c, b, e, a, d].

i=1: pick between 0 and 1. Let's say the next random is 0.07, so 0.07*2 = 0.14 → j=0.

Swap elements at 1 and 0: elements are b and c → becomes [b, c, e, a, d].

So the final list after shuffling would be ['b','c','e','a','d'].

But this is all based on made-up random numbers. The actual result would require running the code. Since I can't do that right now, maybe I should choose a different seed or a different input where the order is easier to predict.

Alternatively, perhaps the seed is 0. Let me try seed(0):

Testing with seed(0):

The first random() would be 0.6459011589877223 (for example). Let's see:

Wait, perhaps it's better to choose a seed that gives a predictable result. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Maybe the seed is 0, and the first shuffle of [a,b,c,d] would be in a certain order.

Alternatively, perhaps the seed is set inside the function, but the problem requires that the code uses a fixed seed, so the tests must be written with that in mind.

Alternatively, maybe the seed is 19, and the test case uses a simple input where the order is easy to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed by writing the tests assuming that the function uses seed(42), and then compute the expected output based on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the seed is 0, and the code is written accordingly. Let me try to think of a small example.

Suppose the input is ["a", "b", "c"], and the seed is 42. The expected output would be a specific permutation. Let me imagine that when shuffled with seed(42), the order is ["c", "a", "b"], for example.

So for the test case:

def test_shuffled_empty():
    assert _shuffled([]) == []

def test_shuffled_single():
    assert _shuffled(["only"]) == ["only"]

def test_shuffled_example():
    input_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
    expected = ["e", "d", "b", "a", "c"]  # This is a guess
    assert _shuffled(input_list) == expected

Wait, but I need to make sure the expected list is correct. Since I can't compute it right now, perhaps I can use a different approach. Maybe the code uses random.sample with the seed, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a new list, so the original is not modified. The tests should check that.

Another test case could check that the returned list is a different object from the input if the input is a list (but if it's a tuple, then it's converted to a list).

Wait, the function's input is a Sequence[str], which can be a list, tuple, etc. The output is a list. So the function must return a new list, not modifying the original.

Another test could check that the length is the same as the input.

So, the tests would be:

- Test empty list → empty list.
- Test single element → same element.
- Test that the output is a list, not the original type (if input was a tuple).
- Test that the order is shuffled deterministically.

So for the third test, pick an input with a known seed's result.

Alternatively, perhaps I can choose a seed where the shuffle of [1,2,3,4,5] becomes [3,4,2,5,1], but using strings, it would be the same indices.

Alternatively, perhaps the seed is 0 and the first shuffle of ['a','b','c','d'] would be in some order. Let's see:

Suppose seed is 0.

In code:

import random

random.seed(0)
lst = ['a','b','c','d']
random.shuffle(lst)
print(lst)

Suppose the output is ['d', 'b', 'a', 'c'].

Then the test case would be:

def test_shuffled_example():
    input_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    expected = ['d', 'b', 'a', 'c']
    assert _shuffled(input_list) == expected

So that's one possible test.

Assuming the seed is 0, but how do I know? The problem says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", but the function's parameters don't include it. So the seed must be a constant inside the function.

Therefore, the code will have a fixed seed, like 0 or 42. Since the problem doesn't specify, I have to pick one. Let's pick 42.

Thus, the code would set the seed to 42 each time.

So the function would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(42)
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result

But then, in the test case, I need to know what the output is for a given input. Let's pick a simple input like ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], and compute the expected output.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a different seed. Alternatively, perhaps the seed is 0, but I need to proceed.

Let me proceed with the tests first, then code.

So the tests:

import unittest
from typing import Sequence
from my_module import _shuffled  # assuming the function is in my_module

class TestShuffled(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty(self):
        self.assertEqual(_shuffled([]), [])
        
    def test_single_element(self):
        input_list = ["only"]
        self.assertEqual(_shuffled(input_list), input_list)
        
    def test_known_order(self):
        input_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
        expected = [...]  # need to compute this
        
Wait, but without knowing the expected result, how can I write the test? That's a problem. Maybe I should choose a test input where the order is easy to predict with a certain seed. Let's try seed(0) with a small list.

Let me imagine that with seed(0), the shuffle of [0,1,2,3] (indices) would generate certain swaps.

Wait, let's try seed(0) with the list ['a','b','c','d'].

The code:

import random

random.seed(0)
lst = ['a','b','c','d']
random.shuffle(lst)
print(lst)

The output might be something like ['d', 'b', 'a', 'c'].

Assuming that's the case, then the test would have expected = ['d', 'b', 'a', 'c'].

So the test case would be:

def test_known_order(self):
    input_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
    expected = ["d", "b", "a", "c"]
    self.assertEqual(_shuffled(input_list), expected)

Another test case with a longer list, but perhaps the seed is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the seed to be 0. Let's proceed with that assumption.

Now, for the code:

The function must take a sequence, convert to a list, then shuffle with the fixed seed.

Thus, the code would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    fixed_seed = 0  # Or 42? Let's pick 0 for the tests above.
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(fixed_seed)
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result

Wait, but in the test case I thought of with seed 0, the input ["a","b","c","d"] gives ["d", "b", "a", "c"]. So the test would pass.

Thus, the code and tests would be as such.

Now, putting all together, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, only the code. But first, the tests, then the code.

Wait, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The user wants the code (the function) and the tests? Or just the function? The problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code is the function. But the instructions say to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code. But the user wants the output to be only the code generated (the function), not the tests. But the TDD approach requires writing tests first, but the user wants the code, so perhaps the function is the code to output.

So, the function is:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(42)  # or 0? Let me choose 42 as it's commonly used.
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result

Wait, but in my earlier example with seed 42, the test case for ["a","b","c","d"] might have a different expected output. To confirm, perhaps I should pick seed 0 for simplicity, but I need to decide.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the seed to be 0. Let me go with seed 0.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects that the function uses a specific seed, but since it's not given, the code uses a fixed value like 0 or 42. Let me proceed with seed 0.

Thus, the function code would be:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(0)
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result

Then, the tests would check for the expected output based on seed 0.

But since the user only wants the code (the function), I can proceed to write the function with the seed set to 0. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, but given the information, this is the best I can do.

Wait, but in the problem's docstring, it says "shuffle with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED". But the parameter doesn't include the seed. So the seed must be a constant in the function. So the code must include that.

Thus, the final code would be as above, with the seed set to 0 or 42. Since I can't test, I'll choose 0 for simplicity. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different seed, but I have to make a choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the seed is 19, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the seed to be 0, so I'll proceed with that.

So the final code:

import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED."""
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(0)  # Fixed seed
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result

Now, to make sure that the tests would pass. Let me think of the test for ["a","b","c","d"] with seed 0 gives ["d", "b", "a", "c"] as before.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, the user wants only the code in Python markdown format. So:

```python
import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(0)
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result
```

Wait, but why seed 0? Because in my example, that's what I used. But perhaps the problem expects another seed. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the seed to be 42. Let me think again.

Suppose I choose seed 42. Let's see what happens with the input ["a","b","c","d"].

Running the code:

import random

random.seed(42)
lst = ['a','b','c','d']
random.shuffle(lst)
print(lst)  # what's the output?

The actual output would require running the code, but since I can't, I can't be sure. However, perhaps the problem expects that the seed is 42. Let me proceed with that.

Thus, the code would set the seed to 42:

```python
import random

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    result = list(seq)
    random.seed(42)
    random.shuffle(result)
    return result
```

But I need to ensure that the function is correct. The key point is that the seed is fixed, so the shuffle is deterministic.

The user's question requires the code to be generated, so the final answer is the code with the fixed seed (42 or 0). Since 42 is a common choice for a seed, I'll go with that.

Thus, the final code is as above with seed 42.
