Okay, I need to write the Python code for the make_parsers() function based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it should build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple. 

Hmm, I think this is related to the argparse module in Python. The main parser and subparsers are typically part of an argument parser setup where you can have subcommands. So, the function probably creates an ArgumentParser, adds a subparsers action, and returns both the main parser and the subparsers object as a tuple.

First, I should think about the structure. The main parser is created, then a subparsers object is obtained using add_subparsers(). The function should return (parser, subparsers). 

Now, following test-driven development, I need to write unit tests first. Let me outline what the tests should check. 

The first test case could check that the function returns a tuple of two elements. The second test would verify that the first element is an instance of ArgumentParser. The third test should confirm that the second element is an instance of _SubParsersAction. 

Wait, how do I get the subparsers object? The subparsers are usually retrieved by calling parser.add_subparsers(), so the make_parsers function must do that. 

Wait, the function's docstring says "build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple." So the function must create the main parser, then get the subparsers via add_subparsers(), then return both. 

So the code for make_parsers would be something like:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return (parser, subparsers)

But let's think about the tests. The first test would check the length of the returned tuple. The second test checks the type of the first element. The third test checks the type of the second element. 

Wait, the subparsers object is an instance of _SubParsersAction. So in the test, I need to import that class from argparse. 

Now, writing the tests. Let's see. The tests would be something like:

import unittest
from argparse import ArgumentParser, _SubParsersAction
from module import make_parsers  # Assuming the function is in module.py

class TestMakeParsers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_returns_tuple_of_two(self):
        result = make_parsers()
        self.assertIsInstance(result, tuple)
        self.assertEqual(len(result), 2)

    def test_first_element_is_ArgumentParser(self):
        parser, _ = make_parsers()
        self.assertIsInstance(parser, ArgumentParser)

    def test_second_element_is_SubParsersAction(self):
        _, subparsers = make_parsers()
        self.assertIsInstance(subparsers, _SubParsersAction)

But wait, how does the subparsers variable get assigned? Because when you call parser.add_subparsers(), it returns the _SubParsersAction instance. So that's correct. 

Now, putting this all together. The code for make_parsers is straightforward. The tests are necessary to ensure that the function works as expected. 

Wait, but the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the user wants the actual code for the function, not the tests. The tests are part of the TDD approach, but the code to be written is just the function. 

Wait, the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the actual code is the function make_parsers. The tests are part of the thinking process but not part of the final output. 

Therefore, the correct code would be importing argparse and returning the tuple as I thought. Let me confirm again. 

Yes. The function should return the parser and the subparsers. So the code is as above. 

Wait, but sometimes when using add_subparsers(), people might set a 'dest' or other parameters, but the docstring doesn't specify any particular configuration. So the minimal code is correct. 

So the final code is:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return (parser, subparsers)

I should make sure that the return is a tuple. Also, the docstring is included. 

Yes, that should be correct. Let me think if there are any edge cases. For example, does the add_subparsers() need any parameters? The default call works, so as per the problem's requirement, it's acceptable. 

Therefore, the code should be as above. Now, I need to present it in Python markdown format, which probably means putting it within ```python delimiters. But the user says to output only the code generated, so just the code without the markdown, but the problem says "in python markdown format". Maybe they mean using the markdown code block with python syntax highlighting. 

So the final answer is the code inside triple backticks with python language specified. 

Wait, the user's instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be enclosed in markdown code blocks. 

Therefore, the code block would be:

```python
import argparse

def make_parsers():
    """
    Build a parser and its subparsers and return them as a tuple.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return (parser, subparsers)
```

Yes, that's it. I think that's the correct code.
