Okay, I need to generate Python code for the initialize method based on the given function signature and docstring. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so first I should think about the unit tests, then the actual code.

First, the method is part of a class, probably related to OCFL storage. The initialize method's purpose is to create and initialize a new OCFL storage root. So, what does that entail? The OCFL (Object Format for Content黎流) specifies a directory structure. The storage root would be the base directory containing all the objects. 

The OCFL storage root typically has directories like "inventory", "versions", etc. Wait, actually the OCFL storage root has a versioned inventory and a content directory. Maybe the initialize method creates the necessary directories and files, like the initial inventory file. 

So, the steps for initialize would be: check if the directory exists, create it if not, then set up the necessary files. But I should ensure that if the directory already exists, maybe it's an error? Or maybe it's idempotent? The docstring says "create and initialize a new", so probably it should only create a new one, so if the directory already exists, it might raise an error.

Hmm, but how to structure the code. The class probably has a path attribute pointing to the storage root. So in the initialize method, the code would create the directory structure. Let me think of the structure: the OCFL storage root has an 'inventory' directory, and a 'versions' directory? Wait, the OCFL spec says the storage root has an inventory.json file, and a versions directory. Wait, maybe I should check the OCFL spec. But since I can't look it up now, I'll proceed with common knowledge.

The OCFL storage root directory structure might include:

- .ocfl_layout (a hidden file indicating the root)
- inventory/ directory with inventory files
- versions/ directory for object versions
- maybe other metadata?

Alternatively, the root directory must have an inventory file, perhaps inventory/0/contents.json or something like that. Wait, maybe the initial inventory is a 0 version. Hmm, perhaps the initialize method creates the root directory, sets up the .ocfl_layout file, and creates the necessary directories and the initial inventory.

So, in the initialize method, the code would:

1. Check if the root directory exists. If it does, maybe raise an error because you can't re-initialize an existing one. Or perhaps it's allowed to re-initialize, but that's probably not the case here.

2. Create the root directory if it doesn't exist.

3. Create the necessary subdirectories like 'inventory' and 'versions'.

4. Write the .ocfl_layout file indicating the root.

5. Create the initial inventory file, perhaps in inventory/0/contents.json, but I might be mixing up the exact structure.

Alternatively, the OCFL storage root's inventory is in a specific format. The initialize method should set up the minimal structure required for an OCFL storage root. The OCFL spec requires that the storage root has an inventory file, so maybe the first step is to create the inventory directory structure.

Wait, perhaps the initialize method should create the storage root's directory structure according to the OCFL standard. For example, the root directory must have a .ocfl_layout file, and the inventory directory with the initial inventory version. 

But to write the code, I need to think of the steps. Let's outline the steps again:

- Ensure the root directory does not exist, or if it does, it's empty. Maybe the method is for creating a new one, so if the directory exists and is non-empty, it's an error.

- Create the root directory.

- Create subdirectories like 'inventory' and 'versions'.

- Create the .ocfl_layout file in the root.

- Create the initial inventory file, perhaps in inventory/0/... but the exact path may depend on OCFL version.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is stored in a way that the first version is 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the inventory directory has a 0/contents.json file. 

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with creating the necessary directories and files, even if I'm not exactly sure of the structure. The unit tests would help here.

Now, for the unit tests. Since I need to write them first, let's think of what the tests should check.

First, test that the initialize method creates the directory structure.

Test case 1: When the root directory doesn't exist, initialize creates it and the necessary subdirectories and files.

Test case 2: If the root directory already exists and has files, it should raise an error (like FileExistsError or a custom exception).

Test case 3: Check that the .ocfl_layout file exists in the root.

Test case 4: Check that the inventory directory exists, and perhaps the initial inventory file exists.

Wait, but how to structure the tests. Let's think of using the unittest framework.

The tests would create an instance of the class with a temporary directory, call initialize, then check the directory structure.

So, for the tests:

- Use the unittest module, perhaps with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory to create a test directory.

- Test that after initialize, the directories (inventory, versions) exist, and the .ocfl_layout file is present.

- Test that calling initialize again on an existing directory raises an error.

Wait, but maybe the initialize method can be called multiple times as long as the directory is already set up. Or perhaps it's an error to call it on an existing storage root.

Alternatively, the initialize method should only be called once, so if the directory already exists, it's an error.

So in the test, first case: create a new directory, call initialize, check structure.

Second case: create an existing directory with some files, call initialize, should raise an error.

Third case: check the presence of the .ocfl_layout file.

Fourth case: check the inventory directory structure.

Now, for the actual code:

The class would have a path attribute, say self.root_path. The initialize method would:

- Check if the directory exists. If not, create it.

- Then, create the necessary subdirectories (inventory, versions).

- Create the .ocfl_layout file in the root.

- Create the initial inventory file (maybe in inventory/0/contents.json?), but perhaps the exact structure is part of the OCFL spec. Since I might not remember exactly, maybe the code would create the inventory directory and write the initial inventory file, but the details might vary.

Alternatively, the initialize method may set up the root with the required files according to the OCFL spec. Let's think of the OCFL storage root requirements. The OCFL storage root must have an inventory file in the inventory directory. The initial inventory might be at inventory/0/contents.json, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a file in the root directory named inventory.json. Hmm, I might be mixing up versions here.

Alternatively, the OCFL storage root's inventory is in a versioned structure. For example, the inventory directory has a subdirectory for each version, like 1/, 2/, etc., each containing a contents.json and a digest file.

Wait, perhaps the initial inventory is stored as inventory/0/contents.json, but the exact structure might be critical. Since I can't recall exactly, maybe I should proceed with the code that creates the necessary directories and files, but perhaps the test will check for the presence of the inventory directory and the .ocfl_layout file.

In any case, the code for initialize would involve creating directories and files.

Now, writing the code.

The class would have an __init__ that takes a path. The initialize method would handle the setup.

Possible code:

def initialize(self):
    """Create and initialize a new OCFL storage root."""
    root_path = self.root_path  # Assuming the class has a root_path attribute
    if os.path.exists(root_path):
        # Check if it's an existing OCFL root or not. If not, error
        # Alternatively, raise an error if the directory exists
        # For simplicity, maybe just check if it exists and is not empty?
        # Or, perhaps the OCFL root can only be initialized once
        # So, if the directory exists, raise an error
        # But how to check if it's already an OCFL root? Maybe check for .ocfl_layout
        # But for the first implementation, perhaps just check existence and raise
        # Or, maybe it's allowed to initialize an existing directory, but that's not standard
        # So, to prevent overwriting, if the directory exists, error
        raise FileExistsError(f"Storage root {root_path} already exists")
    # Create the directory
    os.makedirs(root_path, exist_ok=True)
    # Create subdirectories
    inventory_dir = os.path.join(root_path, 'inventory')
    versions_dir = os.path.join(root_path, 'versions')
    os.makedirs(inventory_dir)
    os.makedirs(versions_dir)
    # Create .ocfl_layout file
    with open(os.path.join(root_path, '.ocfl_layout'), 'w') as f:
        f.write('object\n')  # or whatever the layout specifies
    # Create initial inventory file. Maybe in inventory/0/...
    # Assuming the initial version is 0, create that directory and contents
    initial_inventory_dir = os.path.join(inventory_dir, '0')
    os.makedirs(initial_inventory_dir)
    # Write the initial inventory file
    inventory_file_path = os.path.join(initial_inventory_dir, 'contents.json')
    # The contents would be an empty inventory or the initial structure
    # For simplicity, perhaps write a minimal JSON
    initial_inventory = {
        "type": "inventory",
        "version": 0,
        "digest": "sha512:abc123",
        "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "objects": {}
    }
    with open(inventory_file_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(initial_inventory, f, indent=2)
    # Also, maybe create a digest file for the inventory version
    # But that's getting more into specifics. Maybe for the first version, the code can be minimal
    # So, the above steps create the necessary structure.

Wait, but in the code above, if the root_path exists, it raises an error. However, the initial os.makedirs is called with exist_ok=True, but that would allow creation even if it exists. Wait no, the code first checks if the path exists. So in the code:

if os.path.exists(root_path):
    raise error
else:
    create directories, etc.

Wait, but in the code I wrote, after checking existence, the code proceeds to create the root directory with makedirs. But since exist_ok is True, but the check already ensures it doesn't exist, so that's okay.

But perhaps the check is redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the code should first check if the directory exists, and if it does, check if it's already an OCFL root (by checking for .ocfl_layout), and only then decide to error or not. But maybe for simplicity, the method assumes that the directory is not present, so it errors if it exists.

Now, the tests would check that after initialize, the directories and files exist.

Now, the code for the initialize method would look something like that.

But I need to make sure the code uses the correct paths and methods. Also, handling exceptions properly.

Wait, in the code above, if the root path already exists, it raises an error. But maybe the user wants to re-initialize, but that's probably not the case here.

Now, the code for the initialize method would be part of a class, so the class must have a root_path attribute. So perhaps the __init__ method takes a path parameter, like:

class OCFLStorageRoot:
    def __init__(self, root_path):
        self.root_path = root_path

Then the initialize method would do the setup.

Putting it all together, the code would have:

import os
import json
from datetime import datetime

class OCFLStorageRoot:
    def __init__(self, root_path):
        self.root_path = root_path

    def initialize(self):
        """Create and initialize a new OCFL storage root."""
        if os.path.exists(self.root_path):
            raise FileExistsError(f"Storage root {self.root_path} already exists")
        # Create the root directory
        os.makedirs(self.root_path)
        # Create subdirectories
        inventory_dir = os.path.join(self.root_path, 'inventory')
        versions_dir = os.path.join(self.root_path, 'versions')
        os.makedirs(inventory_dir)
        os.makedirs(versions_dir)
        # Create .ocfl_layout file
        with open(os.path.join(self.root_path, '.ocfl_layout'), 'w') as f:
            f.write('object\n')
        # Create initial inventory directory and file
        initial_inventory_dir = os.path.join(inventory_dir, '0')
        os.makedirs(initial_inventory_dir)
        inventory_file_path = os.path.join(initial_inventory_dir, 'contents.json')
        initial_inventory = {
            "type": "inventory",
            "version": 0,
            "digest": "sha512:initial",
            "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "objects": {}
        }
        with open(inventory_file_path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(initial_inventory, f, indent=2)
        # Also create the digest file for the inventory version
        digest_file_path = os.path.join(initial_inventory_dir, 'digest')
        with open(digest_file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write('sha512:initial')

Wait, but the OCFL spec requires that each inventory version has a digest file. So perhaps the code should create that as well. The digest file contains the hash of the contents.json file, but for the initial setup, maybe it's a placeholder.

Hmm, but generating the actual digest would require reading the contents.json and computing the hash. Since in the initialize step, the initial contents is minimal, maybe the code can compute the digest on the fly.

Alternatively, for the sake of minimal code, perhaps the code just writes a placeholder digest. But in a real scenario, that's not sufficient. But since this is a code generation task, perhaps it's acceptable for the example.

Alternatively, perhaps the digest can be generated using the initial_inventory's contents. Let me think.

Wait, the digest file contains the hash of the contents.json file. So after writing the contents.json, the code should compute its SHA-512 hash, then write that to the digest file.

So, the code would need to read the contents.json, compute the hash, then write to digest.

So modifying the code:

After writing the contents.json, the code would:

with open(inventory_file_path, 'rb') as f:
    content = f.read()
digest = hashlib.sha512(content).hexdigest()
digest_line = f"sha-512:{digest}\n"

Then write that to the digest file.

But for that, the code needs to import hashlib.

So adding:

import hashlib

Then, the code would compute the digest.

This makes the code more accurate, but requires more steps.

Alternatively, maybe the initial digest is a placeholder, but in a proper implementation, it must be correct.

So, the code for the digest part would be:

    # Compute the digest of contents.json and write to digest file
    with open(inventory_file_path, 'rb') as f:
        content = f.read()
    digest = hashlib.sha512(content).hexdigest()
    digest_line = f"sha-512:{digest}\n"
    digest_file_path = os.path.join(initial_inventory_dir, 'digest')
    with open(digest_file_path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(digest_line)

So integrating that into the code.

Now, the full code would look like this.

Wait, but I should also check for other necessary files and directories. The OCFL spec requires that the storage root has certain files. For example, the .ocfl_layout file specifies the layout of the storage root, such as "object" or "inventory". The code writes 'object\n' into it, but maybe the correct value is 'object' without the newline. Or perhaps the .ocfl_layout should have 'object' as its content. So maybe just write 'object' without the newline.

Also, the inventory's version directory (e.g., '0') must have the contents.json and digest file.

So, the code is getting more detailed.

Putting it all together, the code would:

import os
import json
import hashlib
from datetime import datetime

class OCFLStorageRoot:
    def __init__(self, root_path):
        self.root_path = root_path

    def initialize(self):
        """Create and initialize a new OCFL storage root."""
        if os.path.exists(self.root_path):
            raise FileExistsError(f"Storage root {self.root_path} already exists")
        # Create root directory
        os.makedirs(self.root_path)
        # Create subdirectories
        inventory_dir = os.path.join(self.root_path, 'inventory')
        versions_dir = os.path.join(self.root_path, 'versions')
        os.makedirs(inventory_dir)
        os.makedirs(versions_dir)
        # Create .ocfl_layout file
        with open(os.path.join(self.root_path, '.ocfl_layout'), 'w') as f:
            f.write('object')
        # Create initial inventory version 0
        initial_inventory_dir = os.path.join(inventory_dir, '0')
        os.makedirs(initial_inventory_dir)
        # Write contents.json
        inventory_file_path = os.path.join(initial_inventory_dir, 'contents.json')
        initial_inventory = {
            "type": "inventory",
            "version": 0,
            "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "digestAlgorithm": "sha-512",
            "digest": "",  # This will be filled after computing the digest
            "objects": {}
        }
        with open(inventory_file_path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(initial_inventory, f, indent=2)
        # Compute digest of contents.json and update the digest field
        with open(inventory_file_path, 'rb') as f:
            content = f.read()
        digest = hashlib.sha512(content).hexdigest()
        # Update the digest in the JSON file
        initial_inventory['digest'] = digest
        with open(inventory_file_path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(initial_inventory, f, indent=2)
        # Create digest file
        digest_file_path = os.path.join(initial_inventory_dir, 'digest')
        with open(digest_file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(f"sha-512:{digest}\n")
        # Also, create the digest file for the inventory version's contents

Wait, but the digest file's content is exactly the hash computed. The digest field in the JSON might not be necessary? Or perhaps the OCFL spec requires it in the inventory JSON. Alternatively, the digest file contains the hash of the contents.json, so the digest field in the JSON might not be needed. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the specifications. 

According to the OCFL spec, each inventory version directory (like 0/) contains a contents.json and a digest file. The digest file contains the SHA-512 hash of the contents.json file. The inventory's digest is part of the parent inventory's entry. 

In the initial setup, the first inventory (version 0) would have its own digest file. So the code correctly writes the digest file with the hash of contents.json. The contents.json itself may not need the digest field, unless required by the spec. 

Looking at the initial_inventory structure, perhaps the "digest" field is part of the inventory's metadata. Maybe the OCFL spec requires that the inventory has a digest field for the version. Alternatively, perhaps the digest is stored in the digest file, and the contents.json doesn't need it. 

To avoid confusion, perhaps the code should omit the digest field in the contents.json and just have the digest file. So the initial_inventory can have the necessary fields without the digest.

Let me adjust that:

initial_inventory = {
    "type": "inventory",
    "version": 0,
    "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "digestAlgorithm": "sha-512",
    "objects": {}
}

Then, after computing the digest, the digest file is written with the hash.

The code would then write the digest to the digest file, but not include it in the JSON unless required.

This makes the code more accurate.

So the code for the initialize method would proceed like that.

Now, considering the unit tests:

First, a test that the directories are created.

Test case 1:

import os
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

class TestOCFLStorageRoot(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_initialize_creates_structure(self):
        with TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
            root_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'ocfl_root')
            ocfl_root = OCFLStorageRoot(root_path)
            ocfl_root.initialize()
            self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(root_path))
            self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(os.path.join(root_path, 'inventory')))
            self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(os.path.join(root_path, 'versions')))
            self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(os.path.join(root_path, '.ocfl_layout')))
            # Check inventory version 0 exists
            inventory_0_dir = os.path.join(root_path, 'inventory', '0')
            self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(inventory_0_dir))
            # Check contents.json and digest exist
            contents_path = os.path.join(inventory_0_dir, 'contents.json')
            digest_path = os.path.join(inventory_0_dir, 'digest')
            self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(contents_path))
            self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(digest_path))
            # Check the .ocfl_layout content
            with open(os.path.join(root_path, '.ocfl_layout'), 'r') as f:
                self.assertEqual(f.read().strip(), 'object')

    def test_initialize_existing_dir_raises_error(self):
        with TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
            existing_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'existing')
            os.makedirs(existing_dir)
            ocfl_root = OCFLStorageRoot(existing_dir)
            with self.assertRaises(FileExistsError):
                ocfl_root.initialize()

    def test_initialize_non_empty_dir_raises_error(self):
        with TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
            existing_dir = os.path.join(temp_dir, 'existing')
            os.makedirs(existing_dir)
            with open(os.path.join(existing_dir, 'file.txt'), 'w') as f:
                f.write('test')
            ocfl_root = OCFLStorageRoot(existing_dir)
            with self.assertRaises(FileExistsError):
                ocfl_root.initialize()

These tests cover the creation of the directories and files, and the error cases when the directory already exists or is non-empty.

Now, putting the code together.

The final code would include the class with the initialize method, and the necessary imports.

Wait, the code uses datetime.now(), but in tests, this could cause the digest to change each time. To avoid that, perhaps in the test, we can mock the datetime, but for the code itself, it's okay.

The code should also handle exceptions when creating directories, but the os.makedirs should handle that as long as the paths are correct.

Now, the final code:

The code must be enclosed in a Python markdown code block, and only the code is output.

So the code would be:

```python
import os
import json
import hashlib
from datetime import datetime

class OCFLStorageRoot:
    def __init__(self, root_path):
        self.root_path = root_path

    def initialize(self):
        """Create and initialize a new OCFL storage root."""
        if os.path.exists(self.root_path):
            raise FileExistsError(f"Storage root {self.root_path} already exists")
        # Create root directory
        os.makedirs(self.root_path)
        # Create subdirectories
        inventory_dir = os.path.join(self.root_path, 'inventory')
        versions_dir = os.path.join(self.root_path, 'versions')
        os.makedirs(inventory_dir)
        os.makedirs(versions_dir)
        # Create .ocfl_layout file
        with open(os.path.join(self.root_path, '.ocfl_layout'), 'w') as f:
            f.write('object')
        # Create initial inventory version 0
        initial_inventory_dir = os.path.join(inventory_dir, '0')
        os.makedirs(initial_inventory_dir)
        # Write contents.json
        inventory_file_path = os.path.join(initial_inventory_dir, 'contents.json')
        initial_inventory = {
            "type": "inventory",
            "version": 0,
            "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "digestAlgorithm": "sha-512",
            "objects": {}
        }
        with open(inventory_file_path, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(initial_inventory, f, indent=2)
        # Compute digest of contents.json and create digest file
        with open(inventory_file_path, 'rb') as f:
            content = f.read()
        digest = hashlib.sha512(content).hexdigest()
        digest_file_path = os.path.join(initial_inventory_dir, 'digest')
        with open(digest_file_path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(f"sha-512:{digest}\n")
```

Wait, but in the initial_inventory, the digestAlgorithm is "sha-512", but the code uses that in the digest computation. The digest file contains the hash, so that's correct.

Also, the .ocfl_layout has 'object' as its content, which is correct according to OCFL specs (assuming the root is laid out as an object root, not an inventory root).

This code should satisfy the requirements. The unit tests would catch any missing parts, but given the problem's constraints, this should be sufficient.
