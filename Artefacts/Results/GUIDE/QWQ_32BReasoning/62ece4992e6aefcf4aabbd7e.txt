Okay, I need to write the Python function _resolve_string based on the given docstring. Let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says that the function gets the value from the environment using a matcher that has a name and an optional default. If the environment variable isn't set and there's no default, it should raise an error.

Hmm, so the matcher probably comes from a regular expression match, right? Like, maybe the matcher is a regex Match object where the groupdict() has entries for 'name' and maybe 'default'. So the function should extract the name from the matcher's groupdict, then look it up in os.environ. If it's not there, check if there's a default value in the groupdict. If neither exists, raise an error.

Wait, how exactly is the matcher structured? The problem mentions the group dict, so the regex must have named capture groups. For example, maybe the regex is something like r'\$(?P<name>[^}]+)(?::(?P<default>.*))?', so that when you match a string like $MY_VAR, the name is captured, and if there's a default like $MY_VAR:default, then the default is captured too.

So the steps for the function are:

1. Extract the name from the matcher's groupdict. Let's say name = matcher.groupdict().get('name').
2. Check if the environment variable with that name exists. So value = os.getenv(name) or something.
3. If value is not found, check if there's a default in the groupdict. default = matcher.groupdict().get('default').
4. If there's a default, return that. Otherwise, raise an error.

Wait, but the problem says if the variable is not defined and no default, raise an error. So the error should be raised when the environment variable isn't present and there's no default in the group.

So putting this into code:

First, get the name. If the name isn't in the groupdict, maybe that's an error? But according to the problem statement, the matcher should have a name. So we can assume that the groupdict has 'name' key.

So:

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    groups = matcher.groupdict()
    name = groups['name']
    default = groups.get('default')
    value = os.getenv(name)
    if value is None:
        if default is not None:
            return default
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Environment variable {name} not found and no default provided.")
    else:
        return value

Wait, but the function's return type? The docstring says "get the value", so it returns the value as a string. So that's okay.

Wait, but how does the default come into play? The default is part of the matcher's group, so if the regex captured the default part, then groups['default'] would have it. So when the environment variable isn't set, we return the default. If there's no default, then error.

That makes sense.

Now, the tests. Since the user mentioned test-driven development, I should first write the tests. Let's think of possible test cases.

Test case 1: The environment variable is set. So when we call _resolve_string with a matcher that has the name, it returns the env value.

Test case 2: The environment variable is not set, but the default is provided. Then the function returns the default.

Test case 3: The environment variable is not set and no default. Then it raises an error.

Test case 4: Edge cases like empty default or name? Maybe not, but the problem probably assumes that the name is valid.

To write these tests, I need to mock the matcher object. Since the matcher is a regex match object, perhaps using a MagicMock.

Let me outline the test cases:

First, test that when the environment variable exists, it returns that value.

Test 1:

Mock the matcher with name 'TEST_VAR', and set os.environ['TEST_VAR'] = 'value'.

Call _resolve_string(matcher) should return 'value'.

Test 2:

Matcher has name 'NOT_SET' and default 'default_val'. The env var is not set. The function should return 'default_val'.

Test 3:

Matcher has name 'MISSING' with no default. The env var is not set. The function should raise ValueError with the appropriate message.

Test 4: Maybe check that the default is optional. So if the default is present, but the env var is set, it uses the env var.

Wait, in the code above, if the env var is present, it uses that regardless of the default. So that's correct.

Another test could check that when the default is present but the env var is set, the env var's value is used.

So Test 4:

Matcher has name 'TEST_VAR' and default 'def'. The env var is set to 'env_val'. The function returns 'env_val'.

So for the tests, need to use mocks for the matcher's groupdict, and patch os.getenv.

Wait, but in the tests, we can set os.environ temporarily, but maybe using a mock for the matcher.

Alternatively, in the tests, we can create a mock matcher with a groupdict that has 'name' and possibly 'default'.

Let me structure the test class:

Probably using pytest.

First, the test for when the variable is present:

def test_resolve_string_with_env_var_set(mocker):
    # Arrange
    matcher = mocker.MagicMock()
    matcher.groupdict.return_value = {'name': 'TEST_VAR'}
    os.environ['TEST_VAR'] = 'value_from_env'
    
    # Act
    result = _resolve_string(matcher)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == 'value_from_env'

Then, test with default:

def test_resolve_string_with_default(mocker):
    matcher = mocker.MagicMock()
    matcher.groupdict.return_value = {'name': 'NOT_SET', 'default': 'default_value'}
    # Ensure the env var is not set
    os.environ.pop('NOT_SET', None)
    
    result = _resolve_string(matcher)
    assert result == 'default_value'

Test for error when neither:

def test_resolve_string_without_default_nor_env(mocker):
    matcher = mocker.MagicMock()
    matcher.groupdict.return_value = {'name': 'MISSING_VAR'}
    os.environ.pop('MISSING_VAR', None)
    
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as exc_info:
        _resolve_string(matcher)
    assert str(exc_info.value) == "Environment variable MISSING_VAR not found and no default provided."

Another test case where the default is present but the env var is set:

def test_resolve_string_env_var_takes_precedence(mocker):
    matcher = mocker.MagicMock()
    matcher.groupdict.return_value = {'name': 'PREFER_ENV', 'default': 'def'}
    os.environ['PREFER_ENV'] = 'env_val'
    
    result = _resolve_string(matcher)
    assert result == 'env_val'

These tests should cover the main scenarios.

Wait, but in the code, the default is retrieved via groups.get('default'), so if the groupdict has a 'default' key, it will use it. So the code is okay.

Now, the code itself. Let's make sure to import os. The function uses os.getenv. Wait, in the code above, I used os.getenv(name). But os.getenv returns None if not present, which is exactly what we need.

So the code is as I outlined before.

Wait, but what about the case where the default is an empty string? The code would return that, which is correct. So the code seems okay.

Now, putting it all together. The user wants only the code in Python markdown format. So the actual code would be the function and the test functions, but according to the problem, the code to generate is the function itself, based on the signature and docstring. The test-driven part is a tip to generate the tests first, but the user is asking for the code (the function) generated.

Wait, the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the actual function, not the tests. The tests are part of the TDD process, but the user wants the code for the function.

So the code is the function _resolve_string as I outlined. Let me write that properly.

First, import os.

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    """
    Get the value from environment given a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict.
    If the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised.
    """
    groups = matcher.groupdict()
    name = groups['name']
    default = groups.get('default')
    value = os.getenv(name)
    if value is None:
        if default is not None:
            return default
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Environment variable {name} not found and no default provided.")
    return value

Wait, but in the code, the return value when using the default is the string from the group's default. But in the regex, the default might be captured as a group, so for example, if the regex is something like \$(?P<name>\w+)(?::(?P<default>.*))?, then the default group would contain whatever comes after the colon. So that's okay.

Yes, that should work.

So the final code is as above. Let me check for any possible errors. What if the 'name' is not present in the groupdict? According to the docstring, the matcher should have a name. So if it's missing, groups['name'] will throw a KeyError. But the problem says the matcher contains a name, so perhaps that's an invalid input, and the function can raise that error. Which is acceptable.

Therefore, the code is correct.
