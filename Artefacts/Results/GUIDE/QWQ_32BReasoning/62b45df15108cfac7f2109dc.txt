Okay, I need to generate Python code for the status_str method based on the given docstring. Let's start by understanding what the method is supposed to do. The doc says it returns a string by visiting the sorted self.messages list, adding a prefix and each element. So, each message in the sorted list should be prefixed with the given prefix, then concatenated into a single string.

First, I should think about the steps involved. The messages list needs to be sorted. Then, each element is prefixed with the 'prefix' argument. Then, all those prefixed strings are joined into one big string. Maybe with newlines or just concatenated? The doc isn't specific, but perhaps each element is on a new line. Hmm, but the example isn't given. Maybe just concatenated with no separators? Wait, maybe the default is to have each line with the prefix. Let me see the doc again. It says "each visit add prefix and the element". So each element is added with the prefix. So perhaps each element is on its own line with the prefix. Like, if the messages are ["a", "b"], and the prefix is "*", then the result is "*a\n*b" or something like that. 

Wait, the problem says "visiting the sorted self.messages list, each visit add prefix and the element". So for each element in the sorted list, we add the prefix followed by the element. So each element contributes a line with the prefix and the message. So the resulting string is the concatenation of each (prefix + message) for each message in the sorted list, probably separated by newlines.

But the exact separator isn't specified. The doc might just mean that each element is prefixed and then combined, perhaps with newlines. Let's assume that the messages are joined with newlines. 

Now, the method is part of a class, so self.messages must be a list that's already present. The method sorts self.messages, then processes each element. 

Wait, but should it sort the list in place or create a sorted copy? The method says "visiting the sorted self.messages list". So probably, it's sorted each time, but the original list isn't modified. So we need to sort a copy of the messages list. 

So the steps are:

1. Sort the messages list. So sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
2. For each message in sorted_messages, create a string with prefix + message.
3. Join all those strings into a single string. Maybe with newlines. So the default separator is '\n', but the problem doesn't specify. The doc says "return a string with visiting...", so the elements are concatenated in some way. Since each element is added with the prefix, perhaps each is on a new line. Let me check the doc again. The example isn't clear. But maybe the elements are just concatenated without any separator. Wait, no, that would be odd. Probably, each line is a separate line. Let's proceed with that.

So the code would be something like:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    sorted_msgs = sorted(self.messages)
    lines = [prefix + msg for msg in sorted_msgs]
    return '\n'.join(lines)

But I need to make sure that the messages are sorted. Also, what if the messages list is empty? Then the result would be an empty string (if joined with '\n', but if empty list, the join would be an empty string). That's probably okay.

Now, the unit tests. The user mentioned to use test-driven development, so first write the tests. Let me think of some test cases.

Test case 1: empty messages list. Then status_str() should return an empty string. With any prefix, same result.

Test case 2: messages with some elements, sorted. For example, messages = ['c', 'a', 'b'], so sorted would be ['a', 'b', 'c']. With prefix 'Prefix: ', the result should be "Prefix:a\nPrefix:b\nPrefix:c".

Test case 3: check that the original list isn't modified. So after calling status_str, self.messages should still be in original order.

Test case 4: prefix is empty string. So just the messages sorted, each on their own line.

Test case 5: check that different prefixes work. Like, prefix is '#' would lead to each line starting with #.

So in the tests, I'll need to create a class that has a messages list, and then test the status_str method. Since the method is part of a class, the test should create an instance of that class with messages set, then call the method.

Wait, but how to structure the test? Let's see. The code to be written is part of a class. Let's assume the class is called, say, StatusReporter or something. But the problem doesn't specify the class name. So in the tests, perhaps the class is named something like MessageHolder, with a messages attribute.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that the user is writing, so the tests would be for that class. But in the code generation, the user just provides the method's signature and docstring, so the code to generate is the method's code, and the tests would be for that method.

So for the tests, the test case would have to mock or set up an instance with a messages list. Let's think of writing the tests using unittest framework.

Sample test code:

import unittest

class TestStatusStr(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_empty_messages(self):
        class Dummy:
            messages = []
            def status_str(self, prefix=''):
                # the method to be tested here
                pass
        dummy = Dummy()
        self.assertEqual(dummy.status_str(), "")
        self.assertEqual(dummy.status_str("Prefix: "), "")

    def test_sorted_messages(self):
        class Dummy:
            messages = ['c', 'a', 'b']
            def status_str(self, prefix=''):
                # the method to be tested
                pass
        dummy = Dummy()
        expected = 'a\nb\nc'
        self.assertEqual(dummy.status_str(), expected)
        expected_with_prefix = 'Prefix: a\nPrefix: b\nPrefix: c'
        self.assertEqual(dummy.status_str("Prefix: "), expected_with_prefix)

    def test_original_list_not_modified(self):
        class Dummy:
            messages = ['c', 'a', 'b']
            def status_str(self, prefix=''):
                # the method to be tested
                pass
        dummy = Dummy()
        original = list(dummy.messages)
        dummy.status_str()
        self.assertEqual(dummy.messages, original)

    def test_single_message(self):
        class Dummy:
            messages = ['single']
            def status_str(self, prefix=''):
                pass
        dummy = Dummy()
        self.assertEqual(dummy.status_str(), 'single')
        self.assertEqual(dummy.status_str('#'), '#single')

But in the code, the method is supposed to be part of a class. So the tests would need to use a class that has the messages attribute and the status_str method. Since the code to be written is the method itself, the tests would need to be written first, then the method is implemented to pass the tests.

Now, putting all together, the code for the method is as I thought before. Let me check again.

The method returns a string made by adding the prefix and each element in the sorted messages list. So the code is:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    return '\n'.join([prefix + msg for msg in sorted(self.messages)])

Wait, but what about if the messages list contains non-string elements? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume that messages are strings. So the code is okay.

Yes, that should work. So the code is as above.
