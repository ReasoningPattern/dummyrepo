Okay, I need to create a Python decorator called cachedmethod based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding what the decorator should do. The goal is to have a decorator that uses a cache to store results of method calls, so that subsequent calls with the same arguments can retrieve the result from the cache instead of recalculating it. 

First, the decorator factory function cachedmethod takes three parameters: cache, key, and lock. The cache is the storage where the results are kept. The key is a function to generate the cache key, probably based on the method's arguments. The lock is an optional parameter for thread safety, in case multiple threads might be accessing the cache concurrently.

The decorator returned by cachedmethod should wrap a method. When the method is called, it should first check if the result is in the cache using the generated key. If it is, return it immediately. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache with the key, and then return it. 

Hmm, but how does the key function work? The default is hashkey, which I assume is a function that takes the method's arguments and returns a hashable key. Wait, but the user can pass their own key function. So the key function must be able to take the instance (since it's a method), the arguments, and maybe the keyword arguments, and generate a unique key for the cache.

Wait, the parameters for the key function aren't specified here, but in typical memoization, the key is generated based on the arguments passed to the function. So maybe the key function should accept the instance (since it's a method, the first argument is self), *args, and **kwargs, then compute a key. Or perhaps the key function is supposed to be a function that takes the arguments and returns the key. Wait, maybe the key function is called with the instance and the arguments. I need to check standard practices here.

Looking at similar decorators like lru_cache in functools, the key is based on the arguments. Since this is a method, perhaps the instance (self) is part of the key? So that different instances can have different cached results. That makes sense. So the key function should probably take the instance, the arguments, and the keyword arguments to generate a unique key.

So, the key function's signature would be something like key(instance, *args, **kwargs). The default hashkey function would need to handle that. Wait, but in the problem statement, the default is hashkey. Since I don't have the definition of hashkey, maybe it's a function that takes the instance and the arguments and returns a hashable key. The user can provide their own key function if needed.

Now, the decorator itself. The returned decorator must be a function that takes a method (function) and returns a wrapped version. The wrapped function will check the cache for the key generated by the key function. 

Let me think of the steps:

1. The cachedmethod function is called with cache, key, lock. It returns a decorator (function) that will decorate the actual method.

2. The decorator (let's call it decorate) takes the method (the function to be decorated) and returns the wrapper function.

3. The wrapper function is called when the method is invoked. Inside the wrapper:

   a. Generate the key using the key function, passing the instance (self), *args, and **kwargs. 

   b. Check if the key is in the cache. If it is, return the cached value.

   c. If not, call the original method with the given arguments, get the result.

   d. Store the result in the cache under the key.

   e. Return the result.

   But there's also the lock parameter. If provided, we need to acquire the lock before checking the cache and storing the result. This is to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded environments.

Wait, but how to handle the lock? The lock is an optional parameter. So, in the code:

When accessing the cache, first acquire the lock (if provided), then check and set the cache, then release the lock. But need to ensure that even if an exception occurs, the lock is released.

So, the steps with lock:

   a. If lock is not None, acquire it.

   b. Check cache for key. If present, return value. If not, proceed.

   c. Call the original function, get the result.

   d. Store the result in cache.

   e. Release the lock if it was acquired.

But also, if an exception occurs during the function call, we should release the lock and re-raise the exception.

Hmm, so the code needs to handle that with a try/finally block.

Now, the key function. The key is generated by passing the instance (since it's a method) and the arguments. Wait, but when the method is called on an instance, the first argument is self. So when the wrapper is called, the first argument is self. So the key function needs to take the instance (self), and the arguments (args and kwargs). 

Wait, the key function's parameters would be the instance, followed by the arguments and keyword arguments. So, for example, the key function could be something like:

def hashkey(instance, *args, **kwargs):
    return (instance, args, frozenset(kwargs.items()))

But the actual implementation of hashkey isn't needed here since the problem states that the key parameter defaults to hashkey. So I don't have to implement hashkey, just use it as a parameter.

Putting this together, the code structure would be something like:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(instance, *args, **kwargs):
            # compute the key
            k = key(instance, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                lock.acquire()
            try:
                # check cache
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                # call the function
                result = func(instance, *args, **kwargs)
                # store in cache
                cache[k] = result
                return result
            finally:
                if lock is not None:
                    lock.release()
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but in the wrapper, the first argument is instance, which is the self of the method. That's correct because when you decorate a method, the first argument is the instance. So this should work.

Wait, but in Python, when you use a decorator on a method, the function is passed the instance (self) as the first argument. So the wrapper must accept the instance as the first argument, then *args and **kwargs. So that's correct.

Now, but what about class methods or static methods? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can assume it's for instance methods. Since the key uses the instance, it's appropriate for instance methods. For static methods, the instance wouldn't be present, but the decorator would still work as long as the key function doesn't require it. But the problem says it's for a method, so probably instance methods.

Now, the tests. The user mentioned to first generate comprehensive unit tests. So, let's think about how to test this.

First, create a test class with a method that uses the cachedmethod decorator. The test should check that the method is called once, and subsequent calls with the same arguments return the cached result.

For example:

class TestClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
    @cachedmethod(cache='self.cache', key=lambda self, x: x)
    def get_value(self, x):
        return x * 2

Wait, but the parameters to the decorator need to be correct. Wait, the cachedmethod is a decorator factory, so the actual usage would be:

@cachedmethod(cache=some_cache, key=some_key_func)
def method(...):
    ...

Wait, but in the code above, the decorator is created by passing the cache, key, and lock. So in the test, we can set up a test case where the cache is a dictionary, and the key function returns a value based on the arguments.

Wait, perhaps a better test would be:

Test 1: Check that the method is called once and the result is cached.

Test 2: Check that different arguments produce different cache entries.

Test 3: Check that the lock is properly used (maybe using a mock lock).

Test 4: Check that the key function is correctly called.

Hmm, but since the user said to generate the tests first, I need to outline those.

First, let's think of a simple test case:

We can create a mock for the key function and the cache. Let's say:

Test case 1:

- Create a cache (like a dictionary).

- Define a key function that returns a simple key based on the arguments.

- Decorate a function with cachedmethod using that cache and key.

- Call the function with some arguments, check that the function is called.

- Call again with the same arguments, check that the function is not called again (the result comes from cache).

To do this, we can use a Mock or a spy function.

Alternatively, in code:

def test_cachedmethod():
    # Setup
    mock_cache = {}
    mock_key = Mock(return_value='key1')
    calls = []

    def func(instance, x):
        calls.append(x)
        return x * 2

    # Create the decorated function
    decorated_func = cachedmethod(mock_cache, key=mock_key)(func)

    # First call
    result = decorated_func(None, 5)  # instance can be None for testing
    assert result == 10
    assert len(calls) == 1  # function was called
    mock_key.assert_called_once_with(None, 5)  # check key was called with right args

    # Second call with same arguments
    result2 = decorated_func(None,5)
    assert result2 == 10
    assert len(calls) == 1  # no new call, used cache

    # Check the cache has the key and value
    assert mock_cache['key1'] == 10

But how to structure this in unit tests. Since the user wants the tests first, perhaps using pytest.

Wait, but the code needs to be written in a way that the tests can be written. However, the problem says to first generate the tests, then the code.

Wait, the problem says to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the actual code, so the user is supposed to do test-driven development here. But since I'm generating the code, I need to first write the tests, then the code. 

But the user is asking me to output the code, so perhaps the tests are part of the thought process but not required in the output. However, the output is only the code. So I should focus on writing the code correctly based on the requirements.

Wait, but the code needs to be correct. Let me think again about possible issues in the code.

In the code above, the decorator is returning a wrapper function. The key is generated by key(instance, *args, **kwargs). The instance is the first argument, which is correct for an instance method. 

Wait, but in the case of a class method or static method, but the problem states it's for methods, so instance methods are the target here.

Another possible issue: when using the lock. The code uses lock.acquire() and lock.release(), but if lock is provided, it should be a threading.Lock instance or similar. The code is correct in that it only uses the lock if it's provided.

Another point: the key must be hashable. Since the key function is provided by the user, but in the default case, it's hashkey which presumably returns a hashable type. The code doesn't enforce that, but that's up to the user.

Now, what about the parameters to the key function? The key function must accept the instance, *args, **kwargs. So if the user provides a key function that doesn't handle those parameters, it will fail. But that's a user error, not something the decorator can prevent.

Another consideration: the wrapper must handle the case where the function raises an exception. For example, if the function being wrapped throws an error, then the cache is not updated, and the exception is propagated. The lock (if used) must be released in that case. The try/finally block ensures that the lock is released even if an exception occurs.

Yes, the code in the finally block will release the lock if needed, so that's good.

Now, what about the parameters in the decorator? The cache is passed as an argument. So the user must pass a mutable object that can be modified (like a dictionary). The code uses cache[k] = result, so the cache must support that.

Putting it all together, the code I outlined earlier should work. Let me write it properly.

Wait, in the code, the wrapper is defined inside the decorator function. The decorator is a closure that captures the cache, key, and lock parameters. So the code should be:

def cachedmethod(cache, key=hashkey, lock=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(instance, *args, **kwargs):
            k = key(instance, *args, **kwargs)
            if lock is not None:
                lock.acquire()
            try:
                if k in cache:
                    return cache[k]
                result = func(instance, *args, **kwargs)
                cache[k] = result
                return result
            finally:
                if lock is not None:
                    lock.release()
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but in the case when the key is not present, we call the function, store the result, and return it. That's correct.

Wait, but what if the key is in the cache but the value is None? The code would still return it, which is correct because None is a valid return value.

Another thing: the code uses the in operator on the cache. So the cache must support that. For a dictionary, it's okay. If the user provides a different structure, like a list, it would fail. But again, that's up to the user.

So, this code should work as intended.

Now, the user also mentioned to output the code in Python markdown format. So, the final code would be enclosed in triple backticks with the language specified. But since the user wants only the code, I should present it properly.

Wait, the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should be wrapped in ```python ... ```.

So putting it all together, the code is as above. Let me check again for any possible mistakes.

Wait, the key is generated with key(instance, *args, **kwargs). So the key function must accept the instance, then the positional arguments, then the keyword arguments. That's correct.

Another possible issue: the order of the parameters in the key function. For example, if the key function is supposed to ignore the instance, then the user can provide a key that does that. But the decorator code is correct in passing the instance as the first argument.

Yes, this should be correct.
