Okay, so I need to write a Python function called get_versions that gets version information, and if it can't, returns a default. The user mentioned using test-driven development, so first I should think about the unit tests. Let me start there.

Hmm, what does the function do exactly? The docstring says it obtains version info and returns a default if it can't. But how does it obtain it? Maybe from a file, an API, or some system command? Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume a common scenario like reading from a file or environment variables?

Wait, but the actual code isn't specified, so perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary or some structured data. The default value part is important. Maybe the default is something like {'version': 'unknown'} or similar.

For the tests, I need to mock the scenario where version info can't be obtained. So perhaps using a mock to simulate a failure. Let's see. The tests should check that when the version can be retrieved, it returns the correct data, and when it can't, it returns the default.

Wait, but how does the function determine if it can get the version? Maybe it tries to read from a file, and if that fails, returns the default. Let's assume that the function is trying to read a version from a file, say 'version.txt', and if that file isn't found, returns the default.

So, the unit tests would need to test both scenarios. Let's think of the test cases:

1. Test that when the version file exists, the function returns its contents.
2. Test that when the version file does not exist, the function returns the default value.

But how to structure the tests? Maybe using the unittest module and mocking the file operations. Like using unittest.mock to patch open or some other method.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses some other method, like importing a package's version. But without more info, I'll proceed with the file approach.

Wait, the function's name is get_versions (plural). Maybe it returns multiple versions, like a dictionary of versions for different components. The default could be an empty dict or a specific default entry.

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to return a single version string, defaulting to '0.1.0' or something. But the problem says "version information" which is vague. Let's assume it's a dictionary with various keys.

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to read from a file, parse it, and return the data. If that's not possible, return a default like {'version': 'unknown'}.

Now, for the tests:

First, the test that when the version is available, it's correctly read. So in the test, we can mock the open function to return a sample version data. Then assert that get_versions returns that data.

Second, test when the file isn't found. So mock open to raise a FileNotFoundError, and then check that the default is returned.

So the tests would use patch from unittest.mock. Let me outline the test class.

Wait, the user wants me to generate the code only, but first the tests. So the code should be written after writing the tests. But since I'm to generate the code, I need to think through how to structure the function.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use some standard method, like checking __version__ in a package. But without specifics, I'll proceed with the file approach.

The function could try to read a version from a file, and if that fails (IOError), return the default. The default could be a hardcoded value like {'version': '0.0.0'} or similar.

Putting this together, the function might look like:

def get_versions():
    try:
        with open('version.txt', 'r') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except IOError:
        return {'version': 'unknown'}

Wait, but the return type in the docstring isn't specified. The example I thought of returns a string, but maybe the function returns a dictionary. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with version info from multiple sources, but if any fail, use defaults. But without more info, perhaps the simplest approach is to return a string, defaulting to 'unknown'.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to get the version of the current package, using pkg_resources or similar. For example:

import pkg_resources

def get_versions():
    try:
        return {'version': pkg_resources.require("my_package")[0].version}
    except Exception:
        return {'version': 'unknown'}

But then the test would have to mock the pkg_resources part. But since the problem doesn't specify the source, perhaps the function is generic.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a default of {'version': '0.1.0'}, and in case of failure, returns that. The actual method to get the version isn't specified, so maybe the function is a placeholder.

Hmm, the problem is a bit vague. Let me think again. The user provided the function signature and docstring. The function should return version info, default if can't obtain.

The code needs to be written. Let's assume that the function tries to read from a file, and returns a default dict if it can't. Let's proceed with that.

So the code would have a try block that reads the file, parses it into a dict, and returns it. If that fails (IOError or JSONDecodeError, if it's a JSON file), then return the default.

Wait, maybe the version info is stored in a JSON file. So:

def get_versions():
    default = {'version': 'unknown'}
    try:
        with open('version.json', 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return default

That's a possibility. Then the tests would need to mock the file reading.

Alternatively, maybe the version is obtained via an API call, but that's more complex. Since the problem is vague, perhaps the simplest approach is to read from a file and return a default on error.

So the code would look like that, using a try-except block.

Now, for the tests. The test class would use the unittest module, and patch the open or the json.load function.

First test case: when the file exists and is read correctly, return the data.

Second test case: when the file doesn't exist, return the default.

Third test case: when the file exists but is not valid JSON, return default.

Wait, but in the code, the except clause catches both FileNotFoundError and JSONDecodeError. So the tests should cover those cases.

So, the tests would be:

class TestGetVersions(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('json.load')
    def test_valid_file(self, mock_json_load):
        mock_data = {'version': '1.2.3'}
        mock_json_load.return_value = mock_data
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, mock_data)

    @patch('builtins.open', side_effect=FileNotFoundError)
    def test_file_not_found(self, mock_open):
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, {'version': 'unknown'})

    @patch('json.load', side_effect=json.JSONDecodeError('msg', 'doc', 0))
    def test_invalid_json(self, mock_json_load):
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, {'version': 'unknown'})

But I need to make sure to import the necessary modules. Also, the mock needs to be properly set up.

Alternatively, using a context manager for the mock.

Wait, in the first test, the mock_json_load is patched, but how does that interact with the open? Because in the code, the open is called first, then json.load is called on the file.

Hmm, perhaps the code uses json.load(f), where f is the file object. So to mock that, we can patch the open to return a mock file, and then mock the json.load to return the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to mock the entire process. Let's see:

First test: valid file.

We can mock the open to return a file-like object, and mock the json.load to return the desired data. Alternatively, using a MagicMock for the open.

Alternatively, using a nested patch.

Alternatively, using a mock for the open function, and for the json.load function.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to mock the entire get_versions function's internal calls. But perhaps the tests would look like:

But the exact setup depends on how the code is structured. Let's proceed with the code first, then the tests.

Wait, the user wants me to first generate the tests, then the code, but I need to output only the code. But I have to think through the process to get the code right.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a default of {'version': 'unknown'}, and the actual version retrieval is via some method that might fail.

Another approach: maybe the function is supposed to return the current Python version as a default. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with versions of dependencies, but that's more complex.

Hmm. Since the problem is vague, I'll proceed with the simplest approach. Let's assume the function reads a file called 'version.txt' and returns its content as a string. If it can't read the file (any exception), returns 'unknown' as the default.

Wait, but the function's name is get_versions (plural). So maybe it's returning multiple versions. Let's say a dictionary with keys like 'app_version', 'lib_version', etc. But without specifics, perhaps the function returns a single string.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary with version information, and the default is an empty dict or a specific structure.

Alternatively, the default could be an empty dictionary, but the docstring says "the default value is returned". So maybe the default is a specific value, like {'version': '0.1.0'}.

Hmm. Let me proceed with the function that reads from a file and returns a dictionary, defaulting to {'version': 'unknown'} if there's an error.

So the code would be:

import json

def get_versions():
    default = {'version': 'unknown'}
    try:
        with open('version.json', 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return default

Then, the tests would need to mock the file operations.

Now, the tests:

First, a test where the file exists and is valid:

def test_get_versions_valid(self):
    with patch('builtins.open', mock_open(read_data='{"version": "1.0.0"}')):
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, {'version': '1.0.0'})

Second, test when the file is not found:

def test_get_versions_file_not_found(self):
    with patch('builtins.open', side_effect=FileNotFoundError):
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, {'version': 'unknown'})

Third, test when the file exists but is invalid JSON:

def test_get_versions_invalid_json(self):
    with patch('builtins.open', mock_open(read_data='{ invalid json }')):
        with self.assertRaises(json.JSONDecodeError):
            # Wait, but in the function, this exception is caught. So the test should check the return value.
            # So the code would catch it and return the default.
            # So the test should not raise, but return the default.
            # So perhaps:

    with patch('builtins.open', mock_open(read_data='{ invalid json }')):
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, {'version': 'unknown'})

Wait, but using mock_open may not handle the invalid JSON correctly. Maybe better to mock the json.load function to raise an error.

Alternatively:

from unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch

class TestGetVersions(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('json.load')
    def test_valid_json(self, mock_json_load):
        mock_data = {'version': '2.3.4'}
        mock_json_load.return_value = mock_data
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, mock_data)

    @patch('builtins.open', side_effect=FileNotFoundError)
    def test_file_not_found(self, mock_open):
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, {'version': 'unknown'})

    @patch('json.load', side_effect=json.JSONDecodeError('msg', 'doc', 0))
    def test_invalid_json(self, mock_json_load):
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, {'version': 'unknown'})

But in the first test, we need to mock the open and the json.load. Alternatively, the first test can use a mock_open that reads the data, and then the json.load would parse it.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nested patch.

Hmm, but the code uses json.load(f), so to mock that, we can patch json.load to return a specific value.

Alternatively, the first test could do:

def test_valid(self):
    with patch('builtins.open', mock_open(read_data='{"version": "1.2.3"}')) as m:
        from module import get_versions
        result = get_versions()
        self.assertEqual(result, {'version': '1.2.3'})

Wait, but the mock_open may need to be imported from unittest.mock.

Alternatively, using the mock_open helper from unittest.mock.

So putting it all together, the tests would look like that.

But the code's actual implementation is as I wrote before.

Now, the user wants the code generated, so I should write the function get_versions as per the above logic.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the code only returns the default when it can't obtain the version info, which in this case is when the file isn't found or the JSON is invalid.

Yes, the code I wrote does that.

So the final code would be:

import json

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    default = {'version': 'unknown'}
    try:
        with open('version.json', 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return default

Wait, but the default is a dictionary. The docstring says "version information" which could be a dictionary, so that's okay.

Alternatively, if the default should be a string, like 'unknown', but the function returns a string, then the code would be different. But given the use of json.load, a dictionary makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the function should return a string, so the default is 'unknown' and the file contains a string. Then:

def get_versions():
    default = 'unknown'
    try:
        with open('version.txt', 'r') as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except IOError:
        return default

But then the tests would be simpler. But the problem's docstring says "version information", which could imply more than one piece of info. So maybe a dictionary is better.

Hmm, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Since the user didn't specify, I'll proceed with the dictionary approach using a JSON file, as that's a common scenario.

Therefore, the code is as written above.
