Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_logical_path_map based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it returns the file paths of the states in the inventory as a dictionary. Hmm, but the parameters are inventory and version. I'm not exactly sure what the inventory and version parameters look like. Maybe the inventory is some data structure containing information about states and their paths, and the version might affect how the paths are structured or retrieved?

First, I should think about what the inputs could be. The inventory might be a dictionary or a list of objects that have state information. The version could be a string like 'v1' or 'v2' that determines the path format. The output is a dictionary mapping states to their file paths.

Since the user mentioned using test-driven development, I should first write unit tests. Let me think of some test cases. For example, if the inventory has entries for 'state1' and 'state2', and the version is 'v1', the paths might be something like 'v1/state1/file.txt' or similar. The exact path structure depends on how the version is used. Maybe the version is part of the directory path.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure of the inventory, maybe the function is supposed to process the inventory data and extract the paths based on the version. Let me assume that the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with a 'state' and 'path' key. The version could modify the path, like adding a prefix or suffix. For example, for version 'v2', the path might be 'states/v2/state_name.txt'.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is structured such that each entry has a state name and the version determines which path to use from multiple possible paths stored in the entry. For instance, each entry could have a 'paths' dictionary with keys like 'v1', 'v2', etc.

Let me make some assumptions here. Let's say the inventory is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has 'state_name' and 'paths' which is another dictionary mapping version strings to file paths. So for a given state, the function would look up the path corresponding to the given version. The output is a dictionary where keys are state names and values are their paths according to the version.

So, the function would loop through each entry in the inventory, take the state name and the path for the given version, then build the result dict.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's create a sample inventory and test different versions. For example:

Test case 1: inventory has entries for 'california' and 'texas', with paths for versions 'v1' and 'v2'. If version is 'v1', the paths would be 'v1/california.txt' and 'v1/texas.txt'. The test should check that the returned dict has those entries.

Another test case could check for a version not present in some entries. Maybe in some entries, a version is missing, so the function might need to handle that, perhaps by using a default path or raising an error. But the docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps it's assumed that the version is always present.

Wait, the function's docstring says it returns the paths, so perhaps it's required that each entry in the inventory has the given version's path. If not, maybe the function ignores those entries, but the problem isn't clear. Since the problem is to generate code based on the docstring, maybe I should proceed with the basic case where each entry has the required version.

So, the test would have an inventory like:

inventory = [
    {'state_name': 'CA', 'paths': {'v1': '/path/v1/CA', 'v2': '/path/v2/CA'}},
    {'state_name': 'TX', 'paths': {'v1': '/path/v1/TX'}}
]

Then, get_logical_path_map(inventory, 'v1') should return {'CA': '/path/v1/CA', 'TX': '/path/v1/TX'}

Another test case could check that if the version is 'v2', then TX might not have that path and thus be excluded? Or maybe the function requires that all states have the version. The problem isn't clear. Since the docstring says "the states in the inventory", perhaps all states are included, and the version must exist in their paths. So in the case where a state doesn't have the version, maybe it's an error, but the function might just skip it? Or the test would expect that it's included with a default?

Hmm, perhaps the function just returns whatever is present. So in the example, if TX doesn't have v2, then it's not in the result. Or maybe the test would need to have all entries have the version.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory's structure is different. Maybe each entry has a 'state' key and a 'path' key, and the version is part of the path. Like, the path is stored as a template with the version. But I'm not sure. Since I have to proceed, I'll go with the first assumption.

Now, the function's code would be something like:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {item['state_name']: item['paths'][version] for item in inventory}

But maybe the inventory entries have different keys. Like, maybe 'name' instead of 'state_name', but I'll stick with the earlier example.

Now, the unit tests. Let's write them using pytest. For example:

def test_get_logical_path_map_v1():
    inventory = [
        {'state_name': 'CA', 'paths': {'v1': '/v1/CA', 'v2': '/v2/CA'}},
        {'state_name': 'TX', 'paths': {'v1': '/v1/TX'}}
    ]
    expected = {'CA': '/v1/CA', 'TX': '/v1/TX'}
    assert get_logical_path_map(inventory, 'v1') == expected

def test_get_logical_path_map_v2():
    inventory = [
        {'state_name': 'CA', 'paths': {'v1': '/v1/CA', 'v2': '/v2/CA'}},
        {'state_name': 'TX', 'paths': {'v1': '/v1/TX'}}
    ]
    expected = {'CA': '/v2/CA'}
    assert get_logical_path_map(inventory, 'v2') == expected

Wait, in the second test, TX doesn't have v2, so it should not be in the result. So the expected would only have 'CA'.

Another test case could check for an empty inventory, returns empty dict. Or a version not present in any entries.

But according to the problem, the function's docstring says it returns the paths in the inventory. So perhaps entries without the version are excluded. So the code would need to loop through each item in inventory, check if the version exists in their paths, and include only those.

Therefore, the code should filter the inventory items where the version is present in their paths.

So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    result = {}
    for item in inventory:
        if version in item['paths']:
            result[item['state_name']] = item['paths'][version]
    return result

Wait, but in the first test case, TX has v1, so it's included. CA has both versions. The second test case would have TX excluded because it doesn't have v2. So the tests would pass as written.

Alternatively, if the code uses a dictionary comprehension with a condition:

return {item['state_name']: item['paths'][version] for item in inventory if version in item['paths']}

That's concise and works.

So the code would be that.

Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, only the code. So the function's code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    """
    Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type.
    """
    return {item['state_name']: item['paths'][version] for item in inventory if version in item['paths']}

Wait, but I should make sure that the function's parameters are used correctly. The version is passed, so the code checks each item's 'paths' for the version key.

But what if the inventory items have different keys? Like maybe 'name' instead of 'state_name'? The problem's docstring doesn't specify, so I have to go with the assumption based on the test case.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where the keys are state names and the values are paths, but the version is part of the path. For example, the inventory is a dict like {'CA': '/v1/path'}, and the version is used to format the path. But that's a different structure.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is correct, given the problem's description. Let me proceed with that.

So the final code would be as above. The tests would be written first, then the code.

Now, the user wants only the code, in Python markdown format. So the code block with the function and maybe the tests? Wait, no. The question says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The TDD approach requires writing tests first, but the output should be only the code generated. Wait, the problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So, the code is just the function. The tests are part of the TDD process, but the user wants the function code only.

Therefore, the code would be the function as I wrote above. But maybe I should check again.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state names, and the version is used to construct the path. Like, for each state in the inventory, the path is 'version/state_name.txt'. But that would require the function to construct the path, not look it up in the inventory.

In that case, the function would be something like:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: f"{version}/{state}.txt" for state in inventory}

But then the inventory would be a list of state names, and the version is part of the path. But the problem's docstring says "the file paths of the states in the inventory", implying that the paths are already in the inventory, not constructed from scratch.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But given that the user wants the code, and the initial approach seems plausible, I'll proceed with the first solution.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the inventory is a dictionary where keys are state names and values are their paths. The version parameter is unused? But that would make the function's parameter 'version' unnecessary, which can't be right.

Alternatively, the version is part of the path. Like, the paths are stored with version in the path string. But then the function would need to format it. Without knowing more, I have to make assumptions.

Given that the problem mentions the version parameter, it must be used in determining the path. So the first approach where each inventory item has a paths dictionary keyed by version is the most plausible.

Therefore, the code should be as written.
