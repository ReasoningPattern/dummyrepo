Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method validate_hierarchy based on the given function signature and docstring. The method is supposed to validate the storage root hierarchy and return the number of objects checked and how many were valid. Let's think through how to approach this.

First, the function has parameters: validate_objects (a boolean, default True), check_digests (also a boolean, default True), and show_warnings (boolean, default False). The return values are num_objects and good_objects.

Since the user mentioned using test-driven development, I should first write unit tests. But the user wants me to output only the code, so maybe the tests are part of the process but not included in the final answer. Wait, the problem says to output only the generated code, so probably the actual method's code, not the tests. Hmm, but the instructions say to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the code. But the user wants the code generated here. Maybe the code includes the method, and the tests are part of the process but not the answer here. Let me focus on the method's code.

The method is part of a class, given the 'self' parameter. So the class likely has some hierarchy structure to check. The method's purpose is to traverse the hierarchy, check each object's validity based on the parameters, and count them.

Let me think about the steps inside the method:

1. Initialize counters: num_objects and good_objects to 0.

2. Iterate through all objects in the hierarchy. How? The class probably has a way to get all objects, maybe a list or a tree structure. Since it's a storage root hierarchy, maybe there's a root object and children. But without knowing the class structure, perhaps the method will have to traverse the hierarchy somehow. Maybe the class has a get_all_objects() method, or perhaps it's stored in a variable like self.objects.

Alternatively, maybe the method will have to recursively go through each node in the hierarchy. But since I don't have the class's structure, I might have to make some assumptions here. Let's proceed with a general approach.

3. For each object in the hierarchy:

   a. Increment num_objects by 1.

   b. Check if the object is valid. The validity check depends on the parameters.

   - If validate_objects is True, perform some validation on the object itself. Maybe checking if it's properly formatted, exists, etc.

   - If check_digests is True, also check the digest (like a checksum) of the object.

   The method should accumulate good_objects by 1 if all applicable checks pass.

   Also, if show_warnings is True, maybe print a warning if the object is invalid, but not sure how that's implemented here. Since the return values don't include warnings, perhaps the warnings are just logged or printed but not stored.

4. Return the counts.

Now, how to structure the code.

First, the method signature:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):

The return is two numbers, so return num_objects, good_objects.

But how to traverse the hierarchy? Let's assume that the class has a way to get all objects. For example, perhaps there's a self.objects list, or a method to get them. Let's suppose that the class has a method called get_all_objects() which returns an iterator over all objects in the hierarchy. Alternatively, maybe the root is stored in self.root and we can traverse from there.

But without knowing the exact class structure, perhaps the code can be written in a way that uses a helper function to get all objects, or perhaps the code will have to make some assumptions here. Since the problem doesn't specify the class structure, perhaps the code can be generic.

Alternatively, maybe the code will just count some dummy objects for the sake of example. But that's not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is part of a class that represents a storage hierarchy, and each object has methods to check validity and digests. Let's proceed under the assumption that each object has a is_valid() method and a check_digest() method, or something similar.

Wait, the parameters are validate_objects and check_digests. So when validate_objects is True, we check if the object is valid (maybe existence, metadata?), and when check_digests is True, we check the digest (maybe the data integrity).

So for each object:

valid = True

if validate_objects:

   if not object.is_valid():

       valid = False

if check_digests and valid:

   if not object.check_digest():

       valid = False

Then, if valid is True, increment good_objects.

But how to implement that in code.

Alternatively, perhaps the object has a method like validate() which returns a boolean, and another method like check_digest() which returns a boolean. Or maybe the object has a digest property and we can compare it to a computed digest.

But without knowing the actual class structure, perhaps the code can be written with placeholders, but the problem expects the code to be as per the given function.

Alternatively, maybe the code is a skeleton that counts objects, assuming some functions exist.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is structured as:

Initialize counts.

Iterate over each object in the hierarchy (maybe via a generator function or a list).

For each object:

   increment num_objects.

   if validate_objects:

       if not self._is_object_valid(obj):

           continue

   if check_digests:

       if not self._check_digest(obj):

           continue

   good_objects +=1

Wait, but that's not quite right. Because both checks need to pass. So maybe:

valid = True

if validate_objects and not self._is_object_valid(obj):

    valid = False

if check_digests and not self._check_digest(obj):

    valid = False

if valid:

    good_objects +=1

But again, the exact methods depend on the class's structure. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll have to make some assumptions here.

Alternatively, perhaps the code will just return dummy values for the sake of the example, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the code will just loop through some internal list of objects, and for each, do some checks.

Let's assume that the class has a list called self.objects, which contains all the objects in the hierarchy. Then:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):

    num_objects = 0

    good_objects = 0

    for obj in self.objects:

        num_objects +=1

        is_valid = True

        if validate_objects:

            # Assume each object has an is_valid() method

            if not obj.is_valid():

                is_valid = False

        if check_digests and is_valid:

            # Assume a method to check digest

            if not obj.check_digest():

                is_valid = False

        if is_valid:

            good_objects +=1

    return num_objects, good_objects

But this requires that each object has is_valid() and check_digest() methods, which may not be the case, but perhaps that's acceptable for the code.

Alternatively, maybe the check_digests is a separate parameter, so even if the object is valid, if check_digests is on, then check the digest.

Wait, in the code above, the check_digest is only done if is_valid is true (because of the 'and is_valid' part). But that would mean that if validate_objects is true and the object is invalid, then check_digest is skipped. That's okay because if we are not checking the digest, then it's only required if the object is valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the digest check is part of the object's validity, but the parameters let you choose to skip it.

Alternatively, maybe the check_digests is a separate check, so even if the object is valid (in terms of existing), but its digest is wrong, it's considered invalid.

So the code above seems okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check both conditions regardless, but only count the object as good if both are true.

Alternatively, the code could be written as:

if validate_objects and not obj.is_valid():

    is_valid = False

if check_digests and not obj.check_digest():

    is_valid = False

So both checks are done, but only if the parameters are set. But that's the same as the previous code.

Another thing: the show_warnings parameter. The docstring says that the method returns the counts, but if show_warnings is True, perhaps the method should output some warnings when an object is invalid. But since the return values don't include any warnings, maybe the warnings are printed to the console or a logger.

In the code, if show_warnings is True, then after determining that the object is invalid, we can print a warning.

Like:

if not is_valid and show_warnings:

    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} is invalid.")

But where to put this. So in the loop:

for obj in self.objects:

    ... 

    if not is_valid and show_warnings:

        print(f"Warning: Object {obj} is invalid.")

But again, this requires that the object can be stringified, which may be a valid assumption.

So integrating that into the code.

Now putting it all together:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):

    num_objects = 0

    good_objects = 0

    for obj in self.objects:  # Assuming self.objects is a list of all objects

        num_objects += 1

        is_valid = True

        if validate_objects:

            if not obj.is_valid():

                is_valid = False

        if check_digests:

            if not obj.check_digest():

                is_valid = False

        if is_valid:

            good_objects += 1

        else:

            if show_warnings:

                print(f"Warning: Object {obj} failed validation.")

    return num_objects, good_objects

Wait, but in the check_digests case, if validate_objects is true and the object is invalid, then the check_digest may still be done? Because the code above does check_digests regardless of the previous check. Wait, no. Let's see:

The code for check_digests is:

if check_digests:

    if not obj.check_digest():

        is_valid = False

So that's separate. So even if validate_objects is true and the object is invalid, if check_digests is also true, then it will check the digest. But that might not be necessary, but perhaps the user wants to check the digest even if the object is invalid. Not sure, but the parameters are independent.

Alternatively, maybe the check_digest is part of the validation, so the check is only done if validate_objects is true. But the parameters are separate, so the user can choose to check digest even if they don't validate objects. That could be possible. So the code as written is correct.

But maybe in the code above, even if validate_objects is false, but check_digests is true, then the code would check the digest. But in that case, the 'is_valid' variable is initialized to True, and then the digest check would set it to false if needed. So the object would be considered invalid if the digest fails, even if validate_objects is off. But the user might have wanted to only check the digest if the object is valid. But the parameters are separate, so perhaps that's intended.

Hmm, perhaps the parameters are orthogonal. So validate_objects is about checking the object's existence or basic validity, and check_digests is about checking the data integrity. So they can be done independently.

So the code is okay.

Now, the problem mentions that the method is part of a class, so the code must be inside that class. The code above assumes that the class has a list called self.objects. If the actual hierarchy is a tree structure, perhaps the code needs to traverse recursively. But without knowing the structure, this is the best we can do.

Alternatively, perhaps the method should iterate over the hierarchy starting from the root. For example, if the root is stored in self.root, and each node has children, then a recursive approach would be needed. But again, without knowing the class's structure, it's hard to code.

Perhaps the code is intended to be a skeleton that can be filled in based on the actual class structure, but given the problem's requirements, the code above is acceptable.

Wait, but in the code, I assumed that each object has is_valid() and check_digest() methods. So perhaps those methods are part of the object's interface. The problem's docstring doesn't specify that, but it's a necessary assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class where each object is a dictionary or has certain attributes, but that's getting too specific.

Overall, the code I have written seems to fit the given function signature and docstring. The method iterates over all objects, checks their validity based on the parameters, and returns the counts. The show_warnings parameter triggers a print statement when an object is invalid.

Now, I should also consider possible edge cases. For example, if there are no objects, then both counts are zero. If an object passes all checks, then good_objects increases. The code handles that.

Another point: the parameters have default values, so the method can be called with fewer parameters. The code uses those defaults correctly.

Therefore, the code is as written above. Now, I need to present it in Python markdown format, but the user said to output only the code. Wait, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. Wait, Python markdown format usually refers to code blocks like ```python ... ```, but maybe just the code itself. Let me check the exact instructions:

"Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Hmm, perhaps they want the code wrapped in triple backticks with the language specified. Like:

```python
def ...:
    ...
```

Yes, that's probably it. So the code I wrote above, formatted properly.

Now, let me re-examine the code for any possible mistakes.

Wait, in the code above, the line:

for obj in self.objects:

But if the class doesn't have a self.objects attribute, that would be an error. But since the problem doesn't specify the class structure, perhaps the code should instead iterate over a hierarchy structure in another way, like a generator function. Maybe the code is part of a class that has a method to get all objects, like get_all_objects(), so:

for obj in self.get_all_objects():

But without knowing, perhaps the code should use a more generic approach. Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class where self.root is the top-level node, and the code recursively traverses children.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that assumes the existence of some attributes. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed with the initial code, assuming that the class has a list of objects stored in self.objects. It's a reasonable assumption for a storage hierarchy.

Another possible improvement: the code currently uses 'print' for warnings, but maybe it should use logging instead. But the problem says to show warnings if show_warnings is True, and the code uses a print statement, which is acceptable for simplicity.

Thus, the final code is as written.
