Okay, I need to generate Python code for the set_cut_chars method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it sets the bytes used to delimit slice points. The parameters are 'before' and 'after', which are bytes objects. So, this method probably stores these delimiters so that when splitting a file, the splits happen before the 'before' bytes and after the 'after' bytes. 

First, I should think about the class structure. Since this is a method of a class, the actual code will be part of a class. The method needs to store these bytes, so probably there are instance variables like self.before_delimiter and self.after_delimiter. So the code for set_cut_chars would just assign these parameters to those variables.

But before writing the code, I need to follow test-driven development. So I should first write unit tests. Let me think about what the tests would check. The tests should verify that after calling set_cut_chars, the instance variables hold the correct values. Also, maybe check that the method doesn't return anything (since it's None), and that it correctly handles different byte inputs. 

Wait, what about edge cases? Like passing empty bytes? The function's parameters are of type bytes, so the tests should ensure that only bytes are accepted. But the function's parameters are annotated as bytes, so if someone passes a string, it would be a problem, but in Python with type hints, it's not enforced unless using a type checker. Since the problem doesn't mention handling type errors, maybe the method doesn't need to validate the types, assuming the user passes the correct types. But the tests might include checking that it's stored properly even if the bytes are empty or have some specific values.

So the unit tests could be something like:

Test that when set_cut_chars is called, the before and after attributes are set correctly. For example:

def test_set_cut_chars(self):
    obj = MyClass()
    before = b'abc'
    after = b'xyz'
    obj.set_cut_chars(before, after)
    assert obj._before == before
    assert obj._after == after

Also, test with different data, like empty bytes:

def test_set_empty_bytes(self):
    obj = MyClass()
    obj.set_cut_chars(b'', b'')
    assert obj._before == b''
    assert obj._after == b''

But how are the attributes named? Since the method is called set_cut_chars, maybe the attributes are something like _before_cut or similar. The code's actual variables would need to be private or protected. Let's assume the class has attributes like self._before and self._after. So the method would simply assign them:

def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
    self._before = before
    self._after = after

That's straightforward. Now, the tests need to access these attributes. But in Python, they can do so directly if they're not private. Alternatively, maybe the class has properties or other methods that use these variables, but for the purpose of the tests, checking the attributes is sufficient.

Wait, but in the tests, if the test class is using the same class, like the test case would have an instance of the class under test, so the test methods can access the attributes. But maybe the attributes are intended to be private, so the test would use _before and _after. 

Putting this together, the unit tests would be written first. Then the code would be written to pass those tests. 

Now, the problem says to output only the code generated in Python markdown format. So the actual code for the method and the tests? Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The tips mention generating comprehensive unit tests before the actual code. So the process is: first write the tests, then the code. But the user wants the code generated here. Wait, the question is to generate the code (the method's implementation), but the process of TDD requires writing tests first. However, the user is asking for the code (the method), so maybe the tests are part of the code? Or perhaps the user just wants the method's code. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code to be generated is the method's implementation. But the tip says to first generate the unit tests before writing the code. So perhaps the process is that the assistant first thinks of the tests, then writes the code. But the user wants the code, not the tests. So the code here is the method's code.

Therefore, the code would be as simple as assigning the parameters to instance variables. So:

def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
    self._before = before
    self._after = after

But I should make sure that the variables are properly named and that the method is correctly structured. Also, perhaps the class has these attributes initialized, but the method doesn't need to check that. The method's responsibility is just to set them. So that's the code.

Now, the markdown format. Since the user wants the code in Python markdown format, that would be enclosed in triple backticks with the language specified. So:

```python
def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
    """
    Set the bytes used to delimit slice points.

    Args:
        before: Split file before these delimiters.
        after: Split file after these delimiters.
    """
    self._before = before
    self._after = after
```

Wait, but the docstring in the code must match the provided one. The original function's docstring says "Set the bytes used to delimit slice points." and the args. So the code's docstring should exactly match that. So the method's docstring should be as given. So the code should have that docstring. So putting it all together.

Yes, that should be the code. The tests are part of the TDD process but the code to be output is just the method's implementation. So that's the code.
