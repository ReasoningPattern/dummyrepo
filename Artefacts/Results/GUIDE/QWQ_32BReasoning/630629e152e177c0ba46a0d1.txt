Okay, I need to write a Python function called try_retrieve_webfinger_document that takes a handle string and returns an optional string. The function should try to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document without raising exceptions if it fails. 

First, I should recall what WebFinger is. WebFinger is a protocol that allows a client to discover information about a user or resource. The RFC7033 is actually about the JSON Web Token (JWT), but maybe the user meant RFC7033? Wait, no, RFC7033 is the OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation specification. Oh, maybe they meant RFC7033 as a typo? Or perhaps they meant RFC7033 as part of the webfinger process? Wait, maybe they meant the correct RFC for webfinger. Let me check: WebFinger is defined in RFC7033? Wait no, actually WebFinger is in RFC7033? Wait, no, I think WebFinger is in RFC7033? Let me confirm. Wait, no, WebFinger is actually defined in RFC7033? Hmm, maybe I should check quickly. Wait, no, RFC7033 is the OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation. The WebFinger protocol is defined in RFC7033? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh, right, WebFinger is actually in RFC7033? No, wait, WebFinger is part of the OStatus protocol, but the actual RFC for WebFinger is RFC7033? Hmm, maybe the user made a typo here. Because WebFinger is actually in RFC7033? Let me check quickly. Oh, right, WebFinger is defined in RFC7033. Wait, no, looking it up, WebFinger is in RFC7033? Let me see. Wait, according to Wikipedia, the WebFinger protocol is defined in RFC7033. Wait, no, actually the WebFinger protocol is in RFC7033. Oh right, yes. RFC7033 is the WebFinger protocol specification. So the function needs to retrieve that document following that RFC.

So the function's job is to take a handle (like an email address or a URI) and retrieve the webfinger document. The function should not raise exceptions if it fails, so it should handle errors and return None in case of failure.

The function should return an Optional[str], so it can return a string (the document) or None.

Now, how do I implement this in Python? The steps involved are:

1. Parse the handle to get the host. The handle could be in the form of user@domain.tld, so the domain is needed to construct the URL.

2. Construct the webfinger URL. The standard URL is https://domain/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:handle. So the resource parameter is "acct:" followed by the handle. Wait, the handle is already the full address, so for example, if the handle is alice@example.com, then the resource is "acct:alice@example.com".

3. Make an HTTP GET request to that URL. The response should be in JSON format according to the RFC, but perhaps the function just needs to retrieve the document, regardless of its format.

4. If the request is successful (HTTP 2xx status code), return the response content as a string. Otherwise, return None.

But there are several edge cases and error conditions to handle:

- The handle might not be in a valid format (like not containing a @ symbol). In that case, parsing the domain would fail. But according to the function's docstring, it should not raise exceptions, so we need to handle such cases gracefully.

- The HTTP request could fail (no network, invalid host, etc.), so the code should catch exceptions like requests.exceptions.RequestException.

So steps in code:

First, parse the handle to get the host. Split on @, so the handle must have an @ symbol. Otherwise, we can't proceed, so return None.

Wait, but maybe the handle is in another form? Like a URI? The WebFinger RFC says that the resource can be an URI or an email-like address. But for the purpose of constructing the URL, perhaps the handle is in the form user@domain, so we can split on @. If there's no @, then perhaps the handle is invalid, so return None.

So first step:

Split the handle into parts. If there's no @, then can't get the domain, so return None.

Else, the domain is the part after the @.

Then, construct the URL as https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}

Wait, but the handle might have a @ in it? Like if the handle is an URI, but probably the function is expecting a handle like user@domain.

Wait, the RFC says that the "resource" parameter is a URI or an "acct" identifier. So for an email-like address, it's "acct:username@domain".

So, the function needs to construct the resource as "acct:" + handle.

But the handle may not have an @, in which case, the domain can't be determined. So in that case, return None.

So, first, check that the handle has an @ symbol. If not, return None.

Then, split into username and domain parts.

Then, build the URL as f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:{handle}"

Wait, but the handle is the full address (user@domain). So, for example, if the handle is "bob@site.com", then the resource is "acct:bob@site.com".

Then, make the HTTP request to that URL.

Now, in Python, the requests library is commonly used for HTTP requests. But since the function should not raise exceptions, we need to handle any exceptions that may occur (like connection errors, timeout, etc.)

So the code would be something like:

import requests
from typing import Optional

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        # Split the handle to get the domain
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        username_part, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        
        # Construct the URL
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
        params = {
            "resource": f"acct:{handle}"
        }
        
        # Make the request
        response = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError for bad status codes
        return response.text
    except (requests.exceptions.RequestException, ValueError):
        return None

Wait, but splitting on the first @ with split('@', 1) gives us the username_part and domain. However, if there are multiple @ symbols, like "user@sub.domain.com", then split on the first @ gives "user" and "sub.domain.com", which is correct.

So that's okay. But the code needs to handle cases where the split fails? Well, the split with maxsplit=1 will always split into two parts even if there are more @, so the domain would be the rest. So that's okay.

The try block catches all RequestExceptions (which includes connection errors, timeouts, HTTP errors, etc.), and also any ValueErrors? Wait, where could a ValueError come from here?

The split would return two parts, so splitting on '@',1 will not raise a ValueError. The only possible exception would be if the handle is empty? Not sure. Maybe the params construction could have some issue? Probably, the main exceptions are from the requests.get and the response.raise_for_status.

So the except clause catches all RequestExceptions and any other exceptions? Or perhaps just those?

Wait, in the code above, the except clause is catching (requests.exceptions.RequestException, ValueError). But why ValueError? Maybe if the split didn't work? Like, if handle is an empty string, then split would still work, but the domain would be empty. Then the URL would have domain as empty, leading to an invalid URL, which would cause an exception when making the request. So perhaps the ValueError is not necessary here, and the code can just catch the RequestExceptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check that the domain is non-empty. Like, after splitting, if the domain is empty, then return None. Because if handle is "@domain.com", then splitting gives username_part as empty, but the domain is "domain.com". That's okay. But if the handle is "user@", then split would give domain as empty string. So in that case, the domain is invalid, so the URL can't be built. So the code should check that the domain is non-empty.

So adding:

if '@' not in handle:
    return None
parts = handle.split('@', 1)
username_part, domain = parts
if not domain:
    return None

Hmm, but that's part of the code. So in code:

    if '@' not in handle:
        return None
    username_part, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
    if not domain.strip():
        return None  # domain is empty or whitespace

But maybe it's better to handle that in the code. So adding that check.

Alternatively, proceed to build the URL even if domain is empty, but the requests.get would fail with an invalid URL, which would be caught in the except block.

So perhaps that's okay.

Now, putting it all together.

Wait, also, the URL is built with the params as a dictionary. The requests library will handle that by appending the query parameters correctly.

Now, the function returns response.text, which is the content of the response as a string. But what if the response is not text? Well, the RFC says the webfinger document is in JSON format, so the content should be text. But the function doesn't need to parse it, just return the string.

So the code seems okay.

But in the except clause, we have to catch all exceptions that could happen in the try block. The possible exceptions are:

- requests.exceptions.RequestException: any network-related error, including connection errors, timeouts, invalid URLs, etc.

- response.raise_for_status() raises an HTTPError if the HTTP status is >=400. So that's included in RequestException.

- Other exceptions? Like if the handle is None? But the function's parameter is a str, so it's assumed to be a string.

Wait, what if the handle is something like "user@domain@another.com"? Splitting on the first @ would give username_part as "user", domain as "domain@another.com". But that's a valid domain? No, because a domain can't have an @ symbol. But the code would proceed to build the URL with that domain. The URL would then be something like "http://domain@another.com/.well-known/webfinger..." which would be an invalid URL, leading to a requests.exceptions.MissingSchema or similar. So the except block would catch that.

So the code is okay.

Now, for the unit tests. Since the user wants a test-driven approach, first write the tests before the code.

But since I'm to generate the code, but the problem requires that I first think through the tests.

Wait, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, and to output only the code in Python markdown. But in the thinking process, I should consider the tests.

So let's think about the tests.

Test cases for the try_retrieve_webfinger_document function:

1. Valid handle with a valid domain and successful response: should return the document string.

2. Handle without an @ symbol: returns None.

3. Handle with an @ but invalid domain (like no TLD): but how to test that? Maybe mock the request to return an error.

Wait, for testing, since the real requests would require network access, which is not feasible in unit tests, we should use a mocking library like pytest-mock or unittest.mock to mock the requests.get function.

So in the tests, we can:

Test case 1: handle is "user@example.com". The mock should return a successful response with some text. The function should return that text.

Test case 2: handle has no @, like "justuser". The function returns None.

Test case 3: handle has an @ but the domain is invalid (like empty). For example, "user@". The domain would be "", so the function returns None.

Test case 4: the request fails due to a connection error (mocked). The function returns None.

Test case 5: the request returns a 404 (resource not found). The function returns None, because the response status is not 2xx.

Test case 6: the request returns a 200 with some content. The function returns the content.

So the tests would need to mock the requests.get function to return different responses.

Now, writing the unit tests using pytest and the unittest.mock module.

Sample test code:

import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from your_module import try_retrieve_webfinger_document

def test_valid_handle_success():
    handle = "alice@example.com"
    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.status_code = 200
    mock_response.text = '{"some": "json"}'
    with patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response):
        result = try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle)
    assert result == mock_response.text

def test_handle_without_at_symbol():
    handle = "invalidhandle"
    with patch('requests.get') as mock_get:
        result = try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle)
    assert result is None
    mock_get.assert_not_called()

def test_invalid_domain():
    handle = "user@invalid"  # no TLD, but code proceeds to build URL
    # but the domain is "invalid", which is a valid domain? Not sure. Maybe the domain is "invalid", but in the code, it's allowed. However, the URL would be "http://invalid/.well-known/webfinger..." which may be a valid URL (though the domain may not exist). But in the code, the function proceeds. However, when making the request, it would fail. But in the test, since we are mocking, perhaps the test should check that the function still tries to make the request, but the mock can return an error.

Wait, in the test for invalid domain (like empty), the code would split into "user@", so the domain is empty? Let me see.

Wait, for handle "user@", splitting on @ with maxsplit=1 gives username_part = "user", domain = "" (since the split is after the second @? No, the split is after the first @. The handle "user@" has the first @ at index 4 (assuming "user@"). So splitting on @, 1 would give ["user", ""].

So domain is empty. In that case, the code would proceed to build the URL with domain as empty, leading to "http:///.well-known/webfinger..." which is an invalid URL. So in the code, the requests.get would raise an exception (like MissingSchema), which is caught, so the function returns None.

So in the test case, the code would not call the mock_get? Or would it?

Wait, in the code:

if '@' not in handle:
    return None

So for "user@", the '@' is present, so the code proceeds.

Then, after splitting, domain is empty. So the code proceeds to build the URL with domain as empty.

Then, when making the request, the URL would be "https://@.well-known/webfinger..." which is invalid, leading to a requests.exceptions.MissingSchema or InvalidURL exception, which is caught, so the function returns None.

So in the test:

def test_empty_domain():
    handle = "user@"
    with patch('requests.get') as mock_get:
        result = try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle)
    assert result is None
    # The mock_get was called, but the exception would be raised. Wait, in the mock, we can check that requests.get was called with the correct URL, but since the URL is invalid, the exception is raised and caught.

Hmm, but in the test, the mock_get would be called with the URL, but since we are patching requests.get, the mock can return a specific response, but in this case, the domain is empty, so the URL would have an invalid host.

Wait, in the test, when mocking requests.get, the code would still try to call requests.get with the invalid URL. But in the test, since we are using a mock, the mock's return value can be set to raise an exception, but perhaps it's better to just check that the mock was called, but the function returns None.

Alternatively, the mock can be set to return a response that raises an exception when called, but perhaps it's easier to just check that the result is None.

In any case, the test would need to check that when the domain is empty, the function returns None.

Another test case where the request returns a 404:

def test_request_returns_404():
    handle = "user@example.com"
    mock_response = Mock()
    mock_response.status_code = 404
    with patch('requests.get', return_value=mock_response):
        result = try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle)
    assert result is None

Test case for a request that raises an exception (e.g., connection error):

def test_request_raises_exception():
    handle = "user@example.com"
    with patch('requests.get', side_effect=requests.exceptions.ConnectionError()):
        result = try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle)
    assert result is None

These tests cover the main scenarios.

Now, considering all that, the code should be written as follows.

Wait, but in the code, when splitting the handle into username_part and domain, if the domain is empty, the URL would have "https://@...", which is invalid, but the code proceeds. The requests.get would then raise an exception, which is caught and returns None. So the code handles that.

Now, putting it all together in code.

Wait, also, in the code, the URL is built as:

url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"

and the parameters are added via the params dictionary. The requests.get will handle the parameters correctly.

Wait, but in the code above, I have:

params = {"resource": f"acct:{handle}"}

so the requests.get is called with params=params, which appends the query parameters correctly.

Yes.

Now, the code.

Wait, the function uses the requests library. So the code must import requests.

Also, the function must return None on any failure.

Now, the code:

import requests
from typing import Optional

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        username_part, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        if not domain:  # handle cases like "user@"
            return None
        
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
        params = {"resource": f"acct:{handle}"}
        
        response = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except (requests.exceptions.RequestException, ValueError):
        return None

Wait, but in the code above, after splitting, there's a check for domain being empty. So the 'if not domain' returns None. That handles the case where the domain is empty.

That's better than relying on the requests.get to fail. Because in that case, the code can return None early, without making the request.

So that's an improvement.

Wait, the split can result in domain being empty, so adding that check.

Yes.

Also, the except clause catches RequestExceptions and ValueError. Where would a ValueError come from?

The split into two parts with split('@',1) will always return two parts, so username_part and domain are assigned. So a ValueError would not occur here. The only possible exception in the try block is from requests.get or response.raise_for_status, which are covered by RequestExceptions. So maybe the ValueError in the except is unnecessary.

Wait, perhaps the 'domain' could be something that causes an error when building the URL, but that's handled by the requests library. For example, if the domain has invalid characters, the requests.get would raise an InvalidURL exception, which is a subclass of RequestException.

So the except clause can just catch requests.exceptions.RequestException.

Wait, the code's except clause is written as except (requests.exceptions.RequestException, ValueError). But in the code, the only possible exceptions in the try block are from requests.get or response.raise_for_status, which are covered by RequestException. So the ValueError is redundant here.

Therefore, the except clause can be simplified to:

except requests.exceptions.RequestException:

That would be better.

So the code becomes:

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    try:
        if '@' not in handle:
            return None
        username_part, domain = handle.split('@', 1)
        if not domain.strip():  # check domain is not empty or whitespace
            return None
        
        url = f"https://{domain}/.well-known/webfinger"
        params = {"resource": f"acct:{handle}"}
        
        response = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
        return None

Wait, but the split on the first @ could have a domain that's all whitespace? Like "user@  " (with trailing spaces). The split would still give domain as "  ", so the check for domain.strip() would catch that.

Yes, so that's better.

So that's the code.

Now, considering edge cases like handle being "user@domain.com" with a valid domain, but the webfinger endpoint returns a 404, which is caught and returns None.

Another case: the handle is "user@domain.com", and the response is 200, so returns the text.

Yes.

Thus, the code should be correct.
