Okay, I need to write a Python method called popitem that removes and returns the least frequently used key-value pair. Hmm, the function's docstring says it should return a tuple of (key, value). But wait, how do I track the frequency of usage here? Oh right, this sounds like a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache problem, but instead of least recently, it's least frequently used. Wait, maybe it's a frequency-based cache? Or perhaps it's part of a class that tracks the frequency of each item's access?

Wait, the method is part of a class, so I need to consider the class's structure. The popitem method is supposed to remove the item that's been used the least. So each time an item is accessed, its frequency count increases? Or maybe the "used" refers to how many times it's been added or something else?

Wait, the problem might be part of a frequency stack or something similar. Let me think. Maybe the class has a data structure to track the frequency of each key. For example, each time a key is accessed (like in a get or put operation), its frequency increases. Then, when popitem is called, we need to find the key with the smallest frequency. If there are multiple keys with the same frequency, maybe the least recently used among them is popped?

Alternatively, maybe the "least frequently used" is tracked by a count for each key. So the class must have some internal structures, like a dictionary to store the key-value pairs, another to track the frequency of each key, and perhaps a priority queue or something to track the least frequent items.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the full class structure. Since the function signature is given as def popitem(self):, I need to assume that the class has the necessary structures. For example, perhaps the class has a dictionary to hold the items and a frequency dictionary. Or maybe it's using a combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list, but adjusted for frequency instead of time.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Since I need to generate the code, perhaps the problem is similar to an LRU cache but with frequency instead. Let me think of a possible approach.

Let's assume that the class has a dictionary called self.items to store the key-value pairs. Additionally, there's a dictionary called self.freq to track how many times each key has been accessed (like get or set operations). The popitem method would then find the key with the smallest frequency. If multiple keys have the same minimum frequency, perhaps we need to pick the oldest one (like LRU) to break ties.

Alternatively, maybe the frequency is tracked per insertion or access. But without knowing the rest of the class's methods, I might have to make some assumptions here.

Alternatively, maybe this is part of a class that counts how many times each key has been "used", where each time you call a method like get or set, the frequency increases, and popitem removes the least frequent one. So the class might have a frequency dictionary and a way to track the minimum frequency items.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. For instance, the class could track each key's usage count, and when you popitem, you just find the key with the smallest count. If there are multiple keys with the same count, perhaps the one that was inserted first or last?

Hmm, but how do I handle the case where two keys have the same frequency? The problem says "the" least frequently used, implying that there's a single one, but in reality, there might be multiple. So perhaps the tiebreaker is the oldest one (LRU) or the most recent one?

Alternatively, maybe the frequency is the only criteria, and the method can pick any of them. But the problem says "the" so perhaps the class has a way to track insertion order or something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is similar to the LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache. Let me recall: in LFU, when you need to evict an item, you remove the one with the least access frequency. If multiple items have the same frequency, the one that was least recently used is evicted. So combining frequency and time.

Therefore, the class would need to track for each key its frequency and the last time it was used (or insertion time). So, the popitem would first find the minimum frequency. Among all keys with that frequency, find the one with the oldest last access time, and remove it.

So, the class might have:

- A dictionary (items) to hold the key-value pairs.

- A frequency dictionary (freq) where each key's value is its count.

- A timestamp dictionary (or using a separate data structure) to track the last access time of each key.

Alternatively, perhaps using a priority queue where each entry is (frequency, timestamp, key, value). But that might be more complex.

Alternatively, using a structure like a defaultdict for frequency, and for each frequency, a queue or list of keys with that frequency, ordered by insertion time. But this requires more complex bookkeeping.

Hmm, but since I need to write the code for the popitem method, perhaps the class has these structures already. Let me think of the code structure.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the full class. The problem is to generate the popitem method based on the given signature and docstring. So maybe the class has some internal variables that I can use. But without knowing the class structure, perhaps the code can't be written correctly. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting a simple implementation where each key's usage is tracked, and the least frequent is popped, but how?

Alternatively, maybe this is part of a class that uses an ordered dictionary where the least used items are at the front or back. Wait, perhaps the code uses a combination of a dictionary and a heap. Let's think of the heap approach.

Suppose the class has a heap where each element is a tuple (frequency, timestamp, key). The heap is maintained such that the smallest element by frequency and then by timestamp is popped first. Then, the popitem method would pop the smallest element from the heap, remove it from the items, and return the key-value pair.

But the problem is that when the frequency of a key changes (e.g., when it's accessed again), the heap would need to be updated, which can be tricky because heaps aren't efficient for arbitrary updates.

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a frequency dictionary and for each frequency, a linked list of keys. The minimum frequency is tracked, and when that frequency's linked list is empty, we move to the next.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too detailed. Since the problem requires writing the popitem method, perhaps the class has some internal structures like:

- self.items: a dictionary of key-value pairs.

- self.freq: a dictionary mapping keys to their usage counts.

- self.min_freq: the current minimum frequency.

Additionally, there might be another structure to track the nodes, perhaps similar to LFU cache implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class where each item has a count, and the popitem method iterates through all keys to find the one with the smallest count, breaking ties arbitrarily. But that would be O(n) each time, which isn't efficient, but maybe acceptable for a simple case.

Wait, but the problem might not require efficiency, just the functionality. Let me proceed with the assumption that the class has a self.items dictionary and a self.freq dictionary that tracks the usage count for each key.

So, in the popitem method:

1. Find the minimum frequency among all keys. Let's say min_freq = min(self.freq.values()) if self.items is not empty.

2. Find all keys with that frequency.

3. Among those keys, perhaps pick the one that was least recently used (so need a timestamp or insertion order). But without a timestamp, maybe the earliest inserted key among those with min_freq.

Alternatively, if the class doesn't track insertion time, perhaps the first key found with min_freq is chosen.

Wait, but without knowing how the class tracks usage, maybe the problem is simpler. Perhaps the "used" refers to the number of times the item has been accessed (like get or set operations), and the popitem removes the one with the least accesses. So the code could be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.items:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): empty structure")
    min_freq = min(self.freq.values())
    candidates = [k for k in self.items if self.freq[k] == min_freq]
    # choose the first candidate, or the oldest
    # assuming insertion order is tracked somehow
    # maybe the first one in the items (which is insertion order in Python 3.7+)
    # but that's a stretch
    # alternatively, pick the first one in the candidates list
    selected_key = candidates[0]
    # but what if there are multiple candidates?
    # perhaps we need to track the last used time for each candidate and pick the oldest
    # but if the class doesn't track that, then this is impossible.

Hmm, this is getting stuck. Maybe the problem expects a simple implementation where the class is a dictionary that tracks the count of each key's usage. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class that uses an ordered dict to track insertion order, and when you call popitem, you remove the first item (like LRU). But the question says "least frequently used", not least recently.

Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question where the method is supposed to behave like the standard dict.popitem(), which removes and returns an arbitrary item, but the docstring here is different. But no, the docstring specifies least frequently used.

Alternatively, perhaps this is part of a class where each time an item is accessed (like in a get or set), its frequency is incremented. The popitem removes the one with the smallest frequency. If there are multiple, pick any.

So the code could be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.items:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): empty structure")
    min_freq = min(self.freq.values())
    for key in self.items:
        if self.freq[key] == min_freq:
            value = self.items.pop(key)
            del self.freq[key]
            # update min_freq if needed?
            # maybe not necessary here since the next pop would recalculate
            return (key, value)
    # This loop should always find a key, so no need for else.

Wait, but looping through all keys until finding one with min_freq might be O(n), but perhaps acceptable for the problem's requirements.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a priority queue where each element is (frequency, key, value). The heap would allow the smallest to be popped. But maintaining the heap would require updating when frequencies change, which is beyond the scope of the popitem method.

Hmm, given the constraints, I think the code should be structured as follows:

Assuming that the class has:

- self.items: a dictionary of key-value pairs.

- self.freq: a dictionary mapping each key to its usage count.

The popitem method:

- Find the minimum frequency.

- Iterate through the items to find the first key with that frequency.

- Remove it from both items and freq, then return the key-value pair.

But to handle the case where multiple keys have the same frequency, perhaps we need to pick the oldest one (based on insertion time). Since in Python, dictionaries preserve insertion order (as of 3.7+), the first occurrence in the loop would be the oldest.

Wait, but looping through the items in the order of insertion, so when we find the first key with min_freq, that's the first one inserted with that frequency. So if there are multiple keys with the same min_freq, the first one encountered in the loop would be the earliest inserted among them. That could serve as the tiebreaker (like LRU).

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a list to track insertion order, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, the problem might not require handling the tiebreaker, and just picking any key with the minimum frequency is acceptable.

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.items:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): pop from empty structure")
    min_freq = min(self.freq.values())
    # Find the first key with min_freq
    for key in self.items:
        if self.freq[key] == min_freq:
            value = self.items.pop(key)
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    # This should not happen since min was found from existing keys
    # So no else needed.

Wait, but in the for loop, if there are multiple keys with min_freq, this will pick the first one encountered. Since the loop goes through the items in insertion order, that's the oldest one. So that would work as a tiebreaker.

But this requires that the class's items dictionary is ordered (which is the default in Python 3.7+). So this code would work under that assumption.

Now, the user mentioned to follow test-driven development. So first write unit tests before the code.

The tests would need to check that the popitem removes the least frequently used item. For example:

Test case 1: Insert some items, track their usage, and ensure that the one with the lowest count is popped.

Test case 2: Two items with the same frequency; the one inserted earlier is popped first.

Test case 3: After popping, the item is removed from the data structure.

But to write these tests, I need to know the class's interface. For example, how are items added? Since the code is for the popitem method, perhaps the class has __init__, __setitem__, __getitem__, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the class is similar to a dictionary but with the popitem method. Let's assume that the class has __setitem__ to add items, and that accessing items (like via __getitem__) increments their frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the class is designed so that each time you add or modify an item, its frequency is increased. Or maybe the frequency is incremented on some other operation.

But for the test cases, I can make some assumptions. Let's say that adding an item (using __setitem__) increments its frequency. Or maybe the frequency is tracked separately.

Alternatively, maybe the frequency is incremented each time the item is accessed (get or set). But without knowing, perhaps the test cases can be written with simple steps.

Sample test case:

Test that the item with the least frequency is popped first.

Arrange:

- Create a class instance.

- Add items 'a', 'b', 'c', each with different frequencies.

For example:

class LFUCache:

    def __init__(self):
        self.items = {}
        self.freq = {}

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        self.items[key] = value
        self.freq[key] = self.freq.get(key, 0) + 1

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if key in self.items:
            self.freq[key] += 1
            return self.items[key]
        raise KeyError(key)

    def popitem(self):
        # the code we are writing

Then, in a test:

def test_popitem_least_frequent():

    cache = LFUCache()
    cache['a'] = 1  # freq 1
    cache['b'] = 2  # freq 1
    cache['a'] = 3  # now 'a' has freq 2
    # Now, 'b' has freq 1, 'a' has 2, so popitem should return 'b'

    key, value = cache.popitem()
    assert key == 'b' and value == 2

Another test where two items have the same frequency, so the older one is popped.

def test_tie_breaker():

    cache = LFUCache()
    cache['a'] = 1  # freq 1
    cache['b'] = 2  # freq 1
    # Both have same frequency. Since 'a' was added first, it's popped first.

    key, value = cache.popitem()
    assert key == 'a' and value == 1

Another test for empty case:

def test_empty_cache():

    cache = LFUCache()
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        cache.popitem()

These tests would drive the implementation.

Now, writing the code for popitem as discussed earlier.

Wait, but the code must be part of the class. So the actual code for the method would be as I outlined earlier.

Wait, but in the code for popitem, the loop iterates over self.items (the keys in insertion order), and the first one with min_freq is picked, which would be the oldest in case of a tie.

Thus, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.items:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): pop from empty structure")
    min_freq = min(self.freq.values())
    for key in self.items:
        if self.freq[key] == min_freq:
            value = self.items.pop(key)
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    # The above loop must find a key because min_freq was taken from the values
    # So this return is unreachable but needed for syntax
    raise RuntimeError("Unreachable code reached")

Wait, but in Python, if the loop doesn't return, it would exit and hit this error. However, since min_freq is the minimum of the existing values, there must be at least one key with that frequency. So the loop will always find it, so the error is unreachable.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, putting it all together, the user wants only the code in Python markdown. The code for the method popitem is as above. But in the problem statement, the function signature is given as part of the class. So the code would be:

class ... (the class definition would be needed, but the problem only requires the popitem method's code). Wait, the user's instruction says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Ah, right. The function is part of a class, but the user only provides the method's signature and docstring. So the code to output is just the method's code. But the method must be part of a class, so the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    if not self.items:
        raise KeyError("popitem(): pop from empty structure")
    min_freq = min(self.freq.values())
    for key in self.items:
        if self.freq[key] == min_freq:
            value = self.items.pop(key)
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise RuntimeError("Unreachable code reached")

Wait, but the code assumes that the class has self.items and self.freq. Since the problem didn't specify the class structure, this is an assumption, but it's the best I can do given the information.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use a different approach, but given the constraints, this is the best possible.

Therefore, the code for the method is as above.
