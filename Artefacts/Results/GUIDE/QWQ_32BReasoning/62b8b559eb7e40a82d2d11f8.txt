Okay, I need to write a Python function called minimalBases that takes a list of classes and returns those that don't have any subclasses. Hmm, right. So the goal is to find the minimal elements in the hierarchy, where a class is minimal if none of the other classes in the list are its subclasses.

First, I should think about how to determine if a class has any subclasses within the given list. For each class in the input list, I need to check if any other class in the list is a subclass of it. If none are, then it's a minimal base.

Wait, but how do I check that? Let's see. For a given class C, I can iterate over all the other classes in the list and see if any of them is a subclass of C. If even one exists, then C is not minimal. Otherwise, it is.

So the steps would be:

1. Iterate over each class in the classes list.
2. For each class C, check if there exists any other class D in the list where D is a subclass of C.
3. If no such D exists, add C to the result list.

But how do I efficiently check this without redundant checks? Maybe for each class C, loop through all the other classes and see if any of them is a subclass of C. The 'issubclass' function can help here. Wait, but we need to be careful with the order and not check the class against itself.

Wait, but in the list, there might be duplicates? The problem probably assumes that the input list has unique classes, but maybe I should handle that. But the problem says "classes" as the parameter, so probably a list of distinct classes. But the code should handle cases where a class is checked against itself? Like, if there is another instance of the same class in the list, but that's impossible since classes are unique objects. So perhaps the list contains unique elements.

So the steps in code:

result = []
for c in classes:
    has_subclass = False
    for d in classes:
        if d is not c and issubclass(d, c):
            has_subclass = True
            break
    if not has_subclass:
        result.append(c)
return result

Wait, but wait. The 'issubclass' function requires that the second argument is a class. Since d and c are all classes, that should be okay. But if d is a subclass of c, then that means c has a subclass in the list (d), so c is not minimal. Therefore, if any such d exists, we exclude c.

Yes. So that's the logic.

Now, the function should return the list of such minimal classes.

But the problem says "all classes without subclasses as a list". So that's exactly what this code does.

Now, but I need to write unit tests first, as per the test-driven approach. Let me think of some test cases.

Test case 1: A simple hierarchy. Suppose we have three classes: A, B, and C where B is a subclass of A, and C is a subclass of A. Then the minimal bases would be [A], but wait no. Wait, the minimal bases are those that have no subclasses. But since B and C are subclasses of A, A has subclasses. So the minimal would be B and C, because they don't have subclasses in the list. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, let's say the input list is [A, B, C]. If B and C are subclasses of A, then A has subclasses (B and C), so A is not minimal. B and C, do they have any subclasses in the list? Suppose not, then they are minimal. So the minimal bases would be B and C. So the output should be [B, C].

Another test case: a class with no subclasses. For example, if the list contains only a single class D. Then since there are no other classes, it has no subclasses, so it should be in the output.

Another test case: a class and its subclass. Suppose the list is [A, B], where B is a subclass of A. Then the minimal bases would be B, since A has a subclass in the list, so B is minimal.

Another case where a class has multiple subclasses but some are not in the list. Wait, but the function only considers the given list. So if a class has a subclass outside the list, that doesn't matter. Only the presence in the list matters.

Another test case: a diamond hierarchy. Let's say classes A, B, C where B and C are subclasses of A, and D is a subclass of both B and C. The list is [A, B, C, D]. Then, the minimal bases would be D, since it has no subclasses in the list. A has B and C as subclasses, B has D as a subclass (so not minimal), C also has D, so D is the only one with no subclasses in the list.

Hmm. So the tests need to cover these scenarios.

Now, writing the tests. Let's use the unittest module.

First, the test for the single class case:

class TestMinimalBases(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_single_class(self):
        class A: pass
        self.assertEqual(minimalBases([A]), [A])

Then the case with two classes where one is a subclass:

def test_parent_child(self):
    class A: pass
    class B(A): pass
    self.assertEqual(minimalBases([A, B]), [B])

Another test with three classes where the first has two subclasses:

def test_multiple_subclasses(self):
    class A: pass
    class B(A): pass
    class C(A): pass
    self.assertEqual(sorted(minimalBases([A, B, C]), key=lambda x: x.__name__), 
                     sorted([B, C], key=lambda x: x.__name__))

Wait, but the order might not matter, so sorted to compare.

Another test where a class has a grandchild but the child is present:

def test_grandparent(self):
    class A: pass
    class B(A): pass
    class C(B): pass
    self.assertEqual(minimalBases([A, B, C]), [C])

Because A has B as a subclass, B has C, so C has no subclasses in the list, so it's minimal.

Another edge case: a class that is a subclass of itself? Not possible in Python, so no need to test.

Another test case where two classes are not related:

def test_two_unrelated(self):
    class A: pass
    class B: pass
    self.assertEqual(minimalBases([A, B]), [A, B])

Because neither is a subclass of the other.

Another case where a class is in the list but has a subclass not in the list:

def test_subclass_not_in_list(self):
    class A: pass
    class B(A): pass
    class C: pass
    self.assertEqual(minimalBases([A, C]), [A, C])

Because B is not in the list, so A's presence in the list doesn't have a subclass in the list. So A is minimal here.

So these tests should cover the different scenarios.

Now, once the tests are written, the code can be implemented as outlined earlier.

Wait, but in the code, when checking for d in classes, I have to make sure not to compare with itself. So the code's loop:

for d in classes:
    if d is not c and issubclass(d, c):

Yes, that's correct. Because if d is the same as c, we skip. So that's handled.

Now, what about the case where a class is a subclass of multiple others?

Like in the diamond case. Let me see:

In the diamond example:

A is the top, B and C are children of A, D is a child of B and C.

List is [A,B,C,D]

For A, there are B and C as subclasses, so it's excluded.

For B, D is a subclass (so B is excluded).

For C, D is a subclass (so excluded).

For D, none of the other classes (A, B, C) are subclasses of D. So D is included.

So the code would return [D], which is correct.

Another edge case: a class that is a subclass of another in the list but also a superclass of another? Like a cycle? But in Python, you can't have a cycle in class inheritance. So that's not possible, so no need to worry.

So the code should work.

Now, putting it all together. The function minimalBases would loop through each class, check for any subclass in the list, and collect those without any.

Now, the code in Python:

def minimalBases(classes):
    min_bases = []
    for c in classes:
        is_minimal = True
        for d in classes:
            if d is not c and issubclass(d, c):
                is_minimal = False
                break
        if is_minimal:
            min_bases.append(c)
    return min_bases

Wait, that's the code. Let me see. The loops are as discussed.

Wait, but in the case where the list has a class that is a subclass of another, but in the list, the code correctly checks for that.

Yes. So this should work.

Now, the code needs to be written with that.

Now, the user wants only the code in Python markdown format. So I need to present it as:

```python
def minimalBases(classes):
    # implementation here
```

So the final code would be as above.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the order is correct. The tests may check for the order, so in the function, the order of the output should be the same as the order in the input list. For example, in the test_multiple_subclasses case, the order in the input is [A, B, C], so the minimal bases are B and C, so the output should be [B, C], not [C, B]. The code appends in the order of the original list, so that's correct.

Yes. So the code should be correct.
