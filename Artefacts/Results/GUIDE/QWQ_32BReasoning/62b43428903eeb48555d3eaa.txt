Okay, so I need to generate Python code for the formatmany method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding what this method is supposed to do. The docstring says it should convert the SQL using self._converter.convert_many. Hmm, right, so the method takes an SQL string and a list of parameters (either as a list of dicts or sequences) and then uses some converter's convert_many method to process them.

First, I should think about the parameters. The sql is an AnyStr, which I believe means it can be either a str or bytes. The many_params is a bit more complex: it's an iterable of either dictionaries (with keys that are strings or ints) or sequences. The return type is a tuple containing the converted SQL and the parameters, which could be a list of dicts or sequences, depending on the input.

Now, the method's job is to call self._converter.convert_many with these parameters. Wait, but how does convert_many work? Since I don't have its definition, I have to assume based on typical usage. Maybe convert_many takes the SQL and the many_params and returns the formatted SQL along with the parameters in some form. So the method should probably just delegate to that function and return the result.

But before writing the code, the user mentioned using test-driven development. So first, I should generate unit tests. Let me think about what tests to write. The tests should check that when formatmany is called, it uses the converter's convert_many method. So maybe a mock test where we assert that convert_many was called with the correct arguments. Also, the return value should be the result from convert_many. 

Another test case could check that the types of the returned parameters are preserved. For example, if the input is a list of tuples, the output's parameters list should also be tuples (or whatever the converter returns). But without knowing the converter's specifics, maybe the test just checks that the structure is maintained.

Wait, but how do I structure the tests? Let's see. The tests would need to mock the _converter's convert_many method. So using a Mock or MagicMock in the test. Then, create an instance of the class (let's say it's part of a class called Formatter or something), and call formatmany, then check that the mock was called properly.

For example, a test case might look like this:

def test_formatmany_calls_converter(self):
    converter_mock = Mock()
    formatter = MyFormatterClass(converter_mock)
    sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = %s"
    params_list = [{'id': 1}, {'id': 2}]
    result_sql, result_params = formatter.formatmany(sql, params_list)
    converter_mock.convert_many.assert_called_once_with(sql, params_list)
    assert result_sql == converter_mock.convert_many.return_value[0]
    assert result_params == converter_mock.convert_many.return_value[1]

But I need to make sure that the parameters are passed correctly. Also, the return value of formatmany should be exactly what convert_many returns.

Another test case could check that the types are maintained. Suppose convert_many returns a string and a list of sequences, then the return should match that.

Wait, but in the function signature, the return is a tuple of AnyStr and a list of either dicts or sequences, depending on the input. So the code must return exactly what convert_many returns. So the method is basically a pass-through to the converter's method.

Therefore, the code for the method would be straightforward: call self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params) and return the result.

Wait, but what about the types? The method's parameters specify that many_params is an iterable of either dicts or sequences. The return type expects a list of those. So the code must ensure that the return value from convert_many matches that. But since the user is using the given signature, the code can just forward the call.

So putting it all together, the method would look like:

def formatmany(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:
    """Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many"""
    return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But wait, that's it? That seems very simple, but according to the problem statement, that's exactly what the method is supposed to do. The docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many", so the code just delegates to that method and returns its result. So the actual code is just a single line returning the result of convert_many.

Now, the tests. Let's think of some test cases. The first test would check that when formatmany is called, the convert_many is called with the correct arguments. The second test could check that the return values are correctly passed through.

Another test could check edge cases, like empty many_params, but that might depend on the converter's behavior. Since we can't know, maybe just the basic test.

So the unit tests would be something like:

import unittest
from unittest.mock import Mock
from my_module import MyClass  # assuming the class is part of some module

class TestFormatMany(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_calls_convert_many(self):
        mock_converter = Mock()
        instance = MyClass(mock_converter)
        sql = "SELECT * FROM table"
        params = [{'a': 1}, ['b', 2]]
        result = instance.formatmany(sql, params)
        mock_converter.convert_many.assert_called_once_with(sql, params)
        self.assertEqual(result, mock_converter.convert_many.return_value)

    def test_returns_correct_types(self):
        mock_converter = Mock()
        mock_converter.convert_many.return_value = ("new_sql", [{"x": 3}, [4,5]])
        instance = MyClass(mock_converter)
        sql = "original"
        params = [{}]
        new_sql, new_params = instance.formatmany(sql, params)
        self.assertEqual(new_sql, "new_sql")
        self.assertEqual(new_params, [{"x":3}, [4,5]])

But I need to structure this correctly. The actual code for the tests would depend on how the class is structured, but since the user is to write the code, the tests would be part of the TDD process before writing the actual code.

Now, putting all together, the code for the method is straightforward, but the tests need to be written first. But the problem says to output only the generated code in Python markdown format, so I should just write the code for the method.

Wait, but the user mentioned that the code should be generated after following TDD. But since the code is just a wrapper, the actual code is simple. So the final code would be as I outlined above.
