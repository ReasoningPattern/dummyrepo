Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_request_el that checks if an object's class has both 'fill' and 'request' attributes. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to determine whether the obj's class has those two attributes. So, I should probably look into the class of the object, not the instance itself. Because attributes on the class level are what we're checking here.

Hmm, right. So for a given obj, I can get its class by doing obj.__class__. Then, I need to check if that class has both 'fill' and 'request' as attributes. 

Wait, how do I check if a class has an attribute? Oh right, using the hasattr function. So, for the class, check if hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'request') both return True.

Putting that together: the steps are:

1. Get the class of the object: cls = obj.__class__
2. Check if both attributes exist in the class.
3. Return True if both are present, else False.

So the function would look something like:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'request')

But wait, what if obj is None or not an instance? Like, if someone passes a class directly instead of an instance. But the function's name suggests that it's checking the object's class, so maybe that's okay. Because even if obj is a class, then obj.__class__ would be type, and unless type has those attributes, it would return false. But the function's docstring says "obj class", so perhaps it's intended to pass an instance. But the function doesn't enforce that. So maybe it's okay as is.

Now, for the unit tests. Let's think of different cases.

First, a class that has both attributes. Let's say:

class HasBoth:
    fill = True
    request = "something"

An instance of this should return True.

Another test case: a class missing one attribute. Like:

class MissingFill:
    request = "something"

Then, the function should return False.

Another case where the class has neither.

Third case: a class with only 'fill' but not 'request'.

Also, need to test when the attributes are present but maybe None? But the function doesn't care about the values, just the presence of the attributes.

Wait, the function checks for the existence of the attributes on the class, regardless of their value. So even if 'fill' is None, as long as the attribute exists, it's okay.

So the tests should cover these scenarios.

Another edge case: what if the object is of a built-in type? Like a string. Then, the class is str, which probably doesn't have those attributes. So the test would expect False.

Also, test when the attributes are added dynamically. Like:

class TestClass:
    pass

Then, add TestClass.fill = ... etc.

But maybe that's overcomplicating for the tests.

Now, writing the tests using pytest.

First, the test for the case where both are present.

def test_has_both_attributes():
    class HasBoth:
        fill = True
        request = "test"
    obj = HasBoth()
    assert is_fill_request_el(obj) is True

Then a test where only one is present:

def test_missing_fill():
    class MissingFill:
        request = "test"
    obj = MissingFill()
    assert is_fill_request_el(obj) is False

def test_missing_request():
    class MissingRequest:
        fill = True
    obj = MissingRequest()
    assert is_fill_request_el(obj) is False

Test where neither is present:

def test_neither_present():
    class Neither:
        pass
    obj = Neither()
    assert is_fill_request_el(obj) is False

Also, test when the object is an instance of a class where the attributes are inherited.

Like:

class Parent:
    fill = True
    request = "test"

class Child(Parent):
    pass

Then, an instance of Child should return True.

So another test case:

def test_inherited_attributes():
    class Parent:
        fill = True
        request = "test"
    class Child(Parent):
        pass
    child_obj = Child()
    assert is_fill_request_el(child_obj) is True

Another test case where the class is passed directly (since the function uses obj.__class__, which for a class would be type). For example:

def test_class_as_obj():
    class SomeClass:
        fill = True
        request = "test"
    assert is_fill_request_el(SomeClass) is False  # because SomeClass's __class__ is type, which doesn't have fill or request

Wait, in that case, passing the class itself (not an instance) would check the type class. Since type (the metaclass) probably doesn't have those attributes, so the function would return False. But maybe the user intended to pass an instance. But the function's docstring doesn't specify, so the test should reflect that.

So that's a possible test case. The function treats the class as an object, so passing a class would check its own class (type) for the attributes, which is correct per the function's code.

So that's covered.

Another edge case: the attributes are present but are methods? Like:

class HasMethods:
    def fill(self):
        pass
    request = "test"

Then, the hasattr would still return True for 'fill', because the method is an attribute of the class. So that should pass.

So that's okay.

So the tests should cover these scenarios. Now, putting all the test functions together in a test module.

Wait, the problem says to first generate comprehensive unit tests before writing the code, but the user wants me to output only the code. But according to the problem statement, I should generate the code based on the function signature and the tests.

Hmm, but the user says to output only the code generated in Python markdown. So I need to write the function code, which is straightforward.

Wait, the user's instruction says to follow TDD: first generate the tests, then the code. But the user wants me to output only the code. So I should proceed to code, but based on the test-driven approach.

So the code is as I thought earlier:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    cls = obj.__class__
    return hasattr(cls, 'fill') and hasattr(cls, 'request')

Yes, that should work. Let me check again.

Wait, what if the object is None? Then, accessing __class__ would raise an error. But the function's docstring says to check the obj's class, so passing None would be an error. But the function's behavior in that case is to throw an AttributeError. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling such cases, so perhaps it's expected that obj is a valid instance or class.

The function doesn't have any error handling for that, so it's up to the caller to pass a valid obj. So the code is correct as per the requirements.

Thus, the code is as written.
