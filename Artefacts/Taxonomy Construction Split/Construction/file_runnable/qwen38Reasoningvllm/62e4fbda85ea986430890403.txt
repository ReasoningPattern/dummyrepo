Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _shuffled that takes a sequence of strings and returns a shuffled list of strings. The docstring mentions using a FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. Wait, the function signature shows the parameter as seq: Sequence[str], so it's expecting a sequence like a list or tuple of strings. The docstring says to shuffle with a fixed random seed. Oh right, that's important for reproducibility. 

So, how do I shuffle a sequence in Python with a fixed seed? I remember that the random module has a shuffle function. But to make it deterministic, I should set the seed first. The FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is probably a constant defined somewhere. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should use a default value, like 42. But wait, the function is supposed to use the given seed. Wait, the function signature doesn't have a seed parameter. Wait, the docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED"—so maybe the seed is a fixed value inside the function, not passed as an argument. Oh right, the function doesn't take a seed parameter. So the FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is a constant that's fixed within the function.

Wait, the user didn't provide the value of FIXED_RANDOM_SEED. So I need to define it inside the function or as a global variable? Well, the function is supposed to use that fixed seed. So perhaps the code should include a fixed seed, like 42, and then shuffle the sequence using that seed. But the function's parameters don't include a seed, so the seed is fixed. 

So the steps are: import random, set the seed to FIXED_RANDOM_SEED, shuffle the sequence, and return it. But how to handle the sequence? Since the input is a sequence, maybe convert it to a list, shuffle, then return as a list. Wait, the function returns a list of strings. So the code would be:

Import random, then set random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED). Then shuffle the input sequence. But wait, the input is a Sequence, which could be a tuple or list. The shuffle function modifies the list in place. So perhaps we need to convert the input to a list first. 

Wait, but the function is called _shuffled, which suggests it's an internal function. So maybe the code is part of a class or module where FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is defined. But since the user hasn't provided that, I need to assume it's a constant. Let me check the function signature again. The function doesn't take a seed parameter, so the seed is fixed. So the code should include a fixed seed value. 

So the code would be something like:

import random

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # Assuming this is the fixed seed

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    shuffled_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_list)
    return shuffled_list

Wait, but the user might have a specific seed in mind. However, since it's not provided, using 42 is a common default. But maybe the user expects that FIXED_RANDOM_SEED is already defined elsewhere. But the function's docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED", implying that it's a fixed value within the function. So perhaps the code should include the seed as a constant. 

Alternatively, maybe the seed is a global variable. But since the function is supposed to use the given seed, and the parameter is seq, the code should use a fixed seed. So the code above should work. Let me make sure that the function is correctly handling the sequence. For example, if the input is a tuple, converting to a list is necessary. Then shuffling and returning as a list. 

Yes, that's correct. So the code would import random, set the seed, convert the input to a list, shuffle it, and return. But the user might not want the seed to be hard-coded. Wait, the docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED"—maybe that's a constant in the code. So perhaps the code should have that constant defined. 

But the user hasn't provided it. So the function needs to have that seed. So the code would include the seed as part of the function. So the code would be as I wrote. But the user might have a different seed. However, since the function is supposed to use a fixed seed, the code should include that. 

Another thing: the function is supposed to return a list of strings. So converting the input sequence to a list is necessary. Then shuffling. So the code should be correct. Let me check for possible errors. For example, if the input is not a sequence, but the function is annotated with Sequence[str], which is from typing. So the code should handle any sequence type. 

Yes, the code converts it to a list, which works for any sequence. So the final code would be:

import random
from typing import Sequence

FIXED_RANDOM_SEED = 42  # Example fixed seed value

def _shuffled(seq: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """
    Shuffle a given seq with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED
    """
    random.seed(FIXED_RANDOM_SEED)
    shuffled_list = list(seq)
    random.shuffle(shuffled_list)
    return shuffled_list

Wait, but the user might not want the seed to be defined inside the function. But the docstring says "with the given FIXED_RANDOM_SEED"—so perhaps the seed is a constant in the module. However, the function as written doesn't take a seed parameter. So the code should include the seed as a fixed value. 

Alternatively, maybe the seed is passed as a parameter but the function signature doesn't show it. But according to the given function signature, the parameters are only seq. So the code must use a fixed seed. Therefore, the code above is correct. 

But the user might have intended that the seed is a global variable. However, since the function is supposed to use the given seed, and the parameter is seq, the code should have the seed as a fixed value. So the code is okay. 

Another thing: the function is called _shuffled, which is a private function, so maybe it's part of a class. But the code is standalone. So the code should be as written. 

So the final code would be as above. But the user said to output only the code, no explanations. So the code should include the import statements, the constant, and the function. But the user's function signature doesn't include the seed, so the code must have the seed fixed. 

Yes, that's the plan. So the code is generated accordingly.
