Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function generate_default_observer_schema based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it generates a default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in spec.manifest where there's no custom schema specified. So first, I should figure out where the spec.manifest is coming from. Since the function takes an 'app' parameter, maybe 'app' is an object that has a 'spec' attribute with a 'manifest' property. That manifest probably contains a list of Kubernetes resources.

The function's purpose is to create default observer schemas for those resources. But what is an observer schema? Maybe it's a structure that defines how to observe or monitor a Kubernetes resource. For example, each resource might have a set of metrics or events that the observer should track. If there's no custom schema, we need to generate a default one.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Access the manifest from the app object. Let's assume that app.spec.manifest is a list of resource objects.
2. For each resource in the manifest, check if it already has an observer schema specified. If not, create a default one.
3. The default schema might have some standard fields. For example, maybe it includes metadata like name, namespace, and some common metrics.

But wait, the problem says to generate the schema, not the actual code. Wait, no, the function is supposed to generate the default observer schema. So perhaps the function is part of a larger system where each resource has an observer schema, and this function fills in the defaults where they are missing.

So, the function needs to iterate over each resource in the manifest, check if it has a custom observer schema, and if not, assign a default one. But how is the observer schema structured? Maybe each resource has an 'observer_schema' attribute, and if it's not present, we create a default.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact structure, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's assume that each resource in the manifest is an object with a 'kind' attribute (like Deployment, Service, etc.), and that the default observer schema is a dictionary with some standard keys. For example, maybe the default schema includes 'metadata' and 'status' fields, or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the observer schema is a class or a data structure that needs to be instantiated. But given the function's name and the context, it's more likely that it's generating a schema (like a dictionary or a JSON structure) for each resource.

So, the code would look something like this:

- Iterate through each resource in app.spec.manifest.
- For each resource, check if it has an observer_schema. If not, create a default one.
- The default schema could be a predefined structure, maybe based on the resource's kind.

But how to represent the default schema? Let's say for each resource kind, there's a default schema. For example, if the resource is a Deployment, the default schema might have certain parameters. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the default is a generic schema.

Alternatively, maybe the default schema is a simple dictionary with some common fields. Let's assume that the default schema is a dictionary with 'type' set to 'default' and some standard fields like 'metadata' and 'status'.

Wait, the function is called generate_default_observer_schema, so maybe it's generating a schema that's used for observing, which could be a JSON schema or a similar structure. But again, without more details, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a resource kind, and the value is the default observer schema for that kind. But the docstring says "for each Kubernetes resource present in spec.manifest", so maybe it's modifying the resources in place by adding their default observer schema if missing.

Another approach: Maybe the function is part of a framework where each resource has an observer schema, and this function ensures that if none is provided, a default is generated. So, the code would loop through the resources, check for the presence of an observer schema, and if not present, create one.

But since the user hasn't provided the exact structure of the resources or the schema, I need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that each resource has an 'observer_schema' attribute, and if it's not present, we assign a default schema. The default schema could be a dictionary with some standard keys.

So, the code could be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema') or resource.observer_schema is None:
            # Create default schema
            resource.observer_schema = {
                'type': 'default',
                'fields': ['metadata', 'status', 'spec']
            }
    return app

But maybe the default schema is more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to generate a schema based on the resource's type. For example, for a Deployment, the default schema might include replicas, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the function is generating a schema that's used for observing, which could be a list of metrics or something else. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.

Another thought: The function might be generating a schema in the form of a dictionary that defines the structure of the observer data. For example, a default schema could have certain properties that are monitored by default.

But given the lack of specific details, I'll proceed with a basic approach. Let's assume that each resource in the manifest is an object that can have an observer_schema attribute. If it's missing, we assign a default schema. The default schema could be a dictionary with some standard fields.

So, the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not resource.observer_schema:
            resource.observer_schema = {
                'type': 'default',
                'properties': {
                    'metadata': {'type': 'object'},
                    'status': {'type': 'object'},
                    'spec': {'type': 'object'}
                }
    return app

But maybe the function is supposed to return the generated schemas, not modify the app. However, the docstring says "generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource", which suggests that it's adding them to the resources.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary of default schemas for all resources in the manifest that don't have a custom one. But the function's name implies that it's generating them for the app's resources.

Hmm. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function is supposed to iterate over the resources in the manifest and assign a default observer schema if it's not already present.

Another possible approach: Maybe the default schema is a function that returns a predefined structure. For example, for each resource, the default schema could be generated based on its type.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, I'll have to make a generic example. Let's say that the default observer schema is a dictionary with 'type' as 'default' and some standard fields.

So, the code would be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    default_schema = {
        'type': 'default',
        'properties': {
            'metadata': {'type': 'object'},
            'status': {'type': 'object'},
            'spec': {'type': 'object'}
        }
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema'):
            setattr(resource, 'observer_schema', default_schema)
        else:
            # Maybe check if it's None or empty?
            if resource.observer_schema is None or not resource.observer_schema:
                resource.observer_schema = default_schema
    return app

But maybe the function is supposed to return the generated schemas instead of modifying the app. However, the docstring says "generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource", which could imply that it's adding them to the resources.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a system where the observer schema is a data structure that needs to be built. For example, if the app has a list of resources, and for each resource, if no observer schema is provided, we generate a default one.

But again, without knowing the exact structure of the resources and the schema, I need to make assumptions. Let me think about the possible structure. Maybe each resource has a 'kind' attribute, and the default schema is based on that kind. For example, for a Deployment, the default schema might include 'replicas', 'status', etc.

But since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the default schema is a generic one. Let's proceed with that.

Another possibility: The function is supposed to return a dictionary where the keys are the resource names and the values are their default observer schemas. But the function's name suggests it's generating them for the app's resources.

Alternatively, maybe the function is generating a schema that's used for observing, which could be a JSON schema. For example, a default schema for a Kubernetes resource might have certain properties.

But again, without more context, I'll have to make a generic example. Let me check the original function signature again. The function is called generate_default_observer_schema and takes an app. The docstring mentions spec.manifest, so app is likely an object with a spec attribute, which has a manifest attribute that's a list of resources.

So, the code would need to access app.spec.manifest. Let's assume that each resource in the manifest is an object with a 'kind' attribute. The default observer schema could be a dictionary that includes the resource's kind and some default fields.

But perhaps the function is supposed to create a schema for each resource that's not already specified. So, the code would loop through each resource, check if it has an observer_schema, and if not, generate a default one.

In code:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    default_schema = {
        'type': 'default',
        'properties': {
            'metadata': {'type': 'object'},
            'status': {'type': 'object'},
            'spec': {'type': 'object'}
        }
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if not hasattr(resource, 'observer_schema'):
            setattr(resource, 'observer_schema', default_schema)
        else:
            # Maybe check if it's None or empty?
            if resource.observer_schema is None or not resource.observer_schema:
                resource.observer_schema = default_schema
    return app

But maybe the function is supposed to return the generated schemas. However, the function's name suggests it's generating them for the app's resources. So modifying the resources in place makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is generating a schema that's used for observing, which could be a list of schemas. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.

Another angle: Maybe the function is part of a framework that uses schemas to define what metrics or events to observe. The default schema could be a template that includes common fields.

But given the lack of specifics, I'll proceed with the code that loops through the resources, checks for the presence of an observer_schema, and assigns a default if not present. The default schema is a simple dictionary with some standard fields.

So the final code would be as follows. Also, the user said to output only the code, no explanations. So I need to make sure that the code is written without any extra text.
