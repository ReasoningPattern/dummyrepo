Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _eval_file based on the given signature and docstring. Let me read the docstring carefully.

The function takes a prefix and a file_path. The goal is to identify the type of the file. The return value depends on the file type. If the file doesn't match the prefix or is XML, return None. If it's a PDF, return a dict with component_id, file_path. For other types, return a dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again. Wait, that seems a bit odd. The docstring says for non-PDF types, include ftype and file_path. Maybe the last part is a typo? Let me check again.

The docstring says: return dict with component_id, file_path if the type is "pdf", and for non-PDF, return dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path. Hmm, maybe the second part is supposed to have ftype as the key and the file type as the value, along with component_id and file_path. But the way it's written is confusing. Let me think about how to interpret that.

First, the function needs to determine the file type. How? Maybe by checking the file extension. For example, if the file ends with .pdf, it's a PDF. Otherwise, check if it's XML. But how to check the file type? The docstring mentions returning None if the file doesn't match the given prefix or is XML. Wait, the prefix might be part of the filename? Like, maybe the prefix is a substring that should be present in the file_path. Or perhaps the prefix refers to something else, like a header or magic number. But the function name is _eval_file, which might be part of a larger system.

Alternatively, maybe the prefix is used to check if the file's name starts with that prefix. For example, if the file_path starts with the prefix, then proceed. Otherwise, return None. But the docstring says "if the file do not match the given prefix or the type of the file is xml". So, the two conditions are: if the file doesn't match the prefix OR the type is XML, return None. Otherwise, return the appropriate dict.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if the file_path matches the prefix. How? Maybe check if the prefix is a substring of the file_path. Or perhaps check if the file's name starts with the prefix. The docstring isn't clear, but maybe the prefix is part of the filename, like a directory or a specific identifier. For example, if the file_path is something like 'prefix_something.pdf', then it matches. But the exact method isn't specified, so perhaps the code should check if the prefix is in the file_path. Alternatively, maybe it's checking the file's content type. But without more info, I'll assume it's checking the file's name or path for the prefix.

Wait, the function's name is _eval_file, which might be a helper function. The parameters are prefix and file_path. So, maybe the prefix is a string that should be present in the file_path. For example, if the file_path starts with the prefix, then it's considered a match. Or maybe the prefix is part of the filename, like a component ID. But the docstring says "if the file do not match the given prefix" — perhaps the prefix is a component ID that's part of the file's name. For instance, if the file is named 'component123_report.pdf', then the prefix might be 'component123', and the function checks if the prefix is present in the file_path.

But the exact logic isn't specified. Since the user hasn't provided more details, maybe I should make an assumption here. Let's say that the prefix is a substring of the file_path. If not, return None. Also, if the file type is XML, return None.

Next, determining the file type. The function needs to check the file's type. How? Probably by looking at the file extension. For example, if the file ends with .pdf, it's a PDF. If it ends with .xml, it's XML. Other extensions would be considered other types.

So, the steps could be:

- Check if the prefix is in the file_path. If not, return None.
- Check the file's extension to determine its type.
- If the type is XML, return None.
- If the type is PDF, return a dictionary with component_id (maybe derived from the prefix?), file_path.
- For other types, return a dictionary with component_id, file_path, ftype (the type), and another file_path entry? Wait, the docstring says for non-PDF, return a dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path. That seems redundant. Maybe it's a typo and should be component_id, file_path, ftype. But the original says "ftype, file_path" again. Let me check again.

Original docstring: "return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type of the file is "pdf", return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path if the type of the file is not "pdf"."

Wait, that's confusing. For non-PDF, the dict includes component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again? That would mean two entries for file_path. But that's probably a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be component_id, file_path, and ftype. So the user might have made a typo, writing "ftype, file_path" instead of "ftype".

Alternatively, maybe the component_id is derived from the prefix. For example, if the prefix is 'comp123', then component_id is 'comp123'. But how to extract that? The docstring doesn't specify how component_id is determined. That's a problem. The original function's docstring says that for PDF, return a dict with component_id and file_path. But where does component_id come from? The prefix? Maybe the component_id is the prefix. But the user hasn't specified that, so perhaps that's part of the code logic.

Wait, the function's name is _eval_file, which might be part of a system where the prefix is the component ID. So maybe component_id is the prefix. But that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe component_id is extracted from the filename in some way. Since the user hasn't provided details, perhaps the code should take component_id as the prefix. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the component_id is part of the file path. For example, if the file path is something like '/components/comp123/report.pdf', then component_id is 'comp123'. But again, without knowing the exact structure, this is speculative.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should return the prefix as component_id. But the user's docstring says "return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type of the file is "pdf" — so the component_id is a key, and the value is something. But what's the value? Maybe the component_id is derived from the prefix. For example, if the prefix is 'comp123', then component_id is 'comp123'.

But the user hasn't specified how component_id is determined. This is a problem. However, looking at the parameters, the function has prefix and file_path. The docstring says that for PDF, the dict has component_id and file_path. For non-PDF, it has component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the intended keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype for non-PDF. But the user wrote "ftype, file_path" again. Maybe that's a typo and should be ftype and another key. But without more info, I need to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the component_id is extracted from the file path. For example, if the file path contains a component ID, like in a URL or a specific format. But again, without knowing the exact method, this is challenging.

Another approach: perhaps the function is part of a system where the prefix is the component ID. So, the component_id is the prefix. Then, for a PDF file, the dict would be {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path}. For non-PDF, it would be {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': file_type, 'file_path': file_path} — but that would have duplicate keys. That can't be right. So maybe the docstring is a typo, and for non-PDF, it's component_id, file_path, and ftype. So the dict would have three keys: component_id, file_path, and ftype.

But the original says "ftype, file_path" again. Maybe that's a mistake, and the intended keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. So I'll proceed with that, assuming that the user made a typo.

So, the function needs to:

- Check if the prefix is present in the file_path. If not, return None.
- Check if the file is XML. If yes, return None.
- Otherwise, determine the file type (like PDF, etc.).
- For PDF, return {'component_id': ... , 'file_path': ...}
- For other types, return {'component_id': ... , 'file_path': ... , 'ftype': ...}

But how to get component_id? The docstring doesn't specify, but the function's parameters include prefix. Maybe component_id is the prefix. So, for example, if the prefix is 'comp123', then component_id is 'comp123'.

So, the code steps:

1. Check if the prefix is in the file_path. If not, return None.
2. Determine the file type by checking the extension.
3. If the file type is 'xml', return None.
4. If the file type is 'pdf', return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path}.
5. Else, return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': file_type}.

But how to determine the file type? Using the file extension. For example, split the file_path on '.' and take the last part. But need to handle cases where there's no extension. Also, need to check if the extension is 'xml' or 'pdf'.

So, code:

def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):
    if prefix not in file_path:
        return None
    # Determine file type
    file_type = file_path.split('.')[-1].lower()
    if file_type == 'xml':
        return None
    if file_type == 'pdf':
        return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path}
    else:
        return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': file_type}

Wait, but what if the file has multiple dots, like 'file.tar.gz'? Then splitting on '.' and taking the last part would give 'gz', which is not correct. However, the problem might assume that the file has a single extension. Alternatively, maybe using os.path.splitext would be better. Let me think.

Using os.path.splitext would split the file path into root and extension. For example, for 'file.tar.gz', it would split into ('file.tar', '.gz'). So the extension is .gz. But in that case, the file_type would be 'gz', which is not XML or PDF. But if the file is supposed to be identified by its extension, then that's correct. However, the original problem says that if the file type is XML, return None. So, perhaps the code should check if the extension is 'xml' (case-insensitive), and if so, return None. Otherwise, proceed.

But the user's docstring says "if the file do not match the given prefix or the type of the file is xml". So, the two conditions are:

- If the file doesn't match the prefix → return None
- If the type is XML → return None

So, the code would first check if the prefix is in the file_path. Then check if the file type is XML. If either is true, return None. Otherwise, proceed.

But how to check if the file matches the prefix? The docstring says "if the file do not match the given prefix", so maybe the prefix is part of the file name. For example, if the file path is 'prefix_something.pdf', then the prefix is present. But the code uses 'prefix in file_path' which would check if the prefix is a substring. That might be acceptable unless there's a more specific requirement.

Another point: the function returns None if the file doesn't match the prefix OR is XML. So, even if the file is XML but matches the prefix, it still returns None.

So, the code would first check if prefix is in file_path. If not, return None. Then check if the file type is XML. If yes, return None. Then, if it's PDF, return the dict with component_id (prefix) and file_path. Else, return a dict with component_id, file_path, and ftype.

But the docstring says for non-PDF, return a dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path. That seems like a mistake. Maybe the last 'file_path' is a typo. Let me recheck the original docstring:

"Return None if the file do not match the given prefix or the type of the file is xml. Return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type of the file is "pdf", return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path if the type of the file is not "pdf"."

Ah, the user wrote "ftype, file_path" again. That's probably a mistake. Maybe the intended keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. So for non-PDF, the dict includes component_id, file_path, and ftype. But the original says "ftype, file_path" — maybe the user meant that for non-PDF, the dict includes component_id, file_path, ftype, and another key. But since the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given docstring, I have to follow that.

Wait, the user wrote: for non-PDF, return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path. That would be four keys: component_id, file_path, ftype, and another file_path. That's not possible. So, perhaps the user intended to say that for non-PDF, the dict has component_id, file_path, and ftype. So the last part is a typo. But since the user's docstring says that, maybe I should take it literally. But that would be a mistake in the code. Alternatively, maybe the user meant that for non-PDF, the dict has component_id, file_path, and ftype. So the code would have:

For PDF: {'component_id': ..., 'file_path': ...}
For others: {'component_id': ..., 'file_path': ..., 'ftype': ...}

But the original docstring says for non-PDF, return a dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path. That seems redundant. Maybe it's a mistake and the correct keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. So I'll proceed with that, assuming the user made a typo.

Another possible approach: maybe the component_id is extracted from the file path. But the parameters include prefix, which might be the component_id. For example, if the function is called with prefix as the component ID, then component_id is the prefix. So the code uses prefix as component_id.

Putting it all together:

The function first checks if the prefix is in the file path. If not, return None. Then check if the file type is XML. If yes, return None. Otherwise, determine the file type. If it's PDF, return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path}. Else, return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': file_type}.

But how to get the file type. Using the extension. So, code:

import os

def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):
    if prefix not in file_path:
        return None
    # Get file extension
    _, ext = os.path.splitext(file_path)
    ext = ext.lower()
    if ext == '.xml':
        return None
    if ext == '.pdf':
        return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path}
    else:
        return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': ext}

Wait, but the original docstring says "the type of the file is xml" — maybe it's checking the file's content, not just the extension. However, without knowing how to check the actual content type, using the extension is the most straightforward approach. The user might have intended that.

But the problem says "the type of the file is xml" — perhaps the function is supposed to check the actual file content. However, without knowing how to do that, it's hard. Maybe the user just wants to check the extension. So, proceed with that.

Another thing: the function is named _eval_file, which suggests it's a helper function. The parameters are prefix and file_path. The component_id is derived from the prefix. So the code uses the prefix as the component_id.

So, the code would be as above. Now, testing the example:

If file_path is 'prefix_report.xml', then the prefix is in the file_path. The extension is .xml → return None.

If file_path is 'prefix_data.pdf', then return {'component_id': 'prefix', 'file_path': 'prefix_data.pdf'}.

If file_path is 'prefix_data.txt', then return {'component_id': 'prefix', 'file_path': 'prefix_data.txt', 'ftype': 'txt'}.

This seems to fit the docstring. However, the original docstring says that for non-PDF, the dict includes component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again. That's probably a mistake. But since the user's instruction is to follow the docstring, maybe I should include that. But that would be a mistake in the code. However, the user might have intended that.

Wait, the original docstring says:

"return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type of the file is "pdf", return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path if the type of the file is not "pdf"."

So for non-PDF, the keys are component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again. That would be redundant. But perhaps the user meant that for non-PDF, the dict includes component_id, file_path, and ftype. So the last part is a typo. Therefore, the code should return a dict with component_id, file_path, and ftype for non-PDF.

Thus, the code would be as I wrote earlier, using os.path.splitext.

Another thing: the function returns None if the file doesn't match the prefix OR is XML. So, the order is: first check if prefix is in file_path. If not, return None. Then check if the file is XML. If yes, return None. Otherwise, proceed.

So, the code is correct.

Now, code:

import os

def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):
    """
    Identify the type of the given file. Return None if the file do not match the given prefix or the type of the file is xml. Return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type of the file is "pdf", return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path if the type of the file is not "pdf".
    """
    if prefix not in file_path:
        return None
    # Determine file type
    _, ext = os.path.splitext(file_path)
    ext = ext.lower()
    if ext == '.xml':
        return None
    if ext == '.pdf':
        return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path}
    else:
        return {'component_id': prefix, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': ext}

But the docstring says for non-PDF, return a dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again. That would be duplicate keys. But that's not possible. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and the intended keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. Therefore, the code is as above.

Another possible issue: the prefix check. If the prefix is a substring of the file path, but maybe it's supposed to be the beginning. Like, the file path starts with the prefix. For example, if prefix is 'data', and the file path is 'data_report.pdf', then it's a match. But if the file path is 'report_data.pdf', then the prefix is in the path, but maybe it's not supposed to be. However, the docstring says "if the file do not match the given prefix", which is ambiguous. The code uses 'prefix in file_path' which checks for substring presence. But if the user intended to check if the file path starts with the prefix, then the code should be file_path.startswith(prefix). However, without clarification, it's hard to know. But the original docstring says "do not match the given prefix", which could mean that the prefix is not part of the file path. But the code as written checks if the prefix is present in the file path. If that's not the case, return None.

But maybe the prefix is a component ID that's part of the file name. For example, the file name is something like 'component_123_file.pdf', and the prefix is 'component_123'. Then, checking if prefix is in the file_path would work. However, if the prefix is a directory path, like '/components/data/', then checking if it's a substring would be correct.

But again, without more info, the code uses the 'in' operator. So that's acceptable.

So, the code should be as written above. Now, the user said not to include any explanation, just the code in Python markdown format. So the final answer is the code with the docstring as given.
