Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me look at the problem again.

The function is called plugins_manager and it takes a single argument, cls. The docstring says that this function gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

So, I need to write a function that calls a method or attribute on cls._get_service(). The method name isn't specified, but the attribute is ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. 

Wait, in Python, when you have a class with a class variable like ServiceName, you can access it using cls.ServiceName. But here, the function is supposed to get it via _get_service(). So perhaps _get_service() returns another object that has the ServiceName attribute.

Alternatively, maybe _get_service() returns a service object that has a method or attribute called get_service_manager or something similar. But the docstring specifically mentions using ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to call a method on the service retrieved from _get_service(), and that method is named after ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. Or perhaps it's an attribute.

Wait, the function is named plugins_manager and it's supposed to get the plugin manager. So perhaps the code should be something like:

return cls._get_service().get_plugin_manager()

But I'm not sure if get_plugin_manager is a method or an attribute. Alternatively, if ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER is an attribute on the service object, then it would be:

return cls._get_service().ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER

But the way the docstring is written, it says "gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So maybe the function is supposed to call a method on the service retrieved from _get_service(), and that method is named after ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER.

Wait, perhaps the service object has a method named get_plugin_manager(), which is called via _get_service().get_plugin_manager(). But the docstring says it's accessed via the attribute, so maybe it's an attribute.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The function is called plugins_manager, and the docstring says it gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). So perhaps the code is:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service().ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER

But wait, in Python, if ServiceName is a class-level variable, then it's accessed as cls.ServiceName. But if _get_service() returns an instance, then perhaps it's instance.ServiceName.

Wait, maybe the service is retrieved via cls._get_service(), which returns a service object. Then, that service object has an attribute named after ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. So the code would be:

service = cls._get_service()
plugin_manager = service.ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER

But how is ServiceName defined? It's unclear, but perhaps it's a constant or a class attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to call a method on the service. For example, if the service has a method get_plugin_manager(), then it would be:

return cls._get_service().get_plugin_manager()

But the docstring says it's accessed via the attribute, so maybe it's better to use an attribute.

I think the most straightforward way is to assume that the service object has an attribute named ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER. So the code would be:

def plugins_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service().ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER

But wait, in Python, if ServiceName is a class-level name, then it's accessed as cls.ServiceName, but if _get_service() returns an instance, then it's instance.ServiceName.

Alternatively, maybe the service object has a method named get_plugin_manager(), so the code would be:

return cls._get_service().get_plugin_manager()

But without more context, it's hard to be certain. However, the docstring specifically says "gets the plugin manager via ServiceName.PLUGINS_MANAGER in cls._get_service()", which suggests that it's an attribute of the service retrieved via _get_service().

So I'll proceed with that assumption.
