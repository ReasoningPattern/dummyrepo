Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called generate_default_observer_schema and takes an app parameter. The docstring says it generates the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource in spec.manifest where a custom observer schema isn't specified. 

First, I need to figure out how to access the Kubernetes resources. The spec.manifest probably contains the manifest files for different resources. But I'm not sure exactly how the app is structured. Maybe the app has a way to access these manifests, like a dictionary or a list.

The function's purpose is to generate a default schema. So, perhaps it's creating a schema for each resource that's not already defined. The default schema might be a template or a base structure that can be customized later.

I need to think about how to implement this. Maybe the function iterates over the resources in spec.manifest, checks if a custom schema exists for each, and if not, generates a default one. But how to represent the schema?

Assuming that the spec.manifest is a dictionary where keys are resource names and values are the manifests. For each resource, the function would check if there's a custom schema in a specific location, like a config file or a database. If not found, generate a default schema.

But since the problem doesn't provide specific details about the spec.manifest structure or the location of custom schemas, I need to make assumptions. Maybe the function is part of a larger system where the app has access to these resources.

In Python, to generate a default schema, perhaps the function creates a dictionary or a class that represents the schema. For example, a class with attributes like 'name', 'fields', 'required', etc.

But the exact structure of the schema isn't specified, so the code might need to be generic. Maybe the function returns a dictionary of default schemas for each resource.

Wait, the function's docstring mentions "each Kubernetes resource present in spec.manifest". So, the function is supposed to process each resource in that manifest and generate a default schema for them if none exists.

So, the code would:

1. Iterate over each resource in spec.manifest.
2. For each resource, check if a custom schema exists (maybe in a config or a database).
3. If not, generate a default schema and store it.

But how to implement this in code? Let's think about the steps.

First, the function needs to access the spec.manifest. Let's assume that spec.manifest is a dictionary where each key is a resource name, and the value is the manifest data. For example, maybe it's a list of resources, or a dictionary with resource names as keys.

Then, for each resource in spec.manifest, check if a custom schema exists. Suppose the custom schemas are stored in a separate structure, like a dictionary called custom_schemas. If the resource is not in custom_schemas, generate a default one.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's say that the custom_schemas is a dictionary where the keys are resource names and the values are the custom schemas.

So, the code would look something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    # Assume spec.manifest is a dictionary of resources
    # Assume custom_schemas is a dictionary of existing schemas
    default_schemas = {}
    for resource in spec.manifest:
        if resource not in custom_schemas:
            # Generate default schema for this resource
            default_schema = generate_default_schema(resource)
            default_schemas[resource] = default_schema
    return default_schemas

But the problem is that the function is part of an app, and the app's structure is not specified. The function's parameters include 'app', which might be an instance of a class that has access to these resources.

Wait, the function's docstring says "for each Kubernetes resource present in spec.manifest for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified." So, the app might have a way to access the spec.manifest and the custom_schemas.

But since the code is to be generated, I need to write the function as per the given signature and docstring.

The function's return type is not specified, but the docstring says it generates the default schema, so probably returns a dictionary of schemas.

So, the code would involve:

- Iterating over the resources in spec.manifest.
- Checking if a custom schema exists for each.
- If not, generate a default one.

But how to generate the default schema? The function needs to create a structure for the schema. Maybe a class or a dictionary.

Assuming that the default schema is a dictionary with keys like 'name', 'fields', 'required', etc.

But without knowing the exact structure, I'll have to create a generic example.

Perhaps the function returns a dictionary where each key is a resource name and the value is a dictionary representing the default schema.

So, the code could be:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    # Assume spec.manifest is a dictionary of resources
    # Assume custom_schemas is a dictionary of existing schemas
    default_schemas = {}
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if resource not in app.custom_schemas:
            # Generate default schema for this resource
            default_schema = {
                'name': resource,
                'fields': [],
                'required': []
            }
            default_schemas[resource] = default_schema
    return default_schemas

But this is just a sample. The actual implementation would depend on the specific structure of the app and the spec.manifest.

However, the problem requires generating code based on the given function signature and docstring, not implementing the actual logic. So, the code should be written in a way that follows the function's signature and docstring.

The function's parameters are 'app', which is likely an object that has attributes like spec.manifest and custom_schemas.

So, the code would look something like:

def generate_default_observer_schema(app):
    """
    Generate the default observer schema for each Kubernetes resource present in ``spec.manifest`` for which a custom observer schema hasn't been specified.
    """
    default_schemas = {}
    for resource in app.spec.manifest:
        if resource not in app.custom_schemas:
            # Generate default schema for this resource
            default_schema = {
                'name': resource,
                'fields': [],
                'required': []
            }
            default_schemas[resource] = default_schema
    return default_schemas

But I need to make sure that the code is in Python and follows the structure. Also, the function is supposed to be part of the app, so the app has access to spec.manifest and custom_schemas.

Thus, the final code would be as above, but in Python syntax. The code should not include any explanations, reasoning, or markdown.
