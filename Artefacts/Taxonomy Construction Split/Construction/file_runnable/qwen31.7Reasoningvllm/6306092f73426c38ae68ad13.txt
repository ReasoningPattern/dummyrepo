Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the function.

The function is called ansible_playbook and takes several parameters: ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args. The docstring explains each parameter's purpose.

First, I need to create a Python function that wraps the 'ansible-playbook' CLI. So, the function will likely use the subprocess module to run the Ansible playbook.

Wait, the parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, which are Infrared objects. But the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, so maybe those are just passed along and not used in the function body. The docstring mentions that the function wraps the CLI, so the actual execution would be via subprocess.

The parameters verbose, extra_vars, and ansible_args are passed as arguments. The function needs to handle these. The extra_vars is a dict, and ansible_args is a dict of arguments. So, the function will need to combine these into a single dictionary of arguments for the subprocess call.

So, the steps are:

1. Use subprocess to run the ansible-playbook command.
2. Pass the playbook_path as the playbook.
3. Handle the verbose level by setting the -v flag appropriately.
4. Pass the extra_vars as extra-vars.
5. Pass the ansible_args as additional arguments.

But how to structure the command line arguments? The ansible-playbook command can take various options. The function needs to combine the given parameters into the command line.

For example, the command would be something like:

ansible-playbook -v {verbose} {playbook_path} {extra_vars} {ansible_args}

But the exact way to combine these depends on how the parameters are passed. The function needs to merge the parameters into the command line.

So, the function will construct a list of arguments, including the playbook_path, and then pass them to subprocess.run.

Wait, the function's parameters include verbose, which is an integer. So, if verbose is None, it might default to 0. But the docstring says verbose is a parameter, so perhaps it's passed as an integer. But the function's parameters are defined with verbose as a parameter, so the code needs to handle that.

So, the code would need to construct the command line arguments. Let's think about how to do that.

The command line would be:

ansible-playbook {playbook_path} --extra-vars {extra_vars} {ansible_args} --verbose {verbose}

But the exact way to combine these depends on the parameters. The function needs to merge the parameters into the command line.

So, the code would construct a list of arguments, starting with the playbook_path, then adding the extra_vars as --extra-vars, then the ansible_args as --ansible-playbook-args, and then the verbose as --verbose.

But how to handle the parameters? The function's parameters are:

- playbook_path: the playbook to invoke
- verbose: Ansible verbosity level
- extra_vars: dict. Passed to Ansible as extra-vars
- ansible_args: dict of ansible-playbook arguments to plumb down directly to Ansible.

So, the function needs to combine these into the command line.

So, the code would:

- Start with the playbook_path.
- Add --extra-vars if extra_vars is not None.
- Add --ansible-playbook-args if ansible_args is not None.
- Add --verbose if verbose is not None.

But the exact way to combine these depends on how the parameters are passed. The function's parameters are passed as arguments, so the code would need to merge them into the command line.

So, the code would construct a list of arguments, starting with playbook_path, then adding the extra_vars as --extra-vars, then the ansible_args as --ansible-playbook-args, and then the verbose as --verbose.

But how to handle the parameters? For example, if extra_vars is a dict, then the code would need to convert it into a string like "--extra-vars var1=value1,var2=value2".

Similarly, ansible_args is a dict of arguments. So, for each key in ansible_args, the code would add --{key}={value}.

So, the code would:

- Initialize a list of arguments.
- Add playbook_path to the list.
- If extra_vars is not None, add "--extra-vars" followed by the serialized extra_vars.
- If ansible_args is not None, add "--ansible-playbook-args" followed by the serialized ansible_args.
- If verbose is not None, add "--verbose" followed by the verbosity level.

But wait, the function's parameters are:

- verbose: Ansible verbosity level. So, if it's None, maybe it's not included.

But the docstring says that verbose is a parameter, so the code needs to handle it.

So, the code would construct the arguments as follows:

args = [playbook_path]

if extra_vars is not None:
    args.append("--extra-vars")
    args.append(json.dumps(extra_vars))

if ansible_args is not None:
    args.append("--ansible-playbook-args")
    args.append(json.dumps(ansible_args))

if verbose is not None:
    args.append("--verbose")
    args.append(str(verbose))

But wait, the ansible-playbook command might have options that are passed as --option=value. So, the code would need to handle that.

But the function's parameters are passed as arguments, so the code would need to merge them into the command line.

So, the code would construct the command line as:

command = ["ansible-playbook"] + args

Then, run subprocess.run with that command.

But the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, so the code would need to handle the execution.

So, the code would be:

import subprocess
import json

def ansible_playbook(ir_workspace, ir_plugin, playbook_path, verbose=None,
                     extra_vars=None, ansible_args=None):
    """
    Wraps the 'ansible-playbook' CLI.

    :param ir_workspace: An Infrared Workspace object represents the active
    workspace
    :param ir_plugin: An InfraredPlugin object of the current plugin
    :param playbook_path: the playbook to invoke
    :param verbose: Ansible verbosity level
    :param extra_vars: dict. Passed to Ansible as extra-vars
    :param ansible_args: dict of ansible-playbook arguments to plumb down
    directly to Ansible.
    """
    # Construct the command arguments
    args = [playbook_path]
    
    if extra_vars is not None:
        args.append("--extra-vars")
        args.append(json.dumps(extra_vars))
    
    if ansible_args is not None:
        args.append("--ansible-playbook-args")
        args.append(json.dumps(ansible_args))
    
    if verbose is not None:
        args.append("--verbose")
        args.append(str(verbose))
    
    # Run the ansible-playbook command
    subprocess.run(["ansible-playbook"] + args, check=True)

Wait, but the function's parameters include ir_workspace and ir_plugin, which are Infrared objects. The docstring says that the function wraps the CLI, but the code doesn't use them. So, the code can just pass them along, but they are not used in the function body. So, the code can ignore them, but the function must accept them as parameters.

But the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, so the code would need to run the command with those parameters. However, the code as written doesn't use them. But the function is supposed to take them as parameters, so the code must include them in the command line. Wait, no. The function's parameters are passed, but the code doesn't use them. So, the code can ignore them, but the function must accept them.

But the function's parameters are passed, but the code doesn't use them. So, the code can just pass them along, but they are not used. However, the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, so the code must include them in the command line. Wait, no. The command line would be "ansible-playbook" followed by the playbook_path, and other parameters. The ir_workspace and ir_plugin are not part of the command line. So, the code can ignore them.

So, the code as written is correct. But the function's parameters are passed, but they are not used. However, the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, so the code must include them in the command line. Wait, no. The command line is just the playbook_path and the other parameters. The ir_workspace and ir_plugin are not part of the command line. So, the code can ignore them.

So, the code is correct as written. But the function's parameters are passed, but they are not used. However, the function is supposed to take them as parameters, so the code must include them in the function definition.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code must include the parameters, but the function body must not use them. So, the code is correct.

But wait, the function's parameters are passed, but the code doesn't use them. So, the code is correct.

Another thing to consider: the 'subprocess.run' call. The code uses 'check=True', which would raise an exception if the command fails. But the function is supposed to wrap the CLI, so it's okay.

So, the code as written should work.

But wait, the 'ansible-playbook' command may have options that are passed as --option=value. The code is adding the parameters as --extra-vars, --ansible-playbook-args, and --verbose. But the actual command line may require that the arguments are passed as --extra-vars var1=value1,var2=value2, etc. So, the code is correct in that.

So, the code is correct.
