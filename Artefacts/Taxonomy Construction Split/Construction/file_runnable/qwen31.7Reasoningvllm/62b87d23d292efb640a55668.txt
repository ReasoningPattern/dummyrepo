Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the get_config function as described. The function is supposed to return a new VersioneerConfig() and set various attributes on it. 

First, I remember that the VersioneerConfig class is part of the versioneer library. So I need to import that. But the user didn't mention it, so I should include the import statement.

Wait, the function is called get_config, and it returns a new VersioneerConfig(). So the code would start by importing VersioneerConfig from the appropriate module. Let me check the standard way. Usually, it's imported as from versioneer import VersioneerConfig.

Then, the function creates a new instance of VersioneerConfig. So the code would be something like:

from versioneer import VersioneerConfig

def get_config():
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    # Set various attributes here
    return config

But the problem is, the docstring says "set various attribute of it". The user didn't specify which attributes, so I need to assume that the function will set some common ones. Maybe the default ones like version, release, etc.?

Wait, the VersioneerConfig class has attributes like version, release, etc. So perhaps the function is supposed to set those. But since the user didn't specify which attributes, maybe the code should set some common ones. For example, setting version to '1.0.0', release to True, etc.

But the user's instruction says "do not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated". So I need to generate the code that creates the config and sets some attributes. But since the attributes are not specified, maybe the code should set the default ones?

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the function sets the attributes that are commonly used. For example, setting version, release, and other parameters.

But without knowing exactly which attributes, perhaps the code should set the version, release, and other common ones. Let me think. The VersioneerConfig class has a __init__ method that takes parameters like version, release, etc. So maybe the code would set those.

So the code would be:

from versioneer import VersioneerConfig

def get_config():
    config = VersioneerConfig(version='1.0.0', release=True)
    return config

But maybe the user wants more attributes. However, since the problem statement doesn't specify, I should include the most common ones. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to set the attributes that are typically used in versioning, like version, release, and maybe others.

But since the user didn't specify, perhaps the code should just create the config and return it, assuming that the attributes are set as needed. However, the docstring says "set various attribute of it", so the function must set some attributes. But without knowing which, maybe the code should set the version and release.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set the attributes that are part of the VersioneerConfig class. For example, setting the version, release, and other parameters.

But since the user didn't specify, perhaps the code should include some common attributes. Let me check the VersioneerConfig class. The __init__ method has parameters like version, release, and others. So perhaps the code would set those.

So the code would be:

from versioneer import VersioneerConfig

def get_config():
    config = VersioneerConfig(version='1.0.0', release=True)
    return config

But maybe the user wants more attributes. However, since the problem statement doesn't specify, this is the best approach. So the code would create a new VersioneerConfig instance with some default attributes.
