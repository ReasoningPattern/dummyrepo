Okay, I need to generate Python code for the get_spec_defaults method based on the provided docstring. The function's purpose is to resolve argument values from the spec and other sources using self._get_defaults(). Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the method is part of a class since it has 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring mentions using self._get_defaults(), so I should check if that method exists. But since I'm only generating the code for get_spec_defaults, I'll assume _get_defaults is properly implemented elsewhere in the class.

The function's goal is to process the spec to get default values. Maybe the spec is a dictionary or some data structure that defines the parameters and their defaults. The method should probably iterate over the parameters in the spec, retrieve their default values using _get_defaults, and then return those resolved values.

Wait, how exactly does the spec look? Since I don't have more details, I'll have to make some assumptions. Let's say the spec has a list or dictionary of parameters. For each parameter, we might check if it has a default specified in the spec, and if not, use _get_defaults to find it from other sources like environment variables or config files.

Alternatively, maybe the spec already includes all necessary information, and get_spec_defaults just needs to extract the defaults. But the mention of "other sources" suggests combining the spec with external data. So perhaps the _get_defaults function is called to fetch any missing defaults.

Hmm, the function's name is get_spec_defaults, so maybe it returns the default values for all the parameters in the spec. The logic could be: loop through each parameter in the spec, determine its default value, possibly by looking in the spec first and then other sources if needed. Then collect all those into a dictionary or similar structure.

Let me outline possible steps. Inside get_spec_defaults:

1. Initialize a dictionary to hold the resolved defaults.
2. Iterate over each parameter in the spec. The exact structure of the spec isn't clear, but maybe it's something like a list of param names, or each param has a 'default' key.
3. For each parameter, check if the spec provides a default. If not, use self._get_defaults() to find it.
4. Store the found value in the dictionary.
5. Return the dictionary.

Wait, but how exactly does self._get_defaults() work? Maybe it's a helper method that can retrieve defaults from various places. The function might need to pass the parameter name to _get_defaults. Let me see. The code structure would need to loop through the parameters in the spec, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the spec is a dictionary where each key is a parameter name, and each value is another dictionary containing the parameter's details like type, default, etc. So for each param in spec, we look for a 'default' key. If present, use that. Else, call self._get_defaults() for that param.

Wait, but the docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources", so maybe the _get_defaults() is the one that looks in other sources. So perhaps the process is: first, collect all the default values from the spec, then merge them with those from other sources via _get_defaults. Or maybe it's the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps get_spec_defaults is supposed to combine the spec's default values with those obtained from other default sources. Maybe the _get_defaults() method can take a parameter name and return the default from wherever it's found, prioritizing the spec first?

Without more context, I'll have to make a reasonable assumption. Let's think of a common scenario where a function parses a spec (like a CLI tool or a configuration parser). The method might go through each parameter in the spec and for each, determine the default value by first checking the spec, and if not present, use the _get_defaults() function.

Alternatively, maybe the spec itself contains the parameters, and the _get_defaults() is called to get the actual values. For example, the spec lists parameters with their names and possible default sources, and the method resolves those sources into actual values.

But the problem is to generate code based on the given docstring. The doc is brief, so I need to code a function that does exactly what's described. Let me start with the skeleton.

The function starts with def get_spec_defaults(self): and the docstring. Then, perhaps the code is as simple as calling self._get_defaults() and returning the result. But that might not be the case. The doc says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()". So maybe the method processes the spec, using _get_defaults to get the defaults for each argument.

Wait, maybe the spec is an object or a structure that has parameters, and for each parameter in the spec, the method needs to get its default value, possibly by first looking in the spec, and if not found, then using _get_defaults(). Or perhaps the _get_defaults() already takes into account the spec and other sources, so get_spec_defaults just calls that.

Alternatively, maybe get_spec_defaults is supposed to return the default values as specified in the spec, but the _get_defaults() is a helper to resolve those. For instance, if the spec has a 'default' value as a string, like "env:VAR", then _get_defaults would parse that and get the actual value from the environment variable.

In that case, the method would loop through each parameter in the spec, check its default value, and then resolve it using _get_defaults. So the code might look like this:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    defaults = {}
    for param in self.spec:  # assuming self.spec is the spec data
        spec_default = param.get('default', None)
        if spec_default is not None:
            # maybe resolve it here using _get_defaults
            resolved = self._get_defaults(spec_default)
            defaults[param['name']] = resolved
        else:
            # get from other sources via _get_defaults
            defaults[param['name']] = self._get_defaults(param['name'])
    return defaults

But the problem is that the actual structure of the spec isn't known. Maybe the parameters are stored in a list under self.spec['parameters'], so I need to loop through that. Alternatively, maybe the spec is a dictionary where each key is the parameter name and the value is a dictionary with its attributes.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to call self._get_defaults() and that's it. But the doc mentions resolving from the spec and other sources, so the _get_defaults() probably takes the spec into account. Maybe the get_spec_defaults is a thin wrapper that uses the spec to determine which parameters to get defaults for.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() method returns a dictionary of defaults, and get_spec_defaults filters that based on the spec. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is straightforward, like returning self._get_defaults(), but that might not involve the spec. The problem states that the function should resolve from the spec and other sources using that method. So maybe the method uses the spec as an argument to _get_defaults()?

Wait, the function's name is get_spec_defaults, so maybe it's supposed to get defaults specifically from the spec and other sources. The _get_defaults() function could be a helper that knows to look into the spec and other places.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is simply:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But that might not involve the spec. Hmm. The problem says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()". So the _get_defaults function is used to do the actual resolving. The get_spec_defaults method's job is to call that function and perhaps process the results based on the spec's parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() method is passed the spec, so the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults(self.spec)

But again, without knowing the exact structure, I have to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the method iterates over each parameter in the spec, and for each parameter's default value, it uses _get_defaults to resolve it. For example, if the default is a reference to another source, then _get_defaults would handle that.

Suppose the spec is a list of dictionaries, each with a 'name' and 'default' field. The default could be a string like "env:VAR" or "config:section.key". Then, for each parameter in the spec, we check if the default is present, and if so, resolve it using _get_defaults. If not, maybe use another default.

Alternatively, the _get_defaults() method might take a parameter name and return the default from wherever it's found. So the code would loop through each parameter in the spec, get their names, and call self._get_defaults on each name to get the value.

Wait, perhaps the spec contains all the parameters, and the method needs to go through each parameter in the spec and call self._get_defaults() for each, then collect those into a dictionary.

So the code might be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    defaults = {}
    for param in self.spec:  # assuming self.spec is a list of parameters
        name = param['name']
        default_value = self._get_defaults(name)
        defaults[name] = default_value
    return defaults

But maybe the spec already has some defaults, so we need to prioritize those. Like first check if the parameter's spec has a default, then use that, otherwise call the _get_defaults function. Or maybe the _get_defaults function already checks the spec first.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to combine the default from the spec with other sources. But how exactly?

Alternatively, perhaps the _get_defaults() method is designed to take the spec into account when determining the defaults, so get_spec_defaults just calls that method and returns the result. The doc says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()", so maybe the _get_defaults function is already handling the spec, so the code is as simple as:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But that's possible. But the doc mentions "arguments' values from spec and other sources", so maybe the _get_defaults() function requires the spec as an argument, but the method passes it.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() is a method that can be called without parameters, and it knows to look at the spec. So the code would just call it and return.

Alternatively, perhaps the code needs to loop through the parameters in the spec, and for each parameter, get its default from the spec, then if not found, look elsewhere via _get_defaults(). So something like:

defaults = {}
for param in self.spec:
    name = param['name']
    spec_default = param.get('default')
    if spec_default is not None:
        defaults[name] = spec_default
    else:
        defaults[name] = self._get_defaults(name)
return defaults

But this depends on how the spec is structured. Since the problem doesn't give more details, maybe the simplest approach is to assume that self._get_defaults() already takes care of resolving the defaults from the spec and other sources, so the method just calls it and returns the result. But then why the name get_spec_defaults? Maybe the _get_defaults() is called with the spec as an argument.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return {param: self._get_defaults(param) for param in self.spec.params}

Assuming that self.spec has a list of parameters, and for each, we call _get_defaults. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to return a dictionary of defaults from the spec and other sources. The _get_defaults() function might return a dictionary of all defaults, and the method can directly return that. So the code is just:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

But the docstring says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources", so perhaps the _get_defaults() is the one that does the work, and this method is just a pass-through. That would make sense. Then the code is straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() method is a helper that takes a parameter name and returns its value, so the get_spec_defaults loops through each parameter in the spec and collects their defaults via _get_defaults. So:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    defaults = {}
    for param in self.spec:  # assuming self.spec is a list of parameter names or objects
        name = param.get('name') or param  # depends on structure
        defaults[name] = self._get_defaults(name)
    return defaults

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard. Since the problem is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring, perhaps the simplest answer is to return the result of self._get_defaults(). That's possible if that method already takes the spec into account.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge the spec's defaults with those from other sources. Like, the spec might have some parameters with defaults, and others without, so the _get_defaults() gets the missing ones. So the code could be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    spec = self.spec
    defaults = {}
    for name, param in spec.items():
        if 'default' in param:
            defaults[name] = param['default']
        else:
            defaults[name] = self._get_defaults(name)
    return defaults

But again, depends on the spec's structure. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the correct approach is to assume that the method simply calls self._get_defaults() and returns that. Because the docstring says that the method uses that function to resolve the values from the spec and other sources, so maybe _get_defaults() does all the work.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to call _get_defaults and pass the spec. Like, the _get_defaults function takes the spec as an argument. But then the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults(self.spec)

But I don't know. The problem says "with self._get_defaults()", so perhaps the _get_defaults is the tool used, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is as simple as:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

Because the _get_defaults function is already designed to look into the spec and other sources. So the method is just a wrapper that calls it. The docstring says that the function resolves the arguments' values from the spec and other sources using that helper method. So maybe that's all it needs to do.

Alternatively, maybe the _get_defaults() returns a dictionary of defaults, and get_spec_defaults is just returning that. That makes sense.

Hmm, given the ambiguity, the best approach might be to write a function that iterates through parameters in the spec, using _get_defaults to get their default values. But without knowing the exact structure of self.spec, perhaps the code is as simple as returning the result of self._get_defaults(). Let me think of the minimal code that would make sense here.

Another possibility: the _get_defaults() method is supposed to be given the spec, so the code would pass the spec to it. But since the function's name is get_spec_defaults, maybe the _get_defaults function takes the spec into account when generating the defaults, so the code is:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

Alternatively, perhaps the code needs to collect the defaults from the spec first, then fill in any missing ones via _get_defaults(). But without knowing how the spec is structured, it's hard to code.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to call self._get_defaults() and that's it. Since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and the docstring says to use self._get_defaults(), perhaps the method just returns the result of that function. That's the simplest possible code and might be what is expected here.

Yes, perhaps that's the case. Let me check the docstring again. It says "Resolve arguments' values from spec and other sources with self._get_defaults()". So the _get_defaults() function is the one that does the resolving. Therefore, the method's code is just calling that function and returning the result.

Therefore, the code would be:

def get_spec_defaults(self):
    return self._get_defaults()

Wait, but the method's name is get_spec_defaults, which might imply that it's specifically using the spec. Maybe the _get_defaults() function is designed to take into account the spec, so when called, it knows to look there first. So the code is indeed just that one line.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is part of a class that has a spec attribute, and the _get_defaults() function uses that attribute internally. So the method doesn't need to do anything else except call it.

I think that's the most plausible answer here, given the limited information. The docstring says the function resolves using the spec and other sources via _get_defaults, so the method's code is simply returning the result of that helper function.
