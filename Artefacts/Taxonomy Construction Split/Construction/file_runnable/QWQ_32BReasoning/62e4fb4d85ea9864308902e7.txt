Okay, I need to write a Python function called normalize_cmd that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns another tuple of strings. The docstring says to "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form." Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Let me think about what that means.

So, the function's purpose is probably to ensure that the command given has the full path to the executable. If the first element of the tuple isn't a full path, maybe it should find the actual full path by searching the system's PATH. But then it mentions returning it in its original form. Wait, maybe it's about normalizing the path but then returning the entire command as a tuple, with the first element being the full path, and the rest as they were? Or perhaps it's about expanding any relative paths to absolute ones, especially for the executable part?

Let me consider some examples. Suppose the input cmd is ("python", "--version"), then the function should find the full path to the python executable, like "/usr/bin/python" or "C:\Python\python.exe" depending on the OS, and return that as the first element, followed by the other arguments. But how do I do that in Python?

The os module has some functions that can help here. Oh right, the shutil.which function can be used to find the full path of an executable given its name. So maybe for the first element of the tuple, if it's not already an absolute path, we use which to find the full path. If it can't be found, maybe leave it as is? Or raise an error? The problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps just leave it if not found.

Wait, the docstring says "complement the full path to exe". So complement as in complete it? So if the first element is just the executable name, like "python", then find its full path. But if it's already a full path, leave it as is. Then the rest of the arguments stay the same.

So the steps would be:

1. Check the first element of the cmd tuple. Let's call it the executable name.
2. Determine if it's an absolute path. If not, use shutil.which to find the full path.
3. Once we have the correct path for the executable, create a new tuple with that path as the first element, followed by the rest of the original elements.
4. Return this new tuple.

But wait, how do I check if a path is absolute? In Python, there's os.path.isabs() which returns True if the path is absolute. Also, for Windows, there might be some additional checks, but os.path should handle that cross-platform.

So the code would be something like:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd  # maybe handle empty tuples, but probably the function expects at least one element?
    exe_name = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(exe_name):
        # already absolute, check if it's an executable?
        # Or maybe just return as is?
        return cmd
    # else, find the full path using which
    full_path = shutil.which(exe_name)
    if full_path is None:
        # couldn't find the executable, so return the original?
        return cmd
    # replace the first element with full_path, then the rest as original
    new_cmd = (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
    return new_cmd

Wait, but the docstring says "return it in its original form". Maybe that means that after complementing the path, the rest of the arguments are kept the same. So the function only changes the first element if needed. That makes sense.

Wait, but what about cases where the executable is in the current directory, like "./myprogram"? The user might have provided a relative path. Should we expand that to an absolute path as well? Because isabs would return false for "./myprogram", but maybe the user intended to use a relative path. In that case, perhaps we need to check if the first element is a valid path, and if not, then search via which.

Alternatively, the function's purpose is to make sure that the first element is a full path. So any relative path (even if it's not just the name) would need to be resolved to the absolute path. Wait, but how?

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the command's first element is the executable's name without the full path, and we need to find the full path using the system's PATH. So for example, if the cmd is ("git", "commit"), then the first element becomes "/usr/bin/git" or wherever it is found. But if the first element is an absolute path, like "/usr/local/bin/python", then it stays as is. Also, if the first element is a relative path but not just the name (like "../bin/myexe"), then we need to check if that's an executable. If not, then use which to find it. But maybe the function only replaces the first element when it's not an absolute path, and then uses which to find the full path. If which can't find it, then leave it as original.

Wait, but what about if the first element is an absolute path but not an executable? The function's job might not be to check that, just to normalize the path. So the function's main task is to ensure the first element is a full path. So for the first element, if it's not an absolute path, find the full path via which. Then return that as the first element, followed by the rest.

Yes. So the code would be:

First, check if the first element is absolute. If not, use which to find the full path. If which returns a path, use that. Else, leave it as the original. Then combine the rest of the elements.

Wait, but what about if the first element is a relative path but the actual executable is at that path? Like "bin/python" where the path exists. Then we should check if that's an executable. Because shutil.which might not find it if it's a relative path. Because which searches the PATH directories, but a relative path isn't in the PATH. So in that case, the code as above would not resolve it correctly. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to first check if the first element is an absolute path. If it is, then check if it's executable. If not, perhaps leave it as is (but maybe the function is only concerned with adding the full path when necessary). Alternatively, perhaps the function just assumes that if the first element is not absolute, then it's just the name, so we need to find the full path via which. But if it is a relative path (like "myexe"), then which would search the PATH but not the current directory unless the PATH includes the current directory. Wait, on some systems, the PATH doesn't include current directory by default. So perhaps the function should also check if the executable exists at that relative path, or just rely on which?

Hmm. Maybe the function should first check if the first element is an absolute path. If it is, then leave it. If it's not, then use which to find the full path. But if the first element is a relative path that's not just the name, like "bin/program", then perhaps the user intended to use that relative path, so we need to check if that path is valid. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is only supposed to handle the case where the first element is just the executable's name (without any path), and in that case, find the full path. If it has any path (even relative), then it's left as is. Because the problem says "complement the full path to exe". So maybe the first element is a command without any path, so we need to find where it is in the PATH.

So for example, if the cmd is ("python", "arg1"), then the first element becomes the full path from which. But if the first element is "mydir/python", then since it has a path (even relative), the function leaves it as is unless it's not absolute. Wait, but "mydir/python" is a relative path. So should we check if that path is an executable?

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to ensure that the first element is the full path, whether it was given as a relative path or not. So for any first element that's not absolute, we try to find the full path via which. But if the first element is a relative path that's not in the PATH, then which won't find it. In that case, the function would return the original cmd, because it can't find the full path.

Alternatively, maybe the function should resolve relative paths to their absolute counterparts. Like, if the first element is "bin/myexe", then we can check if that's a valid executable, and if so, convert it to the absolute path. But that's more complicated.

The problem's docstring is a bit unclear. Let me read again: "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Maybe "complement" is a typo and should be "complete" the full path. So the function's goal is to replace the executable name with its full path, but leave the rest as they are. So the first element is the only one that might change.

In that case, the code would be as I first thought. So:

Check if first element is absolute. If not, use which to find the full path. If found, replace first element with full path. Else, leave it as original. Then return the new tuple.

So the code would be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe_name = cmd[0]
    if not os.path.isabs(exe_name):
        full_path = shutil.which(exe_name)
        if full_path:
            exe_name = full_path
    return (exe_name,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but in Python, tuples are immutable, so we have to create a new tuple. That's correct here. Also, the case where the first element is a relative path but which can't find it. Then we just return the original cmd.

Wait, the function's name is normalize_cmd. Maybe there are other normalizations, but according to the docstring, the main task is to complement the full path. So that's the main thing.

Another edge case: What if the first element is an absolute path but not an executable? The function doesn't check that, just returns the original. Because the problem says "complement the full path to exe", perhaps the function just adds the path if necessary, but doesn't validate whether it's actually an executable. Wait, but the which function returns the path only if it's an executable. So in the case where the first element is a relative path, but the actual executable is not found via which, then we leave it as is. But if the user provided a relative path that's correct, but not in the PATH, like "./python", then which would not find it. But in that case, the user might have intended to use the current directory. So maybe the function should check if the given path (even relative) is an executable, and if so, convert it to an absolute path?

Hmm, maybe I need to handle that. Let's think again.

Suppose the first element is "./python". That's a relative path. The function could check if that path is valid. For example, check if the file exists and is executable. If so, then the absolute path would be os.path.abspath("./python"). But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the function's job is to only handle cases where the first element is just the executable name (no path), then find the full path via which. Otherwise, leave it as is.

In that case, the code as before would work. So the function only changes the first element if it's not an absolute path. But in that case, the relative path like "bin/python" would not be resolved because it has a path component (so isabs would return false, but which might not find it if bin is not in the PATH. So perhaps that's a problem.

Wait, but the problem says "complement the full path to exe". So maybe the function is supposed to expand any relative paths to their absolute equivalents. Like, if the first element is a relative path, even with a directory, it should be converted to absolute?

But how? Let's see. For example, if the cmd is ("./script.py", "arg"), then the first element is a relative path. The function should check if that's an executable. If it is, then the absolute path would be the full path. So maybe the correct approach is to check if the first element is an absolute path. If not, then check if it's an executable by using os.access and which? Or perhaps just treat any non-absolute path as needing to be resolved via which.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should first check if the first element is an executable. If it's not an absolute path, then use which to find it. But if the path is relative but the executable exists there, then we can use the absolute path of that. Wait, maybe that's better. Let me think.

Suppose the first element is "bin/myexe". The path is relative, but if "bin/myexe" is an executable, then the absolute path would be os.path.abspath("bin/myexe"). So the function should check if the given executable (with the path) exists and is executable. If so, then use that absolute path, otherwise, use which to find it.

Hmm, that complicates things. The problem's description might not require that. Let me re-read the docstring again.

The docstring says "Complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". Maybe "complement" here means to complete, i.e., to add the full path if it's missing. So when the first element is just the name (no path), then find its full path. Otherwise, leave it as is. So the key is whether the first element has a path component. So, for example, if the first element is "python", then find the full path. But if it's "mydir/python", even if it's a relative path, then the function leaves it as is, assuming that the path is correct (maybe the user is passing a relative path that's correct in their context). But then, how does the function know whether the given path is valid? Maybe it doesn't, and just leaves it as is unless it's just the name.

Alternatively, maybe the function should expand any relative path to an absolute path, regardless of whether it has a directory component. Like, for "bin/python", it would resolve to the absolute path of "bin/python".

Hmm, that's a different interpretation. The problem's wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think of possible interpretations again.

The function's goal is to make sure that the first element of the command is the full path to the executable. So any relative path (even with directory) should be converted to an absolute path. For example, if the cmd is ("../bin/app", "arg"), then the first element becomes the absolute path of "../bin/app". But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function only adds the full path if the first element has no path, i.e., is just the executable name. Then, the code as before would work.

Given that the problem's description is a bit unclear, perhaps the intended solution is to use shutil.which on the first element if it's not an absolute path, and replace it with the full path if found. Otherwise, leave it as is. That's the simplest approach.

So, in code:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe = cmd[0]
    if not os.path.isabs(exe):
        full_path = shutil.which(exe)
        if full_path:
            exe = full_path
    return (exe,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but when using which, on a relative path like "bin/python", which would not find it because the PATH doesn't include the current directory. So in that case, the function would leave it as bin/python, which might not be the desired behavior. But perhaps the problem's requirement is only to handle the case where the first element is the bare name, not any relative path with directories.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants to ensure that the first element is the absolute path. So even if it's a relative path, we can convert it to an absolute path. For example, if the first element is "myexe", then find via which. If it's "bin/myexe", then check if that exists as an executable. If so, then get its absolute path. But how to do that?

Wait, for any first element (exe_name), whether it has a path or not, we can check if it's an executable. To do that, perhaps first check if it's an absolute path. If it is, then check if it's executable. If not, then use which. Or maybe even if it has a relative path, we can check if the file exists and is executable. But that's getting more complicated.

The problem's description might not require that. The simplest approach is to use which when the first element is not an absolute path. So the code I have above should work. Let's see some test cases.

Test case 1: cmd is ("python", "arg1"). The first element is not absolute. which finds it, say at /usr/bin/python. So returns that.

Test case 2: cmd is ( "/usr/bin/python", "arg1" ). The first element is absolute, so returns as is.

Test case 3: cmd is ("./python", "arg1"). The first element is a relative path. Since it has a directory (.), isabs would return False. Then which would look for the executable named "./python" in the PATH, which is unlikely. So the function would leave it as is, but maybe the user intended to use the current directory. In this case, the function isn't handling that, but perhaps the problem expects that. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the purpose. Perhaps the function should always return the absolute path of the first element, regardless of whether it's a relative or bare name. So for example, even if the first element is a relative path like "bin/python", the function should check if that's an executable, and if so, return the absolute path. If it's not an executable, then maybe look in the PATH?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to expand the first element to its absolute path if possible, otherwise leave it. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the first element is treated as the executable's name, and the function must find its full path via which. But then, if the first element has a path (even a relative one), it's left as is. Because the presence of a path indicates that it's already a full path (maybe relative to the current directory), so the function doesn't need to do anything.

Wait, but a relative path is still a path. So maybe the function only changes the first element when it's just the name (no path components), and leaves it alone if it has any path (even relative). So in that case, the code above works.

Another test case: cmd is ("../myapp", "arg"). Since "../myapp" has a directory component, isabs would return false (since it's a relative path). But which would search for "myapp" in the PATH, not the path given as "../myapp". So in this case, the function would not find the full path, so leave the first element as "../myapp".

But the user might have intended that the "../myapp" is the correct path. So perhaps the function should just return the original in that case.

Hmm, maybe the problem is only about adding the full path when the executable is in the system's PATH. So if the first element is a relative path that's not in the PATH, then it stays. So the code is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the function should first check if the first element is an executable file, using os.access. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the function should check if the first element is an absolute path. If it is, then check if it's an executable. If not, then return the original (since maybe the path is incorrect, but the function can't do anything else). If the first element is not an absolute path, then try to find it via which. So:

But the problem's docstring doesn't mention handling invalid paths. So perhaps the function just does the best it can by using which for non-absolute paths, and leaves it as is if not found.

Yes, I think that's the intended approach here.

So the code would be as I wrote before. Let's also think about possible exceptions. Like, if the cmd is empty, but the problem probably expects that it's at least a single element. So the code first checks if the tuple is empty, returns it. Otherwise proceeds.

Another case: the first element is a full path but not an executable. The function leaves it as is. Because it's not the function's job to check if it's an executable, just to find the full path if possible.

Wait, but in the case where the first element is a non-absolute path but the actual executable is in the current directory. Like, the command is ("python3", "arg"), and there's a python3 in the current directory. But which may not find it if the current directory isn't in the PATH. So in that case, the function would return the original, but the user might expect that the absolute path is found.

Hmm, perhaps the function should check both possibilities: first check if the given path (even with no directory) exists in the current directory, then in the PATH. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function should first check if the first element is an absolute path, and if it is, then check if it exists. If it does, then return it. If it's not an absolute path, then use which. But that's adding more checks.

The problem's description is a bit vague, but the most straightforward solution is to use shutil.which for non-absolute paths. So proceed with that code.

Wait, but in Python, the shutil.which function returns the absolute path of the executable. So if the first element is "python" and which finds it, then the returned path is absolute. So the code would handle that.

Yes, so that code would work. Let me code that.

Also, note that the function returns a tuple. So after modifying the first element, we can create a new tuple with the first element as the new exe, then the rest of the elements from the original cmd.

The code:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe = cmd[0]
    if not os.path.isabs(exe):
        full_path = shutil.which(exe)
        if full_path:
            exe = full_path
    return (exe,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but what if the first element is a relative path that is an executable? Like, "bin/app" exists in the current directory. Then shutil.which("bin/app") would return None because it's looking for "bin/app" in the PATH, which doesn't include the current directory unless it's in the PATH. So in this case, the function would not change it, but the user might have wanted to get the absolute path of "bin/app".

Hmm, so maybe the code is missing that case. The function should first check if the first element is an executable (regardless of path). For example, check if the file at the given path exists and is executable. If so, then just take its absolute path. Otherwise, proceed to search via which.

Ah, right! So the code above is not handling the case where the first element has a relative path that is valid. Let's think again.

Perhaps the correct approach is to first check if the given first element is a valid executable (even if it's a relative path). So:

Check if the first element is an absolute path. If not, check if it's an executable by checking if it exists and is executable. How?

Wait, to check if a path is executable, you can use os.access(path, os.X_OK). But that requires that the path is correct. So:

For the first element:

if it's not absolute:

   check if it's an executable (i.e., the path exists and is executable). If yes, then use the absolute path of that (os.path.abspath(exe)), else, use which to find it.

Wait, but how to check that? Let me see.

Let me outline steps again:

First element is exe_name.

If it's absolute:

   check if it's an executable. If yes, then return it as first element. If not, then perhaps the function can't do anything, so leave it as is?

Wait, the problem says "complement the full path to exe". So maybe the function is only supposed to find the full path if it's missing. So if the first element is a relative path, but it's a valid executable (exists and is executable), then the function should return the absolute path of that. Otherwise, search via which.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to always return the absolute path of the first element, whether it's found via the given path or via the PATH. So:

Check the first element's path. If it's absolute, check if it exists. If so, use it. If not, then try to find via which.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. The problem's docstring is short, so perhaps the intended solution is to simply use shutil.which on the first element if it's not absolute, and replace it with the full path if found. Otherwise, leave it as is. So the code I had earlier is correct.

Because, for example, if the user provides a relative path like "bin/app" which is not in the PATH, then the function can't find it via which, so leaves it as "bin/app". But the actual full path would be something like "/current/directory/bin/app". So maybe the function should also handle converting the relative path to absolute even if it's not in the PATH?

Hmm, perhaps the problem requires that any relative path is converted to absolute. For example, if the first element is a relative path, then the function should return the absolute version of it (without checking if it's executable). But that's different from the original problem's wording.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to expand any relative path to its absolute form, but only if the executable exists. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the function's job is simply to find the full path of the executable (the first element) by using which, but only when the first element is not already an absolute path. So the code I wrote earlier is correct.

I think that's the way to go. Let's proceed with that code.

Wait, but in the case where the first element is a relative path to an existing executable, like "myexe" in the current directory, then which might not find it unless the current directory is in the PATH. So the code would return the original "myexe", but the actual absolute path is possible. So maybe the function should first try to see if the given path (even relative) is valid. Like:

Check if the first element is an absolute path. If not, check if the file exists and is executable. If yes, then return the absolute path. If not, then use which.

Wait, that's a better approach. Let me think:

So:

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe_name = cmd[0]
    if os.path.isabs(exe_name):
        # check if the executable exists. If not, maybe return original?
        # Or just return as is?
        return cmd
    else:
        # check if the path (exe_name) exists as a file and is executable
        # first, get the absolute path of the given name (assuming it's a relative path)
        possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe_name)
        if os.path.exists(possible_path) and os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK):
            # then the full path is possible_path
            return (possible_path,) + cmd[1:]
        else:
            # search via which
            full_path = shutil.which(exe_name)
            if full_path:
                return (full_path,) + cmd[1:]
            else:
                # can't find, so return original cmd
                return cmd

Wait, but this is more complex. The problem's docstring is a bit unclear, but maybe that's what's needed. Let's see.

The problem says "complement the full path to exe". So if the first element is a relative path (like "myexe"), then the function should find the full path, even if it's in the current directory. But the current directory isn't in the PATH, so which wouldn't find it. So in this case, the function would return the original, unless the user's current directory is part of the PATH. But maybe the function should check if the file exists at the given relative path, and if so, convert it to absolute. That's better.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to first check if the first element's path (as a relative path) exists and is executable. If so, then use the absolute path of that. Else, use which to find it in the PATH. So combining both steps.

So the code would be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe = cmd[0]
    if not os.path.isabs(exe):
        # Check if the file exists as a relative path and is executable
        possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe)
        if os.path.exists(possible_path) and os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK):
            exe = possible_path
        else:
            # Not found locally, search in PATH
            full_path = shutil.which(exe)
            if full_path:
                exe = full_path
    return (exe,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but that's more involved. Does the problem require that? The original docstring says "complement the full path to exe". So perhaps the first element is just the name, and the function must find the full path. But if the first element is a relative path like "bin/app", then the function would first check if that path (relative to current directory) is executable. If so, then use the absolute path. Otherwise, search via which.

Yes, that seems better. Because that way, even relative paths that are valid are expanded to absolute.

So this code would handle that. Let me think through some cases.

Case 1: cmd is ("python", "arg") → which finds /usr/bin/python. So returns that as first element.

Case 2: cmd is ("./python", "arg") → possible_path is current directory's ./python. If it's executable, then the first element becomes the absolute path. Otherwise, which would search for "./python" in the PATH (which probably won't find it). So in that case, if the file exists and is executable, then the first element is replaced with its absolute path.

Case 3: cmd is ("bin/app", "arg") → possible_path is absolute path of bin/app. If that exists and is executable, then it's used. If not, then which looks for "app" in the PATH.

Hmm, but that would change the behavior. For example, if the user intended to run bin/app which is in their current directory, then possible_path would be correct. But if the user's current directory is not where bin/app is, then it might not work. Wait, no, because possible_path is the absolute path of the given string. So if the first element is "bin/app", then possible_path is the absolute path from the current working directory where the script is run. But maybe that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function should treat the first element as the executable name (without any path) when it's not absolute. So the code I first had would be better. Because in case 3 where the first element is "bin/app", which is a relative path, but not an absolute path, the code would first check if "bin/app" exists (as a file) and is executable. If so, then use that. But if the first element is "bin/app", then possible_path is the absolute path to that. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps that's the right approach. So the code I have now would handle that.

But what if the user provided a relative path that's not in the current directory but elsewhere? Like, "some/other/dir/app" which is a relative path. The possible_path would be absolute, but maybe that's correct. The function would check if that absolute path is valid. If it is, then use it, else try to find via which.

Hmm, that's probably better. Because the function is trying to find the actual executable path, whether it's in the current directory or in the PATH. So this code would do that.

But the problem's docstring says "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". The original form would mean that the rest of the arguments are unchanged. So the code seems okay.

Wait, but in the case where the first element is a relative path that's not in the current directory, but exists in another location. Like, the user is in a directory where "bin/app" is not present, but there is an executable named "app" in the PATH. Then the function would first check the possible_path (current directory's bin/app, which doesn't exist), then look via which for "app", find it in the PATH, and replace the first element with that full path.

Yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler. Maybe the function only needs to prepend the full path if the first element is just the name (no path). So in that case, the first code is okay, but the second approach is more thorough.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me see the problem again. The function is called normalize_cmd. The docstring says "complement the full path to exe and return it in its original form". So the "original form" might mean that the rest of the arguments are kept as they are, but the first element is replaced with its full path.

So perhaps the correct code is:

Check if the first element is an absolute path. If yes, leave it. If not, then check if it's an executable in the current directory (using abspath and then checking existence and permissions). If yes, use that absolute path. Otherwise, use which to find it in the PATH. If found, use that. Else, leave as original.

But how to code that?

Wait, the possible_path is the absolute path of the given exe name. So if the given exe is "python", possible_path would be the current directory's absolute path plus "python". But that might not exist. So we first check if that exists and is executable. If yes, then it's the correct path. Otherwise, use which.

Wait, but the user might have intended that the first element is a relative path like "bin/app" which is in their current directory. So the code would check if bin/app exists and is executable. If yes, then use the absolute path. So that would handle that case.

So the code I wrote in the second version seems better. Let me adjust that.

Wait, in the code above, for the case where the first element is a relative path with a directory (like "bin/app"), the code would first compute possible_path as the absolute path of that. So, if the user is in a directory where "bin/app" is present and executable, then it would use that. If not, then it would try to find "app" via which (since the else clause uses the base name? Wait no, in that code, when the first element is "bin/app" (a relative path with a directory), then possible_path is the absolute path of "bin/app", which is correct. But the else clause would then do shutil.which(exe) where exe is "bin/app" (the original name). Which would search for "bin/app" in the PATH, which is probably not there, so returns None, so then the function leaves it as the original. But that's okay, since the path might not exist.

Wait, but in this case, the code would check if the given path (as a relative path) is valid. So for "bin/app", the code would check if that's an executable. If yes, then use its absolute path. Otherwise, try to find via which using "bin/app" as the name, which probably won't find anything. So the original cmd is returned.

But in reality, if the user intended to run "bin/app" which exists in the current directory, then the function would return the absolute path. So that's correct.

But the problem may not require that, but given the wording, I think that's the right approach.

So the code would be as follows.

Wait, but the code in the second version:

The exe variable is cmd[0], which is a relative path. The possible_path is its absolute path. If that exists and is executable, then we use that. Else, try to find via which, using the original exe name (without path). Wait, no, in the else clause, the code uses shutil.which(exe). So if the original exe was "bin/app", then which is searching for "bin/app" in the PATH. Which is unlikely, unless there's an executable named "bin/app" in the PATH. But that's probably not the case. So in that scenario, the function would leave it as the original.

Alternatively, maybe when the first element has a path (like "bin/app"), then the code should not try to find via which. Because the user provided a path, so the function should just check if that path is valid. If not, then perhaps it's an error, but the function can't do anything else. So the code is correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is expecting that only the first element is a simple executable name, and the function should find the full path via which. So in that case, the first code is better. But given the problem's description, perhaps the second approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants to ensure that the first element is a full path, so any relative path (even with a directory) is converted to an absolute path. But that's different. Because even if the user provides a relative path, the function can just convert it to absolute, regardless of whether it's executable. But then the function would return the absolute path even if the file doesn't exist. But that's not part of the problem's description. The problem says "complement the full path to exe". So the first element must be an executable. So perhaps the code should check whether the given first element (if not absolute) can be found via which, but if it has a directory component (like "bin/app"), then the code should check that path as is (converting to absolute) first.

Hmm, maybe that's the case. So the code I have in the second version is better. Let me try to code that again.

Wait, in the code above, for a first element like "bin/app", the possible_path is the absolute path of "bin/app". Then, if that exists and is executable, then the first element becomes that absolute path. Otherwise, the code tries to find the executable named "bin/app" via which (which would probably not find it, unless there's an executable with that name in the PATH). So in that case, the original "bin/app" remains.

But in that scenario, if the user is in a directory where "bin/app" exists, then the function would return its absolute path. But if the user is not in that directory, but the first element is a relative path, then the function might not find it. But the function can't know the current directory unless it's using the current working directory. So that's correct.

Therefore, the code is correct. Let me code that.

Wait, but the code's logic:

if not isabs(exe):

   possible_path = abspath(exe)

   if possible_path exists and is executable → use that as the new first element.

   else → search via which with the original exe name (not the possible path). Wait, no. The code uses shutil.which(exe) where exe is the original cmd[0], which is "bin/app". So that would look for "bin/app" in the PATH. Which is probably not the case. So perhaps in that case, the code should split the exe into name and path? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The first element could be a name (without path) or a relative path (with directories). The function's job is to find the full path to the executable. So for the first element:

- If it's an absolute path, then check if it exists and is executable. If yes, use it. If not, perhaps the function can't do anything, so return the original?

Wait, but the problem says to "complement the full path to exe". So perhaps the function is supposed to return the full path only if the first element is not a full path. But regardless of whether it's found via local path or via which.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is:

For the first element, if it's not an absolute path, then:

   check if it's an executable in the current directory (as a relative path). If so, use absolute path.

   else, use which to find the full path in the system's PATH.

   if neither found, leave as is.

So the code would be:

exe = cmd[0]

if not isabs(exe):

   possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe)

   if exists and executable → use it.

   else:

      full_path = which(exe)

      if found → use it.

      else → leave as original.

Wait, but the possible_path is the absolute path of the given name. For example, if the first element is "python", then possible_path is the absolute path of "python" in the current directory. If that exists, then use that. Otherwise, search via which.

So this would handle cases where the user provided a name without a path, and the executable is in the current directory. But in that case, the function would use the current directory's version. That's probably better than just using which, which may not include the current directory.

Hmm, that's a good point. Because when you run a command like "python", the system first looks in the current directory (if the PATH includes .), but in many systems, the PATH doesn't include current directory. So which may not find it, but the function would check the current directory's path.

Wait, but in the code above, possible_path is the absolute path of the given exe (which is "python"), so that would be something like /current/absolute/path/python. So checking that first. So if the user has a python in their current directory, even if it's not in the PATH, then the function would pick it up. That's better.

So this code would handle that case. So that's a better solution.

Therefore, the code should be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe = cmd[0]
    if not os.path.isabs(exe):
        possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe)
        if os.path.exists(possible_path) and os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK):
            exe = possible_path
        else:
            full_path = shutil.which(exe)
            if full_path:
                exe = full_path
    return (exe,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but what about when the first element is a relative path with a directory (like "bin/app"), but the file doesn't exist. Then, the code tries to find "bin/app" via which (which would look in the PATH for an executable named "bin/app"). That's unlikely, but maybe the user made a mistake in the path, and the actual executable is in the PATH. So in that case, the code would not find it because which is looking for "bin/app" as the name, not "app".

Hmm, that's a problem. So in that case, the code would not find the executable "app" in the PATH. So perhaps the code should first check if the path has a directory component. If it does, then check that path (as absolute) first. If it's not found, then perhaps the code should only search via which if there's no directory component in the first element.

Wait, maybe the code should split the first element into the directory and the name. For example, if the first element is "bin/app", then the directory is "bin" and the name is "app". But that's getting more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the function should only search via which if the first element has no directory component (i.e., it's just the name). Otherwise, treat it as a path and check if it's valid.

So, for the first element, if it's not absolute, then:

   check if the path (as given) is valid. If so, use the absolute path.

   else, if the path has no directory (like "python"), then search via which.

   else, leave it as is.

Hmm, that's a possible approach. So how do I check if the path has a directory component? Like, check if there's a slash in the name?

Wait, using os.path.split, or see if the name contains a directory separator.

Alternatively, check if the path has a directory component by seeing if os.path.dirname(exe) is not empty. Or, check if the path contains a slash. But this might vary by OS (like using backslash on Windows). So perhaps using os.path.sep.

Wait, perhaps the code can first check whether the given exe has a directory component. For example, if it's just the name (no slashes), then try to find via which. Otherwise, check the possible absolute path and see if it exists.

So, in code:

if not isabs(exe):

   if '/' in exe or '\\' in exe (depending on OS?), but perhaps better to split into components.

Wait, perhaps:

if os.path.sep in exe:

   that means it has a directory component. So the code can check the possible_path (the absolute path of that) and see if it exists and is executable. If yes, use it. else, leave as is?

Wait, but then in the case where the first element is "bin/app", but it doesn't exist, then the code would leave it as is, but maybe the user intended to have it in the PATH. But the code can't know that because the path has a directory component. So maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the code should only use which when there's no directory component. So:

if not os.path.isabs(exe):

   if there's a directory component (like "bin/app"), then the code checks if that path (as absolute) exists and is executable. If yes, uses it. else, leaves it as original.

   else (no directory, just the name):

      try to find via which. If found, use the full path from which. else, leave as original.

So this would be better. Let's see how to code that.

So, first, check if the first element has a directory component (i.e., contains a path separator). Let's use os.path.split:

base, name = os.path.split(exe)

Wait, perhaps:

if os.path.split(exe)[0] != '': → has a directory component.

Alternatively, check if the path has any slashes (but that's OS dependent). Hmm.

Alternatively, use os.path.dirname(exe) != '.'? Not sure.

Alternatively, check whether the path has a directory component by seeing if the path is split into more than one part. Let's think of a way to check if the first element is a simple name (no path), then only use which.

So code:

if not os.path.isabs(exe):

   if '/' in exe or '\\' in exe:

      # has a directory component, so treat as a relative path with a directory.

      possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe)

      if os.path.exists(possible_path) and os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK):

          exe = possible_path

      else:

          # can't find, so leave as original.

          pass

   else:

      # no directory component, so just the name.

      possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe)

      if os.path.exists(possible_path) and os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK):

          exe = possible_path

      else:

          full_path = shutil.which(exe)

          if full_path:

              exe = full_path

          else:

              # leave as original.

              pass

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Perhaps the better approach is: when the first element is not an absolute path, first check if it's an executable in the current directory (as a simple name). Then, if not, search the PATH via which.

Wait, but how to know whether the first element is a name without any path? Like, if it has a directory, then the code should first check the absolute path of that. Otherwise, try the current directory first (as a possible_path), then which.

Hmm, perhaps splitting the first element into the directory and the name:

dir_part, base_name = os.path.split(exe)

Wait, but for "bin/app", split would give "bin" and "app". So, then the possible path would be the current directory plus the original path. But how?

Alternatively, the possible path is the absolute version of the given path. So for "bin/app", possible_path is the absolute path of that. So check that first. If it exists and is executable → use it. Else, if there's no directory component (like "python"), then check the current directory's "python", then search via which.

Hmm, maybe it's better to first check the possible absolute path (the given path's absolute form), and if that's valid, then use it. Otherwise, only for names without directory components, try to find via which.

Wait, perhaps the code can do:

if not isabs(exe):

   possible_path = abspath(exe)

   if exists and executable → use it.

   else:

      if the path has no directory (i.e., the directory part is empty):

          use which to find in PATH.

      else:

          leave as is? Because it's a relative path with a directory, but it's not valid.

      if found via which → use that.

      else → leave as is.

So how to code that.

First, check if the first element has a directory component:

has_dir = (os.path.split(exe)[0] != '') → but split returns (head, tail). So head is the directory part. So if head is not empty, then it has a directory component.

Wait, for example, "python" → split would give head is empty string, tail is "python".

"bin/app" → head is "bin", tail is "app".

So:

if not os.path.isabs(exe):

    has_dir = (os.path.split(exe)[0] != '')

    possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe)

    if os.path.exists(possible_path) and os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK):

        exe = possible_path

    else:

        if not has_dir:

            # no directory component, so search via which

            full_path = shutil.which(exe)

            if full_path:

                exe = full_path

        else:

            # has directory but path not valid, leave as is.

            pass

    return (exe,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but in that case, the code would check for the possible_path (the absolute path of the given relative path with directory). If it's not valid, and the user had a directory component, then it leaves it as original. But if the user provided a path like "bin/app", but the bin directory doesn't exist, then it's left as is. That's okay.

Alternatively, the code can first check whether the given path (as a relative path with directory) exists, and if so, use it. Else, if there's no directory, then try which. Otherwise, leave as is.

This way, the code would handle cases where the user provides a relative path with a directory (like "bin/app") but it exists, then it's expanded to absolute. If it's a simple name (no directory), then check current directory's absolute path (as possible_path) first. If that exists, use it. Else, search via which.

Wait, that's a good point. For example, if the first element is "python", then possible_path is the current directory's "python". So the code would check that first. If that exists, then use it, otherwise, search via which.

So this way, the code tries the current directory first for simple names. Which is better than just using which, since which doesn't search the current directory unless it's in the PATH.

So the code would be:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe = cmd[0]
    if not os.path.isabs(exe):
        possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe)
        if os.path.exists(possible_path) and os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK):
            exe = possible_path
        else:
            # Check if the exe has a directory component (like "bin/app")
            has_dir = os.path.split(exe)[0] != ''
            if not has_dir:
                # try to find via which
                full_path = shutil.which(exe)
                if full_path:
                    exe = full_path
    return (exe,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but in this code, for a simple name (no directory), first check the possible_path (current directory's absolute path of the name). If it exists and is executable, use that. Otherwise, check via which.

So this covers both cases: if the executable is in the current directory, even if the PATH doesn't include it, the function would find it. If not, then search via which.

This is better. Let's see:

Test case where cmd is ("python", "arg"):

possible_path is current directory's "python". If that exists → use it. Else, search via which. So the code would return the current directory's path if available, else the which path.

Another test case: cmd is ("./python", "arg"). The first element has a directory (./), so possible_path is the absolute path. So if it exists, use it. Otherwise, leave as original.

Another case: "bin/app" which is a relative path with directory. possible_path is absolute path of that. If it exists → use. else, leave as original.

So this code would handle those cases better than the previous versions.

Hmm, but what about if the first element is a simple name (no directory) but the user has it in a subdirectory like "bin/app" and the current directory has that executable? Like, if the first element is "app", then possible_path is the current directory's "app", which may not exist. But if the actual executable is in "bin/app", then the code would first check current directory's "app", which isn't there. Then, since has_dir is False (because the name is "app" with no directory), it would try which. But which would find it in the PATH, if present.

Wait, but the user might have intended to run "bin/app", but wrote "app". So the function would not find it unless the PATH includes bin.

Hmm, but that's a problem with the user's input. The function's job is to normalize the first element's path.

In any case, this code is better than the previous one.

Wait, but in the code above, when the first element is a simple name (no directory), and the possible_path (current directory's absolute path) exists and is executable → use that. So that's correct. So the code would first check if the executable exists in the current directory, then use that. Otherwise, search via which.

So that's the right approach.

Therefore, the code would be as follows.

Wait, but in the code:

has_dir = os.path.split(exe)[0] != ''

But for "python", split gives ('', 'python') → has_dir is False.

For "bin/app", split gives ('bin', 'app') → has_dir is True.

So when has_dir is False (no directory), then we check the possible_path (current directory's "python") first. If it exists, use it. If not, then use which.

Wait, but in the code above, the possible_path is checked before the has_dir check. So in the case where the first element is a simple name, like "python", the code first checks the possible_path (current directory's absolute path for "python"). If that exists → use it. Else, proceed to check has_dir (which is False), so then try which.

So that's correct.

Therefore, this code should handle all cases properly.

So putting it all together:

import os
import shutil

def normalize_cmd(cmd: tuple[str, ...]) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    if not cmd:
        return cmd
    exe = cmd[0]
    if not os.path.isabs(exe):
        possible_path = os.path.abspath(exe)
        if os.path.exists(possible_path) and os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK):
            exe = possible_path
        else:
            has_dir = os.path.split(exe)[0] != ''
            if not has_dir:
                full_path = shutil.which(exe)
                if full_path:
                    exe = full_path
    return (exe,) + cmd[1:]

Wait, but in the else clause after checking possible_path, the code checks has_dir. But what if possible_path is not valid (doesn't exist or not executable), but the has_dir is true (so it has a directory component). Then the code leaves it as is, because has_dir is true. So even if the path is invalid, the code leaves it as the original.

Yes. That's correct.

Another case: the first element is a simple name "app", but there's an app in current directory. Then possible_path is the absolute path of "app" in current directory. So that would be used.

Another case: first element is "app", but the current directory's "app" is not executable (maybe it's a script without execute permissions). Then, the code would proceed to check via which.

Hmm, but how to check if it's executable. The code uses os.access(possible_path, os.X_OK). So that's correct.

Therefore, this code should work. Let me code that.

Wait, but in the case where the first element is a relative path with a directory but that directory doesn't exist, then the possible_path would not exist, so the code leaves it as is. That's okay.

Yes, this seems better. Let me see if there's any mistake here.

Wait, in the code above, the possible_path is the absolute path of the first element, regardless of whether it has a directory. So even for "app", possible_path is current directory's absolute path + "app".

So that's correct.

Now, putting all that into code, but also considering that the function must return the first element as the full path if possible. Otherwise, leave it as is.

So this should handle all the cases. Now, let me make sure the code is correctly written.

Wait, the code after the possible_path check:

if the possible_path is valid (exists and executable), then set exe to possible_path.

Else, check if has_dir is false (so no directory component). Then, try to find via which.

So, in that case, if the first element is a simple name (no directory), and the possible_path (current directory's version) doesn't exist, then the code proceeds to use which.

Yes.

So I think this is the correct code. Now, let me write it properly.

Wait, but in the code, after the possible_path check, the else block:

has_dir = ... 

if not has_dir → then do the which.

So, in the case where the first element has a directory component, and the possible_path (its absolute path) doesn't exist, then the code leaves it as is. So the user would have to provide the full path or a valid name in the PATH.

So the code is okay.

Hmm, this is probably the best approach given the problem's description. So I'll go with this code.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the function should also check for the existence of the executable. The problem's docstring says "complement the full path to exe". So maybe the function just assumes that the first element is an executable, so even if it doesn't exist, it tries to find the path, but if it can't, then returns the original?

Alternatively, the problem might just want to replace the first element with the full path from which, regardless of whether it exists. But that's probably not the case.

The problem's wording is a bit unclear, but I think the code I have is correct. Let me proceed to write that.
