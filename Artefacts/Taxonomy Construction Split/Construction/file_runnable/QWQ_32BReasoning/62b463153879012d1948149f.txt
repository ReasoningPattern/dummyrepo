Okay, I need to write the Python function _eval_file based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function takes a prefix and a file_path. The goal is to determine the file type. 

First, I should check if the file_path starts with the prefix. If not, return None. Then, figure out the file type. The doc mentions that if it's XML, return None. For PDF, the return dict should have component_id and file_path. Wait, the description says for PDF, the key is component_id and file_path? Wait the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again.

The docstring says: Return None if the file doesn't match the prefix or the type is xml. For pdf, return a dict with keys component_id and file_path. For other types, return a dict with component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again? Wait that can't be right. Wait the last part says "return dict with the key of component_id, file_path if the type is pdf, return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path if the type is not pdf". Hmm, maybe that's a typo. Because the keys would have duplicate entries for file_path. Probably the second part should be "file_path, ftype" or maybe "component_id, file_path, ftype, and something else". Wait maybe the keys are component_id, file_path, ftype, and another key? Or perhaps the second part is supposed to list more keys. Wait the wording says "the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path". That's a bit strange. Maybe the correct keys for non-pdf files are component_id, file_path, ftype, and maybe another key like content or something else? But the docstring isn't clear. Wait, let's read it again carefully.

The return for non-pdf is supposed to be a dict with the keys component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path. Wait, that must be a mistake. Maybe it's component_id, file_path, and ftype. Since the first two parts of the key list are the same. Alternatively, maybe the last part is a typo, and the correct keys are component_id, file_path, ftype. Because the first case for PDF has two keys, and the second case for other types (non-xml, non-pdf) has three keys. Let me think again.

The function's doc says: if the file is pdf, return a dict with keys component_id and file_path. Wait, the wording is "the key of component_id, file_path" — so that's two keys. For other types (not pdf and not xml), the return dict has keys component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path? That can't be right because you can't have duplicate keys in a dictionary. So maybe it's a mistake in the docstring, and the correct keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. Or perhaps the last entry is a different key, like maybe "type" instead of ftype? Or maybe it's a typo and the second part should list component_id, file_path, ftype. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that for non-pdf files (but not xml), the return includes three keys: component_id, file_path, and ftype. Since the first case (pdf) doesn't include the ftype? That makes sense. Let me see. The first return for pdf has component_id and file_path. The second case for non-pdf (but not xml) would have those two plus ftype. 

So the logic is:

1. Check if the file_path starts with the prefix. If not, return None.
2. Determine the file type. Probably by looking at the extension. Like, check the suffix of the file_path. For example, if the file ends with .pdf, then it's pdf. .xml is xml. Other extensions would be other types.
3. If the type is xml, return None.
4. If it's pdf, return a dict with component_id (maybe derived from the file path?), and the file_path. Wait the problem says "the key of component_id, file_path" — but the values are component_id and file_path. How do we get component_id? The prefix might be part of that. Wait the function's parameters are prefix and file_path. So maybe component_id is the part of the file path after the prefix? Or perhaps the component_id is the same as the file_path? Wait the first case for pdf says the dict has keys component_id and file_path, but what are their values? The description says the key of component_id, file_path — but maybe that's a mistake. Wait the first return for PDF has the key component_id, file_path, but the values would be the component_id and the file_path. So perhaps the component_id is the file's name without the extension? Like, if the file is 'report.pdf', component_id could be 'report'?

Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear. Let me read the doc again. The function should return a dict. For pdf, the keys are component_id and file_path. The values for those keys would probably be the component ID and the file path. But how to get component_id? The prefix is given. Maybe the component_id is the part after the prefix? Like, if the file_path is '/prefix/some/file.txt' and the prefix is '/prefix', then component_id would be 'some/file' or the base name? Or perhaps the component_id is the file's name without the extension, but the prefix is a directory path? Not sure. Wait, the problem says "the key of component_id, file_path". So maybe the keys are those two, and the values are the component_id and the file_path? But how to compute component_id. The prefix is part of the input. Maybe the component_id is the file_path without the prefix? Let's think. 

Alternatively, maybe component_id is just the file name without the extension. For example, if the file is 'data.xml', then the type is xml, so return None. For 'document.pdf', the component_id is 'document', and the dict has {'component_id': 'document', 'file_path': 'document.pdf'}. For other files like 'report.txt', then the dict would include ftype as 'txt'? So the keys would be component_id, file_path, ftype. The wording in the doc for non-pdf says "return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path" — which might have a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be component_id, file_path, and ftype. 

Assuming that, the plan is:

- Check if the file_path starts with prefix. If not, return None.
- Get the file's extension. Maybe using os.path.splitext? 
- The extension is the part after the last dot. So, for 'file.xml', it's 'xml', etc. 
- If the extension is 'xml', return None.
- If the extension is 'pdf', then return a dict with component_id (the filename without extension?) and file_path. But the problem says the keys are component_id and file_path. Wait the values would be the component_id and the file_path? Or the component_id is the value for the key 'component_id', and the file_path is the value for 'file_path'?

Yes, that makes sense. So the key names are 'component_id' and 'file_path', with their respective values. 

Wait the problem says for the pdf case, return a dict with the key of component_id, file_path — but that's two keys. So the keys would be component_id and file_path. The values are component_id and file_path. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo and the keys are component_id and file_path, with their values being the component_id and the file_path. So the dict would have those two entries. 

But for non-pdf files (not xml), the return dict has keys component_id, file_path, ftype, and file_path again. That's impossible because of duplicate keys. So maybe the correct keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype, with their values. 

So the function's steps:

First, check if the file starts with the prefix. So, if the file_path does not start with the prefix, return None. 

Then, extract the file's extension. Let's see, using the suffix. 

If the extension is .xml, return None. 

If it's .pdf, then return a dict with component_id (maybe the filename without .pdf?) and the file_path. 

Wait, but how to get component_id? The problem's description isn't clear. Let's look at the docstring again. The key for pdf is component_id and file_path. Wait, maybe component_id is the prefix? No, the prefix is an input parameter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the component_id is the part of the file path after the prefix? For example, if the prefix is '/home/user/' and the file is '/home/user/docs/report.pdf', then component_id is 'docs/report'? But that could include the directory structure. Or maybe the component_id is the base name of the file without the extension. Like, for 'report.pdf', it's 'report'. 

The problem's wording might not specify that, so perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Let me think. The function's name is _eval_file, so maybe component_id is derived from the file's name. 

Let me proceed with code structure:

First, check the prefix:

if not file_path.startswith(prefix):
    return None

Then, get the file extension. Let's split the file path into the root and extension. 

base = os.path.basename(file_path)
name, ext = os.path.splitext(base)
ftype = ext[1:].lower()  # because ext starts with a dot, so [1:] gives the extension part, and lowercase to handle cases.

Wait, but maybe the extension is not the only way to determine the type. However, the problem mentions xml and pdf, so probably the extension is sufficient. 

Then, check ftype:

if ftype == 'xml':
    return None

elif ftype == 'pdf':
    component_id = name  # since name is the base without the extension
    return {'component_id': component_id, 'file_path': file_path}

else:
    # for other types, need to include ftype in the dict. So the keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. 
    # So the return dict should have component_id (name), file_path, and ftype (the extension type)
    return {'component_id': name, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': ftype}

Wait but the doc says for non-pdf files, the dict should have component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path. Which would have duplicate keys. So that can't be right. Therefore, probably a typo and the keys are component_id, file_path, ftype. So the third part would have three keys. 

Therefore, the code would be as above. 

Wait but the problem says, for the non-pdf case, "return dict with the key of component_id, file_path, ftype, file_path". Maybe the user meant to have component_id, file_path, ftype, and another key? Or perhaps the first file_path is the key and the value is the path, and the second is a mistake. Maybe the correct keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. 

Alternatively, maybe the first part for pdf has component_id and file_path as keys, but the second part for non-pdf has component_id, file_path, and ftype as keys. 

Assuming that, then the code would be okay. 

So putting it all together. 

Wait, but I need to make sure that the component_id is derived correctly. 

Wait, perhaps the component_id is the entire file path without the prefix. Like, if the prefix is part of the path, then the component_id is the part after the prefix. 

For example, if prefix is '/some/dir' and file_path is '/some/dir/file.pdf', then component_id would be 'file.pdf'? Or maybe the prefix is a path that the file must start with, but the component_id is the full file name without extension? 

Hmm, the problem's wording isn't clear. The function's parameters are prefix and file_path. So maybe the component_id is the part of the file path after the prefix, but without the extension? 

Let me think. Let's say prefix is the directory leading up to the file, so component_id would be the filename without extension. 

But perhaps the problem wants component_id to be the entire file path. Wait the first case's return for pdf has component_id and file_path as keys, but their values would be the same as the keys? That doesn't make sense. 

Wait maybe the keys are 'component_id' and 'file_path', and their values are the component_id and the file path. So for pdf, the dict has two entries: component_id (the name without extension) and the full file path. For other types, it includes ftype as well. 

Alternatively, maybe the component_id is the full path, but that's unlikely. 

The problem's wording says "the key of component_id, file_path". So the keys are 'component_id' and 'file_path', and the values are component_id and the file path. 

Therefore, the code would be:

import os

def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):
    if not file_path.startswith(prefix):
        return None
    base = os.path.basename(file_path)
    name, ext = os.path.splitext(base)
    ftype = ext[1:].lower()
    if ftype == 'xml':
        return None
    elif ftype == 'pdf':
        return {'component_id': name, 'file_path': file_path}
    else:
        return {'component_id': name, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': ftype}

Wait but in the else clause, the ftype is added. 

Wait, but the else clause is for types that are not pdf or xml? Because the first check is for xml. So if the ftype is not xml, then the code proceeds. So the first check is if ftype is xml, return None. Then, if it's pdf, return the two keys. Otherwise, for other types (like txt, etc.), return the three keys. 

Wait the problem says "return None if the file do not match the given prefix or the type of the file is xml". So the conditions are: if the file doesn't start with prefix, return None. Or if the type is xml, return None. 

So in code:

if not file_path.startswith(prefix) or ftype == 'xml':
    return None

Wait, no. The first part says "the file do not match the given prefix OR the type is xml". So the OR condition. So the code should return None in either of those cases. 

Wait the current code first checks if the path starts with prefix. If not, returns None. Then, checks the ftype. So if the file doesn't start with prefix, it returns None. Then, if the ftype is xml, return None. 

Wait, but the first condition (if not starts with prefix) already returns None. So the second check (ftype is xml) is only done if the path starts with prefix. So the logic is correct. 

Wait, but the problem says "return None if the file do not match the given prefix OR the type is xml". So even if the file starts with the prefix but is XML, return None. 

Yes, the code first checks the prefix. If it passes, then check the ftype. So that's correct. 

So, the code seems okay. 

Wait but the component_id is the name without the extension. For example, if the file is 'report.xml', then since the type is xml, it returns None. For 'report.pdf', the component_id is 'report', and the file_path is the full path. 

Another test case: if the file is 'data.txt', then component_id is 'data', and ftype is 'txt', so the dict includes all three keys. 

Yes. 

Wait, but in the else case, the code checks for ftype not equal to xml or pdf. But in the code above, after checking for xml (return None) and pdf (return the two keys), the else is for other types, so in that case, we include ftype. 

So the code is correct. 

Hmm, but I need to make sure that the function is using the correct way to get the component_id. The problem's docstring says nothing about the component_id's derivation, so perhaps the component_id is the entire file_path. But that can't be, because in the first case, the return would have component_id and file_path as the same value. 

Alternatively, maybe component_id is the file's name (including extension?), but in the case of pdf, perhaps the extension is stripped. 

Wait, in the code, for pdf, the name is the base without the extension. So component_id is the name without the extension. For other files, the name is without the extension, and ftype is the extension. 

Alternatively, maybe the component_id is the entire file path. But then, why would the function return that? 

Hmm, the problem's wording might be a bit ambiguous, but given the examples in the docstring, perhaps component_id is the file's name without the extension, and the file_path is the full path. 

So the code should be okay. Let me think about possible cases.

Case 1: file_path starts with prefix and is pdf. 

file_path = '/home/project/report.pdf'

prefix is '/home/project/'

Then, the component_id is 'report', ftype is 'pdf'. So the dict is {'component_id': 'report', 'file_path': '/home/project/report.pdf'}

Case 2: file is .txt. 

file_path = '/home/project/data.txt'

Then component_id is 'data', and the dict includes ftype as 'txt', so keys are component_id, file_path, and ftype. 

Case 3: file starts with prefix but is xml. 

file_path = '/home/project/file.xml'

ftype is 'xml', so returns None. 

Case 4: file doesn't start with prefix. Returns None. 

So the code should handle that. 

I think that's correct. Now, the code uses os.path.splitext, which splits on the last dot. So for files like 'file.tar.gz', the extension would be 'gz', leading to ftype 'gz'. But since the problem mentions xml and pdf, maybe that's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the function should check the full extension, but the problem doesn't specify. So proceed as per the code. 

Wait, but what about uppercase extensions? Like .PDF? The code converts to lowercase, so that's okay. 

Yes. 

So I'll write the code as such. Also, need to import os, but the function's signature doesn't include it. Wait the user didn't mention imports, so maybe assume that the function is inside a module where os is imported. Or perhaps the code should include the import? 

Wait the function signature is given, and the user says to output the code generated based on that. So probably the function should be written as is, without any imports. But then, using os.path functions would require importing os. 

Hmm, maybe I should include the import statement inside the function? No, that's not common practice. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that the function is part of a module that already has os imported. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the component_id is derived differently. Like, perhaps the component_id is the full path without the prefix. For example, if the prefix is '/some/dir', and the file is '/some/dir/sub/file.pdf', then component_id would be 'sub/file.pdf'? 

But the problem's docstring doesn't specify how to get component_id. The only way to proceed is to use the base name without the extension. 

Alternatively, maybe component_id is the part after the prefix. So, stripping the prefix from the file path. 

Wait, for example, if prefix is '/a/b/c', and the file is '/a/b/c/d/e.pdf', then the component_id would be 'd/e.pdf'? Or 'd/e' (without extension)?

In that case, component_id could be the file_path without the prefix. So:

stripped_path = file_path[len(prefix):].lstrip('/')  # to remove the leading slash after stripping prefix
name = os.path.splitext(stripped_path)[0]

But the problem's wording isn't clear. Since the function's parameters are prefix and file_path, perhaps the component_id is the part of the file path after the prefix. 

Wait the problem says "the key of component_id, file_path if the type is pdf". So the file_path is stored as a value in the dict. 

Hmm, the problem's description might not require that. Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the component_id is just the base name without the extension. 

Alternatively, maybe the component_id is the full file path. But that's unlikely. 

Well, given the ambiguity, but the problem's examples in the docstring, perhaps the component_id is the base name without the extension, and the code as written is okay. 

So I'll proceed with the code using os.path.basename and splitext. 

Wait but the code needs to be in Python, and the user said to output the code in markdown format. Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Wait, perhaps that means just the code with triple backticks? Like:

```python
def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):
    ...
```

But I should check. The user's instruction says to output only the code in Python markdown format. So I'll need to wrap the code in triple backticks with the language tag. 

Also, the code should not have any explanations. Just the code. 

So the code would be:

import os

def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):
    if not file_path.startswith(prefix):
        return None
    base = os.path.basename(file_path)
    name, ext = os.path.splitext(base)
    ftype = ext[1:].lower()
    if ftype == 'xml':
        return None
    elif ftype == 'pdf':
        return {'component_id': name, 'file_path': file_path}
    else:
        return {'component_id': name, 'file_path': file_path, 'ftype': ftype}

Wait but I need to make sure that the component_id is correct. Let me see. 

Wait in the else case, the ftype is not xml or pdf. So the code returns a dict with component_id (the name without extension), file_path, and ftype. 

Yes. 

But what about files without an extension? Like 'file'? Then, the name would be 'file', and the ext is empty, so ftype would be an empty string. Then, the else clause would return a dict with component_id 'file', file_path, and ftype as empty string. But according to the problem statement, perhaps that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the ftype is determined by checking the actual file content, but the docstring says "type of the given file", which could be ambiguous. But since the function's parameters don't include reading the file, probably it's just based on the file extension. 

So this code should work. 

Now, I'll write it as per the instructions, including the import statement. 

Wait the function's signature starts with def _eval_file(prefix, file_path):. So the code must start with that. 

Wait, but I should check if the code is correct. Let me test some examples.

Test 1: 

prefix = '/home/user/'
file_path = '/home/user/docs/report.pdf'

starts with prefix → yes. 

base is 'report.pdf', name is 'report', ftype is 'pdf'. 

So returns {'component_id': 'report', 'file_path': '/home/user/docs/report.pdf'}

Test 2: 

file_path = '/home/user/data.txt', starts with prefix → yes. 

ftype is 'txt', so returns the three keys. 

{'component_id': 'data', 'file_path': '/home/user/data.txt', 'ftype': 'txt'}

Test 3: 

file_path is '/home/user/file.xml' → starts with prefix. ftype is xml → return None. 

Test 4: 

file_path doesn't start with prefix → return None. 

Another case: file with no extension. 

file_path = '/home/user/file' → ftype is empty string. So the else clause applies, so component_id is 'file', and ftype is ''. 

But according to the problem's logic, since the type isn't xml or pdf, it should return the three keys. 

Hmm, but maybe the problem expects that only files with known extensions (other than xml/pdf) are considered. But since the code uses the extension, it's okay. 

So the code should be correct. 

Now, I'll write the code in the required format.
