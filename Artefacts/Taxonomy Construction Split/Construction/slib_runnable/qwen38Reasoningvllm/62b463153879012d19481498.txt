Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function files_list that returns the files in a given path. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to list all files in a specified directory path. But wait, the docstring says "files" plural, so maybe it's supposed to return a list of filenames, not including directories? Or maybe just all entries, but the user might want to filter for files only. Hmm, the exact behavior isn't specified, but the name suggests files, so I should probably include only files, not subdirectories.

So, the steps would be: take the path, check if it's a valid directory, then list all entries and filter out directories. How to do that in Python? Using os.listdir to get all entries, then os.path.isfile to check if each is a file. But I should also handle exceptions, like if the path doesn't exist or isn't a directory. Oh, but the problem says to return the files, so maybe the function should raise an error if the path is invalid? Or perhaps just return an empty list? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume that the path is valid and handle possible exceptions?

Wait, the user didn't mention error handling. Maybe they just want the basic functionality. Let me proceed with that. So, import os, then get the list of files. But wait, the function is called files_list, so perhaps it's better to return a list of filenames. Also, the path might be a directory or a file. Wait, if the path is a file, then the list would be empty. But the function's name is files_list, so maybe it's intended to list files in the directory. So, the function should check if the path is a directory, and if not, maybe return an empty list or raise an error?

The docstring says "given path", so perhaps the function should handle cases where the path is not a directory. Let me think. For example, if the path is a file, then there are no files in it. So, maybe the function should return an empty list in that case. Or maybe the user expects that the path is a directory. But to be safe, perhaps the function should check if it's a directory and handle accordingly.

So, the code would start by importing os. Then, get the list of entries in the path. Then filter each entry to check if it's a file. Then return the list of filenames.

Wait, but os.listdir returns all entries, including directories. So, to get only files, I need to check each item's type. So, for each item in os.listdir(path), check if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, item)) is True. Then collect those items.

So, the code would be something like:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    files = []
    for item in os.listdir(path):
        item_path = os.path.join(path, item)
        if os.path.isfile(item_path):
            files.append(item)
    return files

But wait, what about if the path is not a directory? For example, if it's a file, then os.listdir would throw an error. So, maybe I should check if the path is a directory first. So, add a check with os.path.isdir(path). If not, return an empty list?

So, modifying the code:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    if not os.path.isdir(path):
        return []
    files = []
    for item in os.listdir(path):
        item_path = os.path.join(path, item)
        if os.path.isfile(item_path):
            files.append(item)
    return files

But maybe the user wants to include subdirectories as well? No, the function is named files_list, so probably not. So, this should work. Let me test this logic. If the path is a directory, list all files inside. If not, return empty list. That seems reasonable.

Alternatively, maybe using os.scandir would be better, as it's more efficient. But the user didn't specify any particular method. Let me stick with os.listdir and os.path.isfile for simplicity.

Another thing: the path might be a relative path. Should the function handle absolute paths? Well, the function's parameter is just a path, so it's up to the user to pass the correct one. The function doesn't need to handle that.

So, the code should be as above. Let me make sure there are no errors. For example, if the path is invalid, os.listdir will raise an OSError. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that, so maybe the function is supposed to let it propagate. However, perhaps the user expects that the function will handle such cases gracefully. But since the docstring doesn't specify, maybe it's better to not include error handling unless required.

So, the code would be:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    files = []
    for item in os.listdir(path):
        if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, item)):
            files.append(item)
    return files

Wait, but if the path is not a directory, os.listdir will throw an error. So, perhaps adding a check for that. But again, the docstring doesn't mention it. However, to prevent the function from crashing, maybe it's better to handle that case. So, adding:

if not os.path.isdir(path):
    return []

But what if the path is a file? Then os.listdir would throw an error. So, perhaps the function should check if the path exists and is a directory. So, maybe:

import os

def files_list(path):
    """
    Return the files in given path.
    """
    if not os.path.isdir(path):
        return []
    files = []
    for item in os.listdir(path):
        item_path = os.path.join(path, item)
        if os.path.isfile(item_path):
            files.append(item)
    return files

Yes, that should handle cases where the path is not a directory. So, this code should work. Let me make sure that the function returns a list of filenames, not paths. Because the docstring says "return the files in given path", which probably means the filenames, not the full paths. So, appending just the item name is correct.

So, the final code would be as above. Let me check for any possible issues. For example, if the path is a symlink to a directory, os.listdir would follow it. But that's beyond the scope of the problem. The user probably wants the basic functionality.

Therefore, the code is as written.
