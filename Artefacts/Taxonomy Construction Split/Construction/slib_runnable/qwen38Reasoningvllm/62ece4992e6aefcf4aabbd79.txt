Okay, I need to create a Python function called make_find_paths that takes a sequence of paths and transforms them into glob patterns. The existing patterns should remain untouched. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, what is a glob pattern? Oh right, glob patterns use wildcards like * and ? to match filenames. So the task is to convert regular paths into these patterns. But how exactly? The user didn't specify the exact transformation rules. Wait, maybe the intention is to replace certain characters in the path with their glob equivalents. For example, replacing backslashes with forward slashes, or maybe adding wildcards at the end?

Wait, the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So perhaps the function is supposed to check if a path is already a glob pattern and leave it as is, otherwise convert it. But how to determine if a path is already a glob pattern? Maybe by checking if it contains any of the glob special characters like *, ?, [ etc.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take paths that are literal and convert them into patterns that can be used with glob. For instance, turning a path like 'folder1/folder2/file.txt' into 'folder1/folder2/file.txt' (which is already a glob pattern?), or maybe adding wildcards to match any files or directories. But the example isn't given, so I need to make an assumption.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to replace backslashes with forward slashes, since glob patterns typically use forward slashes. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps it's about making the path compatible with glob matching, like ensuring that any directory separators are normalized, or adding wildcards to match all files in a directory.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a glob pattern by replacing certain characters. For example, replacing '.' with '*'? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe replacing each directory separator with a pattern that matches any number of characters? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to convert paths into patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a literal, like 'file.txt', it becomes 'file.txt', but if it's a pattern, like 'file*.txt', it's left as is. Wait, but that's not really transforming. Maybe the function is supposed to take paths that are not patterns and convert them into patterns that match exactly, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of paths and turn them into glob patterns by adding wildcards. For example, turning 'path/to/file' into 'path/to/file*' to match any file in that directory. But the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched," so perhaps the function is supposed to check if a path is already a glob pattern and leave it, else convert it into one.

But how to detect if a path is a glob pattern? The standard glob characters are *, ?, [ etc. So maybe the function should check if any of these characters are present. If not, then it's a literal path and needs to be converted into a glob pattern. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take paths that are not patterns and convert them into patterns that match any file or directory. For example, replacing each '/' with '/*' or something like that. But that's not clear.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to generate a glob pattern that matches the path exactly, but using the glob syntax. For example, converting a normal path into a pattern where each component is matched exactly, but perhaps using wildcards for the last part. Like, if the path is 'folder1/folder2/file.txt', it becomes 'folder1/folder2/file.txt', which is already a glob pattern. But if it's a directory, maybe adding a '*' at the end. But the docstring isn't specific.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take each path and turn it into a glob pattern by replacing backslashes with forward slashes. But that's just normalization. However, the user says "transform all path into glob patterns," which might imply that they need to be converted into patterns that can be used with glob, like adding wildcards.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of paths and convert them into glob patterns by replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. For example, 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*', 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/folder2/*'. But that's just a guess. Without more details, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to take paths and make them into patterns that can be used with the glob module, which typically uses forward slashes. So maybe the function converts backslashes to forward slashes. But then, the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched," so if a path already has forward slashes, it's left as is. But that's not enough.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a pattern that matches any file or directory in that path. For example, turning 'path/to' into 'path/to/*' to match any file in that directory. But again, the docstring isn't clear.

Hmm. Since the user hasn't provided specific transformation rules, I need to make an assumption. Let me think of common scenarios. Maybe the function is supposed to take a path and turn it into a glob pattern by replacing each directory separator with '/*', and adding a '*' at the end to match any file. But then, if the path is already a glob pattern, it's left as is.

Wait, but how to determine if a path is a glob pattern? For example, if the path is 'file*.txt', it's a glob pattern. So the function should check if the path contains any glob characters. If it does, leave it. If not, convert it into a glob pattern.

But how to do that? Let's think. The function would need to check each path in the input sequence. For each path, if it contains any of the glob characters (*, ?, [ etc.), leave it as is. Otherwise, convert it into a glob pattern. But what's the conversion? For example, turning 'file.txt' into 'file.txt' (which is already a glob pattern), but maybe adding a '*' at the end to match any file. Or maybe replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take paths and make them into patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a directory, add a '*' to match any file in it. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a pattern that matches exactly, but using the glob syntax. For example, replacing backslashes with forward slashes. But that's just normalization.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of paths and convert them into glob patterns by replacing each backslash with a forward slash. Because in Python, when using glob, paths are typically handled with forward slashes. So for example, if the input is a Windows path like 'C:\\folder\\file.txt', it would be converted to 'C:/folder/file.txt'.

But the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So if the path already uses forward slashes, it's left as is. But if it uses backslashes, they are replaced. However, the user might be referring to something else.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a path and make it into a glob pattern by adding wildcards. For example, turning 'file.txt' into 'file.txt' (no change), but if it's a directory, adding a '*' to match any file within. But again, not sure.

Since the user hasn't provided specific examples, perhaps the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a glob pattern by replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and make it into a pattern that can be used with the glob module, which would involve replacing backslashes with forward slashes. Let me think. The glob module in Python uses forward slashes for path separators, regardless of the operating system. So if the input paths use backslashes, they should be converted to forward slashes. But if they already use forward slashes, they are left as is. However, the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched," which might imply that if the path is already a glob pattern (like containing * or ?), it's left as is. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the path contains any glob characters. If it does, leave it. If not, replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end to match any file.

But how to implement that? Let's think. For each path in find_paths:

- Check if it contains any glob characters (like *, ?, [ etc.)
- If it does, leave it as is.
- If not, replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end.

Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to take paths and convert them into patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a directory, then adding a '*' to match any file in it. But if the path is a file, then it's left as is. However, the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched," which suggests that if the path is already a pattern (like containing *), it's left as is. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the path is a literal (no glob characters) and then convert it into a pattern that matches exactly, but using glob syntax. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take each path and make it into a glob pattern by replacing each directory separator with '/*', and adding a '*' at the end. For example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/folder2/*', and 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*'.

But again, without clear examples, this is ambiguous. However, given the function's name and the docstring, perhaps the intended transformation is to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches any file or directory under that path. For instance, turning 'path/to' into 'path/to/*' to match any file in that directory. But if the path is already a glob pattern, like 'path/to/*', it's left as is.

So the approach would be:

For each path in find_paths:

- If the path contains any glob characters (like *, ?, [ etc.), leave it as is.
- Else, convert it into a glob pattern by adding a '*' at the end to match any file.

But then, how to handle directories? For example, if the path is a directory, maybe adding a '*' to match any file within. But if the path is a file, then it's left as is. Wait, but the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns," so maybe all paths should be converted to match any file or directory. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and replace any directory separators with '/*' and add a '*' at the end. For example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/folder2/*', and 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*'.

But again, without more info, it's hard to know. However, given that the function is called make_find_paths, perhaps it's related to generating patterns for finding files. Maybe the function is supposed to take a list of paths and convert them into glob patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a directory, add a '*' to match any file in it. If it's a file, leave it as is. But how to determine if it's a directory or a file?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a pattern that matches exactly, but using glob syntax. For example, replacing backslashes with forward slashes. So, for a Windows path, convert to Unix-style path. But then, the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched," which might not apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take each path and make it into a glob pattern by replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. But that's just a guess.

Let me think of possible code. For example, if the path doesn't contain any glob characters, replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end. Otherwise, leave it.

So, the code would be something like:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if any(char in '*?[' for char in path):
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            # Replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end
            transformed_path = path.replace('\\', '/').rstrip('/') + '*'
            transformed.append(transformed_path)
    return tuple(transformed)

Wait, but that's just one possible approach. However, the user might have a different intention. For example, maybe they want to replace each directory separator with '/*' and add a '*' at the end. Or maybe they want to add a '*' to the end of each path to match any file in that directory.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take paths and convert them into patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a directory, add a '*' to match any file in it. But how to know if it's a directory? That would require checking the file system, which isn't feasible in a function that only takes a sequence of paths. So that's probably not the case.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a glob pattern by replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. For example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/folder2/*', and 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*'.

But how to handle cases where the path already ends with a '*'? Like, if the path is 'folder1/*', then it's already a glob pattern and should be left as is.

So the code would check if the path contains any glob characters. If yes, leave it. Otherwise, replace backslashes with forward slashes, and add a '*' at the end.

But perhaps the user wants to replace backslashes with forward slashes regardless of whether it's a glob pattern. For example, converting Windows paths to Unix-style paths. But then, the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched," which might imply that if the path is already a glob pattern (like containing *), it's left as is. So the code would first check if the path contains any glob characters, and if not, replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take paths and convert them into patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a directory, add a '*' to match any file in it. But again, without knowing the exact transformation, it's hard.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the function is supposed to convert paths that are not glob patterns into glob patterns by adding a '*' at the end, and replacing backslashes with forward slashes. So the code would look like:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if any(c in '*?[' for c in path):
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            # Replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end
            transformed_path = path.replace('\\', '/').rstrip('/') + '*'
            transformed.append(transformed_path)
    return tuple(transformed)

But wait, the rstrip('/') is to remove any trailing slashes, then add a '*' to match any file. For example, if the path is 'folder1/folder2/', it becomes 'folder1/folder2/*'.

But maybe the user wants to replace all backslashes with forward slashes, regardless of whether it's a glob pattern. So even if the path is a glob pattern with backslashes, like 'folder1\folder2*', it would be converted to 'folder1/folder2*'.

But the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched," which might mean that if the path already has glob characters, it's left as is. So the code would check for presence of glob characters. If present, leave as is. Otherwise, replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end.

But perhaps the function is supposed to take paths and make them into patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a directory, then adding a '*' to match any file in it. However, the function doesn't have access to the file system, so it can't determine if it's a directory. So that's not feasible.

Another thought: maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern by replacing each directory separator with '/*', and adding a '*' at the end. For example, 'path/to/file' becomes 'path/to/file*', 'path/to' becomes 'path/to/*'.

But again, without knowing the exact transformation rules, it's challenging. However, given the function's name and the docstring, this seems plausible.

So, the code would check if the path contains any glob characters. If not, replace backslashes with forward slashes, then replace each '/' with '/*', and add a '*' at the end. Wait, but that might not be necessary. For example, if the path is 'folder1/folder2', converting to 'folder1/*folder2/*'? No, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a pattern that matches any file in that directory. So for a path that's a directory, add a '*' at the end. But again, how to determine if it's a directory?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and make it a glob pattern by adding a '*' at the end if it doesn't already end with one. But that's not sufficient.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended transformation is to replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end. So the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    return tuple(path.replace('\\', '/') + '*' if not any(c in '*?[' for c in path) else path for path in find_paths)

But this code would add a '*' to any path that doesn't contain glob characters. However, if the path is a file, adding a '*' would make it match any file with the same name. But maybe that's not the intended behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches exactly. For example, 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt', which is already a glob pattern. But that's not transforming anything.

Hmm. Maybe the user is referring to converting paths into patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a directory, then the pattern would be 'dir/*' to match any file in it. But again, without knowing the exact rules, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of paths and convert them into glob patterns by replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. But that's not standard.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where paths are being used for glob matching, and the transformation is to ensure that the path is in the correct format. For example, in some systems, paths might be passed with backslashes, and the function converts them to forward slashes. But then, the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched," which might mean that if the path already has forward slashes, it's left as is. But if it's a literal path with backslashes, it's converted to forward slashes. However, this doesn't involve adding wildcards.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and make it a glob pattern by adding wildcards. For example, turning 'file.txt' into 'file.txt' (no change), but if it's a directory, adding '/*' to match any file in it. But again, how to determine if it's a directory?

Since the user hasn't provided specific examples, I need to make a best guess. Let me think of a common use case. Suppose someone has a list of paths, some of which are directories, and they want to generate glob patterns that match all files in those directories. But without knowing if the path is a directory, this is not possible. So perhaps the function is supposed to take paths and convert them into patterns that match any file or directory under that path. For example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/folder2/*'.

But how to implement that? For each path, if it doesn't contain any glob characters, replace backslashes with forward slashes, then add '/*' at the end. Wait, but that would make it match any file in the directory. However, if the path is a file, then adding '/*' would be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to add a '*' at the end of each path to match any file in that directory. So 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*', which would match any file starting with 'file.txt' followed by any characters. But that's not standard. Usually, to match any file in a directory, you'd have 'dir/*'.

But perhaps the user wants to make sure that each path is a glob pattern. For example, if the path is a literal, turn it into a pattern that matches exactly. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a pattern that matches exactly, but using glob syntax. For example, replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. But that's not clear.

Given the lack of clarity, perhaps the intended transformation is to replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end if it's not already a glob pattern. So the code would check if the path contains any glob characters. If not, replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end. Otherwise, leave it as is.

So the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path

    """
    return tuple(
        path.replace('\\', '/') + '*' if not any(c in '*?[' for c in path) else path
        for path in find_paths
    )

But this code would add a '*' to any path that doesn't contain glob characters. For example, 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*', which would match any file starting with 'file.txt'. But maybe that's not intended. Alternatively, maybe the '*' should only be added if the path is a directory. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern by replacing each directory separator with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. For example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/*folder2/*', but that's not correct. It should be 'folder1/folder2/*'.

So, for a path that's a directory, adding a '*' at the end. But how to know if it's a directory? The function doesn't have access to the file system, so it can't check. Therefore, perhaps the function is supposed to add a '*' to the end of each path that doesn't already contain a glob pattern.

In that case, the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the function returns a tuple of transformed paths. Also, the function should handle sequences like lists, tuples, etc.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to take paths and make them into patterns that can be used with the glob module. For example, if the path is a directory, then the pattern would be 'dir/*', but if it's a file, then it's left as is. But again, without knowing if it's a directory, this is not possible.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the function is supposed to convert paths that are not glob patterns into ones that end with a '*' to match any file in the directory. So the code would check for presence of glob characters. If none, add a '*' at the end. Also, replace backslashes with forward slashes.

So, the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):

    return tuple(
        path.replace('\\', '/') + '*' if not any(c in '*?[' for c in path) else path

    )

But this would add a '*' to every path that doesn't contain any glob characters. For example, 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*', which would match any file starting with 'file.txt'. However, if the user wants to match exactly, then this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace each '/' with '/*' and add a '*' at the end. For example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/*folder2/*', but that's not correct. It should be 'folder1/folder2/*'.

But how to handle that? For each path, split into components and join with '/*', then add a '*' at the end. But that would require splitting the path, which might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a path and convert it into a glob pattern by replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. For example, 'path/to/file' becomes 'path/*to/*file*'.

But that's not a standard approach. It's unclear.

Given that the user hasn't provided examples, but the function is named make_find_paths, perhaps it's related to generating patterns for finding files. For instance, if the input is a list of paths, and the function is supposed to make them into glob patterns that can be used to find files. So for example, if the path is a directory, add a '*' to match any file in it. If it's a file, leave it as is. But again, without knowing if it's a directory, this is not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern by replacing each '/' with '/*' and adding a '*' at the end. For example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/*folder2/*'.

But this seems arbitrary. Without more information, I need to make a best guess. Let me think of the most common scenario. If the function is supposed to generate glob patterns for searching files, then adding a '*' at the end of each path would make it match any file in that directory. So for example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/folder2/*', and 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*'.

But how to handle paths that already end with a '*'? Like 'folder1/*' would be left as is. So the code would check if the path contains any glob characters. If yes, leave it. Otherwise, replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end.

So the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """

    transformed = []

                transformed_path += '*'
            transformed.append(transformed_path)
    return tuple(transformed)

Wait, but this code would add '/*' if the path ends with a slash, otherwise add '*'. For example, 'folder1/folder2/' becomes 'folder1/folder2/*', and 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/folder2*'.

But maybe the intended behavior is to add a '*' at the end of each path, regardless of whether it ends with a slash. So 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/folder2*', and 'folder1/folder2/' becomes 'folder1/folder2/*'.

But again, this is just a guess. Since the user hasn't provided specific examples, I'll proceed with this approach.

Another thing to consider: the function should return a tuple of transformed paths. So the code should process each path in the input sequence and return them as a tuple.

Putting it all together, here's the code:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path

    """
    return tuple(
        path.replace('\\', '/') + '*' if not any(c in '*?[' for c in path) else path
        for path in find_paths
    )

But this would add a '*' to any path that doesn't contain glob characters. For example, 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*', which would match any file starting with 'file.txt'. However, if the user wants to match exactly, this is not correct. But given the lack of information, this seems like a possible implementation.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace each '/' with '/*' and add a '*' at the end. For example, 'folder1/folder2' becomes 'folder1/*folder2/*'.

But that's not standard. The standard way to match any file in a directory is to have the pattern end with '/*'.

So perhaps the code should check if the path is a directory (by checking if it ends with a slash), and add '/*' if it is, otherwise add '*'.

But again, without knowing if it's a directory, this is not possible. So the function can't determine that. Therefore, the best approach is to assume that any path that doesn't contain glob characters should be converted into a pattern that matches any file in that directory, by adding a '*' at the end. So the code would replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end.

So the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """

    return tuple(
        path.replace('\\', '/') + '*' if not any(c in '*?[' for c in path) else path
        for path in find_paths
    )

This way, any path that doesn't contain glob characters is converted to use forward slashes and added a '*' to match any file in that directory. Paths that already have glob characters are left as is.

But what about paths that end with a '*'? Like 'file.txt*' would be left as is. That makes sense.

So this code should work. Let me test with some examples.

Example 1:
Input: ['file.txt']
Output: ['file.txt*']

Example 2:
Input: ['folder1/folder2']
Output: ['folder1/folder2*']

Example 3:
Input: ['folder1/*']
Output: ['folder1/*']

Example 4:
Input: ['C:\\path\\to\\file.txt']
Output: ['C:/path/to/file.txt*']

But maybe the user wants to replace backslashes with forward slashes regardless of whether it's a glob pattern. So the code would do that.

So the final code would be as above. The function checks for any glob characters in the path. If none, replace backslashes with forward slashes and add a '*' at the end. Otherwise, leave it as is.

Thus, the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
        find_paths: sequence of path
    Returns:
        tuple of transformed path
    """
    return tuple(
        path.replace('\\', '/') + '*' if not any(c in '*?[' for c in path) else path
        for path in find_paths
    )

But wait, the code checks if any character in the path is a glob character. However, this might not be sufficient. For example, a path like 'file[1].txt' would be considered a glob pattern because of the '[' character, so it's left as is. That's correct.

Another case: 'file?txt' would be left as is.

So this code seems to handle that.

Therefore, this is the code I'll generate.
