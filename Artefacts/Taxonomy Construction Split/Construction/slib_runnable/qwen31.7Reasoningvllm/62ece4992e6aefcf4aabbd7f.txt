Okay, I need to write a Python function called _parse_image_ref that takes an image_href string and returns a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). The docstring says it raises ValueError, but I don't see any error handling in the function yet. Let me think about how to parse the image href.

First, the function needs to split the image_href into parts. The docstring mentions using urllib, so maybe the image_href is a URL. So, I should split it into parts using urllib's parse module. The tuple is (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). 

Wait, the return type is a tuple of str, str, bool. So image_id is probably the part before the domain, like the image ID. Netloc is the domain part, and use_ssl is a boolean indicating if the URL uses SSL.

But how to split the href? Let's think. For example, if the href is "https://example.com/image123", then image_id is "image123", netloc is "example.com", and use_ssl is True. But if it's "http://example.com/image123", then use_ssl is False.

So the steps would be: split the href into the protocol (http or https), the domain, and the image ID. The image ID is the part after the last slash, but maybe not. Wait, the image_href could be something like "https://example.com/images/123.jpg". So the image_id would be "123", netloc is "example.com", and use_ssl is True.

So the plan is: split the href into the protocol, the domain, and the rest. The protocol is the first part, then the domain is the next part, and the rest is the image ID. But how to split that?

Alternatively, maybe the image_href is in the format "https://example.com/image_id", so splitting on the last '/' would give the image_id. But if the href is "http://example.com/images/123.jpg", then the image_id is "123.jpg". But the function's return type is (str, str, bool), so image_id is a string, netloc is the domain, and use_ssl is a boolean.

So perhaps the image_href is structured as follows: the protocol (http or https), the domain, and then the image ID. But how to extract that?

Alternatively, maybe the image_href is a URL, and we can split it into components using urllib.parse. For example, using urlparse.

Yes, using urllib.parse.urlparse would split the href into parts. Let's think about that.

So, using urlparse, the href would be split into parts like:

scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment.

So, the netloc is the domain part, which is the second element. The path would be the part after the domain. The image_id would be the part after the last slash in the path. But maybe the image_id is the part after the last slash in the path. For example, if the path is "/images/123.jpg", then the image_id is "123.jpg".

But the function's return type is (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So image_id is the part after the last slash in the path. So, the path is split into parts, and the last part is the image_id.

So, the steps would be:

1. Parse the href using urlparse.
2. Get the netloc (domain).
3. Get the path.
4. Split the path into parts, and take the last part as image_id.
5. Check if the scheme is http or https, and set use_ssl accordingly.

But wait, the image_href could be something like "http://example.com/images/123.jpg", so the path is "/images/123.jpg", and the image_id is "123.jpg". So, the image_id is the last part of the path.

So, in code:

from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    image_id = parsed.path.split('/')[-1]
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, what if the path is empty? Like if the href is just "https://example.com", then parsed.path is '/', so split into ['', ''], and the last part is empty string. But the function's return type is a str, so that would be an empty string. But maybe that's acceptable.

But the function's docstring says that it returns a tuple of the form (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So, the image_id is a string, which could be empty.

But the function is supposed to parse the image href, so maybe the image_href is always a valid URL. But the function should handle any valid href.

But the problem is that the image_href could be something like "https://example.com", which would have parsed.path as '/', so image_id is empty. But the function returns that as a string.

So the code would be as above.

But wait, the function is supposed to return a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So, the image_id is the last part of the path, netloc is the domain, and use_ssl is True or False.

But what if the href is "http://example.com/images/123.jpg"? Then parsed.scheme is 'http', so use_ssl is False. The image_id is '123.jpg', netloc is 'example.com'.

But what if the href is "https://example.com/images/123"? Then the image_id is '123', netloc is 'example.com', use_ssl is True.

So the code seems to handle that.

But what if the href is "http://example.com"? Then parsed.path is '/', so image_id is empty. So the function returns (empty string, 'example.com', False).

But the function's docstring says that it returns a tuple of the form (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So that's acceptable.

But the function is supposed to parse the image href, so maybe the image_href is a URL that has an image ID in the path. But the function is written to handle any valid href.

So the code would be:

from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    image_id = parsed.path.split('/')[-1]
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But wait, the function's return type is Tuple[str, str, bool], but in Python, the Tuple is from typing. So the code should import that.

But the user's code might not have the import. However, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should include the necessary imports.

But the function is inside a module, and the user might not have imported urllib. But the docstring says to use urllib, so the code should import urllib.

Wait, the docstring says "import urllib" but the function uses urlparse from urllib.parse. So the code should import urllib.parse.

So the code would be:

from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    image_id = parsed.path.split('/')[-1]
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

But the function is supposed to return a tuple of (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So the code is correct.

But what if the image_href is not a valid URL? For example, if it's "http://example.com/images/123.jpg", then the code would parse it correctly. But if the href is invalid, like "http://example.com/images/123.jpg?param=1", then urlparse would still parse it, but the code would still return the correct parts.

But the function is supposed to parse the image href, so it's up to the caller to ensure that the href is valid. The function doesn't handle that.

So the code is as above. The function uses urlparse to split the href into parts, then extracts the image_id, netloc, and use_ssl.

So the final code is as written.
