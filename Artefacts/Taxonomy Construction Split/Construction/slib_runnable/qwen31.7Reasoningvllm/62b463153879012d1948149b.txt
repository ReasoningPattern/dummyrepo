Okay, I need to write a Python function called match_file_by_prefix. The docstring says that given a file path, it returns True if the basename starts with the prefix followed by a hyphen or the prefix followed by a dot. 

First, I should figure out how to get the basename of the file path. In Python, the os module has a path module, and os.path.basename() returns the filename part. So I'll use that.

Then, the prefix is given as a parameter. The basename needs to start with prefix + "-" or prefix + ".". Wait, the docstring says "prefix plus "-" or the given prefix plus '.'". So the two possibilities are prefix + '-' and prefix + '.'.

So the condition is: the basename starts with (prefix + '-') or (prefix + '.').

But wait, what if the prefix is empty? Well, the function is supposed to handle that, but maybe the docstring doesn't mention it. But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so I'll assume that the prefix is a valid string.

So the steps are:

1. Get the basename of the file_path using os.path.basename().
2. Check if the basename starts with prefix + '-' or prefix + '.'.

But wait, what if the prefix is empty? For example, if prefix is empty string, then prefix + '-' is '-', and prefix + '.' is '.'. So the basename would need to start with either '-' or '.'? But that's probably not intended. But the function's docstring doesn't specify handling that case, so maybe the code should handle it as per the docstring.

So the code would be:

import os

def match_file_by_prefix(prefix, file_path):
    basename = os.path.basename(file_path)
    return basename.startswith(prefix + '-') or basename.startswith(prefix + '.')

Wait, but what if the file_path is something like '/path/to/file.txt'? Then the basename is 'file.txt'. If the prefix is 'foo', then check if 'file.txt' starts with 'foo-' or 'foo.'? Well, 'file.txt' starts with 'foo-'? No. So the function would return False in that case.

But the function is supposed to return True if the basename starts with the prefix plus hyphen or the prefix plus dot. So that's correct.

But what about if the prefix is empty? For example, prefix is '', then prefix + '-' is '-', and prefix + '.' is '.'. So the basename must start with '-' or '.'? But that's probably not intended. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that, so the code as written would handle it.

So the code seems correct. Let me test some examples.

Test case 1: prefix is 'a', file_path is 'a-b.txt'. Basename is 'b.txt'. Does 'b.txt' start with 'a-'? No. Starts with 'a.'? No. So returns False. Correct.

Test case 2: prefix is 'a', file_path is 'a-b.txt'. Wait, same as before. Wait, no. Wait, if the prefix is 'a', then prefix + '-' is 'a-', and prefix + '.' is 'a.'. So the basename must start with 'a-' or 'a.'. So if the basename is 'a-b.txt', then it starts with 'a-', so returns True. So that's correct.

Another test case: prefix is 'a', file_path is 'a.txt'. Basename is 'a.txt'. Starts with 'a-'? No. Starts with 'a.'? Yes, because 'a.' is the same as 'a.' and the basename is 'a.txt' which starts with 'a.'? Wait, no. 'a.txt' starts with 'a.'? The first character is 'a', then '.'? So 'a.txt' starts with 'a.'? Wait, the first two characters are 'a.'? So yes. So if the prefix is 'a', then the condition is True. So the function returns True. So that's correct.

So the code seems to handle that.

So the code is as written. The only thing is to import os, but the function doesn't use any other modules. So the code is correct.
