Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _c_optimizations_ignored() and the docstring says it returns True if the "PURE_PYTHON" environment variable is not None and not zero, else False.

First, I need to understand what the function is doing. The docstring mentions checking the "PURE_PYTHON" environ variable. So, in Python, environment variables can be accessed using os.environ. But wait, the function is named with an underscore, which is common for internal methods. However, the user might not care about the naming, just the code.

The function needs to check if the "PURE_PYTHON" variable is present and not equal to '0'. So, the code would be something like:

return os.environ.get('PURE_PYTHON') is not None and os.environ['PURE_PYTHON'] != '0'

But wait, the function is supposed to return True in those cases. So, if the variable is set to a non-zero value, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Wait, the docstring says "not none and not 0". So, the condition is that the variable is not None and its value is not '0'. So, the code would check if the environment variable exists and is not '0'.

So, the code would be:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    return os.environ.get('PURE_PYTHON') is not None and os.environ['PURE_PYTHON'] != '0'

But wait, what if the environment variable is set to a string that's not '0'? Like '1' or 'abc'? The docstring says "not 0", which probably means the value is not the string '0'. So, checking if the value is not '0' would handle that.

But maybe the environment variable is set to a numeric value, but in Python, the string '0' is different from the integer 0. So, the code is correct as is.

So, the code should import os and return the condition. The function is supposed to be part of a module, but the user didn't specify any other parts. So, the code is straightforward.

I need to make sure that the function is properly formatted, with the correct return statement. Also, the function is named with underscores, which is okay.

So, the final code would be:

import os

def _c_optimizations_ignored():
    return os.environ.get('PURE_PYTHON') is not None and os.environ['PURE_PYTHON'] != '0'

Yes, that should do it.
