Okay, I need to write a Python function called make_find_paths that takes a sequence of paths and transforms each path into a glob pattern. The docstring says that existing patterns should be passed through untouched. So, the function needs to convert each path into a glob pattern, but if it's already a glob pattern, return it as is.

First, I remember that in Python, the glob module has a glob() function that can convert a string into a glob pattern. But wait, the function is supposed to take a sequence of paths. So, maybe each element in the find_paths list is a path string, and I need to convert each of them into a glob pattern.

Wait, but the function's return type is a tuple of transformed paths. So, for each path in find_paths, I need to generate the corresponding glob pattern. But how do I do that?

Hmm, the glob module's glob() function takes a pattern and returns a list of matches. But here, we need to convert a path into a glob pattern. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a path and return the glob pattern that would match it. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern would be 'file.txt'. But if the path is 'file/*.txt', then the glob pattern is 'file/*.txt'.

Wait, but the function's docstring says that existing patterns are passed through. So, if the input is already a glob pattern, like 'file.txt', then the output should be the same. So, the function needs to check if the input is already a glob pattern. But how to determine that?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a path string and convert it into a glob pattern. For example, if the input is 'file.txt', the output is 'file.txt'. If the input is 'file/*.txt', the output is 'file/*.txt'. But how to handle cases where the input is not a glob pattern? Like, if the input is 'file.txt', then the output is the same. But if the input is 'file', then the output is 'file'.

Wait, but the function's parameters are a sequence of paths. So, each element in the find_paths is a path string. The function needs to convert each of these into a glob pattern. So, for each path in find_paths, we need to generate the corresponding glob pattern.

But how to do that? The glob module's glob() function takes a pattern and returns a list of matches. But here, we need to convert a path into a glob pattern. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a path and return the glob pattern that would match it. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file/*.txt', the glob pattern is 'file/*.txt'.

But how to convert a path into a glob pattern? Maybe the function is supposed to use the glob module's glob() function. Wait, no. The glob module's glob() function takes a pattern and returns a list of matches. But here, we need to convert a path into a glob pattern. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take the path and return the same path as a glob pattern. But that's trivial. Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to convert the path into a glob pattern by replacing certain characters. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file/dir.txt', the glob pattern is 'file/dir.txt'.

Wait, but how to determine if a path is already a glob pattern? Because some paths are already glob patterns. For example, 'file.txt' is a glob pattern. So, the function needs to check if the input is already a glob pattern. But how to do that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the path and return the same path as a glob pattern. But that's not possible because the glob module's glob() function would return a list of matches, but here we need to generate the pattern.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take a path and return the glob pattern that would match it. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file/dir.txt', the glob pattern is 'file/dir.txt'. But how to generate that?

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to take the path and return the same path as a glob pattern. But that's not possible unless the path is already a glob pattern. But the function's docstring says that existing patterns are passed through. So, if the input is already a glob pattern, return it as is.

So, the function would take each path in find_paths, and for each, check if it's already a glob pattern. If it is, return it as is. Otherwise, convert it into a glob pattern.

But how to check if a path is a glob pattern? Well, perhaps the function can use the glob module's glob() function. Wait, but that would require that the path is a pattern. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', then the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file/*.txt', the glob pattern is 'file/*.txt'.

But how to determine if a path is already a glob pattern. Maybe the function can check if the path is a valid glob pattern. But that's complicated.

But the function's docstring says that existing patterns are passed through. So, the function would return the same path as is, unless it's not a glob pattern.

Wait, but how to determine if a path is a glob pattern. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', it's a glob pattern. If the path is 'file', it's a glob pattern. If the path is 'file/dir.txt', it's a glob pattern. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return the same path as is, but the docstring says that existing patterns are passed through. So, the function would return the same path as is, unless it's not a glob pattern.

But how to determine if a path is a glob pattern. Maybe the function can use the glob module's glob() function. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', then glob.glob('file.txt') would return a list of matches. But that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the path and return the same path as a glob pattern. So, for example, if the input is 'file.txt', return 'file.txt'. If the input is 'file', return 'file'. But how to handle cases where the path is not a glob pattern. For example, if the input is 'file.txt', it's a glob pattern. If the input is 'file', it's a glob pattern. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return the same path as is.

But that seems too simplistic. The function's docstring says that existing patterns are passed through. So, the function would return the same path as is, unless it's not a glob pattern. But how to determine that.

But then, the function would be trivial. The code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    return tuple(path for path in find_paths)

But that's not correct. Because the docstring says that existing patterns are passed through. So, if the input is already a glob pattern, return it as is. But if the input is not a glob pattern, convert it into a glob pattern.

But then, the function would be as simple as returning the same list. But that's not helpful. The function's purpose is to transform all paths into glob patterns. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take each path and convert it into a glob pattern. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file/dir.txt', the glob pattern is 'file/dir.txt'.

But that's not correct. I'm stuck. Maybe the function is supposed to take each path and return the same path as a glob pattern. So, the code would be:

But that's not helpful. The function's docstring says that existing patterns are passed through. So, the function would return the same paths as is. So, the code is as simple as returning the same list.

But then, the function is not doing anything. But according to the docstring, the function is supposed to transform the paths into glob patterns. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take each path and return the same path as a glob pattern. So, the code would be:

But I'm not sure. Maybe the function is supposed to take each path and return the same path as a glob pattern. So, the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    return tuple(path for path in find_paths)

But that's not correct. I think I need to look for a way to convert a path into a glob pattern. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file/dir.txt', the glob pattern is 'file/dir.txt'.

But I think that's the best I can do. So, the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    """
    Given a sequence of path, transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched.

    Args:
