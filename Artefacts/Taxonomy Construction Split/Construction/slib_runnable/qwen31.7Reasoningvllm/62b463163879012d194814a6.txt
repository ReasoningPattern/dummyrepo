Okay, I need to write a Python function called files_list_from_zipfile that takes a zip_path as input and returns the list of files inside that zip file. Let me think about how to do this.

First, I remember that Python has a built-in library for handling ZIP files, which is zipfile. So I should import that. The function needs to open the zip file, read its contents, and then list all the files.

Wait, but how do I open a ZIP file in Python? Oh right, using the zipfile.ZipFile class. So the steps would be: open the zip file, iterate over its members, and collect the names of the files.

But wait, the function needs to return the list of files. So I'll need to open the zip file, then loop through each file in the zip, and collect their names. But I have to make sure that the zip file is properly closed after processing.

So the code would look something like this:

Import zipfile.

Then, in the function:

def files_list_from_zipfile(zip_path):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_file:
        return [member.namelist()]

Wait, but member.namelist() returns a list of all the file names in the zip. So that's straightforward. But wait, does the ZipFile open the file correctly? The 'r' mode is for reading, so that's correct.

But what if the zip file is not accessible? Well, the function is supposed to handle that, but the problem statement doesn't mention error handling. So maybe just return the list as is, assuming the zip is valid and accessible.

So the code would be:

import zipfile

def files_list_from_zipfile(zip_path):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_file:
        return zip_file.namelist()

Wait, but wait, the ZipFile object has a namelist() method that returns a list of all the file names in the zip. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the function is supposed to return the list of files. So using zip_file.namelist() is the right approach.

So the code should be as simple as that. Let me check if there are any possible errors. For example, if the zip file is not a valid ZIP file, but the function is supposed to handle that. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling exceptions, so perhaps the function is expected to return the list regardless.

So the final code is:

import zipfile

def files_list_from_zipfile(zip_path):
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_file:
        return zip_file.namelist()

Yes, that should work. Let me make sure that the function is correctly named and the parameters are correct. The function is named files_list_from_zipfile, and the parameter is zip_path. The docstring says it returns the files in the given zip path. So this should be correct.
