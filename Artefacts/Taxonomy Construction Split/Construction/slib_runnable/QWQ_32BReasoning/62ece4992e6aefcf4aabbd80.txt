Okay, I need to write a Python function called remove_ending_os_sep that takes an input list and returns a new list with the trailing os separators removed from each string. Let's see. The docstring says if the input list is None, return an empty list. So first, I should check if input_list is None. If it is, just return [].

Next, for each string in the input list, I have to check two things: whether the string's length is greater than one, and if the last character is the os separator. Wait, the os separator can be either '/' or '\' depending on the OS, right? But in Python, when dealing with paths, the os module's sep variable gives the correct separator for the current OS. So maybe I should use os.sep here. Oh, but maybe the function is supposed to handle any path separators, like both '/' and '\'? Or just the current one? The problem says "pathname separator", so I think using os.sep is the right approach. Although sometimes people might use '/' regardless of the OS, but the function should probably stick to the OS's own separator.

Wait, the doc mentions "trailing os separator characters". Hmm, perhaps it's referring to any occurrence of the separator at the end, even multiple ones? Like if a string ends with "//", then we should remove those. But the description says "trailing os separator characters", so maybe just the last one if it's present. Or maybe all trailing separators?

Wait the doc says "remove trailing os separator characters". So perhaps we need to strip all trailing separators. But the example might be, for a string like "path/to/file/", we should return "path/to/file". But how to do that in Python?

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants to just check if the last character is a separator (regardless of how many there are) and remove it once if present. Let me read the doc again. The function says "remove trailing os separator characters". So perhaps we need to remove all trailing instances. Like, for a string ending with multiple separators, remove them all until the last character is not a separator.

Wait, the first condition is: "Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator." Wait, the wording here is a bit confusing. The function tests each string to see if its length is greater than one (so, at least two characters?), and if the last character is the separator. Then, in that case, do we remove the last character? Or do we process all strings regardless of their length, but only check if the last character is a separator?

Hmm, the exact wording is "if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator". So, the condition is that the string's length is > 1 AND the last character is a separator. Wait, but even if the string is length 1, if that single character is a separator, maybe we should remove it? But according to the condition, the length must be greater than one. Wait, maybe the first part is checking that the string has more than one character so that we can check the last one. Because if it's only one character, you can't have a trailing separator unless that's the only character, but maybe the function doesn't consider those cases. Let me think again. The doc says "tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator". So, if the string is of length 1, it won't be considered. So for example, a string like "/", which is length 1, would not have its separator removed. But maybe that's intended. The function's requirement is to remove the trailing separators only when the string is longer than one character and ends with the separator.

Wait, perhaps the first part is a condition: if the string's length is greater than one (so at least two characters) and the last character is a separator, then we process it. So in that case, for each string in the list, we check if len(s) > 1 and s[-1] == os.sep. If so, we remove the last character. But maybe even if the string is longer, like "a/b/c/", we want to remove all trailing separators. So perhaps we should use a while loop to remove all trailing separators, but only if the string length is more than 1?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to just remove the last character if it's a separator, but only when the string has length more than one. Wait, but the problem says "trailing os separator characters" plural. So maybe there can be multiple. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to remove all trailing separators. Let's see.

So the steps are:

1. If input_list is None, return empty list.

2. For each string in input_list:

   a. Check if the string is non-empty (but the condition says length >1? Wait the doc says "tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator".

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse that again. The function is to iterate over each string in the list and remove trailing os separators. For each string, the test is two conditions: length is greater than one, and the last character is the separator. So, if both are true, then we need to process the string. So, in that case, the function would only remove the last character if both conditions are true. Wait, but what if the string is exactly one character and it's a separator? Then, since the length is not greater than one, the function leaves it as is. But maybe that's a corner case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first condition is that the length is greater than one OR the last character is the separator? No, the wording uses "and", so both must be true. So for a string of length 1, even if it ends with a separator, it won't be stripped. But maybe the user wants to remove the separator even if the string is length 1? The problem says "each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the separator". So only when both are true. So in that case, for example, a string like "a/" would be stripped to "a", but a string like "/" (length 1) would remain as is.

Hmm. So the function's logic would be:

For each string in the input list:

   if the string is longer than 1 characters, and ends with os.sep, then strip the last character. But if it's exactly 1 character, even if it is a separator, we don't do anything.

Wait, but maybe the user wants to check if the string is non-empty (length >=1) and ends with a separator, but then only remove the separator if the length is more than 1? Or perhaps the first condition is that the length is at least 2 so that the last character can be checked. But the wording says "length is greater than one" (so >1, which is 2 or more) and the last character is a separator. So the function should process those strings.

Wait, maybe the function should check the last character regardless of the length, but only if the length is at least 1? Because a single character that is a separator would be length 1, but maybe the user wants to remove that too. The current wording might not cover that. Let me re-read the docstring:

Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator. So, the two conditions must be met. So only when the string is longer than one character, and the last character is a separator, then we remove the last character. So in the case of a single-character separator, we don't remove it. But perhaps the intended behavior is to remove the trailing separator regardless of the string's length, as long as it's non-empty?

Hmm. Well, I'll follow the docstring's wording. So the steps are:

For each string in the input list (assuming input_list is not None):

   if len(s) > 1 and s ends with os.sep, then we remove the last character. But maybe even if the string is longer than 1, but has multiple separators at the end, like "dir//", then the trailing // would still be there. So perhaps the function should remove all trailing separators until the last character is not a separator. Or maybe just the last one if it's a separator and the length is >1.

The doc says "remove trailing os separator characters" so plural, so maybe all trailing ones. So perhaps the correct approach is to strip all trailing os.sep characters, but only if the string length is greater than 1? Or maybe the condition is just that the last character is a separator, but the string is longer than 1. So in that case, even if the string is longer than 1 but ends with a separator, we remove the last occurrence. Wait, no. To remove all trailing separators, we might need to process the string until the last character is not a separator. For example, "a/b/" becomes "a/b", but "a//b/" would become "a//b".

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to just check the last character. If it's a separator and the length is more than 1, then chop it off once. That would be simpler, and maybe that's what the user wants. Because the description says "remove trailing os separator characters", but the conditions are "length >1 and last character is separator". So maybe just the last character.

Hmm. Let me think of possible test cases. Suppose the input is ["a/", "/b", "c//", "d"], then the output should be ["a", "/b", "c", "d"]? Wait, let's see:

For "a/": len is 2>1, last is /, so yes, remove last character → "a".

For "/b": len is 2, last is 'b', so no change → "/b".

For "c//": the last character is /, so yes, but after removing the last /, the next character is also /, but since the length was 3 (if "c//" is length 3?), then after removing the last /, it becomes "c/" (length 2), which again ends with a separator. So maybe in that case, we need to check again?

Wait the problem says "remove trailing os separator characters". So perhaps the function should remove all trailing separators. So for "c//", the result would be "c".

Hmm, but how to do that? Maybe using a loop. For each string, while the last character is os.sep and the length is more than 1, we can strip it. Or perhaps using a string's rstrip method. But os.sep can be either / or \, so for example, on Windows, it's \. So, if the string ends with \, then we need to remove it. But rstrip would require knowing the character to strip. So for the string, we can use s.rstrip(os.sep) but that might not be possible because rstrip takes a string of characters to strip, but here we can pass os.sep as the character. Wait, actually, rstrip can take a single character. Wait, no, the rstrip function can take a set of characters to strip from the end. For example, s.rstrip(os.sep) would work because os.sep is a single character. So that could be a way to do it. Let me think: s.rstrip(os.sep) would remove all trailing instances of os.sep. But the problem says "tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator". So maybe the function should only remove the last character if both conditions are true. So for example, if the string is "a//", then its length is 3, which is greater than one, and ends with / (assuming os.sep is /), so we can remove the last character. But after that, the string becomes "a/", which is length 2. So the last character is still a separator, and since the length is still >1, we can check again and remove again. So to handle that, using rstrip would be better. Because the current wording's conditions are only checking if the last character is a separator and length>1, but maybe in the code, we can do a more thorough stripping.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants to just remove the last character if it is a separator and the string has length greater than one. So for a string like "a//", the first check would see the last character is /, and length 3>1, so remove last character to get "a/", which then has length 2>1 and ends with /, so another removal? But according to the problem's wording, each string is tested once. So the function would only do the check once per string. Hmm, that's a problem. Because in that case, the function would only remove the last separator once. So "a//" would become "a/" which is not desired. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to use rstrip to remove all trailing separators, but only if the string is not empty and the last character is a separator, but with the condition that the length is greater than 1?

Wait, the problem says to check if the length is greater than one and the last character is the separator. So for each string, if those conditions are true, then we can process it. But processing it would involve removing the trailing separator. But how? Let's see:

Suppose the string is "abc/". Its length is 4>1, ends with /, so we can do s[:-1].

But for "abc//", the length is 5>1, ends with /, so after s[:-1] becomes "abc//", which again ends with /, so the next time, but since the function is processing each string once, perhaps it's better to remove all trailing separators, but only if the string's length is more than 1.

Wait, perhaps the problem's wording is a bit ambiguous, but the best approach is to use rstrip(os.sep) on each string. But then, we also have to consider that the string's length must be greater than 1. For example, if the string is just a single character which is the separator, like "/", then since len is 1, we leave it as is. So the code could be:

for s in input_list:

    if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(os.sep):

        s = s.rstrip(os.sep)

    new_list.append(s)

Wait, but using rstrip would remove all trailing separators. So even for "a//", it would become "a".

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects just removing the last character if it's a separator and the length is more than 1. Then, the code would be:

if len(s) >1 and s[-1] == os.sep:

    s = s[:-1]

But then, for the "a//", that would leave it as "a/". So that's not correct. So perhaps the function is supposed to remove all trailing separators, but only if the string's length is more than one. So the correct approach would be to use rstrip, but then check if the resulting string is not empty, etc.

Hmm, the problem's wording says "remove trailing os separator characters". So that implies all trailing ones. So I think using rstrip is the right approach.

So first, import os.

Wait, but the function may not be in an environment where the os module is available. Or is that a given? The problem mentions "pathname separator", so I think it's safe to use os.sep here. So the code should start with importing os.

Wait, the function is supposed to be written by me, so I need to include the import. Wait, but the function signature doesn't have any imports. Oh right, but the code I generate must include the necessary imports.

So in the code, I need to import os.

Wait, but sometimes, maybe the user expects to handle both '/' and backslashes, but perhaps the code should just use the OS's own separator. So that's okay.

Putting it all together:

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):

    if input_list is None:

        return []

    result = []

    for s in input_list:

        if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(os.sep):

            s = s.rstrip(os.sep)

        result.append(s)

    return result

Wait, but what about the case where the string is exactly one character and it's a separator? Like s = os.sep. Then len(s) is 1, so the condition is not met, so it remains. That's correct per the docstring.

Another case: empty string. Well, if the string is empty, then len is 0, so no change. So that's okay.

Wait, but the problem says "tested if its length is greater than one and if the last character is the pathname separator". So, if the string is of length 1 (like "/"), the first condition (len>1) is false, so it's not processed. So the code is correct.

Wait, but what about a string with a single character that's not a separator? Like "a". Then it stays as is. That's fine.

Hmm, but how to test the endswith. Alternatively, the endswith method would check if it ends with the separator. So even if the string has multiple separators at the end, endswith is true, so we can rstrip them all. So that's better than just slicing once.

Therefore, the code should import os. But in the function, the code must be inside. So the code would start with:

import os

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):

    ... the rest as above ...

Wait, but the user might want to use the same separator regardless of OS, but the problem says "pathname separator", so it's correct to use os.sep.

Wait, maybe there's a cross-platform consideration here. Like, on Windows, the separator is \, but sometimes paths can have / as well, but the function should only check for the current OS's separator. Or perhaps the function is supposed to handle any path separators, but that complicates things. The problem's wording says "pathname separator", so the correct approach is to use os.sep.

So, putting all together. The code would be:

import os

def remove_ending_os_sep(input_list):
    """
    If input list is None, return []
    Iterate over a string list and remove trailing os seperator characters.
    Each string is tested if its length is greater than one and if the last
    character is the pathname seperator.
    Returns:
    A list after removing trailing os seperator characters.
    """
    if input_list is None:
        return []
    result = []
    for s in input_list:
        if len(s) > 1 and s.endswith(os.sep):
            s = s.rstrip(os.sep)
        result.append(s)
    return result

Wait, but what about strings like "a/b/c/". The len is 5>1, ends with /, so rstrip would remove the trailing /, resulting in "a/b/c".

Another test case: "a\\\" (with a backslash on windows). Wait, if the os is Windows, then os.sep is \. So "a\" would have len 2, so it ends with \, so rstrip would remove the \, resulting in "a".

Wait, but "a\" has length 2, so that's okay. But if the string is just a single backslash, like "\\", then len is 1, so it's not processed. So the result is the same.

Hmm, but in the case of "a//", the code would check if it ends with os.sep (assuming /), so yes. len is 3>1, so it would rstrip, which would remove all trailing /, so becomes "a".

Another case: "a/b/c", no trailing separator, so stays.

What about a string like "a/b/c//"? The code would see the last character is /, so rstrip would remove the two trailing /, resulting in "a/b/c".

So that's correct.

Wait, but in the code above, the check is s.endswith(os.sep). So if the string ends with that, then we do the rstrip. So even if the string has multiple, it will be stripped. So that's better than just slicing once. So the code is okay.

Now, the function must return the list after processing each element.

Wait, but what about the case where the input list is empty? Then it returns an empty list, which is correct.

Another edge case: a string with exactly two characters, like "a/". Then len is 2>1, ends with /, so becomes "a".

So that's correct.

Another case: a string with two separators but not at the end, like "a//b/". The ends with is true, so it would become "a//b".

So that's okay, since the trailing separator is removed.

Hmm, yes, I think that's the right approach. The code should use rstrip to remove all trailing os.sep characters, but only if the original string's length is greater than one and ends with that separator. Wait, but the condition is only checking that the last character is the separator. Because if the string ends with a separator, then even if there are multiple, rstrip would handle it. So the code is okay.

Wait, but the code is:

if len(s) >1 and s.endswith(os.sep):

so, even if the string has multiple separators at the end, it will be stripped. So the code works. So the code is okay.

Wait, but in the problem's description, the first condition is that the length is greater than one. So for a string like "a/", which is length 2, that's okay, but for a string like "a", which doesn't end with the separator, nothing is done. So the code should be okay.

Now, I need to make sure that the code is written correctly. Let's see:

The function returns a list. The code loops through each string in input_list. For each s, if the conditions are met, then s is stripped of trailing os.sep. Then append to the result.

Yes.

Wait, but the function should not modify the original list, just return a new one. So that's handled.

So I think this is the correct code. Let me check again the docstring.

Wait the docstring says "remove trailing os separator characters". So the plural is correct here. The code does that via rstrip.

Another possible way: using a loop to remove the separator as long as the last character is a separator and the length is more than 1. But rstrip is more straightforward.

Therefore, the code should be as written above.
