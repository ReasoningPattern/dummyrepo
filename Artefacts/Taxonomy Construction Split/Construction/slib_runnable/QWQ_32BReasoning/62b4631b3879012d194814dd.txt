Okay, I need to write a Python function called fix_namespace_prefix_w. The goal is to replace all occurrences of "w:st=" with "w-st=" in the given content. Let me think about how to approach this.

Hmm, the function takes a string 'content' as input. So the task is a string replacement. The simplest way would be to use the replace() method. Like, return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st="). But wait, maybe there's more to it? Like, should I check for other instances where 'w:' might appear, but the docstring specifically mentions only "w:st=" needs to be replaced. So I don't have to worry about other prefixes.

Wait, but what if the string has multiple instances? The replace method should handle all of them. Oh right, because replace without counts replaces all. So that's straightforward. So the code is pretty simple.

Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The function's docstring says exactly to replace that exact substring. So I just need to perform a global find and replace. So the code would be as easy as using str.replace. The parameters are correct, the input is a string, and the output is the modified string.

I should test this in my mind. Suppose the input is something like "<element w:st=something>", after replacement it becomes "w-st=". So the function would return the correct string. What about case sensitivity? The example uses lowercase, so I assume the replacement is case-sensitive. The user didn't mention handling other cases, so it's okay.

No other edge cases come to mind. Just a straightforward substitution. Alright, so the code is just one line. The function definition, then return content.replace("w:st=", "w-st="). That's it. I think that's all. Let me write that.
