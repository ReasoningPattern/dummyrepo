Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called make_find_paths that takes a sequence of paths and transforms them into glob patterns. But existing patterns should be left untouched. Hmm, what does that mean exactly?

So, the function's goal is to process each path in the input sequence. If a path is already a glob pattern (like containing wildcards such as * or ?), it should stay as is. Otherwise, convert it into a glob pattern. Wait, but how do I determine if a path is already a glob pattern? Maybe check if it contains any of the glob characters. But the problem says to pass through existing patterns untouched. So perhaps the function is supposed to convert regular paths into glob patterns, but not modify those that are already globs.

Wait, the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So maybe the idea is that if the path is a normal file path, we turn it into a glob that matches exactly that path. But if it's already a glob (like with * or **), we leave it as is. So for example, a path like '/home/user/file.txt' would become '/home/user/file.txt', but a path like '/home/user/*.txt' would stay the same.

But how do I check if a path is already a glob? The glob module in Python might have some functions, but maybe the user expects a simple check for the presence of * or ? in the path. However, that's not entirely accurate because in glob patterns, ** is also used for recursive matches, and maybe other characters. But perhaps the problem is considering any occurrence of * or ? as a glob pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches exactly that path, but if the path already ends with a glob pattern (like *), then it's left as is. Wait, but the wording is a bit unclear. Let me read the docstring again.

The function's description says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So maybe the input paths are either regular paths or already glob patterns. The task is to convert regular paths into glob patterns (like adding a trailing *?), but leave the existing ones as they are.

Wait, but how to differentiate between a regular path and a glob pattern? For example, if a path is 'file.txt', converting it to a glob would be 'file.txt' (since it's an exact match). But if it's 'file*.txt', that's already a glob pattern. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the path contains any glob characters. If it does, leave it as is. If not, add a * to make it a glob pattern that matches exactly that path.

But the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns". So maybe the transformation is to make each path a glob pattern that matches exactly that path. For example, turning 'path/to/file' into 'path/to/file', which is a glob pattern that matches only that exact path. But if the path already has a glob pattern, like 'path/to/*.txt', then it's left as is.

Wait, but in that case, how do we know if it's already a glob? Because even a normal path could have * in it, like a filename with an asterisk. But maybe the function is intended to convert non-glob paths into globs by adding a * at the end. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger system where paths are either literal or glob patterns, and the task is to ensure that all paths are treated as glob patterns, but if they already are, don't change them.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that would match that path exactly. For example, converting 'file.txt' into 'file.txt' (since a glob pattern with no wildcards matches exactly), but if the path is something like 'file*', then it's already a glob and left as is.

But how to implement that? The key is to check whether the path is already a glob pattern. However, there's no built-in way in Python to check if a string is a valid glob pattern. So perhaps the problem is using a simple heuristic: if the path contains any of the glob characters (*, ?, [), then it's considered a glob pattern and left as is. Otherwise, append a * to make it a glob that matches exactly the path.

Wait, but that might not be accurate. For example, a path like 'file?' would be a glob pattern. But if the user intended to have a literal question mark in the filename, that's a problem. However, given the problem statement, maybe the assumption is that any path that contains * or ? is already a glob pattern, and others need to be converted.

So, the approach would be: for each path in find_paths, check if it contains any glob characters. If it does, leave it as is. If not, convert it into a glob pattern by adding a * at the end? Or maybe wrap it in **/*? Wait, no. For example, if you have a path like 'dir/file', converting it to a glob pattern that matches exactly that path would be 'dir/file', because a glob pattern without wildcards matches exactly. But perhaps the function is intended to make sure that each path is a glob pattern that would match itself. So, in that case, the transformation is unnecessary for existing patterns, but for others, they are turned into glob patterns that match exactly.

But in that case, the function would just return the same paths, because even a normal path is a valid glob pattern. Wait, that's confusing. Because a glob pattern like 'file.txt' would match exactly that filename. So maybe the function is intended to do something else. For example, maybe it's supposed to convert paths into patterns that can be used with find, like adding **/ to make them recursive? But the problem statement isn't clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a system where paths are to be converted into glob patterns for searching, and existing patterns (those that are already globs) are left as is. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add a trailing slash and a * to match files within it. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the original problem says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So maybe the function is supposed to take a list of paths and convert them into glob patterns, but if they are already glob patterns (as per some criteria), leave them as is.

But how to determine if a path is already a glob pattern? The problem might be expecting that any path that doesn't have a glob character is considered a literal and thus converted into a glob pattern. For example, converting 'path/to/file' into 'path/to/file' (which is a glob pattern that matches exactly that path), but if the path is 'path/to/*.txt', leave it as is.

Wait, but that's redundant. Because even 'path/to/file' is a valid glob pattern. So maybe the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path exactly, but if the path already contains a glob pattern, then it's left as is. However, in that case, the function would not change any paths, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the original intention is different.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert paths into patterns that can be used with the find command, which uses globbing. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add a '*' to match files in that directory. But again, without more context, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to how the find command in Unix works. For example, if you pass a path to find, it's treated as a literal. But if you want to use a pattern, you have to use glob syntax. However, the function's job is to take the given paths and convert them into glob patterns, but if they are already glob patterns, leave them. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches that path exactly. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file*', then it's already a glob pattern and left as is. But in that case, the function would just return the same paths, which is not useful. So perhaps the function is intended to add a '*' to the end of each path if it doesn't already have any glob characters.

But that's an assumption. Let's think of possible examples. Suppose find_paths is ['a', 'b*'], then the transformed paths would be ['a*', 'b*'].

So the function would check if the path contains any glob characters. If not, append a '*' to make it a glob pattern. If it does, leave it as is.

But how to check for glob characters? The glob module in Python has a function called glob, but checking if a string is a glob pattern isn't directly provided. However, perhaps the problem is using a simple check for the presence of * or ? in the path. So, for each path in find_paths, if it contains * or ?, then it's considered a glob and left as is. Otherwise, append a *.

But that's a possible approach. Let's proceed with that.

So, the code would loop through each path in find_paths. For each path, check if it contains any of the glob characters. If it does, keep it. Otherwise, append a '*' to it.

Wait, but what about other characters like [ or ] which are used in glob patterns for character ranges? Maybe the problem considers those as part of a glob pattern as well.

So, the code would need to check if the path contains any of the glob special characters. The glob special characters are *, ?, [, and ] (though [ and ] are used for character classes). So perhaps the function checks if any of these characters are present. If yes, leave it as is. If not, append a *.

But how to implement that? Let's think.

In Python, for each path in find_paths, we can check if any of the characters in the path are in the set {'*', '?', '[', ']'}.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only * and ? as the glob characters. For example, in the context of the find command, * is a wildcard, but ? is also a wildcard. However, [ and ] are part of extended glob patterns, but maybe the problem is not considering them. But since the docstring says "pass through existing patterns untouched", perhaps the function is intended to check if the path is already a glob pattern (as per some definition) and leave it, else convert it.

But without more context, I need to make an assumption here. Let's proceed with the idea that any path containing * or ? is considered a glob pattern, and others are converted by appending *.

So, the code would look like this:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if any(c in path for c in ['*', '?']):
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            transformed.append(path + '*')
    return tuple(transformed)

Wait, but that might not be correct. For example, if a path is 'file*', then it's a glob pattern. But if the path is 'file', then adding * would make it 'file*', which is a glob pattern that matches files starting with 'file'.

But perhaps the intended behavior is to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches exactly that path. However, in glob syntax, a literal path doesn't need any changes. So maybe the function is supposed to do nothing, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to convert paths into patterns that can be used with the find command, which requires that patterns are properly formed. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add a '*' to match files inside it. But again, without knowing the exact requirements, this is speculative.

Another possibility is that the function is part of a system where paths are to be converted into glob patterns for some specific use, like in a file search. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add '**/' to make it recursive. But again, the problem statement isn't clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take paths and turn them into glob patterns that match the entire path. For example, converting 'a/b/c' into 'a/b/c' (which is a valid glob pattern), but if the path is 'a/b/*', then leave it as is.

But then, the function would just return the same paths. Which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the original intention is that the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that would match that path exactly. However, in glob syntax, that's just the path itself. So why transform it? Unless there's a specific way to represent it, like adding a trailing slash or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to convert each path into a pattern that matches that path exactly, but using the glob syntax. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', then the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file', then the glob pattern is 'file' (which matches exactly that name). But then, why transform? Unless the original paths are being treated as literal paths and need to be converted into patterns that match them exactly. But that's redundant.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is referring to converting paths into glob patterns that would match the entire path, but with some specific transformation. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add a '*' to match files inside it. But again, without more context, this is hard.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to escape any special characters in the path so that they are treated as literals. But that's the opposite of what the docstring says.

Wait, the problem says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that matches exactly that path. For example, if the path is 'a/b/c.txt', then the glob pattern would be 'a/b/c.txt', which matches exactly that file. But if the path is already a glob pattern, like 'a/b/*.txt', then it's left as is.

But again, how to determine if the path is already a glob pattern. The problem might be using the presence of * or ? as indicators. So, for each path, if it contains * or ?, then it's considered a glob pattern. Otherwise, it's treated as a literal and converted into a glob pattern by adding * at the end.

But that's an assumption. Let's proceed with that logic.

So the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if '*' in path or '?' in path:
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            transformed.append(path + '*')
    return tuple(transformed)

But wait, what about paths that have [ or ]? Like 'file[0-9].txt'? Those are also glob patterns. So the check should include those as well. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention them. However, the function's name is make_find_paths, which might be related to the find command in Unix, which uses glob patterns. In that case, the standard glob characters are *, ?, and [ (with ] closing it). So perhaps the check should be for any occurrence of these characters.

But how to check that? Maybe using a regular expression. For example, check if the path contains any of the glob characters. However, the problem says to pass through existing patterns untouched. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the path is already a glob pattern, and if not, convert it into one.

But without knowing the exact criteria for what constitutes a glob pattern, this is tricky. However, given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended approach is to check if the path contains any of the standard glob characters (*, ?, [) and if not, append a * to make it a glob pattern that matches exactly that path.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern that would match that path exactly, but in a way that's compatible with the find command. For example, if the path is a directory, you might need to add a '*' to match files inside it, but if it's a file, just use the path as is. But again, without knowing the exact use case, this is hard.

But given the problem statement, I think the best approach is to assume that any path that doesn't contain * or ? is considered a literal and needs to be converted into a glob pattern by appending a *.

So, the code would check for the presence of * or ? in the path. If present, leave it. Otherwise, append *.

But perhaps the problem expects that the function converts the paths into glob patterns that match the entire path. For example, converting 'a/b/c' into 'a/b/c' (which is already a glob pattern). So maybe the function is supposed to do nothing, but that's not the case. Therefore, maybe the original problem is different.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert the paths into glob patterns that match the entire path, but in a way that's used by some library. For example, in some contexts, you might need to add a trailing slash to directories. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern that would match that path exactly, but in a way that's compatible with the fnmatch module. For example, if the path is 'file.txt', then the glob pattern is 'file.txt'. If the path is 'file', then the glob pattern is 'file' (which would match that exact name). However, the problem says to transform all paths into glob patterns. But if they are already glob patterns, leave them. So perhaps the function is redundant unless there's a specific transformation.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a pattern that would match that path exactly, but using the ** syntax for recursive matching. But that's unclear.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended solution is to check if the path contains any glob characters. If not, append a * to make it a glob pattern. So, the code would be as follows.

Another thought: the function returns a tuple of transformed paths. So for each path in find_paths, we need to check if it's already a glob pattern. If not, convert it into one. But how?

Maybe the problem is referring to the fact that in some systems, when you pass a path to a function that uses globbing, you need to ensure that it's a glob pattern. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add a '*' to match all files in that directory. But again, without more context, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert each path into a glob pattern by adding **/ to make it recursive. But that's not clear.

Given the lack of clarity, perhaps the best approach is to look for existing patterns. For example, if the path ends with a slash, it's a directory, and adding a * would make it a glob pattern for files in that directory. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to escape any existing glob characters in the path, but that's the opposite of what the docstring says.

Wait, the docstring says "transform all path into glob patterns. Pass through existing patterns untouched." So the function's purpose is to ensure that all paths are glob patterns. But if they are already glob patterns, leave them. So, for example, if the path is a literal, convert it into a glob pattern. But how?

If the path is a literal, the glob pattern that matches it exactly is the same as the path. So, no transformation needed. But then why is the function called? Unless the original paths are being treated as something else, like shell patterns, and the function is converting them into proper glob patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert paths into patterns that can be used with the find function, which requires certain syntax. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add a '*' to match files in that directory. But again, not sure.

Given that, perhaps the intended solution is to check if the path is already a glob pattern (contains * or ?), and if not, append a * to it. That seems like a possible approach, even if it's a bit simplistic.

So, the code would be:

def make_find_paths(find_paths):
    transformed = []
    for path in find_paths:
        if '*' in path or '?' in path:
            transformed.append(path)
        else:
            transformed.append(path + '*')
    return tuple(transformed)

But maybe the problem expects that the function is converting the paths into patterns that can be used with the find command, which requires that you use patterns like 'path/*' to match files in a directory. However, if the path is a file, then it's just the filename. But the function is supposed to transform all paths into glob patterns. So perhaps adding a '*' to each path, but if the path already has a '*', then leave it as is.

But that would mean that even a path like 'file.txt' becomes 'file.txt*', which might not be intended. However, given the problem statement, this might be the expected behavior.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to add a '*' only if the path does not end with a slash. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add '*' to match files inside. But again, without more info, it's hard.

In the absence of clear specifications, I'll proceed with the initial approach: check if the path contains * or ?. If not, append a * to make it a glob pattern that matches exactly that path. So the code would be as written above.

Testing with some examples:

If find_paths is ['a', 'b*'], then transformed would be ['a*', 'b*'].

If find_paths is ['a*', 'b?c'], then transformed would be ['a*', 'b?c'].

But maybe that's not correct. For example, if the path is 'a/b/c', then adding * would make it 'a/b/c*', which matches files starting with that path. But perhaps the intended transformation is to make it a pattern that matches the exact path, which is just the path itself. So the function would not change anything. But that can't be right because the docstring says to transform them.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to converting paths into patterns that are used for matching, but ensuring that they are properly formed. For example, if the path is a directory, you might want to add a '*' to match files inside. But again, not sure.

Another possibility: the function is part of a library that uses glob patterns, and the existing patterns are those that are already in glob format. For example, if the path is 'path/to/file', it's converted into 'path/to/file' (which is a glob pattern that matches exactly that path). But if the path is 'path/to/*.txt', it's left as is.

But in that case, the function would not change any paths, which is not useful. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects that the paths are converted into glob patterns that match the entire path, but with some specific transformation. For example, adding **/ to make it recursive. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to convert each path into a glob pattern by adding a '*' at the end, but only if it doesn't already have a '*' in it. That seems like a possible approach.

So, the code would be as follows. Let's proceed with that.
