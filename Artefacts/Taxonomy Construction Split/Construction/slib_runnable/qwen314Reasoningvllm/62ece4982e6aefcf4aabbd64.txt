Okay, I need to write a Python function called strip_root that takes a path and a root, and removes the root from the path. If it fails, it should throw an exception. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to remove the root part from the given path. So, for example, if the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home', the result should be 'user/file.txt'. But how do I handle different cases? Like if the path starts with the root, or if the root is a substring somewhere else in the path?

The docstring says that if it fails, it should throw an exception. So I need to check if the root is actually a prefix of the path. If not, raise an error. But what's the exact condition for failure? Probably if the path doesn't start with the root, or if the root is not a valid directory.

Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to remove the root only if it's exactly at the beginning. For example, if the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home', then stripping it would leave 'user/file.txt'. But if the path is '/homeuser/file.txt', then the root isn't a prefix, so it should throw an exception.

So the first step is to check if the path starts with the root. If it does, then we can remove the root and return the remaining part. Otherwise, raise an exception.

But how to check that? In Python, I can use the startswith method. However, I need to be careful with trailing slashes. For example, if the root is '/home/' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', then the startswith would still return True. But maybe the root should be considered as a directory, so perhaps we need to ensure that the root is a proper prefix, possibly with a trailing slash.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to work with file paths, and the root is a directory that's a prefix of the path. So, for example, if the path is 'C:/Users/John/file.txt' and the root is 'C:/Users', then stripping would give 'John/file.txt'.

But how to handle cases where the root is not a prefix? Like if the path is 'home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home'? Then the startswith would check for the exact beginning. So maybe the function expects that the root is exactly at the start of the path. So, if the path starts with the root, then we can strip it. Otherwise, raise an error.

So the steps would be:

1. Check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception.
2. If it does, return the path with the root removed.

But how to handle cases where the root is a substring but not at the beginning? Like if the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is 'home'? Then the startswith would return False, so the function would raise an error. That's correct because the root isn't at the start.

But what about if the root is empty? Well, the function's parameters probably assume that root is a valid string. But maybe we need to handle that case. However, the problem statement doesn't mention it, so perhaps we don't need to handle that. The user might pass an empty root, but in that case, the function would return the original path, but maybe that's considered a failure? Hmm, the docstring says "If fails, throw exception", but what's considered a failure?

The problem says to throw an exception if it fails. So, perhaps the failure is when the root is not a prefix of the path. So, the function should check if the path starts with the root. If not, raise an exception. But maybe also check that the root is not longer than the path. For example, if the path is 'file.txt' and the root is '/home', then the path doesn't start with the root, so it's a failure.

So the code would be something like:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

Wait, but what if the root is a directory and the path is a file inside it? Like, if the root is '/home/user' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', then stripping the root would give 'file.txt'. But if the root is '/home/user/', then the path starts with that, and stripping would give 'file.txt' as well.

But the startswith method checks for the exact beginning. So, if the root has a trailing slash, the path must also have that. For example, if the root is '/home', then the path '/home/user' starts with it. But if the root is '/home/', then the path must start with '/home/'.

But maybe the function should handle cases where the root is a directory, regardless of trailing slashes. For example, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', then stripping the root would leave 'user/file.txt'. However, if the root is '/home/' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', then the startswith would check for '/home/' as a prefix. So the path would start with that, and stripping would give 'user/file.txt'.

But perhaps the user expects that the root is a directory, so maybe the root should end with a slash. Or maybe not. The function's parameters don't specify, so I need to follow the given docstring. The docstring says to remove the root from the path. So if the root is a prefix, regardless of trailing slashes, then it's okay.

But in the example, if the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home', then stripping it would leave 'user/file.txt'. But if the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home/', then the path starts with '/home/'? No, because the path is '/home/user...', so the startswith would check if the path starts with '/home/', which would be true if the path is '/home/user...'.

Wait, no. Let's think. The path is '/home/user/file.txt', and the root is '/home/'. The path starts with '/home/'? Let's see: the path starts with '/home', but the root is '/home/'. So the path starts with the root only if the root is exactly at the beginning. So in this case, the path starts with '/home', but the root is '/home/', which is longer. So the startswith would return False. Therefore, the function would raise an error.

But maybe that's not the intended behavior. For example, if the root is '/home' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', then stripping the root would leave 'user/file.txt'. However, if the root is '/home/' and the path is '/home/user/file.txt', then the root is a prefix of the path (since '/home/' is the first part). But in that case, the path starts with '/home/', so the startswith would return True.

Wait, the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home/'. Let's check:

path.startswith(root) would be True if the root is '/home/'? Because the path starts with '/home/'. Let me see: the path starts with '/home', but the root is '/home/'. So the path starts with the root only if the root is exactly the first part. For example, if the path is '/home/user/file.txt', then the first 5 characters are '/home', but the root is '/home/' (6 characters). So the startswith would check if the path starts with the root. Let's take an example:

path = '/home/user/file.txt'
root = '/home/'
path.startswith(root) would check if the first 6 characters are '/home/'. But the path's first 6 characters are '/home/'? Wait, the path is '/home/user/file.txt', so the first 5 characters are '/home', then the next character is '/', so the first 6 characters are '/home/'. So yes, if the root is '/home/', then the path starts with it. Therefore, stripping would give 'user/file.txt'.

But maybe the function is supposed to remove the root regardless of trailing slashes. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is intended to check if the root is a prefix of the path. So, the code would be as I wrote before.

Another thing: the path could be a relative path. For example, if the path is 'user/file.txt' and the root is 'user', then stripping would leave 'file.txt'. But if the root is 'users', then it's not a prefix and would throw an error.

So the function is straightforward: check if the path starts with the root. If it does, return the substring after the root's length. Otherwise, raise an exception.

Now, what about cases where the root is longer than the path? Like path is 'file.txt' and root is '/home/user'? Then path.startswith(root) would be False, so the function raises an error.

But what if the root is exactly the same as the path? Like path is '/home' and root is '/home'? Then stripping would return an empty string. Is that acceptable? The docstring says it returns a path without the root, so that's correct.

Now, the exception: the problem says to throw an exception if it fails. So, perhaps a ValueError with a message indicating that the root was not found in the path.

So the code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

Wait, but what if the root is an empty string? Then path.startswith('') returns True, because an empty string is a prefix of any string. So in that case, the function would return the entire path. But maybe that's considered a failure? The problem statement doesn't specify, but the function's parameters probably assume that root is a non-empty string. However, the code as written would handle that case, but perhaps the user expects that the root is a valid directory path. However, the problem doesn't mention that, so maybe we don't need to handle that. The function's responsibility is to remove the root if it's a prefix, else throw an error.

Another edge case: if the path is exactly the root. Then, stripping would return an empty string. But according to the function's docstring, that's acceptable.

So the code seems correct. Let me test a few examples.

Example 1:
path = '/home/user/file.txt', root = '/home'
strip_root returns 'user/file.txt'

Example 2:
path = '/home/user/file.txt', root = '/home/'
strip_root returns 'user/file.txt' because the path starts with '/home/'.

Wait, in example 2, the path is '/home/user/file.txt', which starts with '/home/'? Let's see:

The root is '/home/', which is 6 characters (including the slash). The path starts with '/home/'? Let me check:

The first 6 characters of the path are '/home/'? The path is '/home/user/file.txt' — the first 5 characters are '/home', then the sixth is '/', so yes. So path.startswith(root) would be True. So the code would return path[6:] which is 'user/file.txt'.

But maybe the user intended that the root is a directory, so the root should end with a slash. However, the function's parameters don't specify that. So the code is correct as per the given instructions.

Another example: path is 'home/user/file.txt', root is 'home'. Then, the code would return '/user/file.txt' — but wait, the path starts with 'home', so stripping would leave the rest. But if the path is a relative path, then stripping the root 'home' would leave '/user/file.txt'? That depends on how the paths are structured. But according to the function's logic, it's correct.

But perhaps the function should handle absolute and relative paths correctly. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so the code is written as per the given function signature.

So the code seems to be as simple as that. Now, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, but the assistant should output only the code, not any explanation. So the final code would be:

def strip_root(path, root):
    """
    Remove root from path. If fails, throw exception

    Returns:
        A path without root
    """
    if not path.startswith(root):
        raise ValueError("Root not found in path")
    return path[len(root):]

Wait, but what if the root is not a directory? For example, if the path is '/home/user/file.txt' and the root is '/home/user', then stripping would leave 'file.txt'. But if the root is '/home/user/file', then the path starts with that, and stripping would leave '.txt'. However, the function's job is just to remove the root if it's a prefix. It doesn't check whether the root is a directory or not. The problem statement doesn't mention that, so the code doesn't need to handle that. The exception is only raised when the root is not a prefix.

So the code is correct. Therefore, the generated code is as above.
