Okay, I need to write a Python function called files_list that returns the list of files in a given path. The user provided a function signature and a docstring, so I should follow that.

First, I remember that the os module has a listdir function which returns all entries in a directory. But wait, I should check if the path is a directory or a file. If it's a file, os.listdir would throw an error, so I need to handle that.

I'll start by importing os. Then, in the function, I'll try to list the directory. If it fails because it's not a directory, I'll catch the OSError and return an empty list instead of crashing.

So, the function will try os.listdir(path), and if that works, return the list. If not, return an empty list. That makes sense because if the path is a file, there are no directories to list, so an empty list is appropriate.

I should make sure the code is clean and only returns the list as per the docstring. No explanations or extra stuff, just the code.
