Okay, I need to write a Python function called get_pattern that converts a given pattern into a regex pattern object. The function should accept either a string or a regex pattern object. It also has an optional strip parameter which, if True, will remove spaces at the start and end of the string. 

First, I'll check if the input is a string. If it is, I'll need to create a compiled regex pattern from it. I remember that the re.compile() function is used for this. But before compiling, I should strip the spaces from the beginning and end of the string if strip is True. So I'll use the strip() method on the string after checking the condition.

If the input is already a regex pattern object, I can just return it as is. However, I should make sure that it's a string before proceeding. Wait, no, because if it's not a string, the function should handle it. So perhaps I should check if the pattern is an instance of re.Pattern. If it is, return it. Otherwise, treat it as a string.

Wait, but what if someone passes another type, like a list or something else? The docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe I should assume that the pattern is either a string or a re.Pattern object. So in the function, I'll first check if pattern is an instance of re.Pattern. If yes, return it. If not, treat it as a string.

So the steps are:

1. Import the re module.
2. Define the function get_pattern with parameters pattern and strip=True.
3. Check if pattern is an instance of re.Pattern. If yes, return it.
4. If not, create a string from pattern. If strip is True, strip whitespace from both ends.
5. Compile the stripped string into a regex pattern object and return it.

Wait, but if the pattern is a string, I should process it only if strip is True. So I'll have to handle that condition.

Let me structure the code:

Import re at the top.

Inside the function:

if isinstance(pattern, re.Pattern):
    return pattern
else:
    # treat as string
    s = str(pattern).strip() if strip else str(pattern)
    return re.compile(s)

Wait, but what if pattern is a string but after stripping, it's empty? Like an empty string. Well, re.compile will handle that, but maybe it's better to handle it, but the user might pass an empty string, so perhaps it's okay.

Putting it all together, the code will look like:

import re

def get_pattern(pattern, strip=True):
    if isinstance(pattern, re.Pattern):
        return pattern
    else:
        s = str(pattern).strip() if strip else str(pattern)
        return re.compile(s)

Wait, but what if the pattern is a list or another iterable? The function will throw an error when trying to str(), which is correct because the function expects a string or a regex object.

Yes, that should cover the cases. So the function first checks if it's a regex object, returns it. Otherwise, converts it to a string, applies strip if needed, and compiles it.
