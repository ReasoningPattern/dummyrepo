Okay, I need to generate a Python method called from_raw_values that's a class method for a Bookmarks class. The docstring says it creates a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark strings. Hmm, so first, I should figure out what the Bookmarks class looks like. Since it's a class method, the first parameter is cls, which refers to the class itself. The method takes a list called values.

Assuming that each raw bookmark string is in a specific format, maybe something like "title,url,tag" separated by commas. The Bookmarks object probably holds a collection of Bookmark instances. So each string in values should be parsed into a Bookmark object. 

Wait, but I don't know the structure of the Bookmark class. Let's think: maybe each bookmark has attributes like title, URL, and tags. So the method would split each string into parts, create a Bookmark instance with those parts, and add them to the Bookmarks collection. 

The function needs to return a new Bookmarks instance containing all the parsed bookmarks. So inside the method, I'll probably loop through each value in the values list, split them into components, then create a Bookmark for each. Then, add all those to the cls's list or whatever data structure it uses. 

Wait, the method is called from_raw_values, so maybe the Bookmarks class has an internal list of bookmarks. The class method would create a new instance of Bookmarks, populate it by parsing each string, and return that instance. 

So the steps are: 

1. Create a new Bookmarks object. 
2. For each string in values:
   a. Split the string into parts. Probably by comma, but maybe there's a different separator. The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe assume comma-separated. 
   b. Create a Bookmark instance with those parts. The order would be important here. Like title first, then url, then tags? Or maybe the tags are a list. Wait, perhaps the tags are separated by another delimiter, like a semicolon. But the problem doesn't say, so maybe each bookmark is a single line with title, url, and tags as separate elements. 

Alternatively, maybe each raw value is a line from a file where each line has the bookmark's data. Let's assume each line is split into title, url, and tags. For example, a line like "Google,https://google.com,search,tech" would split into ["Google", "https://google.com", "search", "tech"], where the first two elements are title and URL, and the rest are tags. 

So, in the code, for each value in values, split by comma. Then, the first part is title, second is URL, and the remaining parts are tags. So create a bookmark with title, url, and tags list. 

But how does the Bookmark class handle tags? Maybe it expects a list, so the tags would be the parts after the first two. 

Wait, the method is part of the Bookmarks class, so perhaps the Bookmarks class is a container for multiple bookmarks. So the from_raw_values method would take each raw string, parse it into a bookmark, and add each to the container. 

So the code would look like this: 

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()  # Create new instance of the class
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        # Assuming parts[0] is title, parts[1] is url, parts[2:] are tags
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmark = Bookmark(title, url, tags)  # Or however the Bookmark is initialized
        bookmarks.append(bookmark)  # Assuming Bookmarks has an append method
    return bookmarks

Wait, but the code needs to be part of the Bookmarks class. The method is a class method, so it's probably defined with @classmethod. But the user provided the function signature as def from_raw_values(cls, values):. So in the code, I need to make sure that the Bookmark instances are created and stored in the Bookmarks instance. 

However, I might not know the exact structure of the Bookmark class. Maybe the Bookmark has a constructor that takes title, url, and tags. Alternatively, maybe the tags are a single string separated by something else, but since the problem says "raw bookmark string values", perhaps each value is already split into the necessary components. 

Wait, the problem says "raw bookmark string values", so each element in the values list is a string that represents a bookmark. The exact parsing is up to me, but since the user hasn't specified the format, I have to make a reasonable assumption. 

Another possible format is that each bookmark string is in the form "title <url> [tag1, tag2]". But without more info, maybe the simplest way is to split each string into parts by comma, and the first two are title and URL, and the rest are tags. 

Assuming that the Bookmarks class has an __init__ that initializes an empty list, and an add method (or append) to add Bookmark objects. 

Wait, maybe the Bookmarks class is a list subclass? Like if it's a subclass of list, then it can have the append method. 

So putting it all together, the code would be something like:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
    return bookmarks

But wait, the Bookmark class might be a separate class. How do I reference it here? The problem says "Bookmarks object", so perhaps the Bookmark is part of the same structure. Maybe the Bookmarks class contains a list of bookmarks, each of which is a dictionary or another class. 

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class has an internal list, and each entry is a tuple (title, url, tags). But the code needs to work with whatever the class structure is. 

Assuming that the Bookmark class is correctly set up, and the Bookmarks class is a container that can be initialized as cls(), then the code should work. 

Wait, but if this method is part of the Bookmarks class, then the Bookmark class must be a separate class. So the code would require that the Bookmark class is imported or defined in the same module. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, I'll have to proceed with the code as is, using Bookmark as the class. 

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class itself holds the data, like each bookmark is stored as attributes. But that's less likely. More probable that each bookmark is an object in a list. 

So the code would look like the above. But I need to make sure that the class method is properly decorated. Wait, the function is supposed to be a method, so the correct way would be to have the @classmethod decorator. 

Therefore, the code should start with that. Also, the user said to output the code in Python markdown format, which probably means just the code with triple backticks. 

Wait, the user's instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I need to wrap the code in triple backticks. 

Putting it all together, here's the code. I'll assume that the Bookmark class is properly imported and has an __init__ that takes title, url, and tags. Also, that the Bookmarks class has an append method. 

Wait, but if the Bookmarks class is a subclass of list, then it can use append directly. So the code would be as above. 

But maybe the tags are supposed to be a list, so parts[2:] must be split again if they are comma-separated? No, because in the example I thought of, parts[2:] would already be the tags. 

Alternatively, perhaps the raw strings have the tags separated by commas, but that's already handled by splitting the entire string once. 

Yes, so the code should split each value into parts by commas, then the first two are title and URL, and the rest are tags. 

So the final code would be something like that. I need to make sure that it's properly indented and uses the class method syntax. 

Wait, the method is part of the Bookmarks class. So the code would be inside the class. But the user wants just the method generated, based on the signature and docstring. 

Wait, the function signature is given as def from_raw_values(cls, values):. So perhaps the code is supposed to be the body of that method. 

Therefore, the code should be written as:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    """
    Create a Bookmarks object from a list of raw bookmark string values.
    """
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',', 2)  # Split into 3 parts, so that tags can have commas? Wait, maybe the initial split is only on the first two commas. Alternatively, if the tags can contain commas, then this approach is flawed. But without knowing the exact format, perhaps it's best to split on commas and take all parts after the second as tags. 

Wait, the problem states "raw bookmark string values". Maybe each value is a line from a file where each line has title, url, and tags separated by commas. So for example, a line like "Google,https://www.google.com,web,search" would split into ["Google", "https://www.google.com", "web", "search"], so title is first, url second, and the rest are tags. 

Therefore, the code as I had before should work. 

Another consideration: what if a line has less than two commas? Like a title but no URL? Then parts[1] would be an error. But perhaps the method expects that each value in the list is properly formatted. So maybe we can just proceed. 

So the code would be:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
    return bookmarks

Wait, but the method is a class method, so the first line would be cls = cls, so creating a new instance with cls(). 

Wait, the first line is bookmarks = cls() which initializes a new Bookmarks object. Then appending each parsed bookmark. 

Assuming that the Bookmarks class has an append method, which it would if it's a list subclass. 

So the code should be enclosed in a class, but the user only wants the method's code. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should be the method's body. 

Wait, the function signature is given as a method (def from_raw_values(cls, values)), so the code should be the implementation of that method. 

But the method is part of the Bookmarks class, so the code must be inside the class, decorated with @classmethod. 

But the user wants only the code, so I need to write the method as part of the class. 

Wait, perhaps the code is to be written as part of the class. So, the full code would include the class, but the user just provided the function's signature. Hmm, maybe the code is to be written as a standalone method, but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the user is expecting the code for the method within the class. So the correct approach would be to write the method with the @classmethod decorator, and then the code as I have. 

Wait, the user's example says to output the code in Python markdown format, so within triple backticks. So the code would include the decorator and the method's body. 

Wait, but the given function's signature is def from_raw_values(cls, values):. So the code should be the method's body. 

So putting it all together, the code would be as follows. Let me check again. 

Wait, perhaps the Bookmark is part of the same class? Or maybe it's another class. Since the docstring mentions a Bookmarks object, which holds multiple bookmarks, I think Bookmark is a separate class. 

But without knowing how the Bookmark is structured, perhaps the code should use a dictionary instead. Maybe the Bookmarks class holds a list of dictionaries. 

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class has an __init__ that takes a list of bookmarks, each being a tuple or a dictionary. 

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But given the problem's constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that each bookmark is an instance of a Bookmark class with title, url, and tags as attributes. 

Therefore, the code would be as written above. 

Wait, but the method is part of the Bookmarks class. So the code must be inside that class. So the user is expecting the code for the method within the class. 

So the final code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',', 2)
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2].split(',')] if len(parts) > 2 else []
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
    return bookmarks

Wait, wait a second. The split with 2 as the maxsplit would split into 3 parts: title, url, and the tags part as a single string. Then split that third part into individual tags. 

Alternatively, if the maxsplit isn't set, then parts would be split on every comma, but that would split the tags into separate elements. 

Wait, maybe the third part (tags) can contain commas if the tags themselves are in quotes or something, but the problem says "raw values", so perhaps that's not the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps each tag is separated by commas, so the tags are parts[2], parts[3], etc. So parts[2:] are all the tags. 

So in that case, the code would be:

parts = value.split(',')

Then parts[0] is title, parts[1] is URL, parts[2:] are tags. 

So the code would be as I first had. 

But in that case, if a URL contains a comma, this would break. But since it's a raw value, maybe the input is properly formatted. 

The problem's docstring doesn't specify, so I'll proceed with that approach. 

So the code is:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
    return bookmarks

Wait, but the method is a class method, so the first line must be inside the class, decorated with @classmethod. 

Wait, the user's function signature is given as a method, so the code must include that. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring. So the code should start with the @classmethod, then the def, but since it's part of the class, I need to make sure that's included. 

Wait, but how is the code structured? The user might be expecting the code to be inside the Bookmarks class, so the full code would look like:

class Bookmarks:
    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        ... the code here ...

But the user wants only the code based on the given signature and docstring, so perhaps just the method's body. 

Alternatively, the user might want the code as part of the class, so the code block would include the class and the method. 

Hmm, the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". The function signature is given as a method, so the code should be the method's implementation, including the decorator and the docstring. 

Wait, the user provided the docstring as part of the function signature. So the code should be the method as written. 

Therefore, the code would be enclosed in a class, but since the user only provided the method's signature, maybe they just want the method's code. 

Alternatively, perhaps the method is supposed to be part of the class, so the code should be written as such. 

Assuming that the Bookmarks class is a list of Bookmark instances, and the method is part of that class, the code would have to be written with the @classmethod decorator, and the method's body. 

So putting it all together, the code is as I wrote earlier. 

Wait, but the first line of the method is creating a new instance of cls (Bookmarks), then appending Bookmark instances. 

But what if the Bookmarks class doesn't have an append method? Then it would fail. But the problem states that the method should create a Bookmarks object, so I think the class is designed to be a container where append is possible. 

Therefore, the code should be written as above. 

Wait, but the user's code may not have a Bookmark class. Maybe the Bookmarks class holds data in another way. For example, each entry is a dictionary. 

In that case, the code would be:

def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',', 2)
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2].split(',')] if len(parts) > 2 else []
        bookmarks.append({'title': title, 'url': url, 'tags': tags})
    return bookmarks

But since the problem mentions "Bookmarks object", which probably has Bookmark instances, I think the first approach is better. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmark is a dataclass. But without knowing, I can't be sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class is a collection where each element is a tuple. 

But given the ambiguity, the best approach is to proceed with the initial code. 

Wait, but the user might not have the Bookmark class in the same module. Maybe they have it as a separate class. 

In any case, the code must be written as per the given function signature and docstring. 

So I'll proceed with the code that splits the value into parts, creates a Bookmark instance with title, url, and tags, then appends to the bookmarks instance. 

Wait, but in the code, the Bookmark class must be imported. But since the user didn't mention that, perhaps the code should assume that the Bookmark class is in the same scope. 

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class itself holds the data, so each entry is a dictionary. 

Hmm, perhaps I should go with the code that uses the cls's own structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmarks class has an __init__ that takes a list of bookmarks, each as a tuple. 

But without more info, the code as written earlier is the best I can do. 

Wait, in the first code I wrote, parts[2:] would include all elements after the first two. So if the value is split into parts, and the first two are title and URL, then the rest are tags. 

So for example, if a value is "Title, http://url.com, tag1, tag2", then parts after splitting would be ['Title', 'http://url.com', 'tag1', 'tag2'], so parts[2:] would be ['tag1', 'tag2'], and tags would be those stripped. 

Yes. 

So the code is correct. 

Now, I have to write that code in the required format, without any explanations. 

Wait, the user said "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be inside triple backticks. 

Also, the method must be decorated with @classmethod. 

Wait, the given function's signature is def from_raw_values(cls, values):, so the code must include that. 

Putting it all together:

The code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
    return bookmarks

Wait, but the Bookmark class might not be accessible. Oh well, the user probably expects that. 

Alternatively, maybe the Bookmarks class is a list of tuples. So then the code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmarks.append( (title, url, tags) )
    return bookmarks

But that depends on how the Bookmarks class is structured. 

Hmm. Since the problem doesn't specify the structure of the Bookmark instances, perhaps the code should just store the parsed data as a list of dictionaries or tuples within the Bookmarks object. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmarks class has an __init__ that takes a list of bookmarks, each as a dictionary. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to be part of a class that handles bookmarks as individual entries. 

Wait, perhaps the Bookmarks class is a container, and each entry is a dictionary with title, url, and tags. 

In that case, the code would look like the second example. 

But given the problem's wording, the method is creating a Bookmarks object, which probably contains Bookmark objects. 

Assuming that the Bookmark class exists, the first code is correct. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with that code. 

Wait, but in the code, the Bookmark is called, but the user's code may not have that. So maybe the code is part of a module where Bookmark is defined elsewhere. 

Since the problem doesn't give any more details, I think that's the best approach. 

So the code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
    return bookmarks

Wait, but the user might not have the Bookmark class. Maybe the Bookmarks class has its own way of storing the data. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmarks class is a list of Bookmark instances, but the Bookmark is a nested class. 

Hmm, but I can't assume that. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to return a list of the parsed parts. But the docstring says "Create a Bookmarks object", so that's not the case. 

Another possibility is that the Bookmarks class has an __init__ that takes a list of those parts, but that's unclear. 

Well, given the information, I think the code I have is the best possible. 

Now, I need to present it in the correct format. 

The user wants the code in Python markdown format, so using triple backticks. 

Also, the code must be inside the class, so perhaps the full code includes the class definition. 

Wait, no. The function signature is given as a method, so the code is just the method's implementation. 

Wait, but class methods are defined within a class. So the code would be part of the Bookmarks class. 

Therefore, the code should be written as part of the class. 

Wait, the user's problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code they need is the method's body. 

Wait, the function signature includes 'def from_raw_values(cls, values):', so the code must be the method's body. 

Therefore, the code should be enclosed in the @classmethod decorator and the method's def, then the body. 

Wait, but when writing the code, the user might have the Bookmark class in the same file. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Bookmark is a typo, and the code is supposed to use the cls (Bookmarks) to create the instances. But that doesn't make sense. 

Hmm. Maybe I should avoid using the Bookmark class and instead have the Bookmarks class hold the data in some way. 

Alternatively, maybe each bookmark in the Bookmarks is a simple data structure like a dictionary. 

Then, the code would be:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',', 2)
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2].split(',')] if len(parts) > 2 else []
        bookmarks.append({'title': title, 'url': url, 'tags': tags})
    return bookmarks

Wait, but splitting into 2 would make parts[2] the rest of the string after splitting on two commas. So for a string like "Title,url,tag1,tag2", splitting with maxsplit=2 would give ['Title', 'url', 'tag1,tag2'], then the tags would be split again by commas. 

Wait, perhaps that's a better approach. Because otherwise, if the URL has a comma, the split would be incorrect. 

Wait, but the problem says "raw bookmark string values". If the URL contains commas, then this method would fail. 

Hmm, this is a problem. The initial approach might have an issue if the URL contains commas. 

But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the format is that each value is structured as title,url,tag1,tag2,tag3 etc. So the first two elements are title and URL, and the rest are tags. 

Therefore, splitting on commas without a maxsplit is okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps the tags are separated by a different character. 

But since the problem doesn't say, I can't adjust for that. 

So proceeding with the first approach. 

Wait, but maybe the tags are a single string, so parts[2] is the tags string. 

Wait, perhaps the raw value is like "title,url,tag1,tag2" where the first two are title and url, and the rest are tags. 

So splitting on commas gives all parts. So parts[0] is title, parts[1] is URL, parts[2:] are tags. 

Yes. 

Therefore, the code is as previously written. 

Now, I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted. 

Wait, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, so wrapped in triple backticks. 

Also, the code must be inside the class. So the full code would look like:

class Bookmarks:
    @classmethod
    def from_raw_values(cls, values):
        bookmarks = cls()
        for value in values:
            parts = value.split(',')
            title = parts[0].strip()
            url = parts[1].strip()
            tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
            bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
        return bookmarks

But the problem says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. The given signature is def from_raw_values(cls, values):. 

So the code should be the method's body, but enclosed in the class. 

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the method's code block. 

Wait, the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must start with the @classmethod and def, then the body. 

Therefore, the code to output is:

@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
    return bookmarks

But I have to include the triple backticks as per the markdown format. 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be enclosed in ```python ... ```.

Therefore, the final answer would be:

```python
@classmethod
def from_raw_values(cls, values):
    bookmarks = cls()
    for value in values:
        parts = value.split(',')
        title = parts[0].strip()
        url = parts[1].strip()
        tags = [tag.strip() for tag in parts[2:]]
        bookmarks.append(Bookmark(title, url, tags))
    return bookmarks
```

Wait, but in the problem's function signature, the method is part of the class. So the code should have the @classmethod decorator before the method. 

Yes, that's correct. 

I think that's the code they are expecting. I'll proceed with that.
