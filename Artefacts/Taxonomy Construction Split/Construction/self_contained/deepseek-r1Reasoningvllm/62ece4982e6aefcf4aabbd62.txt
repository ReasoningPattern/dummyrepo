Okay, I need to write a Python function called _replace_url_args that takes two arguments: url and url_args. The goal is to replace the query parameters in the url with those in url_args. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should parse the url to extract its components. Using urllib.parse might be helpful here. I remember that urlparse can split a URL into its components like scheme, netloc, path, query, and fragment.

So, I'll import urlparse from urllib.parse. Then, I'll parse the input url. The result will give me the query part as a string.

Next, I'll parse the url_args. If url_args is a dictionary, I can use urlsplit again to get the query parameters. I'll need to check if url_args is not None and is a dictionary before proceeding. If it's None, I'll return the original url.

Once I have the query parts from both the original url and url_args, I'll combine them. I should process the parameters in url_args first, so if a key exists in both, the url_args value should take precedence. So, I'll update the query parameters with url_args over the original ones.

After updating the query string, I'll reconstruct the URL. I'll create a new ParseResult object with the scheme, netloc, path, and the updated query. Then, I'll join these components back into a URL string.

I should also handle cases where url_args might have keys that are not present in the original query, which should be fine since the update will include them.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Parse the input url to get its components, focusing on the query part.
2. If url_args is a dictionary, parse its query parameters.
3. Update the original query parameters with those from url_args, ensuring url_args values take precedence.
4. Reconstruct the URL with the updated query parameters.
5. Return the modified URL.

I need to make sure that if url_args is None, the function doesn't crash and just returns the original url. Also, if the query parts are empty or not present, the function should handle that gracefully.

Testing edge cases: what if the original url has no query parameters? Then the url_args should be used as the new query. What if url_args is empty or None? The function should return the original url.

Putting it all together, I'll write the function step by step, making sure each part is handled correctly. I'll use urlparse to manipulate the URLs and dictionaries to handle the parameters.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
