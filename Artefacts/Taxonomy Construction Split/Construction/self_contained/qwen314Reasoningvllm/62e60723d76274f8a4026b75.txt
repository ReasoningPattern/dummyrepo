Okay, I need to write a Python function called round_half_to_even that takes a floating-point number n and rounds it. The docstring says it's for rounding, but the specific method isn't mentioned. Wait, the name suggests it's using "round half to even" strategy, which is the default rounding mode in Python's round function. So maybe the user wants me to implement that.

Wait, but the default round in Python already does round half to even. For example, round(2.5) is 2, round(3.5) is 4. So why would they need a custom function? Maybe they want to ensure that the rounding is done correctly, or perhaps they want to handle some edge cases differently?

Alternatively, maybe the user is expecting a different approach, like using decimal module for more control. But the function signature is simple, and the docstring is minimal. The problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps just using the built-in round function is sufficient here.

Let me check the parameters. The function takes n as a float. The built-in round function in Python does exactly what the name implies: rounds to the nearest even number when the number is exactly halfway between two integers. So for example, round(1.5) would be 2, round(2.5) would be 2, etc.

So the implementation would be straightforward: return round(n). But maybe the user wants to handle numbers with more decimal places? Wait, the function's name is round_half_to_even, which is the same as the default rounding mode. So perhaps the function is just a wrapper around the built-in round function.

But why would someone write this function then? Maybe they want to make it explicit, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. However, given the information, the correct approach is to use the built-in round function. Let me test some examples.

For instance, if n is 2.5, round(n) gives 2. If n is 3.5, it gives 4. That matches the half-to-even behavior. So the code would be as simple as returning round(n). But wait, the function is supposed to take a floating-point number. What about numbers that are not exactly halfway? Like 2.3, which should round to 2, or 2.6 to 3. The built-in round handles that correctly.

So the function can be implemented as def round_half_to_even(n): return round(n). But maybe the user expects some other method, like using the decimal module with ROUND_HALF_EVEN. Let me think. The decimal module allows for more precise control over rounding, but the default round in Python already uses round half to even. So unless there's a specific reason to use decimal, the built-in function is sufficient.

But perhaps the question is a trick, and the user wants to confirm that the default round is being used. In that case, the answer is just to return round(n). However, I should make sure that the function is correctly handling the input. The parameter n is a float, so no issues there.

Another possibility: maybe the user is on a system where the rounding mode is different, but in Python, the round function is supposed to use round half to even regardless. So the code should be correct.

Therefore, the generated code is simply returning the built-in round of n. I'll write that.
