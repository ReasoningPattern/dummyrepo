Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function int_to_string based on the given signature and docstring. Let's see. The function takes a number, an alphabet list, and an optional padding. The goal is to convert the number into a string using the specified alphabet, with the most significant digit first. 

First, I should understand how to map the number to the alphabet. Since it's a short uuid, maybe it's similar to base conversion. For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then each digit of the number in base 3 would correspond to a character in the alphabet. But wait, the number is an integer, so I need to process each digit of the number when converted to the base of the alphabet's length.

Wait, the alphabet is a list of strings. So the length of the alphabet determines the base. For instance, if the alphabet has 26 characters, it's base 26. So the process is: take the number, divide it by the base, get the remainder each time, and map those remainders to the corresponding characters in the alphabet. But since the most significant digit comes first, I need to collect the characters in reverse order and then reverse them at the end.

Let me think about the steps. Let's say the number is 123, alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], base is 3. Then 123 divided by 3 is 41 with remainder 0, then 41 divided by 3 is 13 rem 2, then 13 divided by 3 is 4 rem 1, then 4 divided by 3 is 1 rem 1, then 1 divided by 3 is 0 rem 1. So the remainders are 0,2,1,1. Then reverse them to get 1,1,2,0. Then map each to the alphabet: ['a', 'a', 'b', 'a']? Wait, no. Wait, the remainder for each step gives the index into the alphabet. So for remainder 0, it's 'a', 1 is 'b', 2 is 'c'. Wait, but the example I thought of would be 123 in base 3 is 11020 (since 1*3^4 + 1*3^3 + 0*3^2 + 2*3^1 + 0*3^0 = 81 + 27 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 114, which isn't 123. Maybe I should recalculate. Let me check 123 divided by 3:

123 /3 = 41, rem 0 → 0 → 'a'

41 /3 = 13 rem 2 → 2 → 'c'

13 /3 = 4 rem 1 → 1 → 'b'

4 /3 = 1 rem 1 → 1 → 'b'

1 /3 = 0 rem 1 → 1 → 'b'

So the remainders are [0,2,1,1,1], reversed gives [1,1,1,2,0], which would be 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a' → "bbbc a"? Wait, but the order is most significant first. So the first remainder is the least significant digit. So when we collect the digits, we need to reverse them to get the correct order.

So the process is: repeatedly divide the number by the base (length of alphabet), collect the remainders, then reverse the list of characters to get the most significant first.

But what if the number is zero? Then we need to handle that case, because if the alphabet includes '0', but maybe the function is designed to handle it. Wait, the docstring says the number represents a short uuid. UUIDs are usually non-zero, but maybe the function should handle zero as well. So, if the number is zero, the output should be the first character of the alphabet, unless padding is specified.

Wait, the function's parameters are number (int), alphabet (List[str]), and padding (Optional[int]). The padding is optional. So if padding is provided, the output string should be padded with leading characters from the alphabet to reach that length. But how? For example, if the number converts to a string of length 2, and padding is 5, then add three leading characters (probably the first one) to make it 5 characters long.

But first, the main conversion. Let's outline the steps:

1. Check if the number is zero. If so, return the first character of the alphabet unless padding is specified, in which case pad to the required length.

Wait, no. For example, if the number is zero, then the converted string should be the first character of the alphabet. Because when you divide zero by the base, you get remainder zero, so the digits list would be [0], then reversed to [0], so the string is alphabet[0]. But if padding is required, say padding=5, then the string should be padded with leading characters. So for example, if the original string is 'a' (from 0), and padding is 5, then add four 'a's in front? Or maybe pad with the first character of the alphabet?

But the padding is optional. So the function needs to handle that. Let me think about the steps.

First, handle the case where the number is zero. Then, for each digit in the number, we get the remainder when divided by the base, then divide the number by the base, and repeat until the number is zero. Then collect the remainders in reverse order.

But wait, the order is most significant first. So when we collect the remainders, they are least significant first, so we need to reverse them.

So, for example, number 123, base 3, the remainders collected would be [0, 2, 1, 1, 1], then reversed to [1,1,1,2,0], which maps to the alphabet's characters at those indices.

But the alphabet is a list. So the index is the remainder. So for each remainder, we take alphabet[remainder].

But what if the alphabet is not long enough? Well, the function's parameters probably assume that the alphabet is valid. So we can proceed under that assumption.

Now, the code steps:

- Determine the base as the length of the alphabet. Let's call it base = len(alphabet)
- If the number is zero, return alphabet[0] unless padding is specified. Wait, but if padding is specified, then we need to return a string of length padding, filled with the first character. For example, if padding is 5, then 'aaaaa'?

Wait, the docstring says that padding is optional. So if padding is provided, the output string should be padded with leading characters (from the alphabet) to reach the desired length. But how to determine which characters to use for padding? For example, if the converted string is 'abc' and padding is 5, then we need to add two characters before it. But which ones? Probably the first character of the alphabet, but maybe the last? Or maybe the padding is done with the first character?

Wait, the problem says "the output has the most significant digit first". So when padding, we need to add characters to the left (beginning) of the string. For example, if the original string is 'a' (length 1) and padding is 3, then the result would be 'aaa'? Or maybe the padding is added to the right? Wait, no. Because the most significant digit comes first. So padding would be adding leading characters. For example, if the number is 0 and padding is 5, then the string is 'aaaaa'.

But how to handle the padding? Let's think.

First, convert the number to the string using the alphabet. Then, if the padding is specified, pad the string with the first character of the alphabet (or maybe the last?) to the left until the length is padding. Wait, but what if the padding is less than the length of the converted string? Then we need to truncate? Or maybe the padding is only applied if the converted string is shorter than the padding. The docstring says "Optional with int value", but it's not clear. However, the standard approach for padding in such conversions is to pad with leading characters (like in base64 encoding, but that's different). So, for example, if the converted string is 'abc' and padding is 5, then we add two leading characters. But which ones? Probably the first character of the alphabet. Because when you have a number that's smaller than the base^padding, you can pad it with leading zeros (or whatever the first character is).

But perhaps the padding is meant to be the minimum length. So if the converted string is shorter than padding, add leading characters (from the alphabet) to reach the desired length. If it's longer, then just return the converted string.

So, the steps would be:

- Convert the number to the string using the alphabet, as per the base conversion.
- If padding is provided, check if the length of the converted string is less than padding. If so, prepend the first character of the alphabet (or maybe the last?) to make it padding length. But which one?

Wait, in UUIDs, sometimes padding is done with zeros, but here the alphabet is arbitrary. So perhaps the padding is done with the first character of the alphabet. For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then padding with 'a's.

But let's think about the example. Suppose the number is 0, and padding is 5. Then the converted string is 'a', but we need to pad it to 5 characters. So the result would be 'aaaaa'.

Another example: number is 1, alphabet is ['a', 'b'], padding is 3. The converted string is 'b', then pad with two 'a's to get 'aab'.

Wait, but the most significant digit first. So when you pad, you add characters to the left. So the padding is added to the left.

So, the code would first generate the string, then if padding is provided, check if the length is less than padding. If so, prepend the first character of the alphabet (or maybe the last?) to reach the desired length.

But the problem says that the output has the most significant digit first. So when the number is converted, the first character in the string is the most significant. Therefore, when padding, we need to add characters to the left (beginning) of the string.

But how to determine which character to use for padding? For example, in base 10, padding with zeros. But here, the alphabet is arbitrary. So perhaps the padding is done with the first character of the alphabet. Or maybe the last? Or maybe the first character is used as the padding character.

Alternatively, maybe the padding is done with the first character of the alphabet. For example, in the case of zero, the string is 'a' (if the alphabet starts with 'a'), and padding to 5 would be 'aaaaa'.

So, the code steps:

Handle the case when number is 0. If the alphabet is empty, that's an error, but the function parameters probably ensure that the alphabet is non-empty.

So, code outline:

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:

    base = len(alphabet)
    if base == 0:
        raise ValueError("Alphabet cannot be empty")
    # Handle number 0
    if number == 0:
        return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)
    # Otherwise, perform the conversion
    digits = []
    while number > 0:
        remainder = number % base
        digits.append(alphabet[remainder])
        number = number // base
    # Reverse the digits to get most significant first
    digits = digits[::-1]
    # Now, apply padding if needed
    if padding is not None:
        if len(digits) < padding:
            digits = [alphabet[0]] * (padding - len(digits)) + digits
        elif len(digits) > padding:
            # Truncate? Or raise error? The docstring doesn't specify. Maybe truncate?
            # But the problem says padding is optional. So perhaps if padding is provided, and the length is longer, just return as is?
            # Or maybe the padding is the minimum length. Let's assume that if padding is given, the output is padded to that length, adding leading characters if necessary. If the converted string is longer than padding, maybe it's not truncated. But that's unclear. The problem says "the output has the most significant digit first" but doesn't specify what to do when padding is given and the length is longer. However, in the case of UUIDs, padding is usually to a fixed length. So perhaps if the padding is provided, the output is padded to that length, adding leading characters. If the converted string is longer than padding, then it's not truncated. But maybe the function should raise an error if the number is too large for the padding? Or maybe just return the converted string as is.

But the docstring says "the output has the most significant digit first" but doesn't mention truncation. So perhaps the padding is only applied if the converted string is shorter than the padding. So, if the converted string is longer, we just return it. Otherwise, pad with leading characters.

So, in code:

digits = digits[::-1]

if padding is not None:

    if len(digits) < padding:

        digits = [alphabet[0]] * (padding - len(digits)) + digits

    elif len(digits) > padding:

        # Maybe truncate? Or leave as is? The problem says nothing. Let's assume that padding is the minimum required. So if the converted string is longer, we don't pad. But perhaps the padding is the desired length, and if the converted string is longer, it's not truncated. So the code would just pad to the desired length if needed.

But how to handle when the number is zero and padding is given? For example, if number is zero, then the initial string is alphabet[0], and if padding is 5, then we need to pad it to 5 characters. So in that case, the code would return alphabet[0] * padding.

So, putting it all together:

First, check if the number is zero. Then, return the appropriate string.

Else, process the number into digits, then reverse them.

Then, apply padding if needed.

But how to handle the case where the number is zero and padding is None? Then return alphabet[0].

So, code steps:

if number == 0:

    if padding is not None:

        return alphabet[0] * padding

    else:

        return alphabet[0]

Else:

    process digits as before.

But wait, what if the alphabet has more than one character? For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then number 0 would be 'a', and padding 3 would be 'aaa'.

But then, for the digits list, when the number is not zero, we collect the digits in reverse order. For example, number 1 would be 1 % 3 = 1 → alphabet[1], then number becomes 0. So digits is [alphabet[1]], reversed gives [alphabet[1]], which is 'b' if the alphabet is ['a','b','c'].

Wait, let me think again. Let's take number 1, base 3. The process is:

number = 1

remainder = 1 % 3 → 1 → append alphabet[1] → digits is ['b']

number becomes 0. So the loop ends. Then digits is reversed → ['b'], so the string is 'b'.

But if the padding is 3, then we need to add two leading characters. So the digits list is ['b'], then padding adds two 'a's → ['a', 'a', 'b'] → 'aab'.

But how to handle the padding? Let's code that.

So, the code:

digits = []

while number > 0:

    remainder = number % base

    digits.append(alphabet[remainder])

    number = number // base

digits = digits[::-1]

Then, if padding is not None, check if len(digits) < padding. If so, prepend (padding - len(digits)) times the first character of the alphabet.

Wait, but the digits list is reversed. Let me think with an example.

Suppose the number is 123, base 3. The digits collected during the loop are [0, 2, 1, 1, 1], then reversed to [1,1,1,2,0]. So the string is alphabet[1] + alphabet[1] + alphabet[1] + alphabet[2] + alphabet[0]. Wait, no. Wait, the digits list after reversal is [1,1,1,2,0], so each element is the index into the alphabet. So the characters would be alphabet[1], alphabet[1], alphabet[1], alphabet[2], alphabet[0]. So the string is 'b b b c a' → 'bbbc a'? Wait, but the order is most significant first. So the first digit in the reversed list is the most significant. So the code is correct.

Now, the padding part. Suppose the converted string is 'bbbc a' (length 5), and padding is 3. Then the code would check if len(digits) < padding. But 5 is larger than 3, so no padding. But if padding is 6, then add 1 character to the front. So the code would do:

digits = [alphabet[0]] * (padding - len(digits)) + digits.

But wait, the digits list is [1,1,1,2,0], which is length 5. If padding is 6, then we need to add 1 character to the front. So the new digits list is [alphabet[0]] + [1,1,1,2,0], which would be the first character followed by the existing digits. So the string would be alphabet[0] + alphabet[1] + ... etc.

But what if the padding is less than the length of the digits? Then, the code would not pad. But maybe the padding is supposed to be the minimum length. For example, if the number is 123, which converts to a string of length 5, and padding is 3, then the output is the original string. But perhaps the padding is supposed to be the desired length, and if the converted string is shorter, pad it. If it's longer, then it's left as is. So the code would do that.

Now, code:

But first, need to handle the case where the number is zero. So:

if number == 0:

    result = alphabet[0]

else:

    process the digits.

But then, after processing the digits, if padding is given, check if the length is less than padding. If so, prepend the first character.

Wait, but what if the padding is None? Then, just return the result.

So, putting it all together:

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:

    base = len(alphabet)

    if base == 0:

        raise ValueError("Alphabet cannot be empty")

    if number == 0:

        return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)

    digits = []

    while number > 0:

        remainder = number % base

        digits.append(alphabet[remainder])

        number = number // base

    digits = digits[::-1]

    result = ''.join(digits)

    if padding is not None:

        if len(result) < padding:

            result = alphabet[0] * (padding - len(result)) + result

    return result

Wait, but in the case where the number is zero and padding is provided, we return alphabet[0] multiplied by padding. But what if the padding is zero? Well, the function's parameters probably assume that padding is a positive integer. But since it's optional, maybe we should handle that. However, the docstring says padding is optional, but doesn't specify. So perhaps the code should check if padding is not None and positive. But the problem says to generate code based on the given signature, so maybe we don't need to handle that. Let's assume that padding is a non-negative integer.

Wait, but if padding is zero, then the code would return an empty string? But that's probably not intended. However, the function's parameters may not have constraints on padding. So perhaps the code should handle that, but the problem says to generate code based on the given signature, so maybe just proceed.

But in the case where number is zero and padding is None, return alphabet[0]. If padding is given, return alphabet[0] multiplied by padding. But what if padding is zero? Then it would return an empty string. But maybe that's not a problem. Let's proceed.

Wait, but for example, if the number is zero, and padding is 5, then the result is 'aaaaa' (assuming alphabet starts with 'a').

But what if the alphabet is ['a', 'b'], and the number is zero, padding is 3 → 'aaa'.

But what about when the number is not zero, and after conversion, the length is less than padding. For example, number is 1, alphabet is ['a', 'b'], padding is 3. The converted string is 'b', then pad with two 'a's → 'aab'.

But what if the padding is 2? Then the converted string is 'b', which is length 1. So pad with one 'a' → 'ab'.

But what if the padding is 0? Then the code would return an empty string. But that's probably not intended. However, the function's parameters don't specify, so perhaps it's acceptable.

But let's think about the case when the number is zero and padding is None. The code returns alphabet[0], which is correct.

Now, testing this code.

Test case 1: number=0, alphabet=['a','b','c'], padding=5 → 'aaaaa'.

Test case 2: number=0, padding=None → 'a'.

Test case 3: number=1, alphabet=['a','b'], padding=3 → 'aab'.

Test case 4: number=3, alphabet=['a','b','c'], padding=2 → 'cc' (since 3 in base 3 is 10 → digits [0,1], reversed [1,0] → 'bc'? Wait, no. Wait, let's compute:

number=3, base=3.

Loop:

number=3 >0.

remainder = 3%3 = 0 → append alphabet[0] → 'a'.

number = 3//3 = 1.

remainder = 1%3 = 1 → append alphabet[1] → 'b'.

number = 1//3 = 0. Loop ends.

digits is ['a', 'b'], reversed → ['b', 'a'] → 'ba'.

So the string is 'ba'. If padding is 2, then len is 2, so no padding. So returns 'ba'.

But if padding is 3, then len is 2 <3, so add one 'a' → 'aba'.

Wait, but the code would do:

result = 'ba'

if padding is 3:

    if len(result) < padding → yes, 2 <3.

    result = alphabet[0] * (3-2) + result → 'a' + 'ba' → 'aba'.

Yes.

Another test case: number=123, alphabet=['a','b','c'], base=3.

Let me compute 123 in base 3:

Let me calculate 123 divided by 3:

123 /3 = 41, rem 0 → 'a'

41 /3 = 13 rem 2 → 'c'

13 /3 = 4 rem 1 → 'b'

4 /3 = 1 rem 1 → 'b'

1 /3 = 0 rem 1 → 'b'

digits collected are [0,2,1,1,1], reversed → [1,1,1,2,0] → 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a' → 'bb bca' → 'bbc a'? Wait, the order is [1,1,1,2,0], so the characters are alphabet[1], alphabet[1], alphabet[1], alphabet[2], alphabet[0]. So if alphabet is ['a','b','c'], then that would be 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a' → 'bbbc a' → 'bbbc a' → 'bbc a'? Wait, the string is 'bbbc a'? Wait, no, the digits list after reversal is [1,1,1,2,0], so the string is alphabet[1] + alphabet[1] + alphabet[1] + alphabet[2] + alphabet[0] → 'b' + 'b' + 'b' + 'c' + 'a' → 'bb bca' → 'bbbc a'? Wait, no, the order is 1,1,1,2,0 → 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a' → 'bb bca' → 'bbbc a'? Wait, the order is most significant first. So the first digit in the reversed list is the most significant. So the string is 'b' followed by 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a' → 'bbbc a'? Wait, the digits are [1,1,1,2,0], so the string is 'b' (from index 1) + 'b' (index 1) + 'b' (index 1) + 'c' (index 2) + 'a' (index 0) → 'bbbc a' → 'bbbc a'? Wait, that's 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a' → 'bb bca' → 'bbc a'? Wait, the order is correct. So the code would generate that.

But what if the alphabet is not in the order of the digits? For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'c', 'b'], then the same number would be mapped to different characters.

So the code is correct as long as the alphabet is properly mapped.

Now, code:

But the code as written would handle that.

Now, code:

But need to import List and Optional from typing.

But the user didn't specify, but the function signature uses List and Optional, so the code should include those.

But the user says to generate the code, so the code should have the necessary imports.

Wait, but the user didn't mention that. However, in the function signature, the parameters are List[str] and Optional[int]. So the code should import those.

But the user's code may have those imports already. However, since the user hasn't included them, perhaps the code should include them.

But the user says to generate the code based on the function signature. So the code should have the necessary imports.

But the user may not want the imports included. Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature. So the code should be written as a function, and the imports are part of the code. However, the user may not have mentioned them, but the function uses List and Optional, so the code should have:

from typing import List, Optional

But the user's code may not include that. However, the function is supposed to be written with those types. So the code should include the necessary imports.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code should include the imports.

Wait, but the function is written as:

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:

So the code would need to import List and Optional from typing. So the code should start with:

from typing import List, Optional

But the user didn't mention that, but the function uses them. So perhaps the code should include those.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature. So the code should have the imports.

But the user may not want the imports, but in Python, they are necessary. So the code should include them.

But the user's example code may not have them, but the function uses them. So the code must have them.

So the code would be:

from typing import List, Optional

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    """
    Convert a number to a string, using the given alphabet.

    @param padding : Optional with int value
    @return  string value corresponded to int
    """
    base = len(alphabet)
    if base == 0:
        raise ValueError("Alphabet cannot be empty")
    if number == 0:
        return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)
    digits = []
    while number > 0:
        remainder = number % base
        digits.append(alphabet[remainder])
        number = number // base
    digits = digits[::-1]
    result = ''.join(digits)
    if padding is not None:
        if len(result) < padding:
            result = alphabet[0] * (padding - len(result)) + result
    return result

Wait, but what if the padding is less than the length of the result? For example, number is 123, which converts to a string of length 5, and padding is 3. Then the code would not pad, and return the original string. But maybe the padding is supposed to be the minimum length. However, the problem says that padding is optional, so perhaps the code should not truncate. So the code is correct.

But another edge case: number is zero and padding is zero. Then the code returns alphabet[0] * 0 → empty string. But that's probably not intended, but the function's parameters don't specify, so it's up to the code.

Another edge case: alphabet has only one character. For example, alphabet = ['a'], then any number would be converted to a string of 'a's. For example, number=5, base=1. Wait, but base=1 would cause division by zero? Wait, no. Because in the code, base is len(alphabet). If the alphabet has length 1, then base is 1. Then, when processing the number, in the loop:

number = 5, base=1.

remainder = 5 % 1 → 0. digits.append(alphabet[0] → 'a').

number = 5 // 1 → 5. So the loop continues.

This would loop indefinitely. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because when base is 1, the loop will run forever. So how to handle that?

But the problem says the number represents a short uuid. UUIDs are typically in base 16 or similar. But the function is supposed to handle any alphabet. However, if the alphabet has length 1, then the code would have an infinite loop. So perhaps we need to handle that case.

But the docstring doesn't mention this. So perhaps the function assumes that the alphabet has length >= 2. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we need to handle it. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature. So perhaps the code is expected to handle that.

But if base is 1, then the code would have an infinite loop. So how to handle that?

Wait, the code for base 1 would not work. Because when you divide by 1, the remainder is always 0, and number remains the same. So the loop would run forever. So, need to handle base=1 as a special case.

But the problem says that the number represents a short uuid. So perhaps the alphabet is supposed to have at least two characters. But since the function allows any alphabet, maybe we need to handle base=1.

But how? For example, if the alphabet is ['a'], then any number would be converted to 'a's. But how to determine the number of 'a's? Well, for base 1, the number is represented as a string of 'a's with length equal to the number's value. But that's not standard. However, the problem says that the number represents a short uuid. So maybe the function is intended for bases greater than 1. But since the function allows any alphabet, perhaps we need to handle base=1.

But in the case of base=1, the code would have to handle it. For example, if base is 1, then the number is converted to a string of 'a's with length equal to the number. But how?

Wait, for base=1, the number is represented as a sequence of digits where each digit is 0. But since the alphabet has only one character, which is 'a', then the code would generate 'a' repeated number times. But that's not possible because in the loop, when base is 1, number % base is 0, and number // base is number. So the loop would run forever. So to avoid that, we need to handle base=1 as a special case.

But how?

If base is 1, then the number is converted to a string of 'a's with length equal to the number. But wait, for example, number=0 → 'a' (if padding is None). But if base is 1, then the code would have:

if number ==0: return 'a' * padding or 1.

But if number is 5, then the loop would run indefinitely. So, need to handle base=1.

So, perhaps:

if base == 1:

    if number ==0:

        return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)

    else:

        return alphabet[0] * number

But wait, that's not correct. Because in base 1, the digits are all 0, but the number is represented as the sum of digits * base^position. However, base 1 is not a standard base. So perhaps the function is intended for base >=2. But the user hasn't specified. So perhaps the code should handle base=1.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code should raise an error if base is 1. Because it's not possible to represent numbers in base 1. But the problem says that the number represents a short uuid. So maybe the alphabet is supposed to have at least two characters. However, the function allows any alphabet. So perhaps the code should handle base=1.

But this is a possible edge case. However, the user may not have considered it. But since the function signature allows it, perhaps the code should handle it.

So, modifying the code:

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    """
    Convert a number to a string, using the given alphabet.
    The number represents a short uuid.
    The output has the most significant digit first.
    @param number: Int value
    @param alphabet : List with letters
    @param padding : Optional with int value
    @return  string value corresponded to int
    """
    base = len(alphabet)
    if base == 0:
        raise ValueError("Alphabet cannot be empty")
    if base == 1:
        # Handle base 1 case
        if number == 0:
            return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)
        else:
            return alphabet[0] * number
    if number == 0:
        return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)
    digits = []
    while number > 0:
        remainder = number % base
        digits.append(alphabet[remainder])
        number = number // base
    digits = digits[::-1]
    result = ''.join(digits)
    if padding is not None:
        if len(result) < padding:
            result = alphabet[0] * (padding - len(result)) + result
    return result

But this is a possible fix. However, the problem says that the number represents a short uuid. UUIDs are usually in base 16, but the function is more general. So, perhaps the code should handle base=1. However, the user may not have considered this. But since the function allows it, we should handle it.

But the original code would have an infinite loop for base=1. So adding this check is necessary.

But the user's docstring says that the number represents a short uuid. So maybe the alphabet is supposed to be of length >= 2. But the function allows any alphabet. So perhaps the code should handle base=1.

But this is getting complicated. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't mention handling base=1. So perhaps the code is intended to work for any base >=1. But in that case, for base=1, the code would have to handle it.

But given that the function is supposed to convert a number to a string, perhaps the code should handle base=1. However, the standard way to represent numbers in base 1 is not straightforward. For example, the number 5 in base 1 would be represented as 'aaaaa' (if alphabet is ['a']). But how to handle that.

In the code above, for base=1, if number is 5, then return 'a' *5. But that's not correct, because in base 1, the digits are all 0, but the alphabet has only one character. However, the code would return 'a' * number. But that's a possible way to handle it, even though it's not standard.

But perhaps the function is designed such that when the base is 1, the number is converted to a string of the first character repeated number times. So for number=0, it's 'a' (if padding is None), or 'a' * padding. For number=5, it's 'a' *5.

But this is a possible approach. So the code above handles that.

But the user may not have considered this case, but since the function signature allows it, it's better to handle it.

So, the code would need to handle base=1.

But maybe the user expects that the alphabet is of length >=2. However, the code should be written to handle all cases as per the function signature.

So, the code as written would handle that.

Now, let's check the code again.

Another edge case: number is zero, and padding is None → returns alphabet[0].

Another case: number is zero, padding is 3 → returns alphabet[0] *3.

Another case: base is 1, number is 5 → returns alphabet[0] *5.

But what if the alphabet is empty? The code checks for base ==0 and raises an error.

So, the code now includes handling for base=1.

But the user's original code didn't have that. So perhaps the code should include that.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't mention handling base=1, but the function signature allows it. So the code should handle it.

But perhaps the user expects that the alphabet is of length >=2. However, the code should handle all valid cases.

So, the code would be as above.

But the user's original code didn't include that. So maybe the user didn't think about it. However, since the function allows for any alphabet, it's better to handle it.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't mention handling base=1. So perhaps the code should not handle it, and let it crash. But that's not good.

Alternatively, maybe the code should handle it by returning the first character repeated number times. But that's a possible approach.

So, the code as written above includes that.

But perhaps the user expects that the padding is applied only when necessary. So the code is correct.

Now, let's code that.

But the user's original code may not have that. However, the code as written would handle base=1.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature. So the code should include that.

But the user's code may not have that. However, the code as written is more robust.

So, the final code would include handling for base=1.

But perhaps the user didn't consider this. However, given that the function is supposed to be general, it's better to include it.

But the user's docstring says that the number represents a short uuid. So maybe the alphabet is of length 16 or similar. But the code is supposed to be general.

So, the code is as follows.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code, no explanation. So I need to write the code with the necessary imports and handling.

So, the code:

from typing import List, Optional

def int_to_string(number: int, alphabet: List[str], padding: Optional[int] = None) -> str:
    """
    Convert a number to a string, using the given alphabet.
    The number represents a short uuid.
    The output has the most significant digit first.
    @param number: Int value
    @param alphabet : List with letters
    @param padding : Optional with int value
    @return  string value corresponded to int
    """
    base = len(alphabet)
    if base == 0:
        raise ValueError("Alphabet cannot be empty")
    if base == 1:
        if number == 0:
            return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)
        else:
            return alphabet[0] * number
    if number == 0:
        return alphabet[0] * (padding if padding is not None else 1)
    digits = []
    while number > 0:
        remainder = number % base
        digits.append(alphabet[remainder])
        number = number // base
    digits = digits[::-1]
    result = ''.join(digits)
    if padding is not None:
        if len(result) < padding:
            result = alphabet[0] * (padding - len(result)) + result
    return result

But wait, for base=1, the code returns alphabet[0] multiplied by number. But when number is zero, it returns alphabet[0] multiplied by padding or 1. So that's correct.

But what if the number is zero and base is 1? For example, number=0, alphabet=['a'], padding=3 → returns 'aaa'.

But the code is correct.

Now, the code is written. Let me check for other possible errors.

What if the padding is zero? For example, if padding is 0, then in the case where number is zero, it would return alphabet[0] *0 → empty string. But that's possible.

But the problem says that the number represents a short uuid. So maybe padding is supposed to be a positive integer. However, the code handles it as per the parameters.

So, the code is written.

Now, the user's original code didn't have the base=1 handling. But including it makes the code more robust.

But perhaps the user expects that the alphabet is of length >=2. However, the code should handle all cases.

So, the code is generated as above.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't mention the base=1 case, but the code must handle it.

So, the code is written as such.

Now, the code is ready.
