Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_compute_el that checks if an object has the fill and compute methods. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is supposed to return True if the object's class has both fill and compute methods. So, I need to check if the class of the object has those methods.

In Python, you can get the class of an object using type(obj). So, for example, if obj is an instance of a class, type(obj) would give the class.

Then, to check if a method exists in a class, I can use the hasattr() function. But wait, hasattr checks if the class has the method, not if the instance has it. But since the function is called on the object, maybe the user is checking if the class has those methods. Wait, the docstring says "the obj class has the fill and compute methods." So the function is checking if the class of obj has those methods.

So the steps are: get the class of obj, then check if both 'fill' and 'compute' are present as attributes of that class.

But wait, in Python, methods are functions, so they are stored as attributes. So, for example, if a class has a method called fill, then hasattr(class, 'fill') would return True.

So the code would be something like:

return hasattr(type(obj), 'fill') and hasattr(type(obj), 'compute')

But wait, what if the object is a instance of a class that doesn't have those methods? Then the function returns False.

So the function is_fill_compute_el would check if the class of the object has both methods.

So the code would be:

def is_fill_compute_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and compute methods.
    """
    return hasattr(type(obj), 'fill') and hasattr(type(obj), 'compute')

Wait, but what if the methods are not actually present? Like, if the class doesn't have them. Then the function returns False, which is correct.

Yes, that seems right. So the code is straightforward. Just check if the class has both methods.
