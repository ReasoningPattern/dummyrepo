Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called formatmany and it's part of a class because it has 'self' as the first parameter. 

Looking at the parameters, 'sql' is of type AnyStr, which I think is a generic type for strings in Python. The second parameter, 'many_params', is a Union of two types: Iterable of Dictionaries with Union[str, int] as keys and Any as values, and Iterable of Sequences of Any. So it can be either a list of dicts or a list of lists or tuples.

The return type is a Tuple containing an AnyStr and a Union of two Lists: one for dicts and one for sequences. 

The docstring says this function converts SQL using self._converter.convert_many. So I need to call that method on self. 

I should probably structure the code to handle both cases in many_params. If it's an iterable of dicts, I'll convert each dict. If it's an iterable of sequences, I'll convert each sequence. Then, I'll return the converted SQL string and the converted list.

I'll use isinstance to check the type of many_params. If it's a list or similar, I'll loop through each item and apply the conversion. For each item, if it's a dict, I'll use a list comprehension to convert each value. If it's a sequence, I'll convert it using map and a lambda function to handle each element.

Putting it all together, the function will return a tuple where the first element is the converted SQL string, and the second is the list of converted dictionaries or sequences.
