Okay, I need to write a Python function called merge_extra_vars. The function takes two parameters: vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring explains that the function should extend vars_dict with extra_vars. 

First, I'll start by looking at the parameters. The function signature is given, so I know that extra_vars has a default value of None. If extra_vars is None, I should treat it as an empty list. That way, the function can handle cases where extra_vars isn't provided.

Next, I need to merge the extra_vars into vars_dict. Since extra_vars is a list, I'll loop through each item in this list. For each key-value pair, I'll add or update it in vars_dict. I should make sure that if a key already exists in vars_dict, the new value from extra_vars will overwrite it. This ensures that the latest value from extra_vars takes precedence.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if extra_vars is None and set it to an empty list if so.
2. Iterate over each key-value pair in extra_vars.
3. For each pair, update vars_dict with the key and value.

I should also make sure that the function returns the updated vars_dict so that the caller can use it.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this. I'll write the if statement to handle extra_vars being None, then loop through the list and update the dictionary. Finally, return vars_dict.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.
