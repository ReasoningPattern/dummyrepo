Okay, I need to generate Python code for the load_configurations function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes config_filenames, which is a sequence of filenames. Then there's an overrides parameter, which is optional and defaults to None. The resolve_env flag determines whether to resolve environment variables in the config files.

The goal is to load and validate each configuration file. If there's an error reading a file (like permission issues or parsing errors), log the error. Then return a tuple: a dictionary mapping filenames to parsed configs, and a list of LogRecord instances for any parse errors.

So, the steps I need to do are:

1. Iterate over each config filename in the input sequence.
2. For each file, attempt to read it. If there's an error (like permission denied), catch it and log it.
3. Parse the configuration. How? Maybe using a config parser like configparser or something else. But the docstring doesn't specify the format, so perhaps assume it's a standard format and use configparser.
4. Check for parsing errors. If any, log them as LogRecord instances.
5. Collect the parsed configs into a dictionary.
6. Collect all the errors into a list of LogRecord objects.
7. Return the tuple (config_dict, error_logs).

Wait, but the function needs to handle both reading and parsing errors. So for each file, I need to try reading it, then parsing it. If either step fails, log the error.

But how to handle the overrides? The overrides parameter is a dictionary, perhaps. So maybe when loading each config file, we merge the overrides into the parsed config. Or maybe the overrides are applied after parsing? The docstring says "overrides" but doesn't specify. Maybe the function is supposed to apply the overrides to each configuration. So for each config, parse it, then apply the overrides.

But the exact behavior of overrides isn't clear. Maybe it's a dictionary of key-value pairs that should be merged into the config. So for each config in the files, after parsing, we update it with the overrides.

Also, the resolve_env parameter: if True, then when parsing the config, environment variables in the values should be resolved. For example, if a value is like ${VAR_NAME}, replace it with the actual environment variable value.

So, the code would need to:

- For each filename in config_filenames:
   - Try to open and read the file. If there's an error (like permission), catch it and log.
   - Parse the content into a dictionary. If parsing fails (like invalid syntax), log that error.
   - If resolve_env is True, resolve any environment variables in the parsed values.
   - Apply overrides if provided, merging them into the config.

But how to parse the config? Let's assume that each config file is in INI format. So using configparser.ConfigParser.

But configparser might not be the only possibility. However, since the docstring doesn't specify, I'll proceed with that.

So, first, import necessary modules: configparser, logging, os.

Wait, the function returns logging.LogRecord instances. So I need to create log records for each error. But how? The LogRecord class is part of the logging module. So perhaps for each error, create a LogRecord with the appropriate message, filename, etc.

But the function is supposed to record the error log. So maybe the function is part of a logging setup, and the errors are logged using the logging module. However, the function is supposed to return the LogRecord instances, not just log them. So perhaps the function is designed to collect errors during loading and then return them.

But the user might not have a logger set up. So maybe the function creates a logger, or uses the default one. However, the docstring says "the error log will be recorded", which might mean that the errors are logged, but the function also returns them. So the function needs to log the errors (using logging module) and collect them in a list.

So, for each config file:

- Try to read the file. If there's an exception (like FileNotFoundError, PermissionError), catch it, create a LogRecord with the error message, and add to the error list.
- Then parse the content. If parsing fails (like invalid syntax), catch that, create a LogRecord, add to the error list.
- If both steps succeed, add the parsed config to the config_dict.

But how to handle the parsing? Let's say each config file is a standard INI file. So using configparser.

But also, the resolve_env part. How to resolve environment variables in the config values. For example, if a value is "${ENV_VAR}", replace it with os.environ.get("ENV_VAR", default).

So, after parsing, for each value in the config, if resolve_env is True, replace any ${...} with the corresponding environment variable.

But how to do that? Maybe using the ConfigParser's get method with a custom interpolation class that resolves environment variables.

Alternatively, after parsing, process each value to replace ${VAR} with os.environ.get(VAR, ...).

But the configparser's interpolation can be customized. Let me think. The ConfigParser class has an option to use environment variables. For example, the 'env' interpolation style. So maybe set the interpolation to 'env' when reading the file.

Wait, the ConfigParser's interpolation can be set to use environment variables. So when creating the ConfigParser instance, set the interpolation to 'env' if resolve_env is True. But I need to check if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the resolve_env is a flag to determine whether to replace ${VAR} with environment variables. So, if resolve_env is True, then after parsing, we process each value to replace those variables.

But perhaps the standard way is to use the 'env' interpolation. Let me check. The ConfigParser's interpolation can be set to 'env' which allows ${VAR} to be replaced with environment variables. So if resolve_env is True, we can use that.

So, for each config file:

- Create a ConfigParser instance with interpolation set to 'env' if resolve_env is True.
- Read the file. If that fails, log the error.
- Then, if the file is read successfully, parse it into a dictionary. But how? The ConfigParser has a read_dict method, or maybe we can read the file and then extract the sections and options.

Wait, the ConfigParser can be used to read the file, and then we can get the parsed data as a dictionary. For example, using the 'dict' method. But perhaps for each section, we can convert it into a dictionary and then merge all sections into a single dict.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a dictionary, with the filename as the key.

So, for each filename, after reading, we can get the parsed config as a dictionary. But the ConfigParser's get method can be used to retrieve values, but to get all the options, perhaps we can iterate through all sections and options.

But maybe the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a dictionary, where each key is the section name and the value is another dictionary of options. Or maybe flatten it into a single dictionary. The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the user expects each config to be a dictionary of sections and options, but maybe they want a flat structure. Hmm, this is unclear. But since the function returns a dict of filename to corresponding parsed configuration, perhaps each parsed config is a dictionary that includes all sections and options. Or maybe it's a single dictionary with all options, but that depends on the config format.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to load each config file into a dictionary, and if there are multiple sections, they are merged into a single dict. But without knowing the exact format, it's hard to say. However, the docstring says "parsed configuration", so maybe the standard way is to have a dict of sections and options.

But maybe the user expects that each config is a single dictionary. For example, if the config is in a format where all options are in a single section. So perhaps the function is supposed to read each file and return the parsed config as a dictionary, possibly with sections.

But perhaps the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a dictionary, and if there are multiple sections, they are merged into a single dict. For example, using the 'dict' method of ConfigParser.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a dictionary, where each key is the section name and the value is another dictionary of options. But again, not sure. However, the docstring says "dict of configuration filename to corresponding parsed configuration", so the parsed configuration could be any structure, but perhaps a dict.

But for the purpose of this code, perhaps we can assume that each config is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to merge all sections into a single dict. Or maybe not. Let's proceed with the standard approach.

So, for each config file, read it with ConfigParser, then get the parsed data as a dictionary. Let's say that the ConfigParser is used to read the file, and then the parsed data is converted into a dictionary. For example, using the 'dict' method, which would return a dictionary with sections as keys and their options as nested dictionaries.

But perhaps the user wants all options in a single dict, not per section. So maybe we can flatten the sections. However, without more info, it's better to return the parsed config as a dictionary with sections.

But the function's return type is a tuple of (dict, list of LogRecords). So the dict would map filenames to their parsed configs.

Now, handling the overrides. If overrides is provided, it's a dictionary. So for each config, after parsing, we need to merge the overrides into it. But how? If the config is a dict of sections, then the overrides could be merged into the top-level dict. Or perhaps the overrides are per-section. But the docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the overrides are applied to the entire config, overwriting any existing keys.

So, for each config, after parsing, we can update it with the overrides. But if the overrides are a dict, then for each key in overrides, set it in the config. However, if the config has sections, then the keys would be section names. So perhaps the overrides are applied to the top-level, or maybe to specific sections. But again, without more info, maybe the overrides are applied to the entire config as a flat dictionary. Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe the function is supposed to merge the overrides into the parsed config, but the way to do that depends on the config structure.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are a dictionary that is merged into each config. For example, if the config is a dict, then the overrides are merged into it. But this is unclear. However, the function's name is load_configurations, which might imply that each config is a separate dictionary, and overrides are applied to each one. But perhaps the overrides are a single dict that is merged into all configs. Or maybe each config is merged with the overrides. The docstring says "overrides" but doesn't specify. So perhaps the function is supposed to apply the overrides to each configuration. For example, if the config is a dictionary, then the overrides are merged into it, with overrides taking precedence.

So, for each config, after parsing, we can do config.update(overrides) if overrides is not None. But need to make sure that the config is a dictionary. However, if the config is a ConfigParser object, then perhaps we need to convert it into a dict first.

So, the plan:

- For each filename in config_filenames:
   - Try to open and read the file. If error, log and add to errors.
   - Parse the content into a ConfigParser object. If parsing fails, log and add to errors.
   - If resolve_env is True, use the env interpolation.
   - Convert the ConfigParser into a dictionary (maybe using the 'dict' method or iterating through sections).
   - Apply overrides to the config dict.
   - Add to the config_dict with filename as key.

But how to handle the conversion from ConfigParser to a dictionary. Let me think. The ConfigParser has a method called 'dict' which returns a dictionary of sections and options. So perhaps:

config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation)
config.read(filename)
parsed_config = {section: dict(config[section]) for section in config.sections()}
Then, if overrides is not None, merge them into parsed_config. But how? If overrides is a dict, then for each key in overrides, set it in the parsed_config. However, if the parsed_config is a dict of sections, then the overrides might need to be applied to specific sections. But again, without knowing, perhaps the overrides are applied to the top-level, or maybe the function is supposed to merge them into the parsed config in a way that overrides any existing keys.

Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to merge the overrides into each config, but the exact way is not specified. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the parsed config (as a dict) and then apply the overrides as a dictionary, which would overwrite any existing keys in the parsed config.

So, for example, if the parsed config is a dict, then:

if overrides:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)

But that would merge the overrides into the parsed config. However, if the parsed config is a nested dict (sections), then the overrides might need to be applied to specific sections. But again, without more info, perhaps the function is designed to merge the overrides into the top-level dict, which may not be correct. But given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to merge the overrides into the parsed config, treating it as a flat dictionary. Or maybe the overrides are per config file. But the function's parameter is overrides, which is a single dict, so it's probably a global override for all configs.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied to each config individually. But that's not clear. However, the function's docstring says "overrides" but doesn't specify, so perhaps the code should assume that overrides is a dictionary that is merged into each parsed config. But that could be problematic if the config has nested sections. However, for the purpose of this code, perhaps proceed with merging the overrides into the parsed config as a flat dictionary.

But maybe the function is supposed to take the overrides and apply them to each config. For example, if the config is a dict, then for each key in overrides, set it in the config. So, the code would do:

parsed_config = ... # the parsed config as a dict
if overrides:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)

But again, if the parsed config is a nested structure (sections), then this would overwrite top-level keys. But perhaps that's acceptable.

Now, the error handling. For each filename, we need to attempt to read and parse. So, for each filename, we can try:

try:
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
except Exception as e:
    log the error, add to error_logs.

But wait, the function is supposed to handle errors during reading and parsing. So, perhaps:

For each filename:

- Attempt to open and read the file. If there's an exception (like permission denied, file not found), catch it, create a LogRecord with the error message, and add to the error list. Then proceed to the next file.

- Then, parse the content. If the parsing fails (like invalid syntax), catch that, create a LogRecord, add to error list.

But how to parse the content? If using ConfigParser, then the read method can throw exceptions. For example, if the file is not a valid INI file, ConfigParser will raise an error. So, perhaps wrap the read in a try-except block.

Wait, the ConfigParser's read method can raise configparser.Error if there's a parsing error. So, for each filename, after reading, we can check if the config is valid. But maybe the code should handle that.

So, the code structure would be:

import configparser
import logging
import os

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    config_dict = {}
    error_logs = []
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                content = f.read()
        except Exception as e:
            # Log the error
            error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=filename, lineno=1, msg=str(e), args=None, exc_info=None, func=None))
            continue
        try:
            config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
            config.read_string(content)
        except configparser.Error as e:
            error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=filename, lineno=1, msg=str(e), args=None, exc_info=None, func=None))
            continue
        # Now, convert config to a dict
        parsed_config = {}
        for section in config.sections():
            parsed_config[section] = dict(config[section])
        # Apply overrides
        if overrides:
            parsed_config.update(overrides)
        config_dict[filename] = parsed_config
    return config_dict, error_logs

Wait, but the ConfigParser's read_string method is available in Python 3.8+, but maybe the user is using an older version. Alternatively, use read_file, but that's for reading from a file-like object. Or read the file using read, but that would require the filename. Alternatively, perhaps the code should read the file using the ConfigParser's read method, which takes filenames. But in that case, the code would be:

config.read(filename)

But then, if the file is not found, that would raise an exception. So, the first try-except block is for reading the file. Then, the second try-except is for parsing. But perhaps the code should read the file first, then parse it. However, the code above reads the content first, then uses read_string. But maybe that's not the best approach. Because ConfigParser's read method can handle multiple files, but here we are processing each filename individually.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should use config.read(filename) instead of reading the content. But then, if the file can't be read, it would raise an exception. So, the first try-except block would be around config.read(filename). But how to handle that? Because ConfigParser's read method returns a list of filenames read, but if the file can't be read, it raises an error.

So, perhaps the code should be:

for filename in config_filenames:
    try:
        config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
        config.read(filename)
    except Exception as e:
        error_logs.append(...)
        continue
    # process config

But then, the code would need to handle the case where the file is read, but the parsing is invalid. Wait, the ConfigParser's read method would raise an error if the file is invalid. So, perhaps the code can just call config.read(filename), and if that fails, catch the exception and log it.

But then, the code would need to handle exceptions during reading. So, the first try-except is for opening the file. Wait, no. The ConfigParser's read method can raise exceptions like FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, etc. So, perhaps the code can just wrap the config.read(filename) in a try-except block.

But maybe it's better to first check if the file exists and is readable. However, that's not necessary, as the ConfigParser will handle that.

So, the code would be:

for filename in config_filenames:
    try:
        config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
        config.read(filename)
    except Exception as e:
        error_logs.append(...)
        continue
    # process config

But then, the error_logs would collect any exceptions during reading. However, the docstring says that the function should record the error log if the configuration file cannot be read. So, the error during reading (like permission denied) is caught, and a LogRecord is added.

But how to create a LogRecord? The logging.LogRecord requires parameters like name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, etc. For example, when an error occurs during reading, the filename is the one that caused the error. So, the LogRecord can be created with the filename as the pathname, and the line number as 1 (since the error is at the top level). The message would be the error message.

But in Python, creating a LogRecord is not straightforward. The logging module's LogRecord is usually created by the logging system. However, the function is supposed to create LogRecord instances manually. So, perhaps using the logging module's makeLogRecord function or creating them directly.

Wait, the logging.LogRecord can be initialized with the following parameters:

name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func, extra.

But to create a LogRecord instance, you need to have the logger, but perhaps the function can create a dummy logger and then generate the LogRecord. However, the user might not have a logger set up. So, perhaps the function can create a LogRecord with the necessary parameters, even if the logger isn't set up.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to log the error using the logging module, but also return the LogRecord instances. But the user might not have a logger, so the function needs to create the LogRecord instances manually.

But how to create them? For example, when an error occurs during reading, the exception message can be captured. Then, create a LogRecord with the message, filename as pathname, and lineno as 1 (assuming the error is at the top of the file).

But the exact parameters for LogRecord are a bit tricky. For example, the 'lineno' is the line number in the file where the error occurred. However, if the error is during reading the file, perhaps the line number is not known. So, maybe set lineno to 1 as a placeholder.

So, for the error logs, each LogRecord would have the filename, the error message, and the exception info.

But the code would need to capture the exception message. So, in the except block, we can get the exception message, then create a LogRecord.

But how to create a LogRecord? The logging module's LogRecord is initialized with the following parameters:

def __init__(self, name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func, keywords):

But perhaps the function can create a LogRecord with the necessary info. However, the user might not have a logger, so the function can't actually log it. But the docstring says that the error log will be recorded, which might mean that the function is supposed to log them, but also return them. However, the function returns the LogRecord instances, so perhaps the logging is done via the function's own logging, but the code is supposed to create them.

But perhaps the function is supposed to collect the errors, not actually log them. The docstring says "the error log will be recorded", which could mean that the function logs them, but also returns them. However, the return value is the tuple of config_dict and error_logs. So, the code needs to create LogRecord instances for each error.

But creating LogRecord instances manually is not typical. However, the function's docstring says to return them, so we need to do that.

So, the code for creating a LogRecord when there's an error during reading or parsing would be:

error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(
    name='config_loader',
    level=logging.ERROR,
    pathname=filename,
    lineno=1,
    msg=str(e),
    args=None,
    exc_info=None,
    func=None
))

But the exc_info is usually the exception info. However, in the code above, we're not capturing it. But perhaps the function is supposed to log the error message, and not the full exception info. So, the code can proceed with that.

Now, the resolve_env parameter: if True, then the ConfigParser should use environment variable interpolation. So, the interpolation parameter is set to configparser.EnvInterpolation().

But in Python's configparser, the interpolation can be set with the interpolation argument. So, when creating the ConfigParser instance, set interpolation to EnvInterpolation if resolve_env is True.

But wait, the EnvInterpolation class is part of the configparser module. So, the code would need to import that.

Wait, in Python 3.8+, configparser has EnvInterpolation. So, the code can use that.

So, the code for creating the ConfigParser would be:

config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)

But then, when reading the file, the interpolation is applied.

Now, after parsing, the code needs to convert the ConfigParser into a dictionary. So, for each section in the config, we can take the options and create a dict.

But the code would need to process each section. So, parsed_config is a dict where each key is a section name, and the value is another dict of options.

Then, apply the overrides. If overrides is not None, merge it into the parsed_config. But how? If the overrides are a dict, then for each key in overrides, set it in the parsed_config. However, if the parsed_config is a dict of sections, then the overrides might be applied to the top level. But that could overwrite existing sections. So, perhaps the code should merge the overrides into the parsed_config, but if the overrides have keys that are sections, they would overwrite. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are supposed to be applied to the entire config, but that's unclear. However, given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to merge the overrides into the parsed config, treating it as a flat dictionary. But that's not correct if the parsed config is a nested structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the overrides into each section. But again, without knowing, perhaps the code should treat the parsed config as a flat dict, and apply the overrides as a flat dict. But that's not necessarily correct.

Hmm. This is a bit of a problem. The docstring doesn't specify the structure of the parsed configuration. But perhaps the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a dictionary of sections and options, and the overrides are merged into the top-level dict. So, for example, if the config has sections, and the overrides have keys that are sections, they would overwrite. Otherwise, they are added.

But perhaps the overrides are supposed to be applied to the entire config. So, the code would do:

if overrides:
    for section in overrides:
        if section not in parsed_config:
            parsed_config[section] = {}
        parsed_config[section].update(overrides[section])

But again, this is assuming that the overrides are structured similarly to the config. However, the function's parameters don't specify that. So, perhaps the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code should merge them into the parsed_config. But that would require that the parsed_config is a flat dict, not nested.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the overrides into the parsed config, regardless of structure. But how?

This is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the function's name is load_configurations, and the parameters are config_filenames and overrides, perhaps the overrides are applied to each configuration as a whole. So, for example, if the parsed config is a dict of sections, then the overrides are merged into the top-level dict. But that would not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied as a single dict, and the parsed config is a flat dict. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the overrides into the parsed config, but the way to do that depends on the structure. However, since the function is supposed to return a dict of filename to parsed config, perhaps the parsed config is a flat dict. So, for example, if the config has sections, they are merged into the top-level dict.

But how to do that? For example, using the 'dict' method of ConfigParser, which returns a dictionary with sections as keys and their options as values. But that's not a flat dict. So, perhaps the code should flatten the sections. For example, for each section, add its options to the top-level dict with keys like 'section.option'.

But that's not specified in the docstring. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a nested dict, with sections as keys. Then, the overrides would be merged into the top-level dict. But that could cause conflicts if the overrides have keys that are sections.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied to the entire config, and the parsed config is a flat dict. But again, not sure.

This is a problem. However, since the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the code should proceed with the parsed config as a nested dict (sections as keys), and apply the overrides as a flat dict, which would overwrite any existing keys. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are applied to the parsed config, and the parsed config is a flat dict. So, for example, if the config is in a single section, then the parsed config is a flat dict. But if there are multiple sections, then the code would need to flatten them.

But given that the function is supposed to return a dict of filename to parsed config, and the docstring says "parsed configuration", perhaps the code should return the parsed config as a dictionary of sections and options, and the overrides are applied to the entire config. However, the way to apply overrides would be to merge them into the parsed config. But if the parsed config is a nested dict, then the overrides could be merged into the top-level, which might not be desired.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a single dictionary, with all options from all sections. For example, using the 'dict' method of ConfigParser, which would return a dictionary with sections as keys and their options as values. Then, the code can flatten the sections into the top-level dict.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, this is challenging. However, given that the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code can proceed with the parsed config as a nested dict, and the overrides are merged into the top-level. But that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied to each config, and the parsed config is a flat dict. But how to do that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a single dictionary, with all options from all sections, and the overrides are merged into that. So, for example, using the 'dict' method of ConfigParser, which would return a dict of sections and options, then flattening them into a single dict. But that's not straightforward.

Hmm. Maybe the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a dictionary, and the overrides are applied to that. For example, if the config is a single section, then parsed_config is a dict, and overrides are merged into it. But if there are multiple sections, then the code would need to merge them into a single dict. However, the code would need to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a dictionary, and the overrides are applied as a single dict. So, the code would take the parsed config (which may be a nested dict) and then merge the overrides into it. But how?

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the user expects that the parsed config is a single dictionary, and the overrides are merged into it. So, for example, the code would read the config file into a dictionary, then merge the overrides.

But how to read the config into a single dict? For example, using the ConfigParser's read_dict method, but that's not standard. Alternatively, for each section, add its options to the main dict with keys like 'section.option'.

But perhaps the code can proceed as follows:

parsed_config = {}
for section in config.sections():
    for key, value in config[section].items():
        parsed_config[f"{section}.{key}"] = value

Then, apply the overrides. But this is assuming that the config is in INI format with sections. However, this is just one possible way.

But given that the function's docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the code should return the parsed config as a nested dictionary, and the overrides are merged into the top level. So, for example, if the parsed config is a dict with sections as keys, and the overrides are a dict, then the code would do:

if overrides:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)

But this would overwrite any existing keys in parsed_config that match the overrides' keys. However, if the overrides are supposed to be applied to specific sections, that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the overrides into each config, but the way is not specified. Given that, perhaps the code should proceed with the parsed config as a nested dict (sections as keys), and the overrides are merged into the top level. So, the code would do:

parsed_config = {section: dict(config[section]) for section in config.sections()}
if overrides:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)

But this would merge the overrides into the parsed_config, overwriting any top-level keys. However, if the parsed_config is a dict of sections, then the overrides would be added as top-level keys, which might not be intended. But given the ambiguity, perhaps this is the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the parsed config as a flat dict, and the overrides are merged into that. But again, not sure.

Well, perhaps the user expects that the parsed configuration is a dictionary, and the overrides are merged into it. So, for example, the code would read the config into a dict, then apply the overrides. But how to read the config into a dict? Let's think.

If using ConfigParser, the read_dict method can be used. But that's not standard. Alternatively, the code can read the config and then convert it into a dictionary. For example:

parsed_config = {}
for section in config.sections():
    parsed_config[section] = dict(config[section])

Then, apply the overrides. But again, this is a nested dict.

But given that, perhaps the code can proceed with that structure.

Now, the code:

import configparser
import logging
import os

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    config_dict = {}
    error_logs = []
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
            config.read(filename)
        except Exception as e:
            error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=1,
                msg=str(e),
                args=None,
                exc_info=None,
                func=None
            ))
            continue
        # Convert ConfigParser to a dict of sections
        parsed_config = {section: dict(config[section]) for section in config.sections()}
        # Apply overrides
        if overrides:
            parsed_config.update(overrides)
        config_dict[filename] = parsed_config
    return config_dict, error_logs

Wait, but what if the config has no sections? Then parsed_config would be empty. But that's acceptable.

But the code above may not handle all possible exceptions. For example, if the file is not found, the ConfigParser's read method would raise an exception. So, the try-except block catches that.

But the code also needs to handle cases where the file is readable but the parsing fails. For example, if the file has invalid syntax. The ConfigParser's read method would raise configparser.Error in that case. So, the code catches that as well.

But in the code above, the try-except block is around the config.read(filename) call. However, the ConfigParser's read method can raise multiple exceptions. So, catching Exception is too broad. Maybe it's better to catch specific exceptions.

But perhaps the code can use a general except block to catch all exceptions during reading and parsing.

But the docstring says that the error log is recorded if the configuration file cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or error parsing. So, the code should catch those specific exceptions.

So, perhaps the code should have:

try:
    config.read(filename)
except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
    # log error
except configparser.Error as e:
    # log parsing error

But the user may have other exceptions, like if the file is not a valid INI file. However, configparser.Error is the base class for parsing errors.

So, modifying the code:

for filename in config_filenames:
    try:
        config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
        config.read(filename)
    except PermissionError as e:
        error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(
            name='config_loader',
            level=logging.ERROR,
            pathname=filename,
            lineno=1,
            msg=f"Permission denied: {str(e)}",
            args=None,
            exc_info=None,
            func=None
        ))
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(
            name='config_loader',
            level=logging.ERROR,
            pathname=filename,
            lineno=1,
            msg=f"File not found: {str(e)}",
            args=None,
            exc_info=None,
            func=None
        ))
    except configparser.Error as e:
        error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(
            name='config_loader',
            level=logging.ERROR,
            pathname=filename,
            lineno=1,
            msg=f"Parsing error: {str(e)}",
            args=None,
            exc_info=None,
            func=None
        ))
    else:
        # process config
        parsed_config = {section: dict(config[section]) for section in config.sections()}
        if overrides:
            parsed_config.update(overrides)
        config_dict[filename] = parsed_config

But this approach would have separate except blocks for different exceptions. However, the original code may have to catch all exceptions during reading and parsing, but the docstring mentions specific errors: insufficient permissions or parsing error. So, maybe catching those two.

But perhaps the code should use a general except block, since other exceptions could also occur, like invalid syntax, but the configparser.Error is the base class for parsing errors. So, perhaps the code can catch (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e, and then configparser.Error as e.

But how to handle that. Let's adjust the code:

for filename in config_filenames:
    try:
        config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
        config.read(filename)
    except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(...))
    except configparser.Error as e:
        error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(...))
    else:
        # process config

But in Python, the ConfigParser's read method can raise configparser.Error, which includes parsing errors. So, this would handle that.

But how to capture the exception message. For example, in the case of a PermissionError, the message would be something like "Permission denied".

So, the code would need to create a LogRecord with the appropriate message.

But the code may need to handle other exceptions as well, like if the file is not readable. However, the original code may not need to handle all exceptions, just the ones mentioned in the docstring.

But the user says "if the configuration file cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file, the error log will be recorded."

So, the code should catch those two cases.

But the code may also need to handle other exceptions, like if the file is not a valid INI file. But configparser.Error is the base class for that.

So, the code can be structured as:

for filename in config_filenames:
    try:
        config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
        config.read(filename)
    except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        # log error
    except configparser.Error as e:
        # log parsing error
    else:
        # process config

But then, what about other exceptions, like if the file is not found but not a FileNotFoundError? For example, if the file is a directory. But that would be caught by the general exception.

But the docstring says to record errors when the file can't be read. So, perhaps the code should catch all exceptions during the reading and parsing steps, but the docstring specifies two types: permission and parsing.

But maybe the code should catch all exceptions, and log them. However, the user may want to differentiate between permission errors and parsing errors. But the docstring doesn't specify that, so perhaps the code can catch all exceptions and log them as parsing errors. Or maybe the code can check the type of exception.

But in the code, perhaps the best approach is to catch all exceptions during the reading and parsing, and log them as errors. However, the docstring says that the error log is recorded if the file can't be read (permission or not found) or parsing error. So, the code can catch those specific exceptions.

But perhaps the code can use a general except block, and then check the type of the exception. For example:

except Exception as e:
    if isinstance(e, (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError)):
        msg = f"Error reading file {filename}: {str(e)}"
    else:
        msg = f"Parsing error in {filename}: {str(e)}"
    error_logs.append(...)

But that's more complicated. However, the original code may need to handle those specific cases.

But given that, perhaps the code can proceed with catching all exceptions, and then create a LogRecord with the appropriate message.

But the user's docstring says "if the configuration file cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file, the error log will be recorded." So, the code should handle those two cases.

So, in the try-except block, catch PermissionError and FileNotFoundError, and configparser.Error.

But how to do that. Let's adjust the code:

for filename in config_filenames:
    try:
        config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
        config.read(filename)
    except PermissionError as e:
        error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=filename, lineno=1, msg=f"Permission denied: {str(e)}", args=None, exc_info=None, func=None))
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=filename, lineno=1, msg=f"File not found: {str(e)}", args=None, exc_info=None, func=None))
    except configparser.Error as e:
        error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=filename, lineno=1, msg=f"Parsing error: {str(e)}", args=None, exc_info=None, func=None))
    else:
        # process config

But then, the code would need to import configparser and handle these exceptions.

Now, the code for the parsed config. Once the config is read, the code can process it. For example, converting the sections into a dict. Then, applying the overrides.

But what if the config has no sections? Then parsed_config would be empty. But that's acceptable.

Now, the overrides. If overrides is not None, then we need to merge it into the parsed_config. But how? If the parsed_config is a dict of sections, then the overrides could be merged into the top level. However, that might not be correct. For example, if the overrides have keys that are sections, they would overwrite. But maybe the function is supposed to merge the overrides into the parsed config, treating them as additional options. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the overrides are applied to the entire config. For example, if the parsed_config is a dict of sections, and the overrides is a dict, then for each key in overrides, if the key is a section, then merge the overrides into that section. Otherwise, add it as a new section. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are a flat dictionary, and the code should merge them into the parsed_config. But again, not sure.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to apply the overrides to the parsed config, overwriting any existing keys. So, if parsed_config is a dict of sections, then the code would need to merge the overrides into it. However, this could lead to key conflicts. For example, if the parsed_config has a key 'section.key', and the overrides have a key 'section.key', it would be overwritten. But if the overrides have a key that's not in the parsed_config, it would be added. But this may not be correct. However, given the lack of clarity, perhaps proceed with this approach.

So, the code would do:

if overrides:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)

But this would only work if parsed_config is a flat dict. However, in the current code, parsed_config is a dict of sections. So, the overrides would be merged into the parsed_config, which may not be intended. For example, if the overrides have a key that's a section name, it would overwrite that section. But if the overrides have a key that's not a section, it would add it as a new key. However, this could be problematic. But given the lack of specification, perhaps this is the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge the overrides into each section. But again, not sure.

But the user's docstring says that the function returns a dict of configuration filename to corresponding parsed configuration. So, the parsed configuration is the config that was read from the file, possibly with overrides applied.

But perhaps the overrides are applied as a separate dict, and the parsed config is a dict that includes both the original config and the overrides. So, the code would do:

parsed_config = {}
for section in config.sections():
    parsed_config[section] = dict(config[section])
if overrides:
    parsed_config.update(overrides)

But this would merge the overrides into the parsed_config, which is a dict of sections. So, if the overrides have a key that's a section name, it would overwrite that section. If it has a key that's not a section, it would add it as a new key. But this may not be the intended behavior. However, given that, perhaps this is the way to go.

Now, the code for creating the LogRecord instances. The parameters required for LogRecord are:

- name: the name of the logger, perhaps 'config_loader'
- level: logging.ERROR
- pathname: the filename that caused the error
- lineno: 1 (since the error is at the top level of the file)
- msg: the error message
- args: None
- exc_info: None
- func: None
- extra: ?

But the code may need to create a LogRecord with these parameters. However, the logging module's LogRecord requires more parameters. For example, the 'args' is the arguments for the message, and 'exc_info' is the exception info. But in the code, we are not capturing the exc_info. However, the docstring says to record the error log, which may include the exception details.

But for simplicity, perhaps the code can just log the message and not include the exc_info. But the user may want to have the exception details. However, the code in the except block can capture the exception and include it in the LogRecord.

But how to do that. The LogRecord has an 'exc_info' parameter which can be a tuple of (exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback). However, in the code above, we are not capturing that. So, perhaps the code should set exc_info to (type(e), e, None) or something similar.

But for the purpose of this function, perhaps the code can just log the message and not include the full exception info. So, the code can proceed with the msg being the error message, and exc_info as None.

Putting it all together:

import configparser
import logging
import os

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    config_dict = {}
    error_logs = []
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.EnvInterpolation() if resolve_env else None)
            config.read(filename)
        except PermissionError as e:
            error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=1,
                msg=f"Permission denied: {str(e)}",
                args=None,
                exc_info=None,
                func=None
            ))
        except FileNotFoundError as e:
            error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=1,
                msg=f"File not found: {str(e)}",
                args=None,
                exc_info=None,
                func=None
            ))
        except configparser.Error as e:
            error_logs.append(logging.LogRecord(
                name='config_loader',
                level=logging.ERROR,
                pathname=filename,
                lineno=1,
                msg=f"Parsing error: {str(e)}",
                args=None,
                exc_info=None,
                func=None
            ))
        else:
            parsed_config = {section: dict(config[section]) for section in config.sections()}
            if overrides:
                parsed_config.update(overrides)
            config_dict[filename] = parsed_config
    return config_dict, error_logs

Wait, but the code is missing the 'args' and 'exc_info' parameters for the LogRecord. However, the logging.LogRecord can be initialized with those parameters. But in the code above, the args is set to None, and exc_info is None. However, the exc_info can be set to (type(e), e, e.__traceback__) to include the exception details.

But perhaps the code should include the exception info. So, in the except blocks, set exc_info to (type(e), e, None) or (type(e), e, e.__traceback__).

But the code may not have access to the traceback. However, the user may not need that. So, perhaps it's better to omit it for simplicity.

But the code as written would have the message, and the rest as default. However, the parameters for LogRecord are more than that. The standard way to create a LogRecord is to use the logging module's logger methods, but the function is supposed to create them manually.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the logging module's makeLogRecord function. But that's not part of the public API. However, for the purpose of this code, perhaps the user expects that the LogRecord is created with the necessary parameters.

But the code above may not be sufficient. For example, the 'func' parameter is not set. But perhaps it's okay to leave it as None.

Another thing: the 'pathname' is the filename, and 'lineno' is 1, since the error occurred at the top level of the file.

But what if the error occurs in a specific line? For example, if the file has invalid syntax in a particular line. However, without knowing the line number, it's not possible to capture that. So, the code uses lineno=1 as a placeholder.

Now, the code also needs to import configparser and logging.

But wait, in Python, the ConfigParser's read method can take multiple filenames. However, the code is processing each filename in the config_filenames sequence. So, for each filename, it's read individually.

Another thing: the 'resolve_env' parameter. If True, the interpolation is set to EnvInterpolation. So, when reading the config, any ${VAR} in the values would be replaced with the environment variable.

But the code uses the interpolation parameter correctly.

Now, testing this code. Suppose a config file has a value like "key = ${VAR_NAME}". If resolve_env is True, then the ConfigParser would replace that with the value of VAR_NAME from the environment.

But the code uses the EnvInterpolation class, which is available in configparser.

But wait, in Python versions before 3.8, the EnvInterpolation may not be available. However, the user may assume that they are using a recent version.

So, the code is written with that in mind.

Now, the function returns a tuple of (config_dict, error_logs). The config_dict is a dictionary of filenames to parsed configs, and error_logs is a list of LogRecord instances.

But the code above does that.

But what about the case where the same filename is provided multiple times? The code would process it, but the docstring says "sequence of configuration filenames", so it's possible that duplicates are allowed. However, the code would overwrite the entry in config_dict if the same filename is processed again. But that's up to the user.

Now, the code seems to handle the required cases. However, there's a problem: the code is using the ConfigParser's read method, which may read multiple files. But in this case, the code is processing each filename in the sequence, so it's okay.

Another thing: the code uses 'read' with the filename, but the ConfigParser's read method can take multiple filenames. However, the code is processing each filename in the sequence, so it's okay.

So, the code should work.

But the code may need to handle the case where the config file is empty. However, the ConfigParser would handle that as a parsing error.

Now, the code may need to handle the case where the overrides are a dictionary. For example, if overrides is not None, then it's merged into the parsed_config. But if the parsed_config is a dict of sections, then the overrides may have keys that are sections or not. However, the code is written to merge them, which may not be correct. But given the lack of specification, this is the best assumption.

Thus, the code should be as follows.
