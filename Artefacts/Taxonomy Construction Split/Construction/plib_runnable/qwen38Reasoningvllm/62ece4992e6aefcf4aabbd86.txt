Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _dump_string based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it serializes a Python object into a YAML stream. So, the function takes an object and an optional dumper, and returns the YAML stream.

First, I remember that Python's PyYAML library is used for YAML serialization. The main functions are yaml.dump and yaml.safe_dump. But the function here is called _dump_string, which suggests it's a helper function. The parameter 'dumper' is optional, so maybe it's allowing the user to specify a custom dumper.

Wait, the function's return type is a YAML stream. So, the function should return a string representation of the YAML. But in PyYAML, the dump function returns a string when you pass a stream parameter. Wait, no, the standard usage is that yaml.dump(obj, stream) writes to the stream. But if you want to get the string, you can use a StringIO or similar.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to use the dumper parameter to customize the dumping process. But the docstring says the return is a YAML stream, which is a string. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return the YAML as a string.

Wait, the function's parameters are obj and dumper. The dumper is a parameter that can be passed to the dump function. So, maybe the function is using the dumper argument to allow for custom dumper classes. But how does that fit into the function's purpose?

Let me think about the PyYAML documentation. The dump function can take a dumper parameter, which is an instance of a Dumper class. So, if the user provides a dumper, it should be used; otherwise, the default is used.

So, the function _dump_string should take the object and a dumper, then serialize it into a YAML stream. The function should return the YAML as a string. Therefore, the code would use yaml.dump with the dumper parameter, and capture the output as a string.

But how to capture the output? Because normally, yaml.dump writes to a stream. So, perhaps using a StringIO object to capture the output. Let me check.

Yes, for example:

import yaml
from io import StringIO

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    stream = StringIO()
    yaml.dump(obj, stream, Dumper=dumper)
    return stream.getvalue()

Wait, but the default dumper in PyYAML is SafeDumper. So, if the user doesn't provide a dumper, we use the default. However, the function's parameter is named 'dumper', but in PyYAML, the parameter is called 'Dumper' (uppercase). So, maybe the function is using the correct parameter name.

Wait, in PyYAML, the dump function's parameters are: dump(data, stream=None, Dumper=None, **kwds). So, the parameter is Dumper, not dumper. So, if the function's parameter is named 'dumper', then when passing it to yaml.dump, it should be capitalized as 'Dumper'.

So, the code would be:

import yaml
from io import StringIO

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    """
    Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream

    Args:
        obj: python object

    Returns:
        YAML stream
    """
    stream = StringIO()
    yaml.dump(obj, stream, Dumper=dumper)
    return stream.getvalue()

But wait, the function's parameter is called 'dumper', but in the code, it's passed as 'Dumper'. That's a possible issue. Let me check the PyYAML documentation again. The parameter is indeed 'Dumper', so the function should pass that. So, the code is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the default dumper if none is provided. So, if dumper is None, use the default. But the function's parameter is named 'dumper', which might be a mistake. However, the user provided the function signature with 'dumper' as the parameter name. So, the code should use that name.

Wait, in the function signature, the parameter is 'dumper=None', but in PyYAML, the parameter is 'Dumper'. So, the code should pass 'dumper' as the 'Dumper' parameter. So, the code would be:

yaml.dump(obj, stream, Dumper=dumper)

Yes, that's correct. So, the function is using the dumper parameter to pass to the Dumper argument of yaml.dump.

But what about the default? If dumper is None, then the default Dumper is used. So, the code should work.

Another thing to consider: the function is called _dump_string, which suggests it's a private function. But the user didn't mention that, just the function signature and docstring.

So, putting it all together, the code would import yaml and StringIO, then create a StringIO object, dump the obj into it with the given dumper, and return the string.

Wait, but the user might not have specified the exact parameters. For example, maybe the dumper is supposed to be a custom dumper class. But the function's docstring says the args are obj and dumper, so the code should accept that.

So, the code would be as follows. Also, need to make sure that the function is properly handling the dumper parameter. Also, the function's return is the YAML stream as a string.

Another thing: the function's docstring says "Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream", but the parameters are obj and dumper. So, the function is using the dumper to customize the dumping process.

So, the code should be:

import yaml
from io import StringIO

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    """
    Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream

    Args:
        obj: python object

    Returns:
        YAML stream
    """
    stream = StringIO()
    yaml.dump(obj, stream, Dumper=dumper)
    return stream.getvalue()

But wait, the function's parameter is called 'dumper', but in PyYAML, the parameter is 'Dumper'. So, the code is correct in passing dumper as Dumper.

But perhaps the user expects that the dumper is a function or something else. However, based on the standard PyYAML usage, the Dumper parameter is a class, so the code should be okay.

Another possible consideration: the function may need to handle different versions of PyYAML. But assuming that the user is using a version that supports the Dumper parameter.

So, the code should be as written above. Let me check if there are any other parameters needed. The docstring doesn't mention any other parameters, so the function only takes obj and dumper.

Therefore, the generated code should be:

import yaml
from io import StringIO

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    """
    Given a python object and serialize it into a YAML stream

    Args:
        obj: python object

    Returns:
        YAML stream
    """
    stream = StringIO()
    yaml.dump(obj, stream, Dumper=dumper)
    return stream.getvalue()

But wait, the user's docstring says the return is a YAML stream, which is a string. So, this code returns the string, which is correct.

I think that's the correct approach. So, the code is as above.
