Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element and it takes an issue as an argument. The docstring says it returns possible values of number and sup, so I guess it's extracting numbers and supplementary information from the issue.

First, I should think about what the issue might contain. Issues can have text, maybe numbers, and sometimes supplementary links or info. So the function needs to parse through this content.

I'll start by initializing variables for number and supplement. Number can be an integer, maybe starting at 0, and supplement could be a string to hold any extra info.

Next, I'll process the issue's content. I'll split it into lines and iterate through each line. For each line, I'll check if it's a digit. If it is, I'll increment the number. But I need to make sure that sequences of digits are treated as a single number, so I'll check if the current character is a digit and the previous one wasn't.

If a line doesn't contain digits, I'll check if it contains a URL. I'll use a regex to find any URLs in the line and add them to the supplement string.

After processing all lines, the function will return the extracted number and supplement. I'll make sure to return them as a tuple.

I should also consider edge cases, like lines that are empty or have multiple digits. The regex for URLs should be specific enough to catch typical issue links, like starting with http:// or https://.

Putting it all together, the code will loop through each line, extract numbers, collect URLs, and return the results. I'll write this in Python, making sure to import re for the regular expression.
