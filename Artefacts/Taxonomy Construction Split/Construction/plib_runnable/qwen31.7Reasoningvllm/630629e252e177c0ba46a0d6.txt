Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called retrieve_diaspora_host_meta and it returns an XRD instance. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function takes a host as an argument. The docstring says it retrieves a remote Diaspora host-meta document. So, the goal is to fetch that metadata from the host.

I remember that XRD (Extensible Resource Description) is a protocol used for describing resources, often used in federated identity systems. The XRD instance would be an object that represents the resource, maybe with methods to get metadata.

But the problem is, the user hasn't provided any specific libraries or APIs for interacting with Diaspora's XRD. So, I need to assume that there's a way to make HTTP requests to the host's XRD endpoint.

So, the function would likely use requests library to send a GET request to the host's XRD endpoint. The XRD endpoint for a Diaspora host might be something like https://host.xrd/ or similar.

Wait, but the function returns an XRD instance. So, perhaps the code is supposed to create an XRD object, maybe using a library like xrd or something else. But without knowing the exact library, I need to make an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary or a class instance that represents the XRD data. But the docstring says it returns an XRD instance, so I need to define that.

Wait, the user says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". So, the code should implement the function as per the signature and docstring.

So, the function will make a GET request to the host's XRD endpoint, perhaps using the requests library. Then, parse the response and return an XRD instance.

But how to represent the XRD instance? Maybe the code uses a class, like XRD, which has methods to get metadata, etc. But since the user hasn't provided the XRD class, I need to assume that the code will create an instance and return it.

So, the code would look something like:

import requests

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f"https://{host}.xrd"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return XRD(response.text)
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to retrieve XRD for {host}")

But wait, the XRD class is not defined here. The user's docstring says that the function returns an XRD instance, so the code must include that.

But since the user hasn't provided the XRD class, perhaps the code is supposed to return a dictionary or a similar structure. However, the docstring specifies an XRD instance, so maybe the code is supposed to create an instance using a library like xrd or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary, but the docstring says XRD instance. Hmm.

Wait, the user's docstring says: "returns: ``XRD`` instance". So, the code must return an XRD instance. But without knowing the exact class, I need to make an assumption. Maybe the code uses a library like xrd, which is a Python library for XRD.

Assuming that the XRD class is available, the code would be:

import requests

class XRD:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f"https://{host}.xrd"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return XRD(response.text)
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to retrieve XRD for {host}")

But the user might not have the XRD class, so maybe the code is supposed to return a dictionary. However, the docstring says XRD instance, so perhaps the code is supposed to return a dictionary, but the user's docstring is incorrect. But since the user provided the docstring, I have to follow it.

Alternatively, maybe the XRD instance is a class that has methods to get metadata. But without knowing the exact class, I can't write the code.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary, but the docstring is wrong. But the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given docstring, so I have to follow it.

So, the code will make a request to the host's XRD endpoint, parse the response, and return an XRD instance. The XRD class is assumed to be available.

Therefore, the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the URL is correct. For example, Diaspora's XRD endpoint might be something like https://host.xrd, but the exact URL depends on the host.

So, the code would be:

import requests

class XRD:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

def retrieve_diaspora_host_meta(host):
    url = f"https://{host}.xrd"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return XRD(response.text)
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to retrieve XRD for {host}")

But the user might not have the XRD class, so maybe the code should return a dictionary. However, the docstring says XRD instance, so I have to proceed with that.

Another possible approach is to use a library like xrd, but without knowing the exact library, it's hard to say. So, the code as written should be correct.
