Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me look at what's required.

The function is called list_of_file_names and takes two parameters: settings_dirs and spec_option. The docstring says it creates and returns a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). 

Wait, the docstring mentions a method called cli.ListOfFileNames(), but I don't see any import statements or references to that method in the code. Hmm, maybe the user expects me to simulate that method? Or perhaps it's a placeholder for a real method that's supposed to be implemented.

But the user's instruction says not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So I need to output only the code. However, the function's implementation isn't provided. How to proceed?

Maybe the function is supposed to create a list of file names based on the settings_dirs and spec_option. But without knowing the exact logic, I can't write the code. Wait, the docstring says "via cli.ListOfFileNames()", which suggests that the function is using that method. But since there's no code for that method, perhaps the user expects me to generate a mock implementation?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of file names, and the cli.ListOfFileNames() is a hypothetical method that's supposed to be called. But without knowing the actual implementation, I can't write the code.

Wait, perhaps the user is expecting a placeholder or a mock function. Let me think. The function's purpose is to create a new IniType complex type. So maybe the code is supposed to use the cli.ListOfFileNames() method and return the result. But since there's no code for that method, perhaps the function is just a wrapper that calls that method and returns the result.

But how to implement that? Let me try to write the code. The function would probably call the cli.ListOfFileNames() method with the provided settings_dirs and spec_option, then return the result. But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of cli.ListOfFileNames(), I can't know what to return. However, the docstring says "create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()", so maybe the function is supposed to return the result of that method.

So, the code would look like:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    # Call the cli.ListOfFileNames method with the provided parameters
    # Assuming cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes settings_dirs and spec_option
    # and returns an IniType complex type
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But since the user hasn't provided the actual implementation of cli.ListOfFileNames(), this is just a placeholder. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a mock that returns a dummy value, or maybe the actual implementation is expected to be in another part of the code.

But the user hasn't provided any other code, so I have to generate the code as per the given info. Therefore, the code would be the function as described, with the return statement calling the cli.ListOfFileNames method.

But since the user's example shows that the function is supposed to return a new IniType complex type, maybe the code is supposed to create that type. However, without knowing the exact implementation, I can't write the code. But perhaps the user expects that the function is a wrapper that calls the method and returns the result.

So, the final code would be the function as written, with the return statement calling the method. But since the user hasn't provided the actual method, I have to assume that the code is supposed to be a placeholder.

Therefore, the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But wait, the docstring says "create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()", so maybe the function is supposed to return the result of that method. So the code is as above.

But the user's example shows that the function is supposed to be generated, so the code is as written.
