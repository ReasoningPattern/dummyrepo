Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _reset_logging method in the given class. The docstring says it resets the logging system. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the method is part of a class, so I'll need to handle logging within that class. The function is called _reset_logging, which suggests it's a private method, maybe used internally.

Logging in Python is typically done using the logging module. To reset the logging system, I might need to stop any existing handlers and reset the logger configuration. But how exactly does resetting logging work?

Wait, maybe the method is supposed to clear all log records and reset the logging configuration. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Stop all handlers to prevent any further logging.
2. Reset the logger configuration, maybe by creating a new logger instance.
3. Clear any existing log records.

But how to implement this in code? Let me think.

The logging module has a logger object. To reset it, maybe we can stop all handlers. For example, using a loop over the handlers and calling stop() on them. But wait, the logging module's Handler class has a stop() method? Or maybe we need to remove them.

Alternatively, maybe the method should reset the logger's handlers and level. For example, setting the level to logging.NOTSET and removing all handlers.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

- Get the logger instance for the class.
- Remove all handlers from the logger.
- Set the logging level to NOTSET.
- Clear any existing log records.

But how to ensure that the logging system is reset properly. Maybe the method should reset the logger's handlers and level, and also clear any existing log records.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me think of the steps.

In Python, to reset logging, you might do something like:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = cls.logger  # Assuming cls has a logger attribute
    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)
    logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
    # Maybe reset other configurations here

But wait, the actual implementation might vary. The problem is that the user hasn't provided the class structure, so I have to make assumptions.

The function is part of a class, so the method is likely to access the logger of the class. But since it's a private method, perhaps it's part of a class that manages logging.

So, the code would look something like:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = cls.logger
    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)
    logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
    # Maybe reset other configurations here

But I need to make sure that the logger is properly reset. Also, maybe the logger is created in the class, so the method would have access to it.

Alternatively, if the class is managing the logger, perhaps the method is supposed to reset the logger's configuration. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Another approach: the method could reset the logging by clearing all log records. For example, using logging.shutdown() to shutdown the logging system, but that might not be the right approach here.

Wait, the docstring says "reset the logging system". So perhaps the method is supposed to reset all logging configurations, including handlers, levels, etc.

So, the code would need to:

1. Get the logger instance.
2. Remove all handlers.
3. Set the logging level to NOTSET.
4. Maybe clear any existing log records.

But how to clear log records? Maybe using logging.shutdown() to shutdown the logging system, but that would stop all handlers and clear the logs.

Alternatively, maybe the method is supposed to reset the logger's handlers and level, and also clear any existing log records.

But without knowing the exact implementation, I have to make the best guess.

So, the code would be something like:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = cls.logger
    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)
    logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
    # Maybe reset other configurations here

But perhaps the logger is created in the class, so the method can access it. Also, maybe the logger is a property of the class.

Alternatively, if the class has a logger attribute, then the method can access it.

So, the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the code is correct.

Another point: when you reset the logging, you might need to reinitialize the logger. But if the logger is already initialized, resetting it would involve removing handlers and setting the level.

So, the code seems reasonable. Therefore, the generated code would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = cls.logger
    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)
    logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
    # Maybe reset other configurations here

But the user might want to include the import statement. However, the code is supposed to be generated, and the import is part of the code.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so the import would be at the top of the module. But the code generated here would include the import statement.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So the code would include the import statement.

So, the final code would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = cls.logger
    for handler in logger.handlers:
        handler.close()
        logger.removeHandler(handler)
    logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)
    # Maybe reset other configurations here

But maybe the logger is not a property of the class. Alternatively, the class might have a logger attribute. But without more info, this is the best approach.

Another thing: the method is called _reset_logging, which is a private method. So the code would have the function definition with the docstring as given.

So, the code is as above.
