Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says it should remove and return the least frequently used (key, value) pair. Hmm, so this is likely for a data structure that tracks usage frequency, like a cache with a least frequently used eviction policy.

First, I should think about how to implement this. The method is part of a class, probably a custom dictionary or a similar structure. The standard dict in Python doesn't have this behavior, so maybe the class maintains some additional data to track frequencies.

Wait, the function is called popitem, which is similar to the built-in dict.popitem(), but the built-in one removes the last inserted item. However, the docstring here specifies that it should remove the least frequently used item. So this is a custom implementation.

So, the class probably has a way to track the frequency of each item. Maybe using a dictionary to store the frequencies and another structure to keep track of the order based on frequency. For example, a heap could be used where the least frequent items are prioritized. Or perhaps a sorted data structure like a TreeSet, but Python doesn't have that. Alternatively, maybe a priority queue where the priority is the frequency.

But how to handle the least frequently used? Let's consider that each time an item is accessed, its frequency increases. So, when popitem is called, we need to find the item with the lowest frequency and remove it.

Wait, but if two items have the same frequency, which one to choose? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe it's arbitrary. But in practice, perhaps the order in which they were inserted at that frequency level matters. For example, if two items have the same frequency, the one that was inserted first (or last) might be chosen.

So, the class might have a dictionary to store the items, another to track their frequencies, and a priority queue (like a heap) to keep track of the items ordered by frequency. However, maintaining a heap could be tricky because when frequencies change, the heap needs to be updated. That's not straightforward with a standard heap.

Alternatively, maybe using a heap where each element is a tuple of (frequency, insertion_order, key, value). Then, when we need to pop the least frequently used, we pop the smallest frequency, and if there's a tie, the one with the smallest insertion_order. But insertion_order might not be necessary if the order of insertion isn't important when frequencies are equal.

Wait, but the problem says "least frequently used", so if two items have the same frequency, perhaps the one that was least recently used is chosen? Or maybe it's just arbitrary. The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the implementation can choose any of them.

Another approach: the class could maintain a priority queue where the priority is the frequency. Each time an item is accessed, its frequency is incremented, and then we need to update its priority in the queue. However, standard heaps in Python don't support efficient updates of priorities. So maybe using a heap with (frequency, key, value) and when frequencies change, we just add the new entry to the heap and leave the old ones there. But then, when popping, we might have to check if the top of the heap is still valid (i.e., the current frequency of the item matches the one in the heap). That could get complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a combination of a dictionary for the items and a separate structure to track the frequencies. For example, a min-heap that stores the frequencies and the keys. But again, updating frequencies would require some way to manage the heap.

Wait, perhaps the class is a LFUCache (Least Frequently Used Cache). In that case, the standard approach is to use a dictionary to store the items, a frequency dictionary to track how many times each item has been accessed, and a双向 linked list or something similar to manage the order. But implementing that from scratch would require more code.

But the user just wants the popitem method. So maybe the class has a way to track the least frequent items. Let's think of a simple approach. Suppose the class has a dictionary self.data, and a frequency dictionary self.freq. Then, when popitem is called, we need to find the key with the minimum frequency. If there are multiple keys with the same minimum frequency, perhaps we pick the one that was inserted first or last. But how to track that?

Alternatively, maybe the class maintains a list of items sorted by frequency. But that would be inefficient for updates.

Alternatively, using a heap. Let's say each entry in the heap is a tuple (frequency, key, value). The heap is a min-heap based on frequency. However, when the frequency of an item changes, the heap might have old entries. So, when popping, we need to check if the top of the heap is still valid. If not, we pop it and check the next one.

But how to handle that? For example, when an item's frequency is updated, we can push a new entry into the heap with the new frequency. Then, when we pop, we check if the frequency in the heap matches the current frequency in the freq dictionary. If not, we discard that entry and proceed to the next.

So, the popitem method would:

1. Find the entry with the minimum frequency in the heap.
2. Check if that entry's frequency is still the current frequency for the key.
3. If yes, remove it from the data and freq dictionaries, and return (key, value).
4. If not, pop it from the heap and continue until a valid entry is found.

But this approach could lead to multiple invalid entries in the heap. So, the heap might have some outdated entries, but we can handle them by checking their validity when popping.

So, the code would need to have a heap, and each time an item is accessed, its frequency is increased, and a new entry is added to the heap. Then, when popitem is called, we check the top of the heap for validity.

But how to implement this in Python? Let's outline the steps.

First, the class would need to have:

- self.data: a dictionary mapping keys to values.
- self.freq: a dictionary mapping keys to their current frequencies.
- self.heap: a priority queue (min-heap) that stores tuples of (frequency, key, value).

But when we add an item to the heap, we might have multiple entries for the same key with different frequencies. So, when we pop, we need to check if the frequency in the heap entry matches the current frequency of the key. If not, we ignore that entry.

So, the popitem method would:

- While the heap is not empty:
   - Pop the entry with the smallest frequency.
   - Check if the key exists in self.data and if its frequency matches the entry's frequency.
   - If yes, remove the key from self.data and self.freq, and return (key, value).
   - If not, continue popping until a valid entry is found.

But this could be inefficient if there are many invalid entries. However, for the sake of this problem, perhaps that's acceptable.

Now, the code for the popitem method:

We need to import heapq.

But the user's code might not have the heap initialized. So, the class should have an __init__ method that initializes the heap.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the rest of the class structure. So, perhaps the code is part of a larger class, and the heap is already managed.

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a different approach. For example, maintaining a list of items sorted by frequency, and when an item is accessed, it's moved to a higher frequency group. But again, that's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a priority queue where each entry is (frequency, insertion_order, key, value). The insertion_order could help break ties when frequencies are the same. For example, when two items have the same frequency, the one with the smaller insertion_order is popped first.

But how to track insertion_order? Maybe each time an item is added, it gets an incrementing counter. Then, when frequencies are the same, the one with the smallest insertion_order is chosen.

But again, the problem is that when frequencies change, the heap entries are outdated. So, the popitem method would need to handle that.

Putting this together, the code for popitem would involve:

- Checking the heap for the minimum frequency entry.
- Verifying if that entry is still valid (i.e., the key exists in data and the frequency matches).
- If valid, remove it and return.
- If not, pop it and check the next.

So, the code would look something like this:

import heapq

def popitem(self):
    while self.heap:
        freq, key, value = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        if key in self.data and self.freq[key] == freq:
            del self.data[key]
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")

But wait, the heap might have multiple entries for the same key. For example, if the key was accessed multiple times, each time increasing its frequency. So, when we pop an entry, it's possible that the key's current frequency is higher than the one in the heap entry. In that case, we need to ignore that entry.

But how to handle that? For example, when a key's frequency is updated, we push a new entry into the heap. The old entries for that key would still be in the heap, but they would be invalid. So, when we pop, we check if the key is still present and if the frequency matches. If not, we continue popping.

But this approach could lead to the heap containing many invalid entries. However, each time an item is accessed, we add a new entry to the heap, so the heap will have multiple entries for the same key. But when we pop, we check validity, and if invalid, we just discard them.

This is a common approach in some LFU implementations. So, the code would need to have a heap, and the popitem method would process it as described.

But then, the user's code might not have the heap initialized. So, perhaps the class has an __init__ method that initializes the heap. However, the user hasn't provided that, so maybe the code should assume that the heap is maintained properly.

Alternatively, maybe the class uses a different data structure. But given the function signature and the docstring, the code should implement the popitem method as described.

So, the code would need to have:

- self.data: the actual data store.
- self.freq: tracks the frequency of each key.
- self.heap: a min-heap based on frequency.

But in Python, the heapq module is used for the heap. Each time a key is accessed, its frequency is increased, and a new entry is pushed into the heap. When popitem is called, we pop entries from the heap until we find one that's valid.

But the problem is that the heap might have multiple entries for the same key. For example, if a key was added, then accessed, then accessed again, the heap would have entries for frequency 1, 2, etc. However, when we pop, we check if the key is still in data and if the frequency matches. If it's still there and the frequency matches, we remove it. Otherwise, we ignore.

So, the code would be as follows:

But wait, the user's code might not have the heap as part of the class. So, maybe the class is designed with a heap, and the popitem method uses it.

But since the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, perhaps the code should be written in a way that assumes the presence of these attributes.

So, the code would be:

import heapq

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    while self.heap:
        freq, key, value = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        if key in self.data and self.freq[key] == freq:
            del self.data[key]
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")

But what about the insertion_order? If two items have the same frequency, how to decide which one to pop? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's arbitrary. However, in some implementations, when frequencies are the same, the least recently used is chosen. But that's more for LRU. For LFU, if two items have the same frequency, perhaps the one that was inserted first is chosen. But how to track that?

Alternatively, maybe the heap entries include the insertion order. For example, each entry is (frequency, insertion_order, key, value). Then, when frequencies are the same, the one with the smallest insertion_order is popped first. But that requires maintaining insertion_order.

But the user hasn't mentioned anything about insertion order, so maybe it's not necessary. The problem only specifies that the least frequently used is removed. If there's a tie, perhaps the order is arbitrary, or maybe the one that was inserted first. However, without more information, it's hard to say. But the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the code can just return any of them.

But in practice, for a LFU cache, when two items have the same frequency, the one that was least recently used is evicted. However, that's more of an LRU policy. So maybe the user is referring to a LFU cache, which requires tracking both frequency and insertion time.

But given the information provided, perhaps the code should just focus on frequency. So, the code above would work, but it might not handle ties properly. However, since the docstring doesn't specify, maybe it's acceptable.

Another consideration: when the key is removed from self.data, it's also removed from self.freq. So, the code checks if the key is in self.data and if the frequency matches.

But what if the key is not in self.data anymore? Then, it's invalid, so we skip it.

So, the code seems plausible. However, the user's code may have different attributes. For example, maybe the heap is stored as a list, and the class has other attributes.

But given the function signature and the docstring, the code should be written as such. Also, the user says to output only the code, no explanations.

So, the final code would be:

import heapq

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    while self.heap:
        freq, key, value = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        if key in self.data and self.freq[key] == freq:
            del self.data[key]
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")

But wait, the heap entries might have the same key multiple times. For example, if the key was added and then accessed, leading to multiple entries. However, when we pop, we check if the key is still present and if the frequency matches. If the key is present but the frequency is higher, that means the entry in the heap is outdated, so we skip it.

But this approach could lead to the heap having multiple entries for the same key. However, when the key is removed from self.data, all entries for that key in the heap would be invalid, so they would be popped and ignored.

But this might not be efficient. However, given the constraints, perhaps this is acceptable.

Another thing: the heap might have entries that are no longer in the data. So, when we pop, we check if the key is in self.data. If not, we skip.

So, the code seems correct. But the user's code may have different structures. For example, maybe the heap stores (frequency, key) and the value is stored in the data. But the code as written would work if the heap entries are (frequency, key, value).

But in the code, when we pop from the heap, we get (freq, key, value). Then, we check if the key is in self.data and if the frequency matches. If so, we delete it from data and freq, and return the (key, value).

But what if the value in the heap is different from the current value in self.data? That's possible if the same key was updated. For example, if the key was modified, the heap might have an old value. But in that case, the key is still present in self.data, so the code would check if the frequency matches. However, the value in the heap might not match the current value. Wait, but the key is the same, so the value in the data is the current one. So, the heap entry's value is not necessarily the same as the current value. But that's a problem. Because if the key is present in the data, but the value in the heap entry is different, then we would return the wrong value.

Wait, no. Because the heap entries are (frequency, key, value). But when the key is updated, the value in the data changes, but the heap entries for that key would still have the old value. So, when we pop an entry, the key is present in data, but the value in the heap entry might not match the current value. That's a problem.

Ah, right. So, the heap entries should not store the value, but just the key and frequency. Because the value can be retrieved from self.data. So, maybe the heap entries are (frequency, key). Then, when we pop, we get the key, and then retrieve the value from self.data.

But then, how to handle the value? Let me adjust that.

So, the heap entries would be (frequency, key). Then, when we pop, we check if the key is in self.data. If it is, then we get the value from self.data, and then delete it.

But then, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    while self.heap:
        freq, key = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        if key in self.data:
            value = self.data[key]
            del self.data[key]
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")

But then, the problem is that the heap might have entries with old frequencies. For example, if a key was accessed, increasing its frequency, but the heap still has an entry with the old frequency. So, when we pop, we might get an entry with a lower frequency than the current one. In that case, we need to check if the key's current frequency is equal to the popped frequency. If not, we continue popping.

Wait, that's important. Because when a key is accessed, its frequency is increased. So, the heap might have multiple entries for the same key with different frequencies. For example, when a key is first added, it's pushed with frequency 1. Then, when it's accessed, frequency becomes 2, and another entry is pushed. So, the heap has entries (1, key) and (2, key). When we pop, we get (1, key), but the current frequency of the key is 2, so we skip it. Then, the next time we pop, we get (2, key), which is valid.

But how to handle that? So, the code should check if the key's current frequency matches the popped frequency. Otherwise, it's an old entry and should be ignored.

So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    while self.heap:
        freq, key = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        if self.freq.get(key, 0) == freq:
            value = self.data[key]
            del self.data[key]
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")

But then, what if the key is not in self.freq anymore? Because when it's deleted, self.freq would have it removed. So, the check self.freq.get(key, 0) == freq would return False if the key is not present.

But in that case, the code would continue popping until it finds a valid entry.

This approach would work, but the heap could have many outdated entries. However, each time the frequency of a key changes, a new entry is added to the heap. So, the heap might have multiple entries for the same key, but the valid one is the one with the current frequency.

But this could lead to the heap having multiple entries for the same key. However, when we pop, we check if the frequency matches. If it does, we remove it. Otherwise, we ignore.

This seems correct.

But how to handle the insertion_order? For example, if two keys have the same frequency, which one to choose? The code as written would pop the one with the smallest frequency, but if there are multiple entries with the same frequency, the heap would order them based on the key. But since the key is part of the tuple, and heapq compares tuples lexicographically, if two entries have the same frequency, the one with the smaller key would be popped first. But that's arbitrary. However, the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, the heap could store (frequency, insertion_order, key), so that when frequencies are equal, the one with the smallest insertion_order is popped first. But again, the user hasn't specified that, so maybe it's not needed.

So, the code would be as follows, assuming that the heap is maintained with (frequency, key) tuples, and that self.data and self.freq are dictionaries.

But the user's code may have different structures. For example, maybe the heap is a list managed by the class, and the frequencies are tracked in self.freq.

So, the code for popitem would be:

import heapq

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    while self.heap:
        freq, key = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        if self.freq.get(key, 0) == freq:
            value = self.data[key]
            del self.data[key]
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")

But then, the heap could have multiple entries for the same key. However, when the key is removed, all entries for it in the heap are invalid. So, the code would keep popping until it finds a valid one.

But what if the heap is empty? Then, it raises KeyError.

But in the case of a LFU cache, when the heap is empty, the dictionary is empty, so that's correct.

But the user's code may have other attributes. For example, maybe the heap is a list that's managed by the class, and the method is part of a custom dictionary.

So, the code should be written with these assumptions.

But the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, so perhaps the code is part of a larger class that maintains self.data, self.freq, and self.heap.

Thus, the code for popitem would be as above.

But the user's code may have the heap stored as a list, and the method uses heapq to manage it.

So, the final code would be:

import heapq

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least frequently used.
    """
    while self.heap:
        freq, key = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
        if self.freq.get(key, 0) == freq:
            value = self.data[key]
            del self.data[key]
            del self.freq[key]
            return (key, value)
    raise KeyError("popitem(): dictionary is empty")

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the user may have a different structure. For example, maybe the heap stores (frequency, key, value), but that would lead to the problem where the value might not match the current value in the data. However, if the key is present in self.data, then the value is current, so it's okay to return it.

Alternatively, maybe the heap stores (frequency, key), and the value is stored in self.data. So, when we pop the key, we get the value from self.data.

This seems correct.

But what about when the key is in the heap but has been removed from self.data? For example, if the key was removed, then the heap entry is invalid. So, the code checks if the key is in self.data, but since self.freq is a dictionary, if the key is not in self.data, then self.freq.get(key, 0) would return 0, which may not match the freq in the heap. Wait, no. Because when the key is removed from self.data, it's also removed from self.freq. So, if the key is not in self.data, then self.freq.get(key, 0) would return 0, but the heap entry's freq would be whatever it was when it was added. So, if the key was removed, then the heap entry's freq would not match the current freq (which is 0), so the code would skip it.

But this is correct. Because once the key is removed, it's no longer in the data, so the heap entry is invalid.

So, this code should work.

But the user's code may not have self.heap, self.data, or self.freq. However, given the function signature and the docstring, this is the best approach I can think of.

Thus, the generated code would be as follows.
