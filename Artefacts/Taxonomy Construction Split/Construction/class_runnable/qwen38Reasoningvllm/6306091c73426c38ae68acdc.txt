Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_from_content method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The function's purpose is to validate that a YAML spec file contains all the required fields. If any mandatory data is missing, it should raise an IRValidatorException. Then, it should return the loaded data as a dictionary.

First, the function is a class method (cls is the first parameter), so I should use @classmethod or define it within a class. But since the user didn't provide the class context, I'll assume it's part of a class.

The parameter spec_content is optional, defaulting to None. So, I need to handle cases where it's not provided. Wait, but the function is called validate_from_content, which suggests that maybe it's supposed to read the content from a file? However, the parameter is given, so perhaps the content is passed in. Maybe the function is designed to take the content as input, not read from a file. So, the function's responsibility is to validate the provided YAML content.

Next, the function needs to load the YAML content into a dictionary. So, I'll use the yaml module's load function. But I should make sure to handle possible exceptions, like if the content is not valid YAML.

Wait, the docstring says it raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, the function should first load the YAML content, then check for required fields. But what are the required fields? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the required fields are defined elsewhere in the class, perhaps as a class attribute.

So, the steps are:

1. Load the spec_content into a Python dictionary using yaml.safe_load or similar.
2. Check if all required fields are present in the dictionary.
3. If any required field is missing, raise IRValidatorException.
4. Return the loaded dictionary.

But how to determine the required fields? The function is part of a class, so maybe the class has a class attribute like REQUIRED_FIELDS that lists all the mandatory keys. So, the code would check if all those keys exist in the loaded data.

Also, need to handle the case where spec_content is None. Wait, the function's parameter is spec_content=None, but the docstring says "content of spec file". So perhaps if spec_content is None, the function should read it from a file? But the function's name is validate_from_content, which might imply that the content is provided. However, the parameter is optional, so maybe the function can read from a default location if not provided. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe the function is designed to take the content as input, and if it's None, perhaps it's an error? Or maybe the function is supposed to read from a file, but the parameter is for passing in the content. The docstring isn't clear on that. But since the parameter is given, I'll assume that the content is passed in, and if it's None, maybe the function should raise an error? Or perhaps the function is supposed to read from a file if spec_content is not provided. But the user hasn't mentioned file reading, so maybe the function is intended to validate the content that's already provided. So, perhaps the function is supposed to process the spec_content, which is a string, and validate it.

So, the code would start by loading the YAML content. Let's use yaml.safe_load because it's safer than full load. Then, check for required fields. Let's assume that the class has a class attribute called REQUIRED_FIELDS that is a list of the mandatory keys.

So, inside the function:

- If spec_content is None, maybe raise an exception? Or perhaps the function is designed to have a default source. But the docstring doesn't mention that. The user might have intended that the function is called with the content, so if it's None, maybe that's an error. However, the function's parameters allow for it to be None, so perhaps the function is supposed to handle that case. But the docstring says "when mandatory data is missing in spec file", so maybe spec_content being None is considered missing data. But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the content from a file if not provided. But since the user hasn't specified that, perhaps the function is supposed to take the content as input and validate it.

So, proceed under the assumption that spec_content is a string containing YAML, and the function needs to parse it into a dict and check for required fields.

So, code steps:

Import yaml.

Check if spec_content is None. If so, maybe raise an error? Or perhaps the function is supposed to read from a default location. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the function expects spec_content to be provided. However, the parameter is optional, so maybe the function can handle that. But the docstring says "content of spec file", so maybe if it's None, the function should read from a file. But without knowing the file path, that's not possible. So perhaps the function is designed to take the content as input, and if not provided, it's an error. But the user's docstring doesn't mention that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a method to read the spec file, and this function is called with the content. But again, without more context, it's hard to say. The user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the function's parameters are as given.

So, proceed with the code:

First, load the YAML content. Then check for required fields.

But how to handle the required fields? Let's assume that the class has a class attribute called REQUIRED_FIELDS. So, in the code:

import yaml

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']  # example

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        # Load YAML content
        if spec_content is None:
            # Maybe raise an error? Or read from a default file?
            # Since the parameter is optional, but the docstring says "content of spec file", perhaps the function is supposed to read from a file if not provided.
            # However, without knowing the file path, this is not possible. So perhaps the function is intended to take the content as input, and if not provided, it's an error. But the user hasn't specified that. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read from a file, but the parameter is for passing in the content. So, perhaps the function is designed to take the content, and if it's None, maybe it's an error. But the user's docstring says "param spec_content: content of spec file", so maybe it's expected that the content is provided. However, the parameter is optional, so perhaps the function can handle the case where it's not provided by reading from a default location. But again, without knowing where, it's impossible. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the content as input, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the user's docstring doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read from a file, but the parameter is for passing in the content. So, perhaps the function is designed to take the content, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the user's docstring says "param spec_content: content of spec file", so maybe the function is supposed to process that content.

So, in the code, first, load the YAML content into a dict. Then check if all required fields are present.

So, code:

import yaml

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']  # example

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            # Maybe raise an error? Or assume that it's handled elsewhere?
            # Since the function's parameter is optional, perhaps the function is supposed to read from a file if not provided.
            # But without knowing the file path, this is not possible. So perhaps the function is intended to take the content as input, and if not provided, it's an error. However, the user's docstring doesn't specify that. So maybe the function is supposed to read from a file, but the parameter is for passing in the content. So, perhaps the function is designed to take the content, and if not provided, it's an error. But the user might have intended that the function reads from a file. However, the function's name is validate_from_content, which suggests that the content is passed in. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take the content as input.

            # For the purpose of this code, maybe assume that spec_content is provided. But the parameter is optional. So perhaps the function is supposed to read from a file if not provided. However, since the user hasn't specified the file path, I can't include that. So maybe the function is supposed to take the content as input, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the docstring doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read from a file, but the parameter is for passing in the content. So, perhaps the function is designed to take the content, and if not provided, it's an error. But how to handle that? The user might have intended that the function is called with the content, so if it's None, perhaps the function should raise an error. But the docstring doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the function is supposed to process the spec_content, which is a string. So, proceed with that.

            # Wait, the function's parameter is spec_content, which is the content of the spec file. So, if it's None, maybe the function is supposed to read from a default location. But without knowing where, perhaps the function is supposed to have a default. However, since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the function is supposed to take the content as input. So, in the code, if spec_content is None, perhaps raise an error. But the docstring says "param spec_content: content of spec file", so maybe it's expected that the content is provided. However, the parameter is optional. Maybe the function is supposed to read from a file if not provided, but again, without knowing the file path, that's not possible. So perhaps the function is designed to take the content as input, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the user might have intended that the function can be called with or without the content. Hmm.

            # Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the function should check if spec_content is None and handle it. But how? Maybe the function is supposed to read from a file if not provided. But since the user hasn't given that detail, maybe the code should assume that spec_content is provided. However, the parameter is optional. So perhaps the function is supposed to read from a file if spec_content is None. But again, without knowing the file path, that's not feasible. Therefore, perhaps the function is supposed to take the content as input, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the user's docstring doesn't mention that. So maybe the function is supposed to process the content, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the user's docstring says "content of spec file", so maybe the function is supposed to take that content. So, proceed.

        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            # Maybe raise an exception here? The docstring says to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. But parsing error is different. However, the user's docstring doesn't mention that. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle that. But the user hasn't specified. So maybe the function should raise an exception if the YAML is invalid. But the docstring says to raise when mandatory data is missing. So perhaps the function is supposed to first load the YAML, then check for required fields. So, in code:

            # But the user hasn't specified what exception to raise for YAML errors. The docstring says to raise IRValidatorException. So perhaps the code should catch YAML errors and re-raise as IRValidatorException. Or maybe the function is supposed to assume that the content is valid YAML. But that's not safe. So, perhaps the code should load the YAML and check for required fields, and if any of those are missing, raise the exception.

        # Now, check required fields
        missing_fields = [field for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS if field not in data]
        if missing_fields:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {missing_fields}")

        return data

But wait, what if spec_content is None? The code as written would try to load it, which would throw an error. So, perhaps the function should first check if spec_content is None and handle that case. But the user's docstring doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take the content as input, and if it's None, then it's an error. However, the parameter is optional, so maybe the function is designed to have a default. But the user hasn't provided that. So, maybe the function is supposed to read from a file if spec_content is None. But again, without knowing the file path, that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the function is supposed to take the content as input, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the user's docstring doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the function should assume that spec_content is provided. But the parameter is optional. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to read the content from a file, but the parameter is for passing in the content. So, if spec_content is None, maybe it's an error. But again, the user's docstring doesn't specify. So, maybe the function should proceed under the assumption that spec_content is provided. However, the parameter is optional, so perhaps the function should handle that case. But without more info, it's hard to say. Since the user hasn't provided more details, perhaps the code should proceed with the assumption that spec_content is provided, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the function's parameter is optional, so maybe the code should check if spec_content is None and raise an error. However, the docstring doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the function is supposed to read from a file if not provided. But since the user hasn't specified the file path, maybe the function is supposed to have a default. But again, without knowing, perhaps the code should just proceed with the given spec_content. So, in the code, if spec_content is None, maybe raise an error. But the user's docstring says "content of spec file", so maybe the function is supposed to take that content. So, proceed.

But the user's function signature has spec_content as a parameter, so perhaps the code is supposed to process that. So, the code would be:

import yaml

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']  # example

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        """
        validates that spec (YAML) content has all required fields

        :param spec_content: content of spec file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in spec file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a spec (YAML) file
        """
        if spec_content is None:
            # Maybe raise an error? Or assume that it's handled elsewhere?
            # Since the parameter is optional, perhaps the function is supposed to read from a default file. But without knowing the path, can't do that. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take the content as input, and if it's None, then it's an error. But the user's docstring doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the function should proceed with the given content. So, maybe the code should not check for None here. But if spec_content is None, then yaml.safe_load would throw an error. So, perhaps the function should handle that case. For example:

            raise ValueError("spec_content is required")

        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            # Maybe raise an IRValidatorException here?
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}") from e

        missing_fields = [field for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS if field not in data]
        if missing_fields:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {missing_fields}")

        return data

But the user hasn't mentioned handling invalid YAML. The docstring says to raise IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So, perhaps the function is supposed to assume that the YAML is valid, and only check for missing required fields. However, in practice, you should handle possible parsing errors. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the code should just proceed with loading and checking.

But the user's function signature says that the parameter is spec_content, which is the content of the spec file. So, the code should process that content. So, the code would load it into a dict, check for required fields, and return it.

But what if the spec_content is not a string? Well, the function's parameter is a string, so perhaps the code is supposed to handle that. But again, the user hasn't specified. So, proceed with the code as per the given info.

Now, the code needs to import yaml and raise IRValidatorException. But the user hasn't provided the definition of IRValidatorException. So, perhaps it's a custom exception class that needs to be imported. So, the code should include that.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should assume that it's defined elsewhere. So, the code would raise that exception.

Putting it all together:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']  # example

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):

        """
        if spec_content is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("spec_content is required")

        try:
            data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
        except yaml.YAMLError as e:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Invalid YAML content: {e}") from e

        missing_fields = [field for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS if field not in data]
        if missing_fields:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {missing_fields}")

        return data

But the user's function is part of a class, but the class name isn't given. So, perhaps the code should be written as a class method, but the class name is not specified. So, the code should have the class with the method, but the user might expect that the class is already defined. However, the user's instruction is to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should include the necessary imports and the class definition.

But the user's function is a class method, so the code should have the @classmethod decorator.

But the user's function signature starts with def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):, so the code should be part of a class.

So, the code would need to have the class definition. However, the user hasn't provided the class name. So, perhaps the code is part of a class named something like 'Validator' or 'SpecValidator'. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code can be written with a placeholder class name.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that's already defined, and the code is just the method. But since the user hasn't provided the class, the code should include the class.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should include the class and the method.

But the user's example code in the docstring shows the function as part of a class. So, the code should be written as a class method.

So, the final code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SpecValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']  # example

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):

        if missing_fields:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {missing_fields}")

        return data

But the user's function is called validate_from_content, and the class name isn't specified. So, perhaps the class is named something else. However, the user's code example shows the function as part of a class, so the code should include the class.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature. So, the code should have the function as a class method. But the user hasn't provided the class name, so perhaps the code can have a placeholder class name.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that's already defined, and the code is just the method. But the user's docstring includes the parameter spec_content, which is the content of the spec file. So, the code should process that.

Another thing: the function returns the data loaded from the spec file. So, after validation, it returns the data.

So, the code should be as above. But the user might have intended that the function is part of a class that has the required fields defined. So, the code should include that.

But the user hasn't provided the class name. So, perhaps the code should be written with a class name like 'Validator' or 'SpecValidator'.

But the user's function is called validate_from_content, so the class might be named something like 'SpecValidator'.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import yaml

        return data

But the user's function is supposed to be part of a class, but the class name isn't given. However, the user's example shows the function as part of a class, so the code should include the class.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should have the function as a class method, with the class name as per the user's example. However, since the user hasn't provided the class name, perhaps the code can be written with a class name like 'Validator' or 'SpecValidator'.

But the user's function is called validate_from_content, so maybe the class is named something like 'SpecValidator'.

So, the code would be as above. But the user may not have the IRValidatorException defined. So, the code includes that as a custom exception.

But the user's docstring says to raise IRValidatorException, so the code should include that.

Thus, the final code would be as written above. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So, the code should be written with the class and method, including the exception.

But the user might have a different class structure. However, based on the given info, this seems like a reasonable approach.

So, the generated code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SpecValidator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']  # example

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):

        if missing_fields:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required fields: {missing_fields}")

        return data

But the user may not want the example REQUIRED_FIELDS. So, perhaps the code should have the REQUIRED_FIELDS as a class attribute, but the actual fields would be defined in the class. However, since the user hasn't specified, the code includes an example.

But the user's function is supposed to be part of a class, so the code should have that.

So, this should be the code.
