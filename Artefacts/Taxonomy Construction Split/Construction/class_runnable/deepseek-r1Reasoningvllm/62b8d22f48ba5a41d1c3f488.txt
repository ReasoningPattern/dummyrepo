Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's a method. The docstring says it removes the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns a tuple of the key and value. 

Hmm, this sounds like it's related to a dictionary's methods. In Python, the dict class has a popitem() method. That method removes and returns a (key, value) pair. But by default, it removes the last inserted item, not the first. So to make it remove the first item, I'll need to override the popitem method in a subclass of dict.

So the function should check if self is a dictionary instance. If not, raise a TypeError. Then, it should pop the first item. Wait, how does the popitem method work? The default implementation uses an OrderedDict internally, so the first item is the one with the smallest insertion key. 

In my function, I'll use self.popitem(last=False) to ensure it pops the first item instead of the last. Then, return the key and value as a tuple. Also, I should include the docstring as provided.

Putting it all together, the function will check if self is a dict, and if so, pop the first item and return it. Otherwise, raise an error. I'll make sure the code is properly indented and follows Python syntax.
