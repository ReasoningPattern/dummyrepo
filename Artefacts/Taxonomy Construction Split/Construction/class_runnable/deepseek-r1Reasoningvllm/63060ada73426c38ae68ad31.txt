Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _convert_non_cli_args and takes three parameters: self, parser_name, and values_dict. The docstring explains that this function casts arguments to their correct types by modifying the values_dict parameter. By default, all values are strings.

First, I'll start by looking at the function signature. It's a method, so it should have 'self' as the first parameter. The second parameter is parser_name, which is a string like 'main' or 'virsh'. The third is values_dict, a dictionary of arguments.

The function's purpose is to convert non-CLI arguments. So, I'm thinking about how argparse works. Typically, when you have arguments that are not part of the CLI, they are parsed into the argument parser but might not appear when the script runs as a CLI. These are often set in the values dictionary, and their types need to be corrected.

I remember that in argparse, you can access the arguments using parser.parse_args().values. So, I can loop through each key-value pair in values_dict. For each key, if the value is a string, I need to check if it should be converted to another type, like int, float, or maybe a boolean.

Wait, how do I determine the correct type? The function uses parser_name, which might help in mapping to specific types. For example, 'main' might expect an integer, while 'virsh' could expect a string. I'll need to create a mapping from parser names to their expected types.

Let me think about possible types. Common types are int, str, float, bool. So, I'll create a dictionary that maps parser names to their corresponding types. For example, 'main' might map to int, 'network' to str, etc.

Next, I'll loop through each key in values_dict. For each key, if the value is a string, I'll check if the parser_name is in my type mapping. If it is, I'll use the corresponding type to cast the value. For example, if the parser is 'main' and the value is '123', I'll convert it to int.

I should also handle cases where the conversion might fail. Maybe using a try-except block, but that could complicate things. Alternatively, I can leave it to the caller to handle errors, as argparse does by default.

Putting it all together, the code will:

1. Define the function with the given parameters.
2. Create a type_map dictionary mapping parser names to types.
3. Loop through each key in values_dict.
4. For each key, if the value is a string and the parser_name is in type_map, cast the value to the corresponding type.
5. Return the modified values_dict.

I should make sure that the code is clean and efficient. Also, I'll need to import necessary modules like argparse, but since the function is part of a class, I'll assume argparse is already imported elsewhere.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so maybe I should use self to access any instance variables that might be needed. But in this case, the function only needs parser_name and values_dict, so it's fine as is.

I think I've covered all the bases. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
