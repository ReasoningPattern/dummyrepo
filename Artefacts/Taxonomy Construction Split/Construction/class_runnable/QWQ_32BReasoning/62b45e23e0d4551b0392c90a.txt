Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method validate_version_inventories based on the provided docstring. Let's see what the doc says. The function's purpose is to ensure each version has an inventory up to that point. Also, it should keep track of content digests that are different from those in the root inventory so they can be checked later.

Hmm, the parameters are self and version_dirs, which is an array of version directory names in sequence. So the method is part of a class. The first thing I should do is loop through each version directory. For each version, check if its inventory exists. Wait, but how are these inventories structured? The doc mentions the root inventory, so maybe each version has its own inventory file, and the root is the main one. The method probably needs to verify each version's inventory and compare content digests.

Let me think of steps. Maybe start by initializing a list to record differing content digests. Then iterate over each version in version_dirs. For each version dir, check if there's an inventory file. If not, that's a problem, so maybe raise an error or log an issue. But according to the doc, the method should ensure that each version has an inventory. So perhaps it's validating that each exists and then comparing their content digests to the root's.

Wait, the root inventory's content digests are the ones to compare against. So maybe for each version's inventory, we check if any of their content digests don't match the root's, and collect those. But how exactly? The root inventory's digests might be stored somewhere in the class. The method might need to access that. Like, perhaps the root's digests are stored in self.root_inventory or something similar.

So the steps would be:

1. Initialize a list to hold the differing content digests, maybe called differing_digests.
2. Iterate through each version directory in version_dirs in order.
3. For each version directory, get its inventory. How? Maybe the class has a method to load an inventory from a directory, like get_inventory(version_dir) or read_inventory?
4. Check if the inventory exists for that version. If not, maybe return an error or raise an exception? The doc says "SHOULD have", so perhaps it's required. So if any version's inventory is missing, the validation fails. But the function's return isn't specified. Since the user didn't mention the return type, maybe it's supposed to collect the differing digests and return them, or raise an error when an inventory is missing.
5. Compare the content digests in the version's inventory with those in the root inventory. For any digest that's different, add them to differing_digests.
6. After processing all versions, return the list of differing digests so they can be checked later.

Wait, the function's purpose includes both ensuring inventories exist and tracking differing digests. So maybe the method first checks each version's inventory exists. Then, for each inventory, it compares the content digests with the root's. The differing ones are stored. 

So the code structure would be something like:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory = self.load_inventory(version_dir)  # assuming a helper method
        if not inventory:
            raise Exception(f"Inventory missing for version {version_dir}")
        # compare inventory's digests with root's
        root_digests = self.root_inventory.digests  # maybe stored here
        version_digests = inventory.digests  # whatever the structure is
        for digest in version_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.append(digest)
    return differing_digests

But I don't know the exact structure of the inventory objects. Since the problem is to generate code based on the docstring, perhaps I need to make some assumptions. Let's think that each inventory has a 'content_digests' attribute. The root inventory's digests are stored in self.root_content_digests or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the root inventory is the first one, and each subsequent version's inventory should include all previous up to that point. Wait the first sentence says "Each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point." So maybe each version's inventory should include all the content entries from the root up to that version. But the second part about differing digests suggests that the root has some digests, and versions may have different ones. Wait the exact wording is: "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory so that we can also check them when validating the content."

Ah, so the root inventory has certain content digests. Each version's inventory might have some content digests that are different from the root's. The method needs to track those differing ones. So perhaps for each version's inventory, any content digest not present in the root's list should be added to the differing list. Or maybe it's the other way around, but the wording says "different from those in the root", so if the version's digest is not in the root's, it's added.

Wait, maybe the root inventory is the top-level one, and each version's inventory contains the content up to that version. So when validating, each version's inventory must exist, and any content in them not present in the root's inventory is recorded. Or perhaps the root's inventory is the master, and each version's inventory's content digests should be a subset of the root's, but if they have different ones, those are noted.

Alternatively, maybe the root inventory is the first version's inventory, and each subsequent version's inventory should include all the previous entries plus new ones. But the doc's first part is about each version having an inventory up to that point. So each inventory must exist and be complete up to that version. The second part is about collecting digests that differ from the root's, so that when validating content, those can be checked.

Hmm, perhaps the function is part of a system where each version directory has its own inventory file, and the root has a master inventory. The validation requires that each version's inventory exists, and then the method records any content digests in any version's inventory that are not present in the root's. These differing digests would then be checked during content validation.

So the code would:

- Check each version directory has an inventory file. If any is missing, return an error? But the doc doesn't specify raising an error. It says "SHOULD have", so maybe the function just proceeds, but the presence is assumed, given that the method is called with version_dirs in order. Or perhaps it's part of the validation, so it should check existence and maybe raise an error.

Alternatively, perhaps the method's first responsibility is to check that each version has an inventory, but the code may not need to handle the error, just log it. Since the problem says "generate code based on the function signature and docstring", maybe the code will just collect the differing digests, and the existence check is part of the process.

Wait the first requirement is "Each version SHOULD have an inventory up to that point." So the code must ensure that each version's inventory exists. So in the code, for each version_dir in version_dirs, we check if the inventory exists. How to do that? Maybe by checking a path like f"{version_dir}/inventory.txt" or something. But without knowing the exact file structure, perhaps the class has a method to get the inventory for a version, and if it's not found, an error occurs. The function could proceed by loading each inventory, and if any can't be loaded, maybe it skips but adds an error message? Or the function requires that all inventories exist, so if any is missing, it raises an exception.

The doc says "version_dirs is an array of version directory names and is assumed to be in version sequence (1, 2, 3...)." So the input is already in order, and the method can process them in sequence. 

The second part: "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory so that we can also check them when validating the content."

So the root inventory's digests are the ones to compare against. The root inventory is probably the first one, but maybe it's stored as an attribute of self. Let's assume that the root's content digests are stored in self.root_content_digests, which is a set or a list. 

So for each version's inventory, we get its content digests, then check each digest against the root's. If a digest in the version's inventory is not present in the root's, add it to the list. 

Wait, but maybe it's the other way around: the root's inventory should have all the digests from previous versions? Or perhaps the root is the main one, and any content in versions that aren't in the root are considered differing. 

Alternatively, perhaps each version's inventory may have added or modified content, so any digest that's different from the root's (i.e., not present in root's list) is noted. 

Assuming that the root's digests are stored in self.root_inventory, and each version's inventory is loaded, the code would look like this:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    root_digests = self.root_inventory.get_content_digests()  # hypothetical method
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory = self.load_inventory(version_dir)  # method to load the inventory
        if not inventory:  # or handle exceptions here
            raise ValueError(f"Missing inventory for version {version_dir}")
        current_digests = inventory.get_content_digests()  # again, a method
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.append(digest)
    return differing_digests

But since the problem doesn't specify the structure of the inventories, I need to make some assumptions. The code needs to be generic enough. Maybe the inventories are stored as dictionaries or sets. Let's think that each inventory has a content_digests attribute which is a set.

Alternatively, perhaps the root inventory is the first in the version_dirs list, so the first step is to check that the first version has its inventory. Then, for each subsequent version, their inventory must exist and include all previous content up to that point. But the first part of the doc says "each version should have an inventory up to that point". So maybe each inventory must exist, and for each, the content is cumulative? Not sure. The main point is the first part requires that each version has an inventory, so the code must check that. The second part is about tracking any digests that differ from the root's.

Alternatively, the 'inventory up to that point' could mean that the inventory for version N includes all entries from version 1 to N. But how to check that? Maybe comparing with the previous version's inventory? Or perhaps the inventory for each version is correct as per their own data. Since the problem isn't entirely clear, perhaps the first part is just ensuring that each version has an inventory file. The second part is to collect all content digests from all versions that aren't in the root's inventory. 

So the code would:

- Iterate over each version directory.
- For each, check if the inventory exists (maybe via a helper function).
- Then, collect all the digests from each inventory, and compare them to the root's.
- Any digest that is in the version's inventory but not in the root's is added to the list.

Wait, but the wording is "any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So perhaps if the digest in the version's inventory is not present in the root's, it's added to the list. 

So the code steps:

Initialize differing_digests as empty list.

Get root's content digests (maybe stored in self.root_inventory or some other way).

Loop through each version_dir in version_dirs:

   - get the inventory for this version. How? Maybe via a method like self.get_inventory(version_dir) which returns the inventory object or data structure.

   - check if inventory exists. If not, perhaps raise an error, or log a message but continue. Since the function is supposed to validate, maybe it should raise an error. But the doc says "SHOULD have", so maybe it's a warning but not a failure?

The problem states "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring", so perhaps the code should first check that each version has an inventory. If not, maybe return an error, but since the function's return isn't specified, maybe the method just proceeds, and the differing digests are collected regardless.

Alternatively, the code could check that each version has an inventory, and if any is missing, it raises an exception, but the doc says "should have", so maybe it's a best practice and not a hard requirement? Hmm, but the user probably expects the code to enforce that each has an inventory. 

Assuming that the code will check the existence. So first, for each version_dir, check if the inventory exists. Let's say the inventory is a file in the directory, so maybe:

inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory.json') or something. But without knowing the exact path, perhaps the class has a method to retrieve the inventory for a given version. Let's proceed with that.

So in code:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    root_digests = set(self.root_inventory.content_digests)  # assuming self.root_inventory has this
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory = self.get_version_inventory(version_dir)
        if not inventory:
            raise Exception(f"Inventory not found for {version_dir}")
        current_digests = inventory.content_digests  # assuming this is a list or set
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.append(digest)
    return differing_digests

Wait but the root inventory is the root, so maybe it's the first version? Or the root is separate. The wording says "root inventory", so probably the root is a separate entity, not part of the version directories. So the root's digests are stored in the class's root attribute.

Alternatively, perhaps the root is the initial version, but I think the root is the top-level one. 

Another thought: maybe the inventory for each version is supposed to include all content up to that version. So for version 1, its inventory should have the initial content. For version 2, it should have version 1's content plus new ones. But how does that relate to the root's inventory? Maybe the root's inventory is the final one, and each prior version's inventory must be a subset. Not sure, but the second part of the doc says to track digests different from root's, so the code must compare each version's digests to the root's, and collect any that are not in the root's set.

Wait, maybe the root's inventory is the main one, and each version's inventory should have entries that are all in the root's. Or perhaps the root's inventory is the first, and each subsequent version may have different digests, but we need to track all that are not in the root. 

The code needs to collect all the content digests from all version inventories that are not present in the root's inventory. So for each version's inventory, check each digest against root's, and if not found, add to the list. 

Now, the code structure:

First, get the root's content digests. Let's say self.root_inventory is an object with a content_digests attribute. 

Then loop through each version_dir in version_dirs:

   Get the inventory for that version (maybe via a method like get_inventory_for_version). 

   Check that it exists (maybe by checking if the inventory is not None, or has some content). 

   If not, raise an error. 

   Then, for each digest in that inventory's content, check if it's not in the root's digests. If so, add to the list. 

Wait but the problem says "any content digests different from those in the root inventory". So perhaps, any digest present in any version's inventory that isn't in the root's is added to the list. So even if the same digest appears in multiple versions, as long as it's not in the root, it's added once? Or each occurrence is added? The problem says "keep a record of any content digests different from those in the root inventory", so maybe just collect all such digests, even duplicates. But perhaps they should be stored as a set. 

Alternatively, the differing_digests list can have duplicates. But maybe the user wants a set. Since the problem says "record of any", perhaps a list is okay. 

The code would need to handle the existence check for each inventory. Let's assume that the method self._load_inventory(version_dir) returns the inventory data. So:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    root_digests = set(self.root_inventory.content_digests)
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory = self._load_inventory(version_dir)
        if not inventory:
            raise ValueError(f"Inventory for {version_dir} is missing")
        current_digests = inventory.content_digests
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.append(digest)
    return differing_digests

Wait, but maybe the inventory for a version is supposed to exist. So if it's missing, the method should raise an error. The first part of the doc says "SHOULD have an inventory up to that point", which implies that it's a requirement, so raising an error makes sense. 

Alternatively, if the function is part of a validation process where the presence of inventories is already checked, but the code still has to ensure that each has one. 

Alternatively, perhaps the method just proceeds, and if any inventory is missing, it skips but the function is supposed to check that each has one. So in code, maybe:

for version_dir in version_dirs:
    inventory_path = f"{version_dir}/inventory"  # or some other path
    if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
        # handle error
        raise some error here

But without knowing the exact file structure, perhaps the code uses helper methods. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the code can use some placeholder methods. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventories are stored in a dictionary, and the method checks if the key exists. 

Alternatively, the code could be written in a way that doesn't rely on external methods, but that's hard. The problem says to generate code based on the signature and docstring. Since the parameters are version_dirs, which are directory names, perhaps each directory has an inventory file. 

Assuming that each version directory has an 'inventory.json' file, then the code could do something like:

import os

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    root_digests = set(self.root_inventory.content_digests)
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory_path = os.path.join(version_dir, 'inventory.json')
        if not os.path.exists(inventory_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Inventory file not found in {version_dir}")
        # load the inventory file's content here, perhaps parse JSON
        with open(inventory_path, 'r') as f:
            inventory_data = json.load(f)
        current_digests = inventory_data.get('content_digests', [])
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.append(digest)
    return differing_digests

But this requires that the class has a root_inventory attribute, and the method has access to json. But maybe the problem expects a more abstract approach without using specific file paths. 

Alternatively, the class might have a method like get_inventory(version_dir) that returns the digests for that version's inventory. So the code would:

differing_digests = []
root_digests = self.root_inventory.get_content_digests()
for version_dir in version_dirs:
    current_inventory = self.get_inventory(version_dir)
    if not current_inventory:
        raise ValueError(f"Version {version_dir} has no inventory")
    current_digests = current_inventory.content_digests
    differing = [d for d in current_digests if d not in root_digests]
    differing_digests.extend(differing)
return differing_digests

Hmm, but in this case, the get_inventory method would need to exist in the class. Since the problem's code is to be generated without any explanation, maybe I have to make up some method names that fit. Alternatively, perhaps the code is part of a class where each version's directory has an inventory, and the method loops through them, checks existence, and compares. 

Alternatively, maybe the root's content digests are stored in self.root_digests, and each version's inventory is stored as a list or set. 

Another possibility: the root inventory is the first element in version_dirs. Wait, no. The doc says "root inventory", so it's separate. 

Assuming that the root's content is stored in self.root_inventories or self.root_content_digests, perhaps as a set for easy lookups. 

Putting it all together, here's a possible code structure:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    # Get root's content digests
    root_digests = self.root_inventory.get_content_digests()  # or some method
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        # Load current version's inventory
        current_inventory = self.get_inventory(version_dir)
        if not current_inventory:
            # Inventory missing, so this is an error
            raise ValueError(f"Version {version_dir} has no inventory")
        current_digests = current_inventory.content_digests  # assuming an attribute
        # Check each digest against root's
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.append(digest)
    return differing_digests

This makes sense. The key steps are checking each inventory exists, then collecting any digests not in the root. 

But perhaps the code should first check that each inventory exists, and if not, return an error. The function's doc says that each should have an inventory, so the code must enforce that. 

So the code must raise an exception if any version's inventory is missing. 

Now, the problem says to generate the code, so I have to write it without knowing the exact helper methods. Maybe the class has a method to retrieve the inventory for a version, which returns None if missing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses some internal data structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventories are stored as a dictionary in the class, like self.version_inventories, which maps version directories to their content digests. So in that case, the code could be:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    root_digests = set(self.root_inventory.content_digests)
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        if version_dir not in self.version_inventories:
            raise ValueError(f"Inventory for {version_dir} is missing")
        current_digests = self.version_inventories[version_dir]
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.append(digest)
    return differing_digests

But this is making up attributes and methods. Since the problem doesn't give more details, perhaps the code should be as generic as possible, using some placeholder methods. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a system where each version's inventory is a file, and the method reads them. 

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the code can be written using the most straightforward approach. 

Wait, the problem says "the root inventory", so I need to have access to that. Let's assume that self.root_inventory is an object with a content_digests attribute (like a list). 

Then, the code would loop through each version directory, get their inventory (maybe via a method self.get_version_inventory(version_dir)), check if it exists (maybe by checking if the returned inventory is not None), and then collect any digests not in the root's set. 

Putting this all together, here's the code:

def validate_version_inventories(self, version_dirs):
    differing_digests = []
    root_digests = set(self.root_inventory.content_digests)
    for version_dir in version_dirs:
        inventory = self.get_version_inventory(version_dir)
        if not inventory:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing inventory for version {version_dir}")
        current_digests = inventory.content_digests
        for digest in current_digests:
            if digest not in root_digests:
                differing_digests.append(digest)
    return differing_digests

But perhaps the get_version_inventory method is called get_inventory, and the code uses that. Also, maybe the root's content is stored in self.root_content_digests, which is a list. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should first check that each version has its own inventory (i.e., the inventory exists for that directory), and then collect any digests in any version's inventory that are not in the root's. 

Another point: the version_dirs are in sequence, so maybe the first version is 1, then 2, etc. But the code doesn't need to process their order beyond checking each in order. 

The main thing is to make sure each has an inventory, and track any digests not in the root. 

I think this is the best approach given the information. The code uses a helper method to get the inventory for a version, checks it exists, then compares each digest to the root's. 

Alternatively, maybe the root is the first version in the list, and the other versions' inventories should include all previous ones. But the doc says the root's inventory, so probably the root is separate. 

Therefore, the code I wrote earlier should be okay. Let me check again.

The function's parameters are version_dirs, an array of directories. 

The code loops through each, checks inventory exists (via get_version_inventory returning something or None?), then for each digest in current, if not in root, add to the list. 

Yes. So that's the code. The problem requires that the code be generated without any explanations, so I should just write that.
