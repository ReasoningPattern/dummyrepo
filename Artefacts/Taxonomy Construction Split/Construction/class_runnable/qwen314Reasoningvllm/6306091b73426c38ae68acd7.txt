Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_config_manager and it's a method of a class, since it takes 'cls' as the first parameter. The docstring says that it gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service(). 

So, the function is probably part of a class that has a _get_service method. The _get_service method likely takes a service name and returns the corresponding service instance. The ServiceName is an enum or a class with a member ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER.

The task is to implement the ansible_config_manager method. The docstring indicates that this method should retrieve the ansible config manager by passing ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER to cls._get_service(). 

Therefore, the code inside the function would call cls._get_service() with the appropriate service name. I need to make sure that the service name is correctly referenced. Assuming that ServiceName is a predefined class or enum, the code would be something like:

return cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER)

But I need to check if the _get_service method is supposed to be called on the class or an instance. Since the method is defined with 'cls' as the first parameter, it's a class method. However, the way it's written in the docstring, it's using cls._get_service(), which suggests that _get_service is a class method or a static method. 

Wait, in Python, if a method is called via the class, like cls._get_service(), then _get_service should be a class method or a static method. But the original code doesn't show the definition of _get_service. However, the user hasn't provided that, so I just need to implement ansible_config_manager as per the instruction.

So, the function will take 'cls' as the parameter, and then call cls._get_service() with the ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER. The return value of that call is the ansible config manager.

I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted as a Python function. The user specified not to include any explanations, just the code in Python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with the python tag.

Wait, the user said "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So they want the code in a markdown code block, using triple backticks and the python syntax highlighting.

So putting it all together, the function would be:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service(ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER)

But I need to check if ServiceName is imported or defined. However, the user hasn't mentioned that, so I assume it's already available in the context. Also, the _get_service method is expected to be present in the class, so the code will call it correctly.

I think that's all. The code is straightforward based on the docstring. No need for error handling or additional logic unless specified, which it isn't. So the generated code is as above.
