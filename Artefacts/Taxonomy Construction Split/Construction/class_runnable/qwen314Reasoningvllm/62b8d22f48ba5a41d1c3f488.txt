Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says that the method should remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and return the key and value as a tuple. 

Wait, the first inserted keyâ€”that sounds like it's related to the order of insertion. So maybe this is for a dictionary that maintains insertion order, like Python's built-in dict from version 3.7 onwards. But the problem is, the method is part of a class, and the user hasn't provided the class definition. Hmm, but the function is defined as a method with 'self' as the first parameter, so I need to assume that the class is something that has a collection of key-value pairs, possibly in order.

In Python's standard dict, popitem() removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair (as a tuple), but the docstring here specifies the first inserted key. So maybe the class is a custom implementation of an ordered dictionary. However, the user just wants the code for the popitem method, not the entire class.

But how to implement this? If the class uses a list to keep track of insertion order, then popping from the beginning of the list would get the first inserted key. But for a standard dict, you can't directly access the insertion order. Wait, maybe the class is a subclass of dict, and uses an OrderedDict-like approach. However, without knowing the underlying data structure, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects me to use the standard dict's popitem method, but that's for last inserted. But the docstring says first inserted. So maybe the class is using a different structure, like a list to track the order. Let me think. If the class has a list called 'items' that stores the key-value pairs in insertion order, then popitem would remove the first element of that list and return it as a tuple. But also, the dictionary itself would need to have the key removed. So maybe the class has both a regular dictionary and a list.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided any context about the class's attributes. So maybe this is part of a custom OrderedDict-like class. For example, in Python's collections.OrderedDict, popitem() can remove from the end or the beginning depending on the argument. But the default is to pop the last item. However, the user's docstring says to remove the first inserted key, which would be the first item in the ordered structure.

Assuming that the class has an underlying data structure that maintains insertion order, like a list of keys, and a regular dictionary for the values. Then, the popitem method would need to remove the first key from that list, get its value from the dictionary, and return the tuple. Also, the key should be removed from the dictionary.

But how to implement that. Let me think of a possible structure. Suppose the class has a 'data' dictionary and a 'keys' list. When inserting, keys are added to the end of the list. Then, popitem would take the first element of the keys list, delete it from the data dict, and return the key and value. However, in Python, the standard dict doesn't have such a list, so this is probably a custom class.

But the user hasn't given any other methods or attributes. So maybe the code is supposed to be part of a class that uses a list to track insertion order. Let me write the code accordingly.

So the method would look like this:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self.keys:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = self.keys[0]
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    self.keys.pop(0)
    return (key, value)

But wait, the class would need to have 'data' and 'keys' as attributes. However, the user hasn't provided that. But since the function is part of the class, perhaps those attributes are already present. The user's instruction is to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to create the entire class. So maybe the code is part of a class that already has these attributes.

Alternatively, if the class is a subclass of dict, but that's not possible because dict doesn't have a 'keys' list. So perhaps the user expects that the class is using a different approach, like a linked list or something else. But without more info, the simplest approach is to assume that the class maintains a list of keys in insertion order and a dictionary for the data.

Another possibility is that the user is referring to the standard dict's popitem, but that's not the case. The standard dict's popitem removes the last inserted item. So if the user wants the first inserted, maybe they are using an OrderedDict and want to pop from the front. However, in Python's OrderedDict, popitem(last=False) would pop the first item. But the function signature here is def popitem(self), without any parameters. So perhaps the user is creating a custom class where popitem always removes the first inserted item.

In that case, the code would need to access the first key in the insertion order, remove it from the internal structure, and return the tuple. So assuming that the class has a list called 'insertion_order' that keeps track of the keys in the order they were inserted, then:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self.insertion_order:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = self.insertion_order.pop(0)
    value = self.data.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But again, this depends on the class having 'insertion_order' and 'data' as attributes. However, since the user hasn't provided that, maybe I need to use the standard dict's methods. But that's not possible because the standard dict doesn't track insertion order. Wait, but in Python 3.7+, regular dicts do preserve insertion order, but there's no direct way to get the first inserted key. So perhaps the user is referring to a custom class that uses a regular dict and maintains a list of keys in insertion order.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the code to use the built-in dict's popitem, but that's not possible. So I think the correct approach here is to write code that assumes the class has an ordered structure, like a list of keys, and a dictionary for the values. Therefore, the code would pop the first key from the list, delete it from the dict, and return the tuple.

But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I can't be sure. However, the function is supposed to be part of a class, so the code would need to access those attributes. Therefore, the generated code would be as I thought earlier, using self.keys and self.data. But maybe the class uses a different attribute name. However, without more info, that's the best assumption.

Another thought: maybe the class is a subclass of dict, and the user is expecting to use the __dict__ or some other internal structure. But that's not standard. So perhaps the user is working with a custom class, and the popitem method is supposed to remove the first key inserted. Therefore, the code would need to have access to the insertion order.

So the code would be something like:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self._items:
        raise KeyError('Dictionary is empty')
    key, value = self._items[0]
    del self.data[key]
    self._items.pop(0)
    return key, value

But again, without knowing the actual attributes, it's hard. However, the user might be expecting that the code uses the standard OrderedDict's approach. But since the function is named popitem and the docstring says first inserted, perhaps the code is intended to be for an OrderedDict-like class where popitem removes the first item.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a class that uses a list to track the order, and the code is supposed to use that. Since the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, and not to include any explanation, I need to make a reasonable assumption.

In the absence of more context, I think the most straightforward way is to use a list to track the insertion order. So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self._insertion_order:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = self._insertion_order.pop(0)
    value = self._data.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But again, the attributes _insertion_order and _data are not defined in the given code. However, since the user hasn't provided the class definition, perhaps they expect that the code is part of a class that already has these attributes. Therefore, the code would be as above.

Alternatively, if the class is using a regular dict and a list, maybe the code is:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self.keys_list:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = self.keys_list[0]
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    self.keys_list.pop(0)
    return (key, value)

But the exact attribute names are not specified. However, the user's function is part of a class, and the code would need to access those attributes. Since the user hasn't provided any other context, I'll proceed with the assumption that the class has a list called 'keys' that maintains the insertion order and a dictionary called 'data' that holds the values. Therefore, the code would be as follows.
