Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the pop method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

The function is called pop and takes a self parameter, which is typical for methods in classes. The parameters are key and default, with default set to __marker. The docstring says that it returns the value associated with the key, removes it from the dictionary, and if the key isn't found, returns the default if provided, otherwise raises a KeyError.

First, I need to implement the pop method. In Python, dictionaries have a pop method, but since this is a method in a class, I'll need to simulate that. However, the user hasn't provided a class structure, so I'll assume that the class has a dictionary attribute, maybe called 'data' or something similar.

Wait, the problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So the code should be a method within a class. But since the user hasn't provided the class, I'll have to write the method as a standalone function? Wait, no, the function is part of a class. But the user's instruction says to generate the code, not to write the class. So perhaps the code is a method inside a class, but since the user hasn't provided the class, I'll have to write the method as a standalone function? Wait, no, the function is part of a class. But the user's example shows the function signature with self, so the code should be a method.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code, not to write the class. So perhaps the code is the method itself. So the code will be a method that takes self, key, and default.

So, the code will look like:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """
    D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
    If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
    """
    # Implementation here

But how to implement it? The standard way is to check if the key is in the dictionary. If it is, return the value and delete the key. If not, return default if provided, else raise KeyError.

So, in Python, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    if key in self.data:
        val = self.data.pop(key)
        return val
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

Wait, but the default is set to __marker by default. So the code would check if the key is present. If yes, pop it and return. If not, check if default is not __marker, then return default, else raise KeyError.

But in Python, the __marker is a special value, often used as a default. So the code should handle that.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def pop(self, key, default=__marker):
    """
    D.pop(k[,d]) -> v, remove specified key and return the corresponding value.
    If key is not found, d is returned if given, otherwise KeyError is raised.
    """
    if key in self.data:
        val = self.data.pop(key)
        return val
    else:
        if default is not __marker:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError()

But wait, the user's docstring has the default as __marker, but in the function definition, the default is set to __marker. So the code should use the default parameter as given.

But in Python, when you pass default=__marker, the function's default is __marker. So the code is correct.

So the code should be as above. But the user wants the code in Python markdown format, which is just the code. So the answer is the code as written.
