Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called ansible_config_manager and it's a class method. The docstring says it gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service().

Hmm, first, I need to figure out how to implement this. The function is a class method, so it should be defined as def ansible_config_manager(cls):. The docstring mentions using ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER, which I assume is a constant or a class variable. But the problem is, the code isn't provided. So I need to create a placeholder for that.

Wait, the user probably expects that the actual implementation would involve getting the service via _get_service(), which might be a method of the class. So the function would call cls._get_service() to get the service instance, then access the ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER attribute of that service.

But how to structure this in code. Let me think. The function is supposed to return the manager. So maybe the code would be something like:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    service = cls._get_service()
    return service.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER

But I need to make sure that _get_service() is a method of the class. Since the function is a class method, it's defined with cls as the first parameter. So the code would be as above.

Wait, but the docstring says "Gets the ansible config manager via ServiceName.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER in cls._get_service()". So the function is using the _get_service() method to get the service, and then accessing the ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER attribute of that service.

So the code would be:

def ansible_config_manager(cls):
    service = cls._get_service()
    return service.ANSIBLE_CONFIG_MANAGER

But I need to make sure that the ServiceName is properly referenced. Maybe ServiceName is a class or a module, but since it's not provided, the code would just use the attribute directly.

So the final code would be the function as described. The user wants the code output, so I just need to write that function.
