Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function deep_merge_nodes that merges any node values corresponding to duplicate keys. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. Hmm, first, I should figure out what kind of data structure we're dealing with here. The term "node" makes me think of something like a dictionary or a nested structure. But the mention of MappingNode suggests that maybe it's related to a specific library, perhaps something like PyYAML's nodes? Or maybe it's a custom structure.

Wait, the user didn't mention any specific library, so maybe they just mean dictionaries. But the docstring refers to MappingNode, which is a term I've seen in PyYAML. Let me think. If the nodes are dictionaries, then merging them would involve combining their key-value pairs. But the function is called deep_merge_nodes, so it's probably handling nested structures.

So the task is to merge a list of nodes (which are dictionaries or similar structures) recursively. For each key, if it's present in multiple nodes, we need to merge their values. If the values are not MappingNode (like lists or primitives), then the last one in the list should take precedence.

Let me outline the steps. The function should process each node in the list. For each key in the nodes, if the key exists in multiple nodes, we need to merge their values. But how to handle merging? For example, if two nodes have the same key, and their values are both dictionaries, we need to merge them recursively. If one is a dictionary and the other is a list, maybe we need to combine them? Or perhaps the function is designed to merge only when the values are also MappingNodes. Wait, the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys" and for non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So maybe the merging is done recursively only for MappingNode types, and for other types, just take the last occurrence.

So the approach would be to iterate through each node in the list, and for each key-value pair, if the key already exists in the result, check if both existing and new value are MappingNodes. If they are, recursively merge them. Otherwise, keep the last value.

But how to represent the nodes? Let's assume that nodes are a list of dictionaries. Wait, but the term MappingNode might imply that they are nodes from a YAML parser. However, since the user hasn't specified, maybe they just mean dictionaries. Let me proceed with dictionaries.

So the function deep_merge_nodes takes a list of nodes (dictionaries) and merges them. Let's think of an example. Suppose nodes is [ {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2}}, {'a': 3, 'b': {'d': 4}} ]. The merged result should be {'a': 3, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 4}}.

Another example: if two nodes have the same key with non-dict values, like [ {'a': 1}, {'a': 2} ], then the result is {'a': 2}.

So the function needs to handle nested dictionaries. The merging should be done recursively. The key is to process each node, and for each key, check if it's already present in the merged dictionary. If it is, then check if both existing and new value are dictionaries. If so, merge them recursively. Otherwise, keep the last value.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that it's merging all the nodes in the list. So perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of nodes (each being a dictionary or a MappingNode) and merge them into a single dictionary, with nested merges.

So here's a plan:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary as the result.
2. Iterate over each node in the nodes list.
3. For each node, iterate over its key-value pairs.
4. For each key, check if it's already in the result.
5. If it is, and both the existing value and the new value are MappingNodes (dictionaries), then recursively merge them.
6. Otherwise, keep the last value encountered for that key.

But how to check if a value is a MappingNode? If we're assuming that nodes are dictionaries, then perhaps we can check if the value is a dict. However, if the nodes are from PyYAML, then MappingNode is a specific class. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe they just mean dictionaries. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So the code would need to handle nested dictionaries. Let's think about implementing a helper function for merging two dictionaries recursively.

Wait, but the function is supposed to merge multiple nodes. So perhaps the function is supposed to merge all nodes in the list, combining their keys. So the main function would loop through each node and merge them into a single dictionary.

Let me think of the code structure. The function deep_merge_nodes takes a list of nodes. Let's assume each node is a dictionary. So the code would start with initializing a result dictionary. Then for each node in the list, we process its items. For each key in the node, we check if it's in the result. If it is, then we need to merge the existing value with the new value. Otherwise, we add the key-value pair to the result.

But how to handle the merging? Let's create a helper function that merges two dictionaries recursively. For example, if both values are dicts, merge them. Otherwise, take the last one.

So here's a possible approach:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    # If not both dicts, take the last one
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but this code would process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, check if it's in the result. However, if the nodes are not dictionaries, but perhaps other structures, this might not work. But given the docstring, perhaps the nodes are dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge them.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the parameter is nodes. Maybe nodes is a list of dictionaries, and the function merges them all. But the helper function would need to handle merging two dictionaries. However, the code above would recursively call deep_merge_nodes with a list containing two dictionaries. But that's not correct because deep_merge_nodes is supposed to merge multiple nodes, not just two. Wait, no. If we have two dictionaries, merging them would be done by the helper function. But in the code above, when merging two dicts, it's passing them as a list to deep_merge_nodes, which would then process each node in the list. So for example, if the existing value is a dict and the new value is a dict, then the code would merge them by calling deep_merge_nodes on a list containing those two dicts. But that's not efficient, and perhaps the helper function should be a separate function.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge all nodes into one, and for each key, if there are multiple entries, merge their values. So perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of nodes (each being a dict) and merge them into a single dict, with nested merging.

Wait, but the code above would process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, check if it's already in the result. If it is, then check if both are dicts. If so, merge them. But merging them would require combining the two dicts. However, the code as written would call deep_merge_nodes on a list with two dicts, which would then process each of those two dicts as nodes. But that's not correct because the function is supposed to merge all nodes in the input list, not just two. So maybe the helper function should be a function that merges two dictionaries, not multiple.

Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to merge all nodes in the list, and for each key, the last occurrence in the list takes precedence. But when merging, if the values are dicts, then merge them recursively.

So perhaps the code should be structured as follows:

- The main function takes a list of nodes (dictionaries).
- Initialize a result dictionary.
- For each node in the list, iterate through its items.
- For each key, if it's already in the result, check if both the existing value and the new value are dictionaries. If so, merge them recursively. Otherwise, keep the last value.

But how to handle the merging of multiple nodes. For example, if three nodes have the same key, each with different values. The code would process the first node, add the key. Then the second node's key would trigger a merge if the existing value is a dict. Then the third node's key would again check against the merged value. So the code would process each node in order, and for each key, if the existing value is a dict, merge with the new value. But this approach might not handle all cases correctly. For example, if the first node has a key with a dict, the second node has the same key with a dict, and the third node has the same key with a non-dict. Then the third node's value would overwrite the merged result of the first two.

Wait, but the docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So for example, if two nodes have the same key, and one's value is a dict and the other's is a list, then the list would take precedence. But if both are dicts, then they are merged.

So the code should process each node in order, and for each key, if it's already in the result, check if both the existing value and the new value are dicts. If so, merge them. Otherwise, take the new value.

But how to implement this. Let me think of the helper function. Maybe the main function is supposed to merge all nodes, and for each key, the last occurrence in the list is kept, but when merging, if the values are dicts, they are merged recursively.

Wait, but the code I wrote earlier would do that. Let me test with an example.

Suppose nodes = [ {'a': 1}, {'a': 2} ].

The first node is processed, adding 'a':1. Then the second node's 'a' is processed. Since 'a' is already in the result, check if both are dicts. The existing value is 1 (not a dict), so the new value (2) is kept. So the result is {'a':2}.

Another example: nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}} ].

Processing first node: 'a' is added with {'b':1}. Then processing the second node's 'a' key. The existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So we call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1}, {'c':2} ]? Wait no, the code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing the existing value (which is a dict) and the new value (another dict). Wait, no. Let me see:

In the code above, when merging, for the key 'a', existing value is a dict, and new value is a dict. So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list with those two dicts. But deep_merge_nodes is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. So that would merge the two dicts, resulting in {'b':1, 'c':2}.

But then, the code would have merged the two dicts, which is correct. However, the code would then recursively call deep_merge_nodes on each of those nodes. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The code as written would take each node in the list, and for each key in that node, check if it's in the result. So if the first node is {'a': {'b': 1}}, then the result starts as {'a': {'b': 1}}. Then the second node is {'a': {'c': 2}}. For key 'a', existing value is a dict, and new value is a dict. So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [result['a'], value], which is [{'b':1}, {'c':2}]. Wait, no. The code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing the existing value (which is a dict) and the new value (another dict). But the function deep_merge_nodes is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. So in this case, the code would merge those two dicts, and assign the result back to result['a'].

But wait, the code for the key 'a' would do:

if key in result:
    if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
        result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
    else:
        result[key] = value

But the function deep_merge_nodes is called with a list of nodes. So in this case, the existing value is a dict (from the first node), and the new value is a dict (from the second node). So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing those two dicts. But deep_merge_nodes is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. So that would merge them, leading to a merged dict. But then, the code would be merging the existing value (which is a dict) with the new value (another dict), but the existing value was already part of the result. So this approach might not be correct.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list, and for each key in the nodes, if there are multiple entries, merge their values. So perhaps the function is designed to take a list of nodes (each being a dictionary) and merge them into one. So the code should process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, if it's already in the result, merge the existing value with the new value. But how to handle merging multiple nodes.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list, and for each key, the last occurrence in the list takes precedence, but when merging, if the values are dicts, they are merged recursively. So the code would need to process all nodes, and for each key, if the existing value is a dict, then merge with the new value. But the merging process should be such that if the existing value is a dict and the new value is a dict, they are merged. If the existing value is not a dict, then the new value replaces it.

So perhaps the code should be structured as follows:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                # Check if both are dicts
                if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    # Merge them recursively
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    # Take the last value
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but this code would recursively call deep_merge_nodes on a list of two nodes (the existing value and the new value). But the existing value is a dict, which is a node. So perhaps the function is designed to merge all nodes in the list, and for each key, the last occurrence is kept, but when merging, if the values are dicts, they are merged. However, this approach may not handle multiple nodes correctly. For example, if there are three nodes with the same key, each with a dict value. The code would process the first node, add the key. Then the second node's key would trigger a merge between the first and second. Then the third node's key would trigger a merge between the merged result and the third node's value. But that's not correct because the third node's value would be merged into the existing merged value, which is the result of merging the first two. But in this case, the code would handle it.

But perhaps this is not the correct approach. Because the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the parameter is nodes, which is a list. So maybe the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list, and for each key, if there are multiple entries, merge their values. But the way the code is structured, it's processing each node in the list, and for each key in the node, merging with the existing value in the result. However, this approach may not be correct because when you have multiple nodes, each with the same key, you need to merge all of them, not just the last two.

Wait, for example, if there are three nodes: node1 has key 'a' with value {'b': 1}, node2 has key 'a' with value {'c': 2}, node3 has key 'a' with value {'d': 3}. The code would process node1, adding 'a' to result. Then node2's 'a' would trigger a merge between the existing value (node1's dict) and node2's dict. The merged result would be {'b':1, 'c':2}. Then node3's 'a' would trigger a merge between that merged dict and node3's dict, resulting in {'b':1, 'c':2, 'd':3}.

But that's correct. Because the last occurrence in the list would be node3, but during merging, each time a key is found, it's merged with the existing value. However, this approach would only merge the existing value with the current node's value, not all previous ones. Wait, no. Because when you process node2, you merge it with the existing value (from node1). Then when processing node3, you merge it with the existing value (which is the merged result of node1 and node2). So that would effectively merge all three nodes. Because each time a key is encountered, it's merged with the current existing value. So the order of processing the nodes matters. The last node's value for a key would overwrite any previous merges if it's not a dict. But if it's a dict, it would be merged into the existing value.

But this approach may not be correct. Because if you have multiple nodes with the same key, each with their own dict, the code would merge them sequentially. For example, node1 has {'a': {'b': 1}}, node2 has {'a': {'c': 2}}, node3 has {'a': {'d': 3}}. The code would first process node1, adding 'a' with {'b':1}. Then node2's 'a' would merge with that, resulting in {'b':1, 'c':2}. Then node3's 'a' would merge with that, resulting in {'b':1, 'c':2, 'd':3}.

But what if the nodes are in a different order? For example, node1 has {'a': {'b': 1}}, node2 has {'a': {'b': 2}}, node3 has {'a': {'c': 3}}. Then processing node1 adds 'a' as {'b':1}. Then node2's 'a' would merge with that, leading to {'b':2} (since both are dicts, and the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1}, {'b':2} ]? Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the existing value is {'b':1} (a dict), and the new value is {'b':2} (another dict). So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1}, {'b':2} ]? Wait, no. Because the code is processing the current node (node2) and its key is 'a', so for key 'a', the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [result['a'], value], which is [{'b':1}, {'b':2}]. But wait, the function deep_merge_nodes is supposed to take a list of nodes. So in this case, the nodes list would be [ {'b':1}, {'b':2} ]? Or is the function supposed to merge the existing value (which is a dict) with the new value (another dict)?

Wait, perhaps the function is designed to merge all the nodes in the input list, and for each key in the nodes, if there are multiple entries, merge their values. So the code should process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, check if it's present in the result. If it is, then merge the existing value with the new value. But how to merge them? If the existing value is a dict, then merge it with the new value (which is also a dict) recursively. Otherwise, take the new value.

But the code as written would do that. Let me think again. For example, in the case where the existing value is a dict and the new value is a dict, the code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing those two dicts. But that would process each of those dicts as nodes, which may not be correct. Because the function is supposed to merge all nodes in the input list. So if the existing value is a dict, then it's part of the merged structure, and the new value is another dict. So the code would need to merge these two dicts. But how? Because the function deep_merge_nodes is called with a list of nodes, which in this case is [existing_dict, new_dict]. So the function would process those two dicts as nodes, but each dict is a node. So for each key in those dicts, they would be merged. However, this approach may not work because the existing_dict and new_dict are not lists of nodes, but individual nodes. So perhaps the function is not designed to take a list of nodes, but rather to merge multiple dictionaries. Maybe the function is supposed to take a list of dictionaries and merge them all.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list, and for each key, if there are multiple entries, merge their values. So the code should process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, if it's already in the result, then merge the existing value with the new value. But how to do that.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list, and for each key, the last occurrence in the list is kept, but if the values are dicts, they are merged recursively. So the code would need to process all nodes in order, and for each key, if it's already in the result, check if the existing value is a dict. If it is, then merge it with the new value. But merging two dicts would require a helper function.

Alternatively, maybe the code should be written as a recursive function that merges two dictionaries. Let me think. Suppose the function is called with a list of nodes, and for each key in the nodes, we merge all the values. But perhaps the function is supposed to merge all the nodes into one, with the last value taking precedence for non-dict values.

So perhaps the code should be written as follows:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but in this case, when merging two dicts, the code is passing them as a list to deep_merge_nodes. So for example, if the existing value is a dict and the new value is a dict, then the code would merge them by calling deep_merge_nodes on a list containing those two dicts. But deep_merge_nodes is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. So this would merge them, but the way the code is structured, it's merging the existing value (which is a dict) with the new value (another dict). But the existing value is already part of the result. So this approach would recursively merge the existing value with the new value, but the existing value is a dict that may have other keys. However, this code would process the existing value as a node, and the new value as another node. But that's not correct. Because the existing value is already part of the merged result. So merging it again with the new value may not be the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function should be a helper that merges two dictionaries, and the main function uses that helper. Let me think. For example, the main function would iterate through each node in the list, and for each key, if it's already present, merge the existing value with the new value using the helper. Otherwise, add it.

But then, how to handle multiple nodes. For example, if there are three nodes with the same key, each with a dict. The helper function would merge the first two, then merge the result with the third. But the code would have to process each node in sequence.

So perhaps the main function is not the right approach. Maybe the function should take a list of nodes and merge them all, but the merging is done by combining all the nodes into one. So the code would need to process each node in the list, and for each key, if it's present in the result, check if both are dicts. If so, merge them. Otherwise, take the last one.

But how to implement this. Let me think of the code again. Suppose nodes is a list of dictionaries. The function deep_merge_nodes is supposed to merge them. So the code would start with an empty result. Then for each node in the list, iterate through its items. For each key, if it's already in the result, check if both the existing value and the new value are dicts. If yes, then merge them. Otherwise, replace with the new value. But merging them would require a recursive approach.

Wait, but the code above would do that. For example, when merging two dicts, it calls deep_merge_nodes on a list containing those two dicts. But that's not correct because the function is supposed to merge all nodes in the input list. So if the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict, then the code would merge those two dicts, but the existing value is already part of the result. So this approach would merge the existing value (which is a dict) with the new value (another dict), but the existing value is part of the result. So perhaps this is a way to do it.

But let me test with an example. Suppose nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}} ].

The first node is processed, adding 'a' with {'b':1}. Then the second node's 'a' is processed. The existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So the code calls deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1}, {'c':2} ].

Wait, no. The existing value is result['a'] which is {'b':1}, and the new value is {'c':2}. So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1}, {'c':2} ]? No, because the code is passing [result[key], value], which is [{'b':1}, {'c':2}]. But the function deep_merge_nodes is supposed to take a list of nodes. So in this case, the function would process each node in the list, which are the two dicts. So for each of those dicts, their keys would be processed. But that's not correct. Because the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. The code would merge them into a single dict. But the way the code is written, when you call deep_merge_nodes on [{'b':1}, {'c':2}], it would process each of those dicts as nodes. So the first dict would add 'b':1, then the second dict would add 'c':2. So the merged result would be {'b':1, 'c':2}.

But then, the code would set result['a'] to that merged dict. So the final result would be {'a': {'b':1, 'c':2}}. Which is correct. So this approach works.

Another example: nodes = [ {'a': 1}, {'a': 2} ].

The first node adds 'a':1. The second node's 'a' is processed. Since existing value is not a dict, the new value is kept. So result is {'a':2}.

Another example: nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2}, 'c': 3} ].

Processing first node: 'a' is added with {'b':1}. Then processing second node's 'a' key. Existing value is a dict, new value is a dict. So call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1}, {'b':2, 'c':3} ].

Wait, no. The existing value is {'b':1}, and the new value is {'b':2, 'c':3}. So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1}, {'b':2, 'c':3} ].

Processing that list: the first node is {'b':1}, which adds 'b':1. Then the second node is {'b':2, 'c':3}. For key 'b', existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replace with 2. Then add 'c':3. So the merged dict would be {'b':2, 'c':3}. So result['a'] is set to this, leading to {'a': {'b':2, 'c':3}}.

Which is correct. Because the second node's 'a' key has a dict, and the existing value is a dict. So merging them would combine their keys. But in this case, the second node's 'a' value is a dict that has 'b' and 'c'. So the merged result would have 'b' from the second node, and 'c' added.

But what if there are multiple nodes with the same key and their values are dicts. For example, nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}, {'a': {'d': 3}} ].

The code would process the first node, adding 'a' as {'b':1}. Then the second node's 'a' would trigger a merge between {'b':1} and {'c':2}, resulting in {'b':1, 'c':2}. Then the third node's 'a' would trigger a merge between {'b':1, 'c':2} and {'d':3}, resulting in {'b':1, 'c':2, 'd':3}. So the final result would be {'a': {'b':1, 'c':2, 'd':3}}.

Yes, that seems correct.

But wait, the code as written would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing the existing value and the new value. So for each key, if there's a collision, it merges the existing value (which is a dict) with the new value (another dict). But the existing value may have been merged from previous nodes. So this approach seems to work.

But what about if the existing value is a dict and the new value is not? Like nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': 2} ].

The first node adds 'a' as {'b':1}. The second node's 'a' is processed. Existing value is a dict, new value is 2. Since the new value is not a dict, the code would replace the existing value with 2. So the final result is {'a': 2}.

Which is correct according to the docstring.

So the code seems to handle that.

But what about if the existing value is a dict and the new value is a list? Like nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': [2,3]} ].

The code would replace the existing value with the list, since it's not a dict. So the result is {'a': [2,3]}.

But perhaps the user expects that if the existing value is a dict and the new value is a list, they should be combined. But the docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So perhaps the function is designed to only merge if both values are MappingNodes (dicts). Otherwise, take the last one.

So the code as written would handle that.

But then, how to handle cases where the existing value is a dict and the new value is a dict. For example, nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2, 'c': 3}} ].

The code would merge the two dicts, resulting in {'b':2, 'c':3}.

But the existing value is {'b':1}, and the new value is {'b':2, 'c':3}. So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1}, {'b':2, 'c':3} ].

Processing that list: the first node is {'b':1}, adding 'b' as 1. Then the second node's 'b' is processed. Existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replace with 2. Then add 'c' as 3. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'c':3}.

Which is correct. So the code seems to handle that.

But wait, the code is supposed to merge all nodes. So if there are multiple nodes with the same key, each time it's processed, it merges with the existing value. So the code would handle that.

But what if the nodes are not dictionaries? The docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So perhaps the nodes are objects that have keys and values, and the function is supposed to handle them recursively. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the user's docstring mentions MappingNode, which is a term from PyYAML. So maybe the nodes are PyYAML MappingNode objects. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should be written assuming that the nodes are dictionaries, and that the function is supposed to merge them recursively.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list, and for each key, if the values are MappingNodes, they are merged, else the last one is kept.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should be written assuming that nodes are dictionaries, and the function merges them recursively.

So the code I wrote earlier would work for that.

But let me think about the base case. If a node is not a dict, then it's just added. But the function is supposed to merge nodes. So perhaps the function is designed to take a list of nodes (each being a dict or a MappingNode) and merge them.

But in the absence of specific information, I think the code should be written assuming that nodes are dictionaries. So the code above would work.

But the function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the parameter is nodes. So maybe the function is supposed to merge all the nodes in the list, and for each key, if there are multiple entries, merge their values. So the code is as follows:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but this code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing two dicts. But the function is supposed to merge all nodes in the input list. So if the input list has multiple nodes, this approach would process each node in order, merging their keys into the result. However, when merging two dicts, the code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list with those two dicts. But that's not correct because the function is supposed to merge all nodes in the input list, not just two. However, in this case, the code would recursively merge the existing value (which is a dict) with the new value (another dict), which would merge them into one dict. So for example, if the input list has three dicts, the code would process the first, then the second would merge with the first, then the third would merge with the result of the first two. So the code would effectively merge all nodes in the list.

But this approach may not be correct. Because when you call deep_merge_nodes on a list of two dicts, it would merge them, but the way the code is structured, it would process each dict in the list as a node. So for example, if you have nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}], then the first node adds 'a':1. The second node's 'a' is processed. Since the existing value is not a dict, it's replaced with 2. So the result is {'a':2}.

If nodes is [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2, 'c': 3}}], then the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [{'b':1}, {'b':2, 'c':3}]. Processing the first dict adds 'b':1. Then the second dict's 'b' is processed. Since existing value is 1 (not a dict), it's replaced with 2. Then 'c' is added. So the merged value for 'a' is {'b':2, 'c':3}.

But what if the existing value is a dict and the new value is a dict, but they have overlapping keys. For example, nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 4}}, {'a': {'b': 2, 'd': 5}}]. The code would call deep_merge_nodes on [{'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5}]. Processing the first dict adds 'b':1 and 'c':4. Then the second dict's 'b' is processed. Existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged 'a' value is {'b':2, 'c':4, 'd':5}?

Wait, no. Because the code is merging the existing value (which is a dict) with the new value (another dict). So in this case, the existing value is {'b':1, 'c':4}, and the new value is {'b':2, 'd':5}. So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5} ].

Processing the first node (the dict {'b':1, 'c':4} ), adding 'b' and 'c' to the result. Then processing the second node (the dict {'b':2, 'd':5} ), for key 'b', existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'd':5}.

But that's not correct. Because the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So the code should merge them, but in this case, the code is merging the two dicts, but the way it's structured, it's processing each dict as a node. So the first dict is processed, adding 'b' and 'c'. Then the second dict is processed, and for each key in the second dict, it checks if they are in the result. For 'b', it's already there, and the existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged result for the 'a' key is {'b':2, 'd':5}?

But that's not the intended behavior. Because the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So they should be merged. But according to the code, when merging the two dicts, it would process each key in the second dict. For example, the first dict is {'b':1, 'c':4}, and the second dict is {'b':2, 'd':5}. The code would process each key in the second dict. For 'b', existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict would be {'b':2, 'd':5}.

But this is incorrect. Because the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So they should be merged. However, in the code, when merging two dicts, the code is passing them as a list to deep_merge_nodes, which then processes each dict as a node. So the first dict in the list would be processed, adding its keys. Then the second dict would be processed, and for each key, if it's in the result, check if it's a dict. But in this case, the first dict is {'b':1, 'c':4}, and the second is {'b':2, 'd':5}. When we call deep_merge_nodes on this list, the result would be {'b':2, 'd':5}?

No, wait. Let's walk through the code for the case where the nodes list is [{'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 4}}, {'a': {'b': 2, 'd': 5}}].

The main function starts with result = {}.

First node is {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 4}}. So for key 'a', it's not in the result, so added as {'b': 1, 'c':4}.

Second node is {'a': {'b': 2, 'd':5}}. For key 'a', it's in the result. The existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So the code calls deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5} ].

Now, processing that list:

result starts as empty.

First node is {'b':1, 'c':4}.

Processing 'b' and 'c' keys. They are added to the result.

Then the second node is {'b':2, 'd':5}.

For 'b', existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2.

For 'd', added as 5.

So the merged result is {'b':2, 'c':4, 'd':5}?

Wait no. Because the code is processing the nodes list [ {'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5} ].

Wait, no. The code for deep_merge_nodes is called with [ {'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5} ] as the nodes parameter. So the function would iterate through each node in this list. The first node is {'b':1, 'c':4}.

For each key in this node, 'b' and 'c' are added to the result. Then the second node is {'b':2, 'd':5}. For 'b', existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2. For 'd', added as 5. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'd':5}.

But the original intention was to merge the two dicts. So the code is not doing that. It seems like the code is not merging the two dicts properly. Because when you call deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5} ], the function would process each node in the list. The first node adds 'b':1 and 'c':4. The second node's 'b' key would replace the existing value (1) with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'd':5}.

But that's not the same as merging the two dicts. Because the original dicts were {'b':1, 'c':4} and {'b':2, 'd':5}. Merging them should result in {'b':2, 'c':4, 'd':5}.

So the code is not merging them correctly. Because when the code calls deep_merge_nodes on [ {'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5} ], it would process the first node, adding 'b' and 'c'. Then the second node's 'b' would replace the existing 'b' value (since it's not a dict). So the code is not merging the two dicts properly. The problem is that when you have two dicts, you need to merge their keys, but the code is not doing that. Instead, it's treating each dict as a node and processing their keys, but if the keys are already present, it's replacing them.

Ah, I see the mistake. The code is not merging the two dicts. It's processing each dict as a node, and for each key in the dict, if it's already in the result, it replaces it. So in the example where the nodes list is [{'a': {'b': 1, 'c':4}}, {'a': {'b': 2, 'd':5}}], the code would first process the first node, adding 'a' with {'b':1, 'c':4}. Then the second node's 'a' key would trigger a merge between {'b':1, 'c':4} and {'b':2, 'd':5}. But according to the code, it would call deep_merge_nodes on those two dicts. However, when you call deep_merge_nodes on those two dicts, it would process each key in the first dict (b and c) and then the second dict's keys (b and d). For key 'b', existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict for 'a' would be {'b':2, 'd':5}.

But that's not correct. The correct merged dict should have 'b' from the second dict, and 'c' from the first dict, and 'd' from the second dict. So the code is not merging the two dicts properly. It's replacing the existing value for 'b' with the new one, but not merging the other keys.

So the code is incorrect. Because when merging two dicts, the code is not combining their keys. Instead, it's processing each dict as a node, and for each key in the second dict, it's replacing existing keys.

Wait, no. Because the code is merging the existing value (which is a dict) with the new value (which is a dict). So the code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing those two dicts. But deep_merge_nodes is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. So in this case, the list has two dicts. The code would process the first dict, adding its keys. Then the second dict's keys would be processed. So for example, if the first dict is {'b':1, 'c':4} and the second is {'b':2, 'd':5}, then the code would process the first dict, adding 'b' and 'c'. Then process the second dict, and for 'b', existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict would be {'b':2, 'd':5}.

But that's not correct. Because the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So they should be merged. But the code is not doing that. The code is treating the existing value as a node, and the new value as another node. But when merging two dicts, the code is not combining them, but instead processing each as a separate node, leading to replacement of existing keys.

So the approach is wrong. The problem is that when merging two dicts, the code should combine their keys, not process them as separate nodes.

So perhaps the code should not call deep_merge_nodes on the existing value and the new value, but instead merge them in a different way.

Let me think again. The function deep_merge_nodes is supposed to merge all the nodes in the input list. So for each key in the nodes, if there are multiple entries, merge their values. So the code should process all nodes in the list, and for each key, if there are multiple entries, merge their values. But how to do that.

Maybe the code should be written as a helper function that merges two dictionaries, and then the main function uses this helper to merge all nodes in sequence.

So here's an alternative approach:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        result = merge_dicts(result, node)
    return result

def merge_dicts(d1, d2):
    for key, value in d2.items():
        if key in d1:
            if isinstance(d1[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                d1[key] = merge_dicts(d1[key], value)
            else:
                d1[key] = value
        else:
            d1[key] = value
    return d1

But this approach would merge d1 and d2, where d1 is the existing result and d2 is the current node. So for each key in d2, if it's in d1, then check if both are dicts. If so, merge recursively. Otherwise, take the value from d2. This way, all nodes are merged sequentially.

But in this case, the main function would merge all nodes in the list, starting with the first node as the initial result, then merging each subsequent node into the result.

This approach would handle the example where nodes are [{'a': {'b': 1, 'c':4}}, {'a': {'b': 2, 'd':5}}].

The first node is {'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}. The result starts as empty, then after merging the first node, result is {'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}.

Then merging the second node {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}} into the result. For key 'a', existing value is a dict. So we check if the new value (which is a dict) is also a dict. Yes. So we call merge_dicts on the existing value (the dict {'b':1, 'c':4}) and the new value (dict {'b':2, 'd':5}).

In merge_dicts, for each key in the new dict (b and d):

- For key 'b', it's in d1 (existing value is 1). So check if both are dicts. The existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict. So merge them. So merge_dicts is called on {'b':1, 'c':4} and {'b':2, 'd':5}.

In that call, for key 'b' in d2, it's in d1. Both are dicts. So merge_dicts is called again on d1['b'] (which is 1) and d2['b'] (which is 2). Wait, no. Because in merge_dicts, d1 is the existing dict (from the first node's 'a' value), and d2 is the current node's 'a' value (the second dict). So when merging, we iterate through the keys of d2 (which is {'b':2, 'd':5}).

For each key in d2:

- 'b' is in d1 (which is {'b':1, 'c':4}).

So check if both are dicts. The existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replace with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict for 'a' would be {'b':2, 'd':5}, and the 'c' key from the first dict would be lost.

Wait, that's not correct. Because the existing dict for 'a' is {'b':1, 'c':4}, and the new dict for 'a' is {'b':2, 'd':5}. So merging them should result in {'b':2, 'c':4, 'd':5}.

But with the current approach, when we call merge_dicts on the existing dict (d1) and the new dict (d2), it would iterate over d2's keys. So for 'b', it's in d1. Since d1's value is 1 (not a dict), it would replace it with 2. Then 'd' is added. But the 'c' key from d1 would remain. So the merged dict would be {'b':2, 'c':4, 'd':5}.

Wait, no. Because in the merge_dicts function, d1 is the existing dict (from the first node), and d2 is the current node's 'a' value. So when merging, the code would iterate over the keys in d2, which are 'b' and 'd'. So for each of those keys, it would check if they are in d1. For 'b', yes, and since the existing value is 1 (not a dict), it would replace with 2. Then 'd' is added. However, the 'c' key from d1 is not processed again. Because the merge_dicts function is merging d2 into d1. So the 'c' key would remain in d1. So the merged dict would be {'b':2, 'c':4, 'd':5}.

Yes, that's correct. Because the merge_dicts function is merging d2 into d1. So the code would take all keys from d2 and merge them into d1. So the 'c' key is already in d1, but since it's not in d2, it remains. So this approach seems correct.

But then, the main function would call merge_dicts on the result and the current node. So the main function would start with an empty result, then merge each node into it. For example, the first node is merged into the empty result. Then the second node is merged into the result. This way, all keys from all nodes are processed.

But how does this handle the case where multiple nodes have the same key. For example, nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}]. The first node is merged into the result, which becomes {'a':1}. Then the second node is merged into the result. The key 'a' is present, and since the existing value is 1 (not a dict), it's replaced with 2. So the final result is {'a':2}.

Another example: nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}, {'a': {'d': 3}}]. The main function would merge each node into the result. The first node adds 'a' with {'b':1}. The second node's 'a' is merged into the result. Since 'a' is already present, and the existing value is a dict, the code would check if the new value is a dict. It is, so merge_dicts is called on the existing 'a' dict and the new 'a' dict. The new 'a' dict is {'c':2}, so merging it into the existing {'b':1} would result in {'b':1, 'c':2}. Then the third node's 'a' is {'d':3}, which is merged into the existing {'b':1, 'c':2}, resulting in {'b':1, 'c':2, 'd':3}.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the code should be structured with a helper function merge_dicts that merges two dictionaries, and the main function iterates through each node, merging them into the result.

But the original function signature is def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):, which takes a list of nodes. So the main function would need to iterate through each node in the list and merge them into the result.

So the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        result = merge_dicts(result, node)
    return result

def merge_dicts(d1, d2):
    for key, value in d2.items():
        if key in d1:
            if isinstance(d1[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                d1[key] = merge_dicts(d1[key], value)
            else:
                d1[key] = value
        else:
            d1[key] = value
    return d1

But this approach would work. However, the user's function is supposed to be a single function. So perhaps the helper function should be inside the main function.

But the user's function is called deep_merge_nodes, which takes a list of nodes. So perhaps the code should be written as a single function with nested helper.

But the user's function is supposed to return the merged result. So the code should be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    def merge_dicts(d1, d2):
        for key, value in d2.items():
            if key in d1:
                if isinstance(d1[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    d1[key] = merge_dicts(d1[key], value)
                else:
                    d1[key] = value
            else:
                d1[key] = value
        return d1

    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        result = merge_dicts(result, node)
    return result

But this code would merge all the nodes into the result. Let me test this code with the example where nodes is [{'a': {'b': 1, 'c':4}}, {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}].

The first node is {'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}. The result starts as empty, then after merging, it becomes {'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}.

Then the second node is {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}. So merge_dicts is called with result (which is {'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}) and the node (which is {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}).

In the merge_dicts function, we iterate over the keys of the node (which is 'a'), and for each key, we check if it's in d1 (which is the result). So key 'a' is present. Then check if both are dicts. The existing value is a dict (d1[key] is {'b':1, 'c':4}), and the value from the node is {'b':2, 'd':5}. So we call merge_dicts on those two dicts.

In that call, d1 is {'b':1, 'c':4}, and d2 is {'b':2, 'd':5}.

Iterate over d2's keys: 'b' and 'd'.

For 'b', it's in d1. Check if both are dicts. The existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replace with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict becomes {'b':2, 'd':5}.

So the result for 'a' becomes {'b':2, 'd':5}.

But then, the 'c' key from the first dict is lost. Because when merging the second node's 'a' value into the existing 'a' value, the code is merging the second node's 'a' value (which is a dict) into the existing 'a' dict. But the second node's 'a' dict has keys 'b' and 'd', but not 'c'. So during the merge, the 'c' key is not processed again. So the 'c' key remains in the existing 'a' dict.

Wait, no. Because the merge_dicts function is merging d2 into d1. So when we call merge_dicts on d1 (which is {'b':1, 'c':4}) and d2 (which is {'b':2, 'd':5}), the code loops through d2's items. So for each key in d2, it processes them. The 'b' key is processed, and the 'd' key is added. But the 'c' key is not in d2, so it remains in d1. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'c':4, 'd':5}.

Yes, that's correct. Because the merge_dicts function is merging the keys from d2 into d1. So the existing keys in d1 that are not in d2 remain. So this approach works.

But what if the node has multiple keys? For example, the first node has {'a': {'b':1}, 'c': 2}, and the second node has {'a': {'d':3}, 'c': 4}. Then merging would result in {'a': {'b':1, 'd':3}, 'c':4}.

Yes, because the first node is merged into the result. Then the second node is merged into the result. The 'a' key is present, so merge the dicts. The 'c' key is present, so replace with 4.

So this code seems to handle that.

But the original function signature is def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):. So the code should be written as a single function, not using a helper.

Alternatively, the code can be written without a helper function. Let me try to write it inline.

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    # Recursively merge the two dicts
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but this code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing two dicts. Which would then merge them. But this approach is not correct, because when merging two dicts, the code would process each as a node. For example, if the nodes list is [{'a': {'b':1}}, {'a': {'c':2}}], then the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [{'b':1}, {'c':2}]. Which would merge them into {'b':1, 'c':2}, and then assign it to result['a'].

But that's correct. So the code would merge the two dicts, and the result would be {'a': {'b':1, 'c':2}}.

But what if the nodes list is [{'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}, {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}]. Then the code would call deep_merge_nodes on [{'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5}]. Processing each node in that list. The first node adds 'b':1 and 'c':4. The second node's 'b' is processed, and since it's in the result, check if both are dicts. The existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replace with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'd':5}.

But the 'c' key from the first dict is lost. Because when merging the two dicts, the code is processing the second dict's keys, and the first dict's keys are not processed again. Wait, no. Because the code is called with a list of nodes, which in this case is [{'b':1, 'c':4}, {'b':2, 'd':5}]. So the first node is {'b':1, 'c':4}. The code would process each key in this node, adding them to the result. Then the second node is {'b':2, 'd':5}, and for each key in this node, 'b' and 'd', it would check if they're in the result. For 'b', it's present, and the existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replaced with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'd':5}, but the 'c' key from the first node is not in the second node, so it's not processed. So the 'c' key is lost.

Ah, here's the problem. The code as written would not merge all keys from all nodes. Because when you call deep_merge_nodes on a list of two dicts, it would process each key in the second dict, but not the first. So this approach is wrong.

So the code needs to merge all keys from all nodes. So the helper function approach is better because it merges d2 into d1, which includes all keys from d2. But the main function is supposed to merge all nodes in the list. So the helper function should merge d2 into d1, which includes all keys from d2. But in the previous example, the code would not include the 'c' key from the first node. Because when merging the two dicts, the code is processing the second dict's keys, not the first.

So the helper function approach is better. But how to implement it without a helper function.

Alternatively, the code should be written as follows:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                if isinstance(result[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    # Merge the two dicts
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([result[key], value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But this code would call deep_merge_nodes on a list containing the existing value and the new value. But this is not the same as merging all nodes. Because if the existing value is a dict, and the new value is a dict, then the code would merge those two dicts, but the existing dict may have other keys that are not in the new dict. However, the code would not process those keys again. So this approach is flawed.

So the correct way is to have a helper function that merges two dictionaries, and the main function uses this helper to merge all nodes sequentially.

Therefore, the code should be written with a helper function. But the user wants the function to be called deep_merge_nodes, and the helper function can be inside it.

So here's the corrected code:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    def merge(d1, d2):
        for key, value in d2.items():
            if key in d1:
                if isinstance(d1[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    d1[key] = merge(d1[key], value)
                else:
                    d1[key] = value
            else:
                d1[key] = value
        return d1

    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        result = merge(result, node)
    return result

But this code would merge all nodes into the result. Let me test with the example where nodes is [{'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}, {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}].

The first node is {'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}. The result starts as empty, then after merging, it becomes {'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}.

Then, the second node is {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}. So merge is called with result (which is {'a': {'b':1, 'c':4}}) and the node (which is {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}).

In the merge function, we iterate over the keys of the node, which are 'a', 'b', 'd'? No, the node is {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}, so its items are {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}.

So in the merge function, for each key in d2 (the node), which is 'a', we check if it's in d1 (the result). It is. Then check if both are dicts. d1[key] is {'b':1, 'c':4}, and value is {'b':2, 'd':5}. So we call merge on those two dicts.

So the merge function is called with d1 as {'b':1, 'c':4} and d2 as {'b':2, 'd':5}.

In this call, we iterate over d2's items, which are 'b' and 'd'.

For 'b', it's in d1. Check if both are dicts. The existing value is 1 (not a dict), so replace with 2. Then 'd' is added. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'd':5}.

So the result['a'] is set to this merged dict. So the final result is {'a': {'b':2, 'd':5}}. But the 'c' key from the first dict is lost. Because the merge function only processes the keys from d2 (the node's items), not from d1.

Wait, no. The merge function is merging d2 into d1. So in this case, d1 is {'b':1, 'c':4}, and d2 is {'b':2, 'd':5}. The merge function loops through d2's items, which are 'b' and 'd'. So for 'b', it replaces the existing value. For 'd', it adds it. The 'c' key is not processed here, because it's not in d2. So it remains in d1. So the merged dict is {'b':2, 'c':4, 'd':5}.

Yes, that's correct. Because the merge function is merging d2 into d1. So the keys in d2 are processed, but the keys in d1 that are not in d2 remain.

So this approach is correct.

But in the code, the merge function is called with d1 and d2, and the d2 is the current node. So the code is merging the current node into the result.

But the problem is that the code is written as a single function. So the helper function is inside the main function.

But the user's function signature is def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):. So the code should be written as such.

But in this case, the code is not handling the case where the node is not a dict. For example, if a node is a list or a primitive. But the docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So the code should assume that the nodes are dicts, and that the function is merging them.

So the code above should work.

But the original function is supposed to take a list of nodes, and merge them. So the code would process each node in the list, merging them into the result.

But what if the nodes are not dictionaries? The code would fail, but the docstring says that the function merges node values corresponding to duplicate keys. So perhaps the nodes are all dicts, and the function is supposed to merge them.

Thus, the code should be written as follows:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    def merge(d1, d2):
        for key, value in d2.items():
            if key in d1:
                if isinstance(d1[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    d1[key] = merge(d1[key], value)
                else:
                    d1[key] = value
            else:
                d1[key] = value
        return d1

    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        result = merge(result, node)
    return result

But this code would work for merging all nodes in the list, and for each key, the last occurrence in the list would take precedence if the values are not dicts. If the values are dicts, they are merged recursively.

But the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which takes a list of nodes. So this code would work.

But the user's docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So the code should handle that.

But in this code, when merging, if the existing value is not a dict, it replaces it with the new value. So that's correct.

But what about if the existing value is a dict and the new value is not. For example, result has 'a' with {'b':1}, and the new node has 'a' with 2. Then, during the merge, since the existing value is a dict and the new value is not, the code would replace the existing value with 2. Which is correct.

So this code should work.

But the function is supposed to merge nodes, which may be nested. So the code would handle that.

But the code is written with the assumption that each node is a dictionary. So the code would work for that.

But the user's function is called deep_merge_nodes, and the parameter is nodes. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle a list of nodes, each of which can be a dict or another structure. But without more context, I'll proceed with the assumption that nodes are dictionaries.

So the code above should be correct.

But the user's initial code example may have a different structure. For example, if the nodes are not dictionaries, but something else. But given the docstring, I think the code is correct.

So the final code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    def merge(d1, d2):
        for key, value in d2.items():
            if key in d1:
                if isinstance(d1[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    d1[key] = merge(d1[key], value)
                else:
                    d1[key] = value
            else:
                d1[key] = value
        return d1

    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        result = merge(result, node)
    return result

But wait, the merge function is merging d2 into d1. So when we call merge(result, node), we are merging the node into the result. So the result is updated with the merged values.

But this code may have an issue with the initial result being empty. For example, the first node is merged into the empty result. So for each key in the first node, it's added to the result. Then the second node is merged into the result, and so on.

This should work.

But what about if the nodes are not dictionaries? For example, if a node is a list. But the docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So if a node is not a dict, then it's treated as a non-MappingNode. But the code assumes that all nodes are dicts. So this code may not handle that case. But given the lack of information, it's better to proceed with the assumption that nodes are dictionaries.

So the code above should be correct.

But the user's initial code may have a different structure. For example, if nodes are a list of dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge them. So this code should work.

Thus, the final code is as above.
