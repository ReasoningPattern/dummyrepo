Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function deep_merge_nodes based on the given docstring. Let me think about what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it merges any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and returns the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains.

Hmm, first, I should figure out what kind of data structure these nodes are. The mention of MappingNode suggests that maybe this is related to YAML parsing, where nodes can be mappings (like dictionaries) or scalars (simple values). So, perhaps the function is supposed to merge a list of such nodes, combining their key-value pairs, and for duplicate keys, if the values are both mappings, they should be deeply merged. If one is a scalar, the last one takes precedence.

Wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, so maybe it's handling a list of dictionaries (nodes) and merging them recursively. The key point is that when keys collide, if both values are mappings, they are merged deeply. Otherwise, the last value is kept.

So, the approach would be to iterate through each node in the list, and for each key-value pair, check if the key already exists in the result. If it does, and both existing and new value are mappings, then merge them. Otherwise, keep the last one.

But how to implement this? Let's think about using a dictionary to accumulate the merged result. For each node, we process its items. For each key in the node, if the key is already in the result, we need to check if both are mappings. If so, we merge them recursively. Otherwise, we replace the existing value with the new one.

Wait, but the nodes could be a list of dictionaries. So, the function is supposed to take a list of nodes (each being a dictionary) and merge them. Let me outline the steps:

Initialize an empty dictionary as the result.
Iterate over each node in nodes:
   For each key, value in the node:
      If the key is already in the result:
          If both result[key] and value are dictionaries (MappingNode?), then deep merge them.
          Else, keep the last value.
      Else:
          Add the key and value to the result.

But how to check if a value is a MappingNode? In Python, perhaps using isinstance(value, dict) or some other check. But maybe the nodes are actually objects from a library like PyYAML, which have MappingNode and ScalarNode types. However, the user hasn't specified that. So maybe the function is intended to work with dictionaries, and the term MappingNode is just a hint.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle a list of nodes where each node is a dictionary, and merge them, with the rule that if a key exists in multiple nodes, the last occurrence's value is kept, unless both values are dictionaries, in which case they are merged.

So, the code would need to recursively merge dictionaries. Let's think about how to do that.

For example, if two dictionaries have the same key, and both values are dicts, then we merge them. Otherwise, the last one wins.

So, the function could be implemented as follows:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in merged:
                if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([merged[key], value])
                else:
                    merged[key] = value
            else:
                merged[key] = value
    return merged

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes and takes nodes as input. Maybe the nodes are not dictionaries but some other structure. But given the docstring, perhaps it's safe to assume that each node is a dictionary. Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge all of them.

Wait, the function's parameter is nodes, which is a list? Or is it a single node? The docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys", which implies that nodes is a list of nodes (each being a dictionary or similar). So the function is supposed to take a list of nodes and merge them into one.

But the function signature is def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):, so nodes is a single argument. Maybe nodes is a list of dictionaries. So the code would process each node in the list.

But the example code I wrote earlier would process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, merge into the merged dictionary.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that it's merging multiple nodes. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of nodes (each being a dictionary) and merge them, with the rules mentioned.

But maybe the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes where each node is a dictionary, and for each key, if there are multiple entries, merge them recursively.

But the code I wrote earlier would handle that. Let me test with some examples.

Example 1:
nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}]
merged would be {'a': 2} because the last value is kept.

Example 2:
nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}]
merged would be {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}.

Example 3:
nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2}}]
merged would be {'a': {'b': 2}}.

Wait, but according to the docstring, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So, if a key exists in multiple nodes, and the values are not both mappings, then the last one is kept.

So the code above would handle that. But the function is supposed to merge nodes. Wait, perhaps the nodes are not a list but a single node, and the function is supposed to merge multiple nodes into one. But the function's parameter is nodes, which is a single argument. So maybe the function is supposed to take a list of nodes, each being a dictionary, and merge them.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge multiple nodes into a single node, where each node is a dictionary. So the code would process all nodes in the list, merging them as per the rules.

But the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which might imply that it's merging multiple nodes (like multiple dictionaries) into one. So the code I wrote earlier would work.

But perhaps the function is supposed to handle more complex structures. For example, if a node is a list of nodes, but the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys", so maybe each node is a dictionary, and the function merges all of them.

So the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in merged:
                if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([merged[key], value])
                else:
                    merged[key] = value
            else:
                merged[key] = value
    return merged

Wait, but the function is called with nodes as a single argument. So maybe nodes is a list of dictionaries. So the function is supposed to merge all the dictionaries in the list.

But the code above would process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, merge into the merged dictionary.

But perhaps the function is supposed to merge multiple nodes, where each node is a dictionary, and the merging is done in a way that for each key, if it's present in multiple nodes, the values are merged recursively if they are both dictionaries, otherwise the last one is kept.

Yes, that seems to fit the docstring.

But maybe the function is supposed to take a list of nodes (each being a dictionary) and merge them. So the code would be as above.

But I need to make sure that the function is called with nodes as a list. However, the function signature is def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):, so perhaps nodes is a list. So the code would process each node in the list.

Wait, but in the code, the loop is for node in nodes: which implies that nodes is an iterable. So if nodes is a list, that's okay.

But maybe the function is supposed to handle a single node, and the merging is done by combining multiple nodes. But the function's parameter is nodes, which is a single argument. So perhaps the function is designed to take a list of nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes, where each node is a dictionary, and the merging is done as per the rules.

So, the code as written would work. Let me check the docstring again: "Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains."

So, the function is supposed to merge multiple nodes (each being a dictionary?), and for duplicate keys, if the values are both mappings (dicts?), merge them deeply. Otherwise, take the last one.

Therefore, the code would be as follows. However, the function is named deep_merge_nodes, but the parameter is nodes. So perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of nodes, and merge them.

But maybe the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes, where each node is a dictionary. So the code would process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, merge into the result.

But the code as written would do that. However, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which might be a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to merge multiple nodes (like a list of dictionaries) into a single dictionary, with the merging rules. So the code would be as I wrote.

But perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of nodes (each being a dictionary) and merge them. So the code is correct.

But I need to make sure that the code is handling the merging correctly. For example, if two nodes have the same key, and their values are both dicts, then we need to merge them. So the code uses recursion here.

Wait, in the code, when merging two dicts, it calls deep_merge_nodes with a list containing those two dicts. But the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes. So if the function is called with a list of nodes, then for each node in the list, we process its items. But when merging two dicts, we pass them as a list to deep_merge_nodes again. That would work recursively.

But maybe the function is supposed to take a list of nodes and merge them. So the code is correct.

But perhaps the function is supposed to merge multiple nodes, and the nodes are not necessarily dictionaries. But given the docstring, I think it's safe to assume that each node is a dictionary.

So the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in merged:
                if isinstance(merged[key], dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([merged[key], value])
                else:
                    merged[key] = value
            else:
                merged[key] = value
    return merged

But wait, the function is called with nodes as a single argument. So if nodes is a list, then this code would work. But maybe the function is supposed to take a list of nodes, each of which is a dictionary. So this code would merge all the nodes in the list.

But perhaps the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes, where each node is a dictionary, and the merging is done as per the rules.

But maybe the function is supposed to handle nested dictionaries. For example, if a node has a key that's a dictionary, then that dictionary is merged with any existing one in the result.

Yes, that's what the code does. For example, if the first node is {'a': {'b': 1}}, and the second node is {'a': {'c': 2}}, then merged['a'] would be the result of deep_merge_nodes on [{'b':1}, {'c':2}], which would combine them into {'b':1, 'c':2}.

But in the code, when we have merged[key] and value both as dicts, we call deep_merge_nodes with a list containing those two dicts. But the function is supposed to merge nodes, which are the original list. Wait, perhaps the function is designed to take a list of nodes, and each node is a dictionary. So when merging two dictionaries, we pass them as a list to the same function. That seems correct.

But maybe the function is supposed to merge all nodes in the list, and for each key, if there are multiple entries, merge them. So the code is correct.

But what if the nodes are not dictionaries? Well, the docstring mentions MappingNode, which might be a specific type from a library. However, since the user hasn't provided that context, perhaps the code should assume that nodes are dictionaries.

So the code would work for that case.

But the function's parameter is nodes, which is a list? Or maybe it's a single node? The function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which might imply that it's merging multiple nodes. So perhaps the function is supposed to take a list of nodes (each being a dictionary) and merge them.

But the code as written would process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, merge into the result.

So, the code seems to fit the description.

But perhaps the function is supposed to merge a list of nodes, where each node is a dictionary, and the merging is done in a way that for each key, the last occurrence is kept unless both are dicts, in which case they are merged.

Yes, that's what the code does.

So the code is correct. But maybe I should test some cases.

Another example: nodes = [{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2}}, {'a': 3, 'b': {'d': 4}}]. The merged result would be {'a': 3, 'b': {'c': 2, 'd': 4}}.

Another case: nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2}}]. Then merged['a'] would be the result of deep_merge_nodes on [{'b':1}, {'b':2}], which would be {'b':2}.

So the code seems to handle that.

Therefore, the code is as follows.
