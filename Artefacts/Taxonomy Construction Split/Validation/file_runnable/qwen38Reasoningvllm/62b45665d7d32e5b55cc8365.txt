Okay, I need to generate Python code for the parse_arguments function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function is supposed to take *unparsed_arguments, which means it can accept a variable number of arguments. The docstring says it parses parameters and returns them as a dict map. So the goal is to convert these arguments into a dictionary.

Wait, but how are the arguments structured? The user didn't specify, but maybe they expect that the arguments are key-value pairs. Like, if you call parse_arguments("key1", "value1", "key2", "value2"), it should return {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}.

But what if there's an odd number of arguments? That would be a problem. Maybe the function assumes that the arguments are provided in pairs. Or perhaps it's expecting a list of arguments that can be parsed in some way. The docstring isn't very specific. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to parse command-line arguments, but the parameters are passed as *unparsed_arguments. Wait, but the function name is parse_arguments, not parse_command_line. So perhaps it's a general-purpose function to convert a list of arguments into a dictionary.

Let me think. If the function is given a list of arguments, maybe it's intended to take them as key-value pairs. So for example, if you have arguments like key1=value1, key2=value2, etc., then split them into keys and values.

Wait, but the function is called with *unparsed_arguments, which would collect all positional arguments. So if someone calls parse_arguments("key1", "value1", "key2", "value2"), then the function needs to pair them up. But how to handle that? Maybe the function expects that the arguments are in the form of key1=value1, key2=value2, etc., and then split each argument into key and value.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of arguments where each argument is a key, and the values are provided in some way. But that's unclear. The docstring says "parses parameters", but without more details, I have to make an assumption.

Another possibility: the function is meant to parse a list of strings where each string is a key-value pair, separated by an equals sign. So for example, if the input is ["key1=value1", "key2=value2"], then the function would split each string into key and value and create a dictionary.

Wait, but the function is defined with *unparsed_arguments, which would collect all the arguments as a tuple. So if the user calls parse_arguments("key1=value1", "key2=value2"), then the function needs to process each argument as a key-value pair.

So the plan is: iterate over the unparsed_arguments, split each argument on '=', and add them to the dictionary. But what if an argument doesn't have an equals sign? Maybe the function should handle that by ignoring invalid ones or raising an error. The docstring doesn't mention error handling, so perhaps we should assume that all arguments are valid key-value pairs.

So the code would be something like:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    """
    Parses parameters and returns them as dict maps
    """
    args_dict = {}
    for arg in unparsed_arguments:
        if '=' in arg:
            key, value = arg.split('=', 1)
            args_dict[key] = value
    return args_dict

Wait, but splitting on '=' with maxsplit=1 ensures that if the value itself has an equals sign, it's treated as a single key. For example, "key=value with = inside" would split into key and "value with = inside".

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of arguments where each argument is a key, and the values are provided in some other way. But that's not clear. Since the docstring doesn't specify, the most straightforward approach is to split each argument into key and value based on the equals sign.

So the code would loop through each argument in the tuple, split into key and value, and add them to the dictionary. That seems reasonable. Let me test this logic with some examples.

If the function is called with parse_arguments("a", "1", "b", "2"), it would create {'a': '1', 'b': '2'}.

If called with parse_arguments("key1=value1", "key2=value2"), it would create the same.

But what if there's an odd number of arguments? Like parse_arguments("a", "1", "b")? Then the last argument 'b' would be ignored. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that case, so maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take a list of arguments where each argument is a key, and the values are provided as separate arguments. But that would require pairing them, which isn't straightforward. For example, if you have keys as arguments and values as subsequent arguments. But that's more complex and would require checking that the number of arguments is even. However, the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps the initial approach is better.

So the code would split each argument into key and value. Let me write that.

Another thing: the function returns a dict, so the code should return a dictionary. Also, the docstring says "dict maps" which might be a typo for "dictionary".

So the code would be:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    """
    Parses parameters and returns them as dict maps
    """
    args_dict = {}
    for arg in unparsed_arguments:
        if '=' in arg:
            key, value = arg.split('=', 1)
            args_dict[key] = value
    return args_dict

But maybe the function is supposed to handle more complex parsing, like handling quotes or other separators. However, without more details, this is the simplest possible implementation that meets the given description.

I think that's the best approach here. So the code would be as above.
