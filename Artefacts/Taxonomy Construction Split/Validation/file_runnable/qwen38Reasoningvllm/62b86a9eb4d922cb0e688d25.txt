Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the function _get_resource_name_regex based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says it should return the regular expressions used to validate Krake resource names.

First, I need to figure out what the regular expression should look like. Since it's for resource names, I should consider common naming conventions. Maybe they have specific rules, like starting with a letter, followed by letters and numbers, and maybe some underscores or hyphens. But since the user hasn't specified exact rules, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Krake is a project related to Kubernetes, so perhaps the resource names follow Kubernetes naming rules. Kubernetes resource names typically can include lowercase letters, numbers, and certain special characters like hyphens and underscores. They also can't start or end with a hyphen. So the regex might be something like ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$ to ensure it starts and ends with a letter or number.

But maybe the user has different requirements. For example, maybe they allow uppercase letters? If not, the regex should enforce lowercase. Also, maybe there's a maximum length. Let me check the Kubernetes documentation. Oh right, Kubernetes resource names can be up to 253 characters, but the regex for that is a bit more complex. However, the user's docstring doesn't mention length, so perhaps it's not necessary here.

Alternatively, maybe Krake uses a simpler regex. Let me think. If the name can have letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, but not start or end with a hyphen, then the regex would be ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$. But the user's docstring doesn't specify case sensitivity. Maybe they want it to be case-insensitive? Or perhaps they require specific casing.

Wait, the function is called _get_resource_name_regex, which suggests it's an internal helper. The exact requirements might be that the name is alphanumeric with hyphens and underscores, and doesn't start or end with a hyphen. So I'll go with that. Let me write the regex pattern.

So the function should return a compiled regex object. The pattern would be r'^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$' and then compile it with re.compile. But maybe the user wants it to be case-insensitive? Or maybe they have a specific format. Since the docstring doesn't specify, I'll assume the standard approach.

Wait, but in the example, the user might have a different requirement. For instance, maybe they allow numbers in the middle but not at the start. Or perhaps they have a specific prefix or suffix. Without more info, I'll stick with the common pattern.

So the code would be importing re, then defining the function to return re.compile with the appropriate pattern. Let me make sure to include the correct flags. Maybe the regex should be case-insensitive, but the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe they want to match exactly, so no flags. Let me check the original function's docstring again. It says "validate the name of the Krake resources" but no specifics. So I'll assume the standard regex for resource names, which is usually alphanumeric with hyphens and underscores, and not starting or ending with a hyphen.

Therefore, the code would be:

import re

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return re.compile(r'^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$')

But wait, maybe the user wants to allow numbers in the name. The pattern allows numbers in the middle. Also, maybe they want to include more characters like periods or colons? But that's unlikely. Let me think again. The standard Kubernetes name regex is [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which allows hyphens in the middle but not at the start or end. So perhaps the pattern should be r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$' but that allows for optional hyphens. Wait, the original pattern I had includes underscores and hyphens. Maybe Krake allows underscores as well. So perhaps the correct pattern is allowing letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, but not starting or ending with hyphen.

So the regex would be ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$. But maybe the user wants to allow numbers at the start? Like if the name can start with a number. Wait, the original docstring says "Krake resources" but without specifics. Let me check if there's any standard for Krake. Since I don't have that info, I'll proceed with the most common approach.

So the code would import re and return the compiled regex. Also, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of regex patterns? The docstring says "regular expressions" plural, so perhaps there are multiple patterns. But the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which suggests a single regex. Maybe the user made a typo and meant singular. Alternatively, maybe there are multiple regex patterns for different parts of the name.

Hmm, but the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is supposed to return the regex, so perhaps it's a single pattern. Let me proceed with that. So the code would be as above. But maybe the user wants to include more characters. For example, maybe dots or other symbols. Without knowing, I'll stick with hyphens and underscores.

Another consideration: the regex should be case-insensitive? Or case-sensitive? The docstring doesn't specify, so I'll assume case-sensitive. So the pattern uses [a-zA-Z] for the first character. Alternatively, maybe it's case-insensitive, but the user might have a reason to have it case-sensitive. Let me check the original function's purpose. If the resource names are case-sensitive, then the regex should be case-sensitive. If not, maybe use the re.IGNORECASE flag. But again, without specific info, I'll assume case-sensitive.

So the final code would be importing re and returning the compiled regex with the pattern that starts with a letter, followed by letters, numbers, hyphens, or underscores, and ends with a letter or number. That's the code I'll write.
