Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called directlyProvidedBy, and it returns an IDeclaration interface. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's purpose is to return the interfaces directly provided by the given object. In Zope interfaces, the IDeclaration interface is used to represent the interfaces that are declared. So, the function probably needs to return an instance of IDeclaration.

But wait, the function's parameters are not specified. The docstring says "given object", but the function definition doesn't have parameters. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the function is supposed to take an object as an argument, but the signature is missing it. Hmm, the user provided the function signature as def directlyProvidedBy(object):, so the parameter is there. But the docstring mentions "the given object", which suggests that the function takes an object as input.

So, the function is supposed to take an object and return the interfaces directly provided by it. But how to implement that in Python? Well, in Zope, interfaces are usually managed through the interface module. But the problem is, the function is supposed to return an IDeclaration, which is a class from zope.interface.interfaces.

Wait, but the user is asking for code generation. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return an IDeclaration instance, but how? Maybe the function is a wrapper that returns the IDeclaration for the given object's interfaces.

But without knowing the exact implementation, maybe the function is supposed to return a placeholder or a mock. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, not to implement it. But the docstring says "Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object" and returns an IDeclaration.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return a mock IDeclaration instance. But how to do that? Let me think. The IDeclaration interface is part of zope.interface. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return an instance of IDeclaration, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is a wrapper that returns the IDeclaration for the object's interfaces. But without knowing the actual implementation, it's hard to say. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given signature and docstring. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return a mock IDeclaration instance.

But how to create that? Let me check the Zope interface module. The IDeclaration interface is part of zope.interface.interfaces. So, the function would need to import that.

But the function's code would need to return an instance of IDeclaration. However, without knowing the actual object, it's impossible to create the IDeclaration. So maybe the function is supposed to return a placeholder, like a mock.

Alternatively, maybe the function is a helper that returns the IDeclaration for the given object's interfaces. But in practice, that would require accessing the interfaces of the object, which is not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return a list of interfaces that are directly provided by the object. But the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration, which is a class. So, maybe the function is supposed to return an instance of that class.

But how to create that instance? Maybe the function is supposed to return a mock, like a dummy IDeclaration instance. So, the code would be:

from zope.interface.interfaces import IDeclaration

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return IDeclaration()

But that's just a guess. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So, the code would need to include the import statement for IDeclaration and return an instance of it.

But the function's parameter is 'object', which is not used in the code. That's odd. Maybe the function is supposed to return the IDeclaration for the object's interfaces, but without knowing the actual object, it's impossible. So, perhaps the function is a stub that returns a dummy IDeclaration.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the IDeclaration for the object's interfaces, but the actual implementation is not provided. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, not to implement it.

So, the code would be:

from zope.interface.interfaces import IDeclaration

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    return IDeclaration()

But I'm not sure if that's correct. However, given the information, that's the best I can do.
