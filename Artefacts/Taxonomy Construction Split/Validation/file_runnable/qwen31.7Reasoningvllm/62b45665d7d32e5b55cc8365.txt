Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_arguments that takes variable number of arguments and returns them as a dictionary of maps. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function is supposed to parse the unparsed arguments into a dictionary. But the problem is, the function is defined with *unparsed_arguments, which means it can accept any number of arguments. The docstring says it returns them as dict maps, but that's a bit unclear. Maybe it's supposed to group the arguments into a dictionary where each key is a parameter name and the value is the corresponding value?

Wait, the docstring says "returns them as dict maps". Maybe that's a typo, and they meant "returns them as a dictionary of maps" or something else. But the function's purpose is to parse the arguments into a dictionary. So the function needs to take the arguments, perhaps split them into key-value pairs, and return a dictionary.

But how to handle the arguments? The function is called with *unparsed_arguments, which is a variable number of arguments. So, for example, if the user calls parse_arguments("key1", "value1", "key2", "value2"), the function should return a dictionary like {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}.

But how to split the arguments into key-value pairs? The problem is that the arguments could be in any order, and the keys and values could be mixed. So the function needs to parse each argument as a key-value pair, but how?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to parse the arguments as a list of key-value pairs, where each argument is a key followed by a value. But that's not possible if the arguments are passed as separate elements. For example, if the user passes "a=1", "b=2", then the function would need to split them into key-value pairs.

But the function is called with *unparsed_arguments, which is a variable number of arguments. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take all the arguments as a list, and then split them into key-value pairs. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to parse the arguments as a list of strings, where each string is a key-value pair. For example, if the arguments are "a=1", "b=2", then the function would split them into a dictionary.

But the function's parameters are *unparsed_arguments, which is a variable number of arguments. So, the function would need to process all of them as key-value pairs. But how?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to take the arguments as a list of strings, where each string is a key-value pair. For example, if the user calls parse_arguments("a=1", "b=2"), then the function would return {"a": "1", "b": "2"}.

But the problem is that the arguments could be in any order, and the keys and values could be mixed. So, perhaps the function is supposed to split each argument into key and value. For example, if the argument is "key=value", then split into key and value. But if the argument is a single string, maybe it's a key, and the value is something else.

Wait, but the function's docstring says "returns them as dict maps". Maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is the argument, and the value is the corresponding value. But how to parse that?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to parse the arguments into a dictionary where each key is the argument name, and the value is the argument value. But how to split the arguments into key-value pairs.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to take the arguments as a list of strings, where each string is a key-value pair. For example, if the arguments are "a=1", "b=2", then the function would split them into a dictionary.

But the function is called with *unparsed_arguments, which is a variable number of arguments. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take all the arguments as a list, and then split them into key-value pairs.

But how to do that? For example, if the arguments are "a=1", "b=2", then the function would split them into a dictionary. But if the arguments are "a", "b", then the function would return {"a": "", "b": ""} if the value is empty, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the arguments as a list of strings, where each string is a key-value pair. So, the function would process each string, split into key and value, and add to the dictionary.

But how to handle that in the function. Let's think of the code.

The function would take *unparsed_arguments as a variable number of arguments. So, in Python, the function would have:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    # process the arguments

But how to split them into key-value pairs. Let's assume that each argument is a string that contains a key and a value. For example, "key=value" would be split into key and value. But if the argument is a single string, maybe it's a key, and the value is something else.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to parse the arguments into a dictionary. So, perhaps the function is supposed to take all the arguments as a list, and then split them into key-value pairs.

But how to do that. Let's think of an example. Suppose the user calls parse_arguments("a=1", "b=2"). Then the function should return {"a": "1", "b": "2"}.

But how to split the arguments. The function can iterate over the arguments, and for each argument, split into key and value. But how to split them. For example, if the argument is "a=1", split into key "a" and value "1". If the argument is "a", then maybe the value is empty or something else.

But the problem is that the function's parameters are *unparsed_arguments, which is a variable number of arguments. So, the function would need to process all of them as key-value pairs.

But perhaps the function is supposed to take the arguments as a list of strings, where each string is a key-value pair. So, the function would process each string, split into key and value, and add to the dictionary.

So, the code would be:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    args = {}
    for arg in unparsed_arguments:
        if '=' in arg:
            key, value = arg.split('=', 1)
            args[key] = value
        else:
            # if the argument is a key without a value, maybe it's a key, and the value is something else?
            # but how to handle that? Maybe the value is empty or something?
            args[arg] = ''
    return args

But this code would split each argument into key and value if there's an equals sign. Otherwise, it treats the argument as a key with an empty value.

But the problem is that the function's docstring says "returns them as dict maps". Maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is the argument, and the value is the corresponding value. But the code above would do that.

But the function is called with *unparsed_arguments, which is a variable number of arguments. So, for example, if the user passes "a=1", "b=2", then the function would return {"a": "1", "b": "2"}.

But what if the arguments are passed as "a", "b"? Then the function would return {"a": "", "b": ""}.

But the docstring says "returns them as dict maps". Maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is the argument, and the value is the value of the argument. So, the code above would do that.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to parse the arguments into a dictionary. So, the code would be as above.

But the function is called with *unparsed_arguments, which is a variable number of arguments. So, the code would process each argument as a key-value pair.

But what if the arguments are passed as "a", "b", "c"? Then the function would return {"a": "", "b": "", "c": ""}.

But the docstring says "returns them as dict maps". Maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is the argument, and the value is the value. So, the code above would do that.

So, the code would be:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    """
    Parses parameters and returns them as dict maps
    """
    args = {}
    for arg in unparsed_arguments:
        if '=' in arg:
            key, value = arg.split('=', 1)
            args[key] = value
        else:
            args[arg] = ''
    return args

But wait, the docstring says "returns them as dict maps". Maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is the argument, and the value is the value. So, the code above would do that.

But perhaps the function is supposed to parse the arguments into a dictionary where each key is the argument name, and the value is the value. So, the code is correct.

But the function is called with *unparsed_arguments, which is a variable number of arguments. So, the code would process each argument as a key-value pair.

But what if the arguments are passed as "a", "b", "c"? Then the code would add them as keys with empty strings as values.

But the docstring says "returns them as dict maps". Maybe that's a typo, and they meant "returns them as a dictionary".

So, the code would be as above.

But the user wants the code generated, so the answer is the code as written.
