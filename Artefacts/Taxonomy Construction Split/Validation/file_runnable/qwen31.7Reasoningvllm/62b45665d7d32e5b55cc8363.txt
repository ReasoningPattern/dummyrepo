Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function make_parsers as described. The docstring says it builds a parser and its subparsers and returns them as a tuple. 

First, I remember that in Python, the argparse module is used for parsing command-line arguments. So the function should create an argparse.ArgumentParser instance and its subparsers.

Let me think about the steps. The function needs to create the main parser and then add subparsers. So I'll start by importing argparse.

Then, create the main parser using argparse.ArgumentParser(). Then, create subparsers using add_subparsers(). 

Wait, but the function is supposed to return a tuple. So the main parser and the subparsers? Or maybe the main parser and the subparsers as a list? Wait, the docstring says "return them as a tuple". So maybe the main parser and the subparsers (as a list or something else)?

Wait, the function is supposed to build the parser and its subparsers. So the main parser is the root, and the subparsers are the child parsers. So the function should return (parser, subparsers) as a tuple?

But how to structure that. Let me think. The standard way is to have the main parser, and then add subparsers. So the code would be:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    # add subparsers here
    return (parser, subparsers)

But wait, the docstring says "return them as a tuple". So the tuple would be (parser, subparsers). But subparsers is an argparse._SubParsersAction object. So the function would return that.

But maybe the user expects the subparsers to be a list of the subparsers? Or maybe the function is supposed to return the main parser and the subparsers as a list? Wait, the docstring says "return them as a tuple". So the tuple is (parser, subparsers).

But in Python, the subparsers is an object, so returning it as part of the tuple is okay.

So the code would be:

import argparse

def make_parsers():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers()
    return (parser, subparsers)

But maybe the user wants to add some subparsers with specific commands? But the function signature doesn't specify any parameters, so the code should just create the parser and subparsers without any additional setup.

So the code is straightforward. Import argparse, create the parser, add subparsers, return the tuple.
