Okay, I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that takes a list of nodes and merges them, handling duplicate keys. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one should stay. Hmm, so first I should figure out what a MappingNode is. Oh right, probably a node that's a mapping (like a dictionary) and can have nested nodes. 

The function has to merge these nodes. So for each key, if all the nodes have that key and their corresponding values are also MappingNodes, then I should recursively merge those. But if any of the nodes with the same key have a non-MappingNode value, then the last one in the list should take precedence. 

Wait, the problem says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So the main idea is that when keys are the same and the values are MappingNodes, they get merged deeply. Otherwise, the last value in the nodes list wins. 

So how do I approach this? Let's think of the nodes as a list of dictionaries, maybe? Or perhaps some custom node objects that have a 'value' attribute and a way to check if they are a MappingNode. Since the problem mentions non-MappingNode values, I'll assume that each node is a MappingNode or not. Maybe the nodes have a 'mapping' attribute or something, but perhaps for simplicity, the function can check if the value is a dictionary (assuming MappingNode is represented as a dict here). Or maybe the nodes are instances of a class, and I need to check their type. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll have to make some assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are all dictionaries, and the function needs to merge them. The deep merge would be for keys where all the nodes that have that key have a dictionary as their value. Then, for those keys, merge the dictionaries recursively. For keys present in multiple nodes but where at least one of the values isn't a dictionary, the last node's value is kept.

Wait, the problem says "corresponding to duplicate keys" — so maybe duplicate here refers to keys that exist in multiple nodes. So the merging process should go through each key in all the nodes and combine their values.

Let me think of an example. Suppose nodes are [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2}}, {'a': 3} ]. The keys for 'a' in the first two are MappingNodes (their values are dicts), but the third is a non-MappingNode (value is 3). So since there's a non-MappingNode value for 'a', the merged result should take the last one, so 'a' would be 3. But if all the 'a' keys have MappingNodes (like if the third node's 'a' was a dict), then their 'b' values would be merged. 

So the steps would be:

1. Iterate over all the nodes in the list in order.
2. For each key in each node, check if the current accumulated value for that key is a MappingNode (a dict?), and whether the new node's value for that key is also a MappingNode.
3. If both are MappingNodes, then merge them by combining their keys, and for overlapping keys, do the same recursively.
4. If either is not a MappingNode, then just take the latest value (since the later nodes in the list override earlier ones).
5. The result should be a new node (maybe a dictionary) that combines all these.

Wait, but how do I track the accumulated result? Start with an empty dictionary, and for each node in the nodes list, process its keys into this result. 

The key is to handle each key in the current node and check against the accumulated result's value for that key. So for each key in the current node:

- If the key is not in the result, add it with its value.
- If it is in the result, then check if both existing value and current value are MappingNodes. If so, merge them recursively. Otherwise, replace the existing value with the current one.

But the order matters because we process the nodes in sequence, and the last occurrence of a key that isn't a MappingNode will replace previous ones.

Wait, but the problem says "the last of the values remains" when there's a collision with non-MappingNode. So even if earlier nodes have a MappingNode for a key, if a later node has a non-MappingNode value for the same key, the final value should be that non-MappingNode. So the process is:

For each key in all nodes, the last node's value for that key is the one that takes precedence unless all the previous values (for that key) were MappingNodes, in which case we need to merge them.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to go through each node in the list, and for each key in the node:

- If the key is already in the merged result:
   - Check if the existing value is a MappingNode and the current node's value is also a MappingNode. If both are, then merge them (i.e., combine the two dictionaries, recursively merging their overlapping keys).
   - Else, replace the existing value with the current node's value. Because if either is not a MappingNode, then we can't merge, so the later one stays.
- If the key is not in the merged result, add it with its value.

Wait, but that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. The condition is: if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So merging is only done when all the colliding keys have MappingNode values. Otherwise, the last value is kept.

So the steps would be:

For each key present in any of the nodes, collect all the values from the nodes in order. Then, for that key, decide whether to merge them or just take the last one.

Alternatively, process the nodes in order, and for each key in the current node:

- If the key exists in the merged result and both the existing value and current value are MappingNodes, then perform a deep merge of those two and update the merged result's value for that key.
- Otherwise, replace the merged result's key with the current node's value.

Wait, but this would mean that as soon as a non-MappingNode is encountered for a key, all subsequent values would override the previous ones, but if later nodes have a MappingNode again, they would be merged? Or no, because once you have a non-MappingNode value in the merged result, you can't merge anymore. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to check all the nodes in the list, and for each key, collect all the values, then determine if all of them (except the last one?) are MappingNodes. Or maybe the last value is the one to decide. 

Alternatively, the merging can only proceed if all the values for that key (in all nodes except the last?) are MappingNodes. Wait, no. Let me think of an example. Suppose the nodes are:

node1: {'a': {'b': 1}}, node2: {'a': {'c': 2}}, node3: {'a': 3}

The keys for 'a' in node1 and node2 are MappingNodes, but node3's 'a' is not. So the final value for 'a' should be 3, because the last node's value is non-Mapping. So in that case, the earlier MappingNodes are ignored, and only the last value is taken. 

Another example: nodes are node1: {'a': {'b': 1}}, node2: {'a': {'b': {'c': 2}}}, node3: {'a': {'b': 3}}.

Here, the third node's 'a' value is a dict (if 3 is a MappingNode?), or wait, 'b' is 3. So node3's 'a' is a dict with 'b' as a non-MappingNode (assuming 3 is an integer, which is not a MappingNode). So when merging 'a' from node1 and node2, since their values are both MappingNodes, their 'b' keys can be merged. But when node3 comes along, the current merged 'a' (from node1 and node2) is a dict. But node3's 'a' is a dict where the 'b' key is 3 (a non-MappingNode). So for the 'a' key, since the existing value (from merging node1 and node2) is a MappingNode and node3's 'a' is a MappingNode (since it's a dict), then their 'b' keys would need to be checked. The existing 'b' in the merged 'a' is a MappingNode (from node1 and node2), but node3's 'a' has 'b' as a non-MappingNode (3), so when merging 'a', since the two 'b's have a non-MappingNode in node3's 'a', then the final 'b' would be 3, because the last occurrence in the 'a' values is the non-MappingNode.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to structure the code.

First, I'll assume that a MappingNode is a dictionary (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise). So, the function can check if a value is an instance of a dict to determine if it's a MappingNode. 

The function will need to loop through each node in the nodes list. The initial merged result starts as an empty dictionary. For each node, we'll process each key in that node. 

For each key in the current node:

current_value = node[key]

if the key is already in the merged_result:

existing_value = merged_result[key]

if both existing_value and current_value are dictionaries (i.e., MappingNodes), then we need to deep merge them. So merged_result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing_value, current_value])

Wait, but in the function, the input is a list of nodes. So the deep_merge_nodes function can be called recursively for the values. 

Wait, but the function is supposed to take a list of nodes and merge them. So the base case would be when merging a list of nodes (dictionaries?), the function would perform the merging as described. 

Wait, the function signature is def deep_merge_nodes(nodes): where nodes is a list of nodes. So perhaps each node in the list is a dictionary, and the function returns a merged dictionary. 

Wait, the problem says "nodes" — maybe each node is a dictionary. Let me proceed with that assumption. 

So, the function will take a list of dictionaries and merge them according to the rules. 

The algorithm could be:

Initialize the merged_dict as an empty dict.

For each node in nodes:

   for key in node:

      value = node[key]

      if key is in merged_dict:

          existing_val = merged_dict[key]

          if isinstance(existing_val, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):

              merged_dict[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing_val, value])

          else:

              # At least one is not a dict, so the last value takes over.

              merged_dict[key] = value

      else:

          merged_dict[key] = value

Wait, but that might not work because when processing the nodes in order, for each node, you have to check each key in that node against the merged_dict. 

Wait, the nodes are processed in order, so for each node in the list, for each key in that node, we check if the key is already in the merged_dict. 

If existing value and current value are both dicts, then we need to merge them. 

Otherwise, we just replace the existing value with the current value. 

But in this approach, when merging, the existing value (from the merged_dict) and the current value (from the current node) are the only two being considered. But actually, all previous nodes' values for that key must have been MappingNodes (dictionaries) so that the current one can be merged. 

Wait, no. Suppose there are three nodes:

node1 has key 'a' with a dict, node2 has 'a' with a dict, node3 has 'a' with a non-dict. 

Then, when processing node3, the existing value in merged_dict is a merged dict from node1 and node2. Since node3's value is not a dict, we replace the existing value with node3's value. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Another example: node1 has 'a' as a dict, node2 has 'a' as a non-dict, node3 has 'a' as a dict. 

Processing node1: merged_dict['a'] is the dict. 

Processing node2: key 'a' exists. existing_val is a dict, current value (node2['a']) is not. So merged_dict['a'] becomes node2's value (non-dict). 

Then processing node3's 'a' (a dict), but since existing_val is now non-dict, so we replace with node3's value? Wait no, because the existing value is now non-dict (from node2), so when node3 comes along, since existing_val is non-dict and current value is a dict, then since there's a non-dict in existing, we replace with the current (node3's) value (the dict). But according to the problem statement, if any of the colliding keys have non-MappingNode values, the last remains. 

Wait in the case of node1, node2 (non-dict), node3 (dict):

The key 'a' has values in node1 (dict), node2 (non-dict), node3 (dict). 

The last value is the dict from node3. But according to the problem's rule, if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode (node2's value is non-dict), then the last remains. So the final value would be node3's 'a' (since it's the last one). 

Wait the problem says "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So whenever any of the keys in the list have non-MappingNode values, then the last one is taken. 

So in that example, since node2 has a non-dict value, even though node3's is a dict, the final value is node3's, since it's the last. 

Wait the problem says "colliding keys with non-MappingNode values". So if any of the nodes (in the list) have a non-MappingNode value for the same key, then the last one is kept. 

So in the case of node1's 'a' is a dict, node2's 'a' is a non-dict (like 5), then when processing node2, since existing is a dict and current is non-dict, the new value would be 5. Then, when processing node3's 'a' (a dict), existing is 5 (non-dict), so the new value would replace it with the dict from node3. But that would violate the problem's condition because there was a previous non-dict (node2's value) so the last (node3's) is the one to stay. Wait but node3's value is a dict again. So the problem's condition is that if any of the values (for the same key across nodes) are non-MappingNodes, then the last value is kept. 

So, the key is, for a given key, if in the list of nodes, any of the nodes (before the current one) have a non-dict value for that key, then when we process the current node, if that key is present, we can just replace the existing value with the current one, regardless of whether the current's value is a dict. 

Hmm, so the approach above would work because each time we check whether the existing value and the current value are both dicts. 

Wait, let me see the example again. 

node1: {'a': {'b': 1}}, node2: {'a': 5}, node3: {'a': {'c': 3}}

Processing node1 first: merged_dict['a'] = {'b':1}

Processing node2: key 'a' exists. existing_val is a dict, current value (5) is not. So since either is not a dict, we replace with 5. 

Then processing node3: 'a' is in merged_dict as 5. The current value is a dict. So existing is non-dict, current is a dict. Since there's a non-dict (the 5 from node2), then according to the problem's rule, since there is a non-MappingNode (5), the last value (node3's value is a dict?), but wait, node3's 'a' is a dict. So in this case, the last value is the dict, but the problem says that if any of the colliding keys have non-MappingNode, then the last is kept. 

Wait, in this case, the key 'a' had a non-dict (node2's 5). So when node3 comes along, since the last value is the dict, but the previous nodes had non-dicts, does the last value (node3's) count as the one to stay? 

Hmm, according to the problem statement, the last of the values remains when there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values. 

In this case, the colliding keys have values of different types. The first is a dict, second is non-dict (5), third is a dict again. 

The last value is the third's (a dict), so the result should take that? 

Wait, the problem says "if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains". So if any of the nodes have a non-MappingNode for that key, then the last one (regardless of type) is kept. 

In the example above, since node2's value is non-dict, then when merging all three nodes, the 'a' key would have the last value (node3's value) which is a dict. 

Wait, but the problem says "the last of the values remains" in the case of collisions with non-MappingNode. 

Wait maybe the way to think is: for a given key, if in the list of nodes, any of the nodes (except the last one?) have non-MappingNode values, then the last value is kept. Or perhaps, if any of the nodes before the last have a non-MappingNode value, then the last's value is kept. 

Alternatively, the presence of a non-MappingNode in any of the nodes for the same key makes it so that the last one is taken. 

So, in the example, the first and second nodes have 'a' as a dict and non-dict. So since there was a non-dict (node2), then the last node (node3) is taken, which is a dict. 

Wait but the problem says "if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains". So the colliding keys have non-MappingNode in their values. So if any of the nodes (except the last?) have non-MappingNode, then the last is kept. 

So in that case, the third node's 'a' is a dict, but since there was a previous node with a non-dict, the third's value is kept because it's the last. 

But then in that scenario, the final value is a dict (from node3's 'a'), which is allowed. 

Hmm, so the approach where whenever existing and current are both dicts, we merge, else we replace with current, that would work. Because in the first case, existing is a dict and current is a non-dict, so replace. Then when processing node3's 'a', existing is non-dict (5) and current is a dict. So since existing is not a dict, we replace with the current (the dict). 

Wait that would result in the merged 'a' being a dict again, but according to the problem's rule, since there was a non-dict (node2's 5) in the keys, the last value (node3's dict) is kept. 

But according to the problem's statement, when any of the colliding keys (i.e., any of the nodes except the last?) have non-MappingNode values, then the last is kept. 

Wait, perhaps the problem's condition is that if any of the nodes (in the list) have a non-MappingNode value for that key, then the last one's value is kept. 

So, the presence of at least one non-dict in the nodes for that key causes the last one to be kept, even if the last one is a dict. 

Wait, in that example, the third node's 'a' is a dict, but since there was a non-dict (node2's 'a'), then the last is kept. So the final value would be the third's dict. 

So the algorithm works in that case. 

Another example where all nodes have the key but only the last is a non-dict. 

nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'b': 2}}, {'a': 3} ]

Processing node1: merged has 'a': {'b':1}

Processing node2: existing is dict, current is dict → merge, so merged becomes {'a': {'b': 2} }, wait no, the merge would combine the two dicts. Wait the deep_merge of the two dicts would merge their 'b's. But since they are both dicts, their 'b's would be merged. Wait in this case, the 'b's in each are integers, so when merging the two {'b':1} and {'b':2}, the existing and current are both dicts (each's 'b' is an integer, which is a non-dict?), so when merging the 'b's:

Wait, the existing_val for 'a' is a dict (from node1) and the current node's 'a' is a dict (node2's). So their 'b's are both integers (non-dicts). So when merging the 'a's, the deep_merge would check the 'b's. Since the existing_val for 'b' in the merged 'a' is 1 (non-dict) and node2's 'a' has 'b' as 2 (non-dict), so since they are non-dicts, the last one (2) would be kept. 

So the merged 'a' would be {'b': 2}. 

Then when processing node3, which has 'a' as 3 (non-dict), existing_val is a dict (the merged from node1 and node2's 'a's), so the existing is a dict and current is non-dict. Therefore, since one is a dict and the other is not, the current (3) replaces the existing. 

Thus, the final 'a' is 3, which is correct because there was a non-dict in the third node. 

Okay, so the algorithm seems to work. 

Now, the code. The function is supposed to take a list of nodes (which are dictionaries?), and return the merged result. 

Wait, the function's parameters are nodes, which is a list of nodes. Each node is a dictionary. 

So the code structure would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key in node:
            val = node[key]
            if key in merged:
                existing = merged[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(val, dict):
                    # both are dicts, so merge them recursively
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, val])
                else:
                    # at least one is not a dict, so just take the current val (since we are iterating and this is the current node)
                    merged[key] = val
            else:
                merged[key] = val
    return merged

Wait, but in the recursive call, the existing and val are the existing value and current value, so passing them as a list to deep_merge_nodes. 

Wait, for the case where existing is a dict and val is a dict, then the deep_merge_nodes([existing, val]) would merge those two. 

Wait, but in the example where node1 has {'a': {'b': 1}}, node2 has {'a': {'b':2}}, then merging their 'a' values (both dicts), the result would be {'b': 2}? Because when merging those two dicts, the next step would process the existing (node1's a) and the current (node2's a). The key 'b' is in both, and their values are 1 and 2 (non-dicts). So the merged 'b' would take the last value (2). 

Yes, so the recursive approach would handle that. 

Another test case: nodes = [ {'a': {'b': {'c': 1}} }, {'a': {'b': {'d': 2}} } ]

Merging these two, the 'a' keys are both dicts, so their 'b' keys are merged. The 'b's are also dicts, so their 'c' and 'd' keys are kept, resulting in {'a': {'b': {'c':1, 'd':2}}}.

That's correct. 

So the code should work. 

Wait, but in the loop over the nodes, the function processes each node in order. So for each key in the current node, we check if it's in the merged dict. 

Wait, but the existing value could be a merged result from previous nodes. So the code should correctly handle that. 

Hmm, I think this code should work. Let me see possible edge cases. 

What if a key is present in some nodes but not all? Like nodes = [ {'a': 1}, {'b': 2} ]

Then 'a' is only in the first node, so the merged dict would have 'a':1 and 'b':2. 

Another case where a key is in multiple nodes, but all their values are dicts. 

nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}, {'a': {'b': {'d':3}}} ]

The first two's 'a' are dicts. Merging them gives {'a': {'b':1, 'c':2}}. Then the third node's 'a' is a dict, so existing is that merged dict, and current is the third's a. 

So existing has 'b' as 1 (non-dict?), but the third's a has 'b' as a dict. 

Wait, existing 'a' is a dict, current 'a' is a dict. So their 'b's are merged. 

The existing 'b' in the a's is 1 (non-dict), but the third node's 'a' has 'b' as a dict. 

Wait, so for the 'b' key in the a's:

existing_val is 1 (int), and current_val is {'d':3} (dict). 

So when merging the a's (the existing and the third's a), since their 'b's have one non-dict (the existing is 1, which is not a dict), then the last value (the third's a's 'b' is a dict. Wait, no. Wait the third node's 'a' has 'b' as a dict, but the existing's 'a' had 'b' as 1 (non-dict). 

So in that case, since existing (1) is not a dict, and current (the third's 'a' 'b' is a dict), so the existing and current for the 'b' key in the a's would be 1 and {'d':3}. 

So in the recursive call for merging those two (the existing and the current 'b' value), since existing is 1 (non-dict) and current is a dict, the last value (the current one, which is the dict) would be kept. 

Wait, in the function, the existing is the first node's value (1), and the current is the third's a's 'b' (the dict). 

Wait, the existing is from the existing merged a (the first two a's merged into a dict with b:1, c:2). The third node's a has 'b' as a dict. 

So when merging the existing a (from first two nodes) and the third's a:

for each key in third's a (like 'b'):

existing in the merged a's 'b' is 1 (non-dict), current is {'d':3} (a dict). So in that case, since one is non-dict, the current's value (the dict) would replace the existing 1. 

Wait but according to the problem's condition, if the existing and current for a key are both dicts, then they can be merged. Otherwise, the current value replaces. 

So in the 'b' key in the a's, existing is 1 (non-dict) and current is a dict. So the current (dict) is kept. 

Thus, the merged a's b would be the dict from third's a. 

So the final merged a would be {'b': {'d':3}, 'c':2}. 

Which is correct. 

Hmm, so the code should handle that. 

Another test case: nodes with the same key but some are dicts and others not. 

nodes = [ {'x': 1}, {'x': 2}, {'x': {'y':3}} ]

The first two have non-dicts, so when merging the first two, the last (2) is kept. Then, when processing the third node's 'x', existing is 2 (non-dict), so the third's value (a dict) would replace it. 

Wait, but according to the problem's rule, since there was a non-dict in the first two nodes, the last value (third's, which is a dict) is kept. 

Wait but the third's value is a dict. The problem says that when any of the colliding keys have non-MappingNode (so in this case, the first two have non-dicts), then the last (third's) value is kept. So yes, that's correct. 

Wait but in the code, the third's 'x' is a dict. The existing value (2) is not a dict, so when merging, since existing is non-dict and current is a dict, the code would set merged['x'] to val (the dict), since they are not both dicts. 

Yes, so that's exactly what we want. 

Another case where two nodes have the same key, but one is a dict and the other is a non-dict. 

nodes = [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': 5} ]

The merged result should be 5, because the second node's value is non-dict, so the last one (5) is kept. 

Yes, the code would do that. 

What if the nodes list is empty? Then return an empty dict. 

Okay, so the code seems to handle that. 

Now, the function's parameters are called 'nodes', which is a list. So the function starts with merged as empty, then loops through each node in nodes. 

Wait, but in the recursive call, when merging two dicts (existing and val), we pass them as a list to deep_merge_nodes. 

Wait, in the first step, the function takes a list of nodes (the input nodes), and for each key in each node, the code proceeds. 

So in the recursive case, when merging existing and val (both dicts), the function is called again with a list of those two. 

So the code is correct. 

Wait, but in the first step, the nodes list is passed to the function. The function loops through each node in the list, in order. 

Yes, so the first node is first, then the second, etc. So the order is correct for the "last remains" part. 

Thus, this code should work. 

Wait, but what about if the nodes have other types of structures, like lists? The problem says "non-MappingNode values", so perhaps MappingNode is a specific type. But in the absence of that info, the code assumes that a MappingNode is a dict. 

So the code is okay. 

Now, I have to write the code exactly as per the problem. The function's name is deep_merge_nodes, and the parameters are nodes. 

Wait, in the code, the loop is for each node in nodes, then for each key in node. 

But in the first step, the code starts with merged as empty. 

Wait, but in the case where a key is present in multiple nodes but some are dicts and others are not, the code works as intended. 

So I think that's the code. Let me check again.

Wait, in the code above, when merging existing and val (both dicts), the code calls deep_merge_nodes([existing, val]). 

Yes, because existing is the current value in merged, and val is the current node's value. So merging those two as a list would give the combined dict. 

So that's correct. 

Another possible case: three nodes, each with the same key, and two are dicts and the third is a non-dict. 

nodes = [ {'a': {'b':1}}, {'a': {'c':2}}, {'a': 3} ]

First two's 'a's are merged into {'a': {'b':1, 'c':2}}. Then third node's 'a' is 3. So existing is a dict and current is non-dict. Thus, merged['a'] becomes 3. 

Yes, which is correct. 

I think this code should work. 

Wait, but in the code, the for loop is over nodes. So when you have a list of nodes (dictionaries), you process each one in order, and for each key in the current node, you check whether it's in the merged dict. 

Yes, that's the right approach. 

So the code is as written above. Let me write it properly. 

Wait, in the code, the function is called with nodes as a list. The merged starts as empty. 

Wait, but in the recursive call, when merging two dictionaries, existing and val, the code passes a list containing those two. 

Yes, so the recursion will handle that. 

Now, the code. 

The function's docstring says: merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains. 

So the code should be as follows. 

Wait, but in Python, dictionaries can have other types. So the code checks if the existing value is an instance of a dict and the current value is also a dict. 

Yes. 

So here's the code:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    merged = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key in node:
            val = node[key]
            if key in merged:
                existing = merged[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(val, dict):
                    merged[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, val])
                else:
                    merged[key] = val
            else:
                merged[key] = val
    return merged

Hmm, that's the code. Let me test with an example where all are dicts. 

nodes = [ {'a': {'b':1}}, {'a': {'b': {'c':2}}} ]

Merging these: the 'a' keys are both dicts, so their 'b's are merged. 

The existing for 'a' is the first node's {'b':1}, and the second's is {'b': {'c':2}}.

So when merging those two, for key 'b' in the 'a's:

existing is 1 (int) and val is a dict ( {'c':2} ). 

Since existing is not a dict, the val (the dict) replaces it. 

Thus, the merged 'a' becomes {'b': {'c':2}}.

Wait, but according to the code, the existing (1) and the current (the dict) are not both dicts, so the current value (the dict) is kept. 

Wait, but the problem says that if all the colliding keys have MappingNode values (i.e., are dicts), then merge. Otherwise, last remains. 

In this case, the first 'a' has a 'b' value of 1 (non-dict), and the second 'a' has 'b' as a dict. 

So the key 'a' has values that are both dicts (the 'a' of each is a dict). So the code proceeds to merge them. 

Wait, the existing for 'a' is a dict (from first node), and the current's 'a' is a dict (second node's 'a'). So their 'b's are 1 (non-dict) and the dict. 

So when merging the two 'a's, the code will process their keys. 

The 'b' key is present in both. 

The existing in the first 'a's 'b' is 1 (non-dict), and the current 'b' in the second 'a' is a dict. 

Thus, since one is non-dict, the current value (the dict) is kept. 

So the merged 'b' would be the dict from the second node's 'a', since it's the last value for 'b' in that context. 

Wait, in the recursive call for the 'a' keys:

The existing is the first node's a ( {'b':1} ), and the current is the second node's a ( {'b': {'c':2}} ). 

So when merging those two, the code would loop through each key in those two a's. 

The first a's 'b' is 1, the second's 'b' is a dict. 

So when processing the second a's 'b', existing in the merged (from the first a's 'b') is 1. 

Since existing is not a dict, and the current value is a dict, then the current value (the dict) replaces the existing. 

Thus, the merged 'a' becomes {'b': {'c':2}}. 

Which is correct. 

Another test case where the same key has a mix of dicts and non-dicts in deeper levels. 

Hmm, I think this code should handle that. 

Wait, but what if a node's value is a list? Then it's not a dict, so it would be treated as non-MappingNode. 

The problem probably expects that only dictionaries are considered as MappingNodes. 

Thus, the code should be correct. 

Wait, but in the code, when merging existing and val (both dicts), the code calls deep_merge_nodes with [existing, val]. 

Yes, because existing is the previous value in the merged dict, and val is the current node's value. 

So the function is called recursively on those two, which is correct. 

So I think this is the right code. Let me see if there's any possible mistake. 

Wait, the order in which the nodes are processed is correct. Because for each node in the list, we process its keys, and for each key, we check if it's already in the merged dict. 

So the first node's keys are added, then the second node's keys are processed next, etc. 

Thus, the last occurrence of a key with non-dict values would override previous ones, and only when all are dicts would their values be merged. 

Yes. 

So the code should work. 

I think that's it. Let me write the code as required.
