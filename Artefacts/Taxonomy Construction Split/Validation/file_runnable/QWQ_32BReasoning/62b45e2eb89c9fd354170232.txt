Okay, I need to write a Python function called next_version that takes a version string and returns the next one following the pattern. Hmm, what's the pattern here? Usually version numbers are like "1.2.3", and incrementing would go to "1.2.4", then "1.3.0" if the last part is at 9 or something? Wait, maybe it's simpler. Let me think.

The function should parse the version string, split it into parts, probably by dots. Then increment the last part. But if any part is a zero, maybe there's a different rule? Or maybe it's just a sequence of numbers separated by dots, and each part is an integer. Like "0.0.9" becomes "0.0.10", but that would add another digit. Wait, but versioning usually allows that, right? Like 1.2.9 becomes 1.2.10, which is fine.

So the steps would be: split the version string into parts, convert each to an integer. Then start from the end, increment the last part by 1. If it overflows (like if it was 999 and becomes 1000, making the part longer), then we have to carry over? Wait, no, maybe not. Because version numbers can have parts that are any number, so leading zeros aren't allowed. So for example, "00-99" would not be a valid version part, but the input is given as a valid version, so each part is a number without leading zeros.

So the process is: split into parts, increment the last part. If it's just a single number like "3", then next is "4". If the parts are like "1.2.3", then increment the last part to 4, so "1.2.4". If the last part is 999, then it becomes 1000, so the version would be "1.2.1000" but that's probably not the case. Wait, but the problem says "following existing pattern". Maybe the pattern is that each part is of a certain length? Like if the input is "0.1.0", the next should be "0.1.1", then "0.1.2" etc. So when parts are numbers with leading zeros, maybe the output should preserve the number of digits? Wait, but version numbers usually don't have leading zeros. Like in semantic versioning, 1.0010 would be considered invalid because the numbers can't have leading zeros. So perhaps the input version is in a format where each part is a number, possibly with leading zeros, but the output should follow the same pattern of parts. Like if the input has three parts, the output must also have three parts. So for example, if the input is "1", the next is "2". If it's "0.9.9", then the next would be "0.9.10", but that would make the third part have two digits. But maybe the pattern refers to the number of segments, not their lengths. So the function should split into parts, increment the last part, and if any part overflows (like 999 becomes 1000, making the part longer than before), then that's okay. But the output must have the same number of parts as the input. Wait, no. Let's think of examples. Let's see:

Suppose the input is "1.9.9". The next version would be "1.9.10". Then "1.10.0" after that. Wait, but how do we know when to carry over? Like, maybe the standard way is to increment the last part, and if it overflows (like if it's 999, becomes 1000, but the part's length increases), but the problem might not require that. The problem's description is a bit vague. The docstring says "following existing pattern", so perhaps the pattern is just the number of parts. For example, if the input has 3 parts, the next must also have 3 parts. So in the case where the last part is 9, incrementing gives 10, which is okay even if the part length increases. So the function just splits the version into parts, converts each to integer, increments the last one, and then joins them back with dots. But what if the last part is 999 and becomes 1000, then the number of digits increases but the number of parts stays the same. So that's acceptable.

Wait, but maybe there are cases where all parts are at their maximum. Like "9.9.9" would become "10.0.0"? Because you can't have 9.9.10 as a 3-part version. Wait, no. The problem might require that the next version has the same number of parts. Let me think again. Let's see examples:

Test case 1: "1.2.3" → "1.2.4"

Test case 2: "0.9.9" → "0.9.10" → but that's still three parts.

Another case: "1.2.99" → "1.2.100"

Another case: "1.9.9" → "1.9.10"

What if the last part overflows and becomes longer? That's okay, as long as the number of parts is maintained. So the approach is straightforward.

Another edge case: "1.2.3.4.5" → next would be "1.2.3.4.6"

What about "1.2.3.0"? → "1.2.3.1"

But what if the input is like "1.2.3.9" → "1.2.3.10", which is four parts, so that's okay.

Another case: "255.255.255" → next would be "255.255.256"

So the function should split the version string by dots, convert each part to an integer, then increment the last one, and then format each part as a string. Wait, but when converting back, the parts might have different numbers of digits, but that's allowed. Because the existing pattern is the number of parts, not their individual lengths. So the code steps are:

Split the input version into parts, split by '.'.

Convert each part to integer.

Increment the last part by 1.

Then, check if any part before the last is 999 and becomes 1000? Wait, no, we just increment the last part. The other parts stay the same unless the last part's increment causes a carryover that affects previous parts. Wait, but that's not how version numbers work. For example, in semantic versioning, you increment the patch version, minor, or major. But the problem here seems to be that each part is a number, and you just increment the last part. So there's no carryover unless the last part overflows, but in that case, it's just the same as adding 1. So for example, "1.2.9" → "1.2.10" → "1.2.100" → etc. So no need for cascading increments. Just the last part is increased.

Wait, but what if the version is "0.0.9"? Then the next should be "0.0.10", which is still three parts. So the code is:

version.split('.') gives a list of strings, like ["1", "2", "3"]

convert each to integers: [1,2,3]

increment last element: 3+1=4 → [1,2,4]

then join with dots as strings: "1.2.4".

Yes, that's the straightforward approach. So the code would be:

def next_version(version):

    parts = list(map(int, version.split('.')))

    parts[-1] += 1

    next_ver = '.'.join(map(str, parts))

    return next_ver

Wait, but what if the version has more than three parts? Like "1.0.0.0" → next would be "1.0.0.1". That's correct. So that code should handle any number of parts. Let me test some edge cases.

Test case: "1" → becomes "2".

Test case: "9.9.9" → becomes "9.9.10". Wait, that's three parts. Because 9+1 is 10, so the third part becomes 10. So that's okay.

Another test case: "0.9.1" → "0.9.2".

What about "1234" → "1235".

So this code seems to work. But wait, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Like, in some versioning schemes, you might have to increment the previous part if the current is at 9. But I don't think so. The problem says "following existing pattern", and the examples I can think of don't require that. The existing pattern is probably the number of parts. So this code should be correct. Let me see if there's any other edge case.

What about "0.0.99999"? → next would be "0.0.100000", which is correct.

So I think that's the solution. Just split into parts, increment the last, then join again. So the code is as above.
