Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_nodeinfo_well_known_document based on the provided docstring. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary including information like the url and document_path. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

Hmm, the function takes a url and an optional document_path. The returned dictionary should have those details. Maybe the function is supposed to fetch the .well-known/nodeinfo document from a given URL? Wait, the problem doesn't mention fetching, just returning a formatted dict. The docstring isn't very detailed, but the example probably expects the function to construct a document path if it's not provided. Oh right, in NodeInfo specifications, the well-known document points to a nodeinfo endpoint, like /.well-known/nodeinfo. But maybe the function is supposed to take the base URL and the document path, then combine them?

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to create a structure that represents the NodeInfo well-known document. The standard requires that the well-known document contains links to the nodeinfo versions. For example, if the url is 'https://example.com', and document_path is something like '/.well-known/nodeinfo', then the function might return a dict with the 'links' key pointing to the various versions. But the docstring is a bit vague. The user's example shows that the output should be a dictionary including the url and document_path. Maybe the function just constructs a dictionary with those as keys, but perhaps more details?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the provided URL and the document_path, formatted in a specific way. Let's see the parameters: url is required, document_path is optional. So if document_path is not given, maybe the function uses a default path like '/.well-known/nodeinfo'. Wait, but the problem says "including information such as url and document_path." So perhaps the output dictionary has keys like 'url' and 'document_path', with the values being the inputs. But that seems too simple. Or maybe it's part of building the actual nodeinfo document structure, like the links to the available versions?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to make a request to the given URL's well-known nodeinfo path and parse the response. But the problem states "returns a formatted dictionary" without mentioning network operations. Since the user didn't specify that, perhaps the function just constructs a dictionary with the parameters provided. Let me check the docstring again. It says "returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path." So the function probably takes those parameters and returns a dict containing them. But what's the exact structure?

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return the .well-known/nodeinfo document's content. For example, when a server is queried at https://example.com/.well-known/nodeinfo, it returns a JSON with links to the actual nodeinfo data. The standard format for that is something like:

{
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0",
      "href": "/nodeinfo/2.0"
    }
  ]
}

So maybe the function constructs that structure. The parameters would be the base URL and the document_path, which could be the href. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the base URL and generate the full nodeinfo endpoint URL by combining it with the document_path. If document_path isn't provided, maybe it's a default. But the function's name suggests it's about the well-known document itself. Let me think again.

The problem's instruction says to generate code based on the signature and the docstring. The docstring mentions the return includes 'url' and 'document_path' as information. So perhaps the function simply creates a dictionary with those keys. But that's trivial. Like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path if document_path else '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    }

But the docstring says "formatted dictionary, including information such as..." so maybe the keys are more specific. The NodeInfo well-known document has a specific structure. Let me recall the NodeInfo specs. The .well-known/nodeinfo document is a JSON file with a "links" array containing objects with "rel" and "href". The href is the full URL of the nodeinfo endpoint. So perhaps the function constructs that. The parameters might be the base URL, and the document_path (maybe pointing to the specific version's endpoint). Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to generate the structure of the well-known document. For example, given the base URL and the document_path (like '/nodeinfo/2.0'), then the href would be the combination of the URL and the path. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the url and the document_path, along with other standard fields. The standard requires that the well-known document must have a version link. For example, the base URL is 'https://example.com', and the document_path is '/.well-known/nodeinfo', then the href would be that path. Wait, no. The well-known document's href is pointing to the actual nodeinfo data endpoint, which might be a different path. So maybe the function is supposed to build the links array. Let's see an example. Suppose the document_path is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint (like '/nodeinfo/2.1'), then the function would generate the links array with that. The base URL would be the server's base, so combining them to form the href.

Wait, the well-known nodeinfo document's href is the full URL. So the function's parameters are the base URL and the path to the nodeinfo endpoint. Then the document would be a dict like:

{
    "links": [
        {"rel": "http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0", "href": "https://example.com/path/to/2.0"}
    ]
}

But how would the parameters fit into that? The document_path might be the path to the nodeinfo endpoint, so the href would be the base url plus the document_path. So the function might create a dictionary with a 'links' array, each element having the 'rel' as the version and 'href' as the full URL. But where do the versions come from? The problem's function doesn't mention versions as parameters, so maybe it's fixed?

Alternatively, maybe the function is just returning a dict with the given parameters as keys. Let me read the problem again. The user says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". The docstring says "returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path". So the dictionary must include at least those two. But the function's parameters are url and document_path (optional). So if document_path is not provided, maybe it's set to a default? Like, the function would return a dict with 'url' pointing to the given URL, and 'document_path' as the provided path or a default. But that seems too simple for a function called get_nodeinfo_well_known_document. Perhaps the function is supposed to form the full URL of the well-known document by combining the given url and the document_path. For instance, if the document_path is None, then it appends '/.well-known/nodeinfo' to the URL. But the return is a dictionary with that info.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to create the actual structure of the nodeinfo well-known document. For example, the standard requires that the .well-known document contains links to the nodeinfo endpoints. So the function would need to construct a dictionary with 'links' pointing to those endpoints. The 'url' parameter would be the base URL of the server, and 'document_path' would be the path to the nodeinfo endpoint. So the href would be the base URL plus the document_path. But since the document_path is optional, maybe it's a default path?

Wait, perhaps the function's purpose is to return the .well-known/nodeinfo document's content. The standard says that the document should look like:

{
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0",
      "href": "https://nodeinfo.example.com/nodeinfo/2.0",
      "type": "application/json"
    }
  ]
}

So the function might generate such a structure. The 'url' parameter would be the server's base URL. The document_path would be the path to the nodeinfo endpoint (e.g., '/nodeinfo/2.0'), so the href is url + document_path. But if document_path is not provided, maybe it's a default, or perhaps the function requires it and raises an error? The problem's function signature says document_path is optional, so perhaps the function uses the given path if provided, else uses a default?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with 'url' as the full well-known document URL (the base URL plus '/.well-known/nodeinfo') and 'document_path' as the path. So the code would be something like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': url + document_path,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

Wait, but that might not be correct because combining the URL (which could already end with a slash) and the path (starting with a slash) would create a double slash. So maybe the function should handle that? Like using urljoin from urllib.parse?

Alternatively, perhaps the function just constructs a dictionary with the given parameters as values. So the returned dict has 'url' as the input url, and 'document_path' as the input or a default. But the problem's docstring says "including information such as url and document_path", which suggests that the dict contains more than just those two keys. Maybe the function is supposed to return a structure that's compliant with the NodeInfo well-known document. Let me check the specs again.

According to the NodeInfo specs, the well-known document is a JSON file located at /.well-known/nodeinfo, which contains links to the actual nodeinfo endpoints. The structure is:

{
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0",
            "href": "https://example.com/nodeinfo/2.0"
        },
        ...
    ]
}

So the function's purpose might be to generate such a links array. But then, the parameters would need to include the versions and their corresponding paths. However, the given function signature only has url and document_path. Maybe the document_path is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint (like '/nodeinfo/2.0'), and the function constructs the href as the base URL plus the document_path. The returned dict would have the links array with the given path. But how does the 'url' parameter play into this?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the URL of the well-known document and the path. For example, the well-known document's URL is the base URL plus '/.well-known/nodeinfo', and the 'document_path' is the path to the actual nodeinfo data. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the function is simply supposed to create a dictionary that holds the provided parameters. The docstring says "including information such as url and document_path". So maybe the function returns a dictionary with keys like 'url' and 'document_path', along with other required fields. But the problem's example is unclear. Let me think of the simplest possible code that matches the docstring.

The docstring says the return includes the url and document_path. So the function can return a dict with those keys. If document_path is not provided, perhaps it's set to a default. So the code could be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path or '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    }

Wait, but that would set document_path to the default if it's None. However, the function's name is get_nodeinfo_well_known_document, which suggests that it's the document's content. So maybe it's returning a structure that is the actual nodeinfo well-known document. In that case, the links would need to be generated. Let's think again.

Suppose the function is meant to return the structure of the .well-known/nodeinfo document. The parameters are the base URL of the server (url) and the document_path which is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint (like '/nodeinfo/2.0'). Then, the href would be the combination of the url and document_path, but ensuring that there are no duplicate slashes. So using urllib.parse.urljoin would be better. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the 'url' as the base URL and 'document_path' as the path, along with other standard fields. The problem's docstring is very brief, so perhaps the function just returns a dictionary with those two parameters as keys. Let me see the example given in the problem. The user's instruction says to output the code in markdown format, but the function's code. The /think part is for me to think through.

Wait, the user's function is supposed to return a formatted dictionary. The function's parameters are the base URL and the path. The well-known document's path is typically '/.well-known/nodeinfo', so perhaps the function's purpose is to construct that. But if the document_path is provided, it's used instead. Or maybe the function is building the links array with a default version. Let's see: perhaps the function is supposed to return a dict with a "links" list that has the href as the base URL plus the document_path, and a default rel value. But the problem's function signature doesn't include the version as a parameter. So maybe it's hard-coded.

Alternatively, maybe the function is just returning a dictionary with the given parameters. For example, the function is a helper that takes the URL and path and returns a dict with those two. Let's look at the docstring again. It says "including information such as url and document_path". So the returned dict must have at least those two keys, but maybe more. The problem's example may expect that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the actual content of the nodeinfo well-known document, but that requires knowing the versions supported, which aren't provided in the parameters. Since the parameters don't include that, maybe the function just returns a basic structure with the provided path. Let me think of a possible structure.

Suppose the function's purpose is to return a dictionary that represents the .well-known/nodeinfo document. The 'url' parameter is the server's base URL, and the 'document_path' is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint. Then, the href would be the combination of the two. So the function would create a "links" array. But since the versions aren't given, maybe the function just constructs a minimal example, like a links array with one entry. But without knowing the version, how?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the URL and document_path as keys, along with other standard fields. But since the docstring is vague, the code must be simple. The minimal approach would be to return a dictionary with the two parameters. So:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path if document_path is not None else "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    }

Wait, but the 'document_path' parameter is optional. So if it's not provided, the function would set it to the default. However, in the NodeInfo standard, the .well-known document's path is fixed, so perhaps the function's document_path is the path to the actual nodeinfo data (like '/nodeinfo/2.0'), and the function constructs the well-known document's content. For example, the well-known document would have a "links" array with entries for each version, but in this case, maybe just one version is provided via the document_path. The function would then generate the links array with the href being the base URL plus the document_path. So the returned dict would be:

{
    "links": [
        {
            "rel": "http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0",  # but how to get the version?
            "href": "https://example.com/some/path"
        }
    ]
}

But since the version isn't passed in, perhaps the function can't do that. So maybe the function is not supposed to include the actual links, but just the parameters. Alternatively, maybe the 'document_path' is the path to the .well-known document itself, and the function constructs the full URL. For example, the .well-known document's URL is the base URL plus '/.well-known/nodeinfo', but if document_path is provided, maybe it's added instead. So the function would return a dict with 'url' being the combined URL, and 'document_path' as the parameter. But that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the URL of the well-known document and the path as part of the data. Wait, the function's name is get_nodeinfo_well_known_document, so maybe it's returning the content of that document, which includes links to the actual nodeinfo endpoints. But without knowing the versions, how can it do that?

Hmm. The problem's instructions are to generate code based on the given signature and the docstring. The docstring says the returned dict includes info like url and document_path. So perhaps the function is just returning a dictionary with those two keys. The 'document_path' is optional, so if it's None, maybe it's set to a default, like '/.well-known/nodeinfo'. Wait, but that's the path where the well-known document is located, not the path to the nodeinfo endpoint. Or maybe the function is combining them into the full URL for the well-known document. For example, the full URL would be the base url plus the document_path. So the code could be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    return {
        "url": f"{url}{document_path}",
        "document_path": document_path
    }

Wait, but that would create the URL by appending the path, but if the base URL already has a trailing slash, then combining with a leading slash would result in a double slash. To avoid that, maybe use urljoin from urllib.parse. So:

from urllib.parse import urljoin

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    full_url = urljoin(url, document_path)
    return {
        "url": full_url,
        "document_path": document_path
    }

But that's more involved. But the docstring doesn't specify that the URL needs to be properly formed. Maybe the problem expects that. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the parameters as part of the structure. Like, the well-known document's content requires a "links" array. But since the parameters don't include the version, maybe it's not possible, so the function just returns a dict with those two keys.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the well-known document's structure. Since the document_path is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint (like '/nodeinfo/2.0'), then the href would be the base URL plus that path. So the links array would have an entry with the href as the combination. But then the 'rel' would be the version's namespace, which isn't provided as a parameter. So perhaps the function is hardcoding a version. But that's not clear from the problem's description.

Alternatively, maybe the function is just supposed to return a dictionary with the two parameters. The docstring says "such as", implying that there are other possible pieces of information, but without more details, the minimal approach is to include those two. Let me see the function's parameters again. The first is 'url', the second is 'document_path' which is optional. The return must be a dict with at least those two. So the code could be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path
    }

Wait, but then document_path could be None, which the doc says includes the information. So perhaps if document_path is not provided, it uses a default. So:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But the problem's docstring says "including information such as...", so maybe the function returns a structure that's the actual nodeinfo well-known document. Let me think again. The standard document has a "links" array. So perhaps the function is supposed to return that structure. The 'url' parameter would be the server's base, and document_path is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint. So the href is the combination. The rel would be the version's namespace. But since the version isn't passed, maybe the function uses a default version. Or perhaps the document_path is the path to the well-known document itself, which is usually fixed. Wait, the well-known document is located at /.well-known/nodeinfo. So the document_path parameter might not be necessary for that, but perhaps it's for the path to the actual nodeinfo data.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is to return the well-known document's content. For instance, the function would return a dictionary with a "links" array, where each entry has a 'rel' and 'href' pointing to the nodeinfo endpoints. The 'rel' is the version's namespace, but since the parameters don't include that, maybe the function is just creating a minimal example with one link. The 'document_path' would be the path to the endpoint. So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/nodeinfo/2.0'  # but maybe the default is the .well-known path?
    return {
        'links': [{
            'rel': 'http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0',
            'href': f'{url}{document_path}'
        }]
    }

Wait, but that's making assumptions about the version. The problem's docstring doesn't specify that. So perhaps the function's purpose is different.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the url and document_path as keys. For example, the 'url' would be the base URL, and the 'document_path' is the path to the nodeinfo well-known document (which is typically '/.well-known/nodeinfo'). But in that case, the document_path parameter would be optional, defaulting to that path. So the function would return:

{
    'url': url,
    'document_path': document_path or '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
}

But that's a simple dictionary. The problem's example might expect that. The docstring says "formatted dictionary", so maybe it's just that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is returning the well-known document's path when given the URL. Like, the document's URL is the combination of the two, but the function returns a dict with the url and the path. The minimal code would then be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path if document_path is not None else '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    }

Wait, but that's exactly what I thought earlier. Since the parameters are the URL and the path (optional), the function constructs a dictionary with those two keys, using the default path if it's not provided. That seems plausible. The problem's docstring says "such as" so there might be other keys, but without more info, this is the simplest.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the full URL of the well-known document. So the 'document_path' is the path to the .well-known document. So the default would be '/.well-known/nodeinfo', and the function combines them. So:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'well_known_url': f'{url.rstrip("/")}{document_path.lstrip("/")}',
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

Wait, but that's adding more keys. The docstring only mentions "such as" so maybe that's not necessary. Let me go back to the problem's exact wording. The function returns a formatted dictionary including information such as the url and document_path. So the minimal solution is to have a dictionary with those two keys, where document_path is set to a default if not provided. So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path if document_path else "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    }

Wait, but in Python, using "if document_path" would check if it's truthy. So if someone passes an empty string, that would be considered as False. Maybe better to use "if document_path is not None". Because the default is when it's None. So:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path if document_path is not None else "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    }

That's better. Because the parameter is optional, and if not provided, it uses the default path. The returned dict includes those two keys, which is what the docstring says. So that's probably what the problem expects. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the full URL of the well-known document. For example, combining the base URL and the document_path (which defaults to the standard path). So the 'url' in the returned dict would be the full URL, and maybe 'document_path' is the path part. But then the parameters' 'url' might be the base, and the function constructs the full URL.

Like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': f'{url}{document_path}',
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But that would combine the two. However, this might be better. The problem says "including information such as url and document_path". So the 'url' in the dict would be the full URL of the well-known document, and the 'document_path' is the path used. The input 'url' could be the base URL (like 'https://example.com') and document_path is the path (like '/.well-known/nodeinfo'). But perhaps the user expects that the document_path is optional, so if not given, the function uses the standard path and constructs the full URL.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a structure that's the actual nodeinfo well-known document's content, which requires the links array. But without knowing the versions, that's not possible. Since the parameters don't include that info, perhaps the function can't do that. So going back, the minimal approach is to create a dictionary with the two parameters, using the default for document_path when it's not provided.

Wait, the function's name is get_nodeinfo_well_known_document. The NodeInfo well-known document's content is the links array. So perhaps the function is returning that structure. Let me check the standard again. The .well-known/nodeinfo file contains a JSON like:

{
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0",
      "href": "https://example.com/nodeinfo/2.0"
    }
  ]
}

In that case, the 'url' parameter would be the base of the server, and 'document_path' is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint (like '/nodeinfo/2.0'). So the href is the combination of the two. So the function would return a dictionary with a 'links' array, each entry having 'rel' and 'href'. But the 'rel' is the version's namespace, which isn't provided in the parameters. Therefore, maybe the function is not supposed to construct the links array but just return the parameters in a dict.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the well-known document's URL (the .well-known/nodeinfo path) as part of the dict. So the 'url' would be the base URL plus '/.well-known/nodeinfo', and the 'document_path' would be that same path. But then why have the document_path as a parameter?

Hmm, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the parameters as the keys, but formatted properly. Like, the document_path is an optional parameter that's part of the returned dict. So the function simply returns a dict with 'url' and 'document_path', with the latter defaulting to the standard path.

Alternatively, maybe the function is returning the well-known document's content. Let's see. The 'url' here is the base URL, and the 'document_path' is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint. The function would then create the links array with href being the base URL + document_path. The 'rel' would need to be the version's namespace, but since that's not a parameter, perhaps it's hard-coded. For example, assuming version 2.0:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/nodeinfo/2.0'
    return {
        'links': [{
            'rel': 'http://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0',
            'href': f'{url.rstrip("/")}{document_path}'
        }]
    }

But the problem's docstring mentions including the 'url' and 'document_path' in the returned dict. So perhaps the links array isn't needed, and the function just returns a dict with those two keys. That's more likely given the sparse docstring.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the url of the well-known document (base_url + '/.well-known/nodeinfo') and the document_path is the path to that. So:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': f'{url}{document_path}',
        'document_path': document_path
    }

This way, the function constructs the full URL of the well-known document and includes both the base and the path. But the problem says the function returns a dict including those pieces of information. The 'document_path' parameter might be an alternative path, so the function uses it if provided. The default is the standard path. So this could be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'document_path' is the path to the nodeinfo endpoint, and the function returns the links array. But without the version, maybe it's not possible. The problem's docstring isn't clear, so perhaps the minimal approach is the best here.

The user's example shows the function's code in markdown, so I should output that. Let me try to think of the most straightforward code that matches the given signature and the docstring. The docstring says the dict includes the url and document_path. So the function can return a dictionary with those two keys. If document_path is not provided, it uses a default. So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path or "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    }

Wait, but in Python, using "or" would check if document_path is falsy. So if someone passes an empty string, that would be considered falsy. But the parameter is optional, so the default is when it's None. So better to use an if statement. Like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path
    }

This way, only when document_path is None, it sets the default. So the returned dict has both keys, with the path set to the default if needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary with more structure, like the links array. But without more info, I'll stick to the minimal solution. Let's see the possible outputs. The user's example might require that the document_path is combined with the URL. So maybe the function returns a dict with the full URL as 'url' and the path as 'document_path'. Like:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': f'{url}{document_path}',
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But this would combine the two. Let me think of the parameters. The 'url' might be the base, and the 'document_path' is the path to add. For example, if the user provides the base URL and a different document path, the function constructs the full URL and includes both in the dict. That makes sense. So the code would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the well-known document's path as the document_path, and the 'url' is the base. But then the user would have to combine them themselves. The problem says "formatted", so maybe combining is part of it.

In the absence of more information, I'll proceed with the code that constructs the full URL by combining the base URL and document_path (defaulting to the standard path if not provided), and returns a dictionary with 'url' and 'document_path' keys. That would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': f'{url.rstrip("/")}{document_path.lstrip("/")}',
        'document_path': document_path
    }

Wait, but the URL might have a trailing slash, and the document_path a leading one, leading to double slashes. Using rstrip and lstrip would handle that. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, just append them. The problem might not care about the URL formatting, but if it does, using urljoin would be better. Like:

from urllib.parse import urljoin

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    full_url = urljoin(url, document_path)
    return {
        'url': full_url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

That's probably the right way to handle the URL combination. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention the full URL, just that the returned dict includes the url and document_path. So maybe the 'url' in the dict is the base URL, and 'document_path' is the path. Or perhaps the function's return includes the full URL as part of the formatted document. The problem's instructions say to output only the code, so I have to choose.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a dictionary with the parameters as is, but the 'document_path' is optional. So:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

But then if document_path is not given, it would be None. The docstring says "including information such as...", so maybe it's okay to have it as None. Alternatively, the default is needed. Since the well-known document is at a standard path, perhaps the function requires that the document_path is provided, but since it's optional, maybe the function just returns a dict with the given parameters, but document_path defaults to the standard path. So the first approach where document_path is set to default when None is better.

So putting it all together:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    return {
        "url": url,
        "document_path": document_path or "/.well-known/nodeinfo"
    }

Wait, but using "or" here: if document_path is an empty string, then it would use the default. But according to the function's definition, document_path is optional with default None. So the correct way is to check if it's None. So:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {
        'url': url,
        'document_path': document_path
    }

Yes, that's better. So the function checks if document_path is None, sets it to the default, then returns the two in a dictionary. That seems to fit the docstring's description. I think that's what the problem expects. So the code would be as above. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The function is supposed to return a formatted dictionary, so maybe the keys are properly named. The example in the problem's docstring uses "such as", so the two keys are part of it, but there might be more. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll stick with the two keys.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to return the well-known document's content, which is a links array. So the function would need to construct that. The 'document_path' parameter might be the path to the nodeinfo endpoint (like '/nodeinfo/2.0'), so the href would be the base URL plus document_path. The rel is the version's namespace. Since the version isn't a parameter, perhaps it's fixed. But that's making assumptions. Since the problem's instructions are to only output the code without explanations, perhaps the correct approach is to return a dict with the parameters as keys, using default for document_path.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary that includes the 'url' as the base URL and the 'document_path' as the path, along with the full URL. But the problem's docstring is vague. Let's see the exact wording: "Returns a formatted dictionary, including information such as url and document_path." So the dictionary must at least have those two pieces of information. The minimal code would be as above.

Therefore, I'll write the function that constructs the document_path to default to '/.well-known/nodeinfo' if None, then returns a dict with both parameters as keys. So the code would be:

def get_nodeinfo_well_known_document(url, document_path=None):
    if document_path is None:
        document_path = '/.well-known/nodeinfo'
    return {'url': url, 'document_path': document_path}

Wait, but maybe the 'document_path' is the path to the actual nodeinfo document. So the function returns a dictionary with those two keys. That seems to fit. Alright, that's probably the correct code here. Let me check again. The function's name suggests it's about getting the well-known document's structure. So perhaps the 'document_path' is part of the URL. But without more details, the minimal solution is better.
