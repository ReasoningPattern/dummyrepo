Okay, I need to write a Python function called parse_arguments that takes a variable number of unparsed arguments and returns them as a dictionary. The docstring says it parses parameters and maps them into a dict. Hmm, so the input is a list of arguments, probably in the form of key-value pairs, and the function should convert those into a dictionary where each key is mapped to its corresponding value.

Wait, the function uses *unparsed_arguments, which means it's gathering all the arguments into a tuple. So the input is a bunch of arguments passed to the function. But how are these arguments structured? Like, are they key-value pairs separated by spaces? Or maybe each argument is a string in the form of "key=value"?

Oh right, in command-line arguments, parameters are often passed as key-value pairs, such as "--key value". But the function's parameters are given as *unparsed_arguments, so maybe each argument is a separate element. Like if the user runs the script with "python script.py --name John --age 30", then *unparsed_arguments would be ('--name', 'John', '--age', '30'). So the function needs to process those into a dictionary where keys are the options (without the --) and values are the next arguments, but only if they are not options themselves.

Alternatively, maybe the arguments are given as a list where each key-value pair is adjacent, like ["key1", "value1", "key2", "value2"], so the function needs to pair them up. But how do I handle cases where there are an odd number of elements? Maybe that's an error, but the problem doesn't mention that. So perhaps I can assume that all arguments come in pairs.

Wait, the function's name is parse_arguments, and the parameters are given as *unparsed_arguments, so the function is expecting to receive the arguments as separate elements. So for example, if someone calls parse_arguments('--name', 'John', '--age', '30'), then the arguments are in a tuple like ('--name', 'John', '--age', '30'). The goal is to create a dictionary where the keys are the options (without the leading dashes) and the values are the next elements. But how to handle that?

First, I need to loop through the unparsed_arguments. Each option starts with a '-', but maybe the key is the part after --, like splitting on '='? Wait, perhaps the arguments are in the form of "key=value" strings. Like each argument is a string with an equals sign. So for example, if the input is "--name=John", then the key is "name" and the value is "John". But if the arguments are given as separate entries like "--name", "John", then the approach is different.

The problem's description isn't very clear. Let me think about common scenarios. In Python, when using argparse, options can be specified either as "--key value" or "--key=value". The function here might need to handle both cases. But since the function is called parse_arguments with *unparsed_arguments, maybe the input is already split into individual elements. So the function should process them as a list of strings where each key is followed by its value, unless the key includes an equals sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the arguments are given as a list where each key-value pair is separated by a space, so the function has to pair them. So the first element is a key (like starting with --), then the next is the value. But how to distinguish between keys and values? Like, if an argument starts with '--', then it's a key, and the next argument is the value. But if the next argument also starts with '--', that would be a problem. So perhaps the function should iterate through the list, and whenever it encounters an argument starting with '--', it takes the next argument as the value, unless the current argument has an equals sign. For example, "--key=value" would split into key and value directly, so the next argument isn't part of that.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to process arguments that are in the form of "key=value" strings, so each argument is a single string with an equals sign. So like if the input is "--name John --age 30", that's two separate arguments (without the equals), but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the arguments are all in the "key=value" format. Let me think of possible scenarios.

Let me consider the function's parameters: *unparsed_arguments. That means when the function is called, the arguments are passed as individual elements. So for example, if you have a command line like "my_script.py --name John --age 30", then the sys.argv would have the script name and the rest. But here, the function is receiving the arguments as separate items, like the user is passing them as separate strings. So the function's input is a list of these arguments. The function needs to parse each of them into key-value pairs.

So the first thing is to loop through each argument in the unparsed_arguments. For each argument, check if it starts with '--' or '-'. Maybe short options like '-n' are also allowed? The problem's docstring is brief, so perhaps the simplest approach is to assume that each argument starts with '--' followed by the key, and the next argument is the value. Unless the argument itself contains an '=', in which case the key and value are split from that argument.

So here's a possible plan: the function initializes an empty dictionary. Then iterates over the arguments. For each argument, if it starts with '--', then split on '='. If there's an '=', then the key is the part before, the value is the part after. If there's no '=', then the next argument (if exists) is the value. But we have to be careful with the index, not to go out of bounds.

Wait, but that could be tricky because if the next argument is another '--' option, then that's a problem. So the function might need to handle that. But the problem's docstring doesn't specify error handling. So perhaps the function just assumes that each option is either a standalone key (without =) followed by a value, or a key=value in one argument.

Alternatively, maybe the arguments are in the form of key=value pairs, each as a single string, so each element in the arguments list is a key=value pair. In that case, the function can split each argument on '=', and add to the dictionary. But the problem mentions "parameters" which might be in the form of --key value pairs. So perhaps the function needs to process both cases.

Hmm, but the problem's description is minimal. Let's see. The function's name is parse_arguments, and it returns a dict that maps parameters. The docstring is brief, so maybe the simplest approach is to split each argument on '=' and use the first part as key, second as value. But that would require each argument to be a key=value string. For example, if the input is "--name=John", then splitting on '=' gives ["--name", "John"], so the key is "name" (without the '--') and the value is "John".

Alternatively, if the arguments are like "--name", "John", then the first is the key (without the --), and the next is the value. So the function has to loop through the arguments and pair them. But in that case, we have to track whether the current argument is a key or a value. So maybe the function will process the arguments in pairs, but check if the current argument is a key (starts with --) and then split accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the function should loop through the arguments, and for each argument that starts with '--', split into key and value. If there is an '=', then split that argument into key and value. If there is no '=', then the next argument is the value, and we can proceed. But in that case, the loop needs to track the index and not go out of bounds.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the arguments are ['--name', 'John', '--age', '30'], then the dictionary would be {'name': 'John', 'age': '30'}. Another example: ['--email=john@example.com', '--country=US'] would split each into key and value by splitting on '=', so the keys would be 'email' and 'country', values as the strings after '='.

So the approach would be:

Initialize an empty dict.

Loop over each argument in the unparsed_arguments:

- If the argument starts with '--', split on '='. If there is an '=', then key is the part before, value is after. Remove the '--' from the key.

- If there is no '=', then the key is the part after '--', and the next argument (if exists) is the value. Then we need to move to the next index.

Wait, but in that case, the loop would have to handle the next element. So maybe we need to loop through the arguments with an index, so that when we find a key without '=', we can take the next element as value and then increment the index by 2.

Alternatively, we can process the arguments in pairs, but that might not work if some keys are given with = and others without.

Hmm, perhaps the better approach is to iterate through the arguments, and whenever we encounter an argument that starts with '--', we process it as a key. Then, if there is an '=', split into key and value. If not, then the next argument is the value (unless it's another '--', which would be an error, but maybe we can ignore that for now).

So here's the plan:

Initialize the dictionary.

Create an iterator over the unparsed_arguments.

Loop over the elements:

- Take an element from the iterator.

- If it starts with '--', then split into parts. Let's say current_arg is like "--key=value", then split into parts = current_arg.split('=', 1) (split once to handle cases where the value has =). The key is parts[0][2:], and the value is parts[1] if there's a split, else the next element from the iterator.

Wait, but using split on '=', so if the argument is "--key value", that's two separate elements in the list. So for example, the list would have "--key", "value".

Alternatively, the function's input could be a list where each option is either a key starting with -- followed by a value, or a single key=value.

So the code would need to handle both cases.

Let me think step by step.

First, create a dictionary to store the results.

Then, iterate through the arguments. Let's use an index approach.

Initialize index to 0.

While index < len(unparsed_arguments):

    current_arg = unparsed_arguments[index]

    if current_arg starts with '--' or '-':

        # it's a key. process it.

        if '=' in current_arg:

            # split into key and value here.

            parts = current_arg.split('=', 1)

            key_part = parts[0]

            key = key_part.lstrip('-')

            value = parts[1]

            add to the dict: key -> value

            index += 1

        else:

            # the key is current_arg (without --), and the next element is the value.

            key = current_arg.lstrip('-')

            if index + 1 >= len(unparsed_arguments):

                # no value provided, perhaps raise an error, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe just skip?

                # but the problem says to parse the parameters, so maybe we can assume that each key has a value.

                # or perhaps set the value to None or True (like a flag), but the docstring doesn't mention that.

                # For simplicity, let's assume that the next argument exists.

                # So in this case, if there's no next element, perhaps the function just ignores it?

                # But the problem may require that all keys have a value. Hmm.

                # Well, given the problem's lack of specifics, perhaps proceed under the assumption that each key is followed by a value.

            else:

                value = unparsed_arguments[index + 1]

                add to dict: key -> value

                index += 2

    else:

        # it's not a key, so perhaps ignore it or treat as a positional argument? But the function's docstring says to parse parameters, which are probably the key-value pairs. So maybe we can skip non-key arguments.

        index +=1

Wait, but this approach would have to handle the case where the next element is another key. Like, if the arguments are ['--name', '--John', ...], then that's invalid, but perhaps the code just takes the next element as the value regardless.

Alternatively, maybe the non-key elements should be considered as values for the previous key. But that would be a problem. So the code may assume that all keys are properly followed by their values, and that any non-key elements are part of the values.

Hmm. Let me try to code this step by step.

Start with:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    result = {}
    index = 0
    while index < len(unparsed_arguments):
        arg = unparsed_arguments[index]
        if arg.startswith('--'):
            # process this as a key
            # split into key and value if possible
            if '=' in arg:
                key_part, value = arg.split('=', 1)
                key = key_part.lstrip('-')
                result[key] = value
                index +=1
            else:
                # the key is arg without --, and the next arg is the value
                key = arg.lstrip('-')
                # check if there's a next argument
                if index +1 >= len(unparsed_arguments):
                    # no value provided. Maybe skip this key? Or raise an error?
                    # The problem says to parse parameters, so perhaps we can't proceed. But since the function's doc doesn't specify error handling, maybe we just ignore this key and continue?

                    # Alternatively, maybe the next argument is not a key, so we can proceed.

                    # But in this case, the next argument is needed. So if there's none, perhaps it's an error, but since the problem doesn't mention it, perhaps just skip?

                    # Let's assume that each key must have a value. So if there's no next argument, we can't process it. So perhaps we just skip.

                    # So maybe in this case, we can't add the key to the dict, so we just increment index by 1 and continue?

                    # Or perhaps the key is present but has no value? Like a boolean flag, but the problem's doc says parameters, so maybe it's expecting a value.

                    # Since the problem is vague, perhaps proceed with the code that requires a next argument.

                else:
                    value = unparsed_arguments[index +1]
                    result[key] = value
                    index +=2
        else:
            # this is a positional argument, not part of parameters. So ignore it?
            # the function's doc says to parse parameters, so maybe only process those with --, and others are skipped.

            index +=1

    return result

Wait, but what about if the next argument is also a --? Like if the input is ['--name', '--John'], then this would take 'name' as the key, and the next argument is '--John', which is not a value. But the code would proceed to add 'name' -> '--John'? That's possible. But maybe the user intended that, so perhaps the code doesn't check and just proceeds.

Alternatively, maybe we should check whether the next argument is a key. But that complicates things. Since the problem's requirements aren't clear, perhaps the code is written to assume that every --key is followed by a value, except when the key is given with =.

So in the code above, if the argument is like '--name', then the next argument is taken as the value, but if the next argument starts with '--', then it's considered a value, even though it's another option. Which might be an error, but the code can't handle that. So maybe the code is designed to process only arguments in the form of key=value or the key is followed by a value not starting with '--'.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is only supposed to process arguments that are in key=value format. So, any argument starting with '--' must have an '='? That would simplify things, but the problem's description doesn't specify that.

Hmm, given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended approach is to split each argument on '=', and if the first part starts with '--', then that's the key. So, for each argument in the list, if it has an '=', then split it. Otherwise, ignore it. But that would miss the case where the key is followed by a separate value.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take all the arguments and pair them as key-value, assuming that every even index is a key and the next is a value. But that's not standard, because in command line, options can be in any order and some options don't require values.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to process the arguments as a list of key-value pairs where each key is an argument starting with '--' followed by a value, except when the key is given with the '='. So in the case of '--name John', the key is 'name', value 'John'; in '--email=john@example.com', the key is 'email', value the email string.

So the code needs to handle both scenarios.

In the code above, when an argument starts with '--' but has no '=', it takes the next argument as the value, even if that next argument is another '--' option. So in that case, the code would treat the next -- as the value. But that's probably a mistake. So perhaps the code should check if the next argument starts with '--', then that's a new key, so the previous key's value is missing. But how to handle that?

Maybe the code should only take the next argument as value if it does not start with '--'.

So modifying the code:

else:

    key = arg.lstrip('-')

    next_arg = unparsed_arguments[index +1] if index+1 < len(unparsed_arguments) else None

    if next_arg and next_arg.startswith('--'):

        # then the next argument is a key, so this key has no value. perhaps skip?

        index +=1

    else:

        result[key] = next_arg

        index +=2

Wait, but how to implement that. Let me think again.

In the case where the current argument is a key (like '--name') and the next argument is also a key (like '--age'), then the code would try to take the next argument (the '--age') as the value for '--name', which is probably not intended. So to avoid that, we need to check if the next argument is a key (starts with --) then we can't take it as a value, so the key has no value. So perhaps in such cases, the key is skipped, or an error is raised.

But since the problem doesn't mention error handling, maybe we can just ignore keys that don't have a valid value. So in this case, when the next argument is a key, then the current key can't have its value, so we just increment by 1 (so index +=1 instead of 2), and then proceed. But that would leave the next argument to be processed as a key, but then again, if it's followed by another key, it would also have no value.

Alternatively, maybe in that case, the current key is considered to have a default value, but that's not specified here.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to process each argument:

If the argument starts with '--', split on '=' once. If split, then key is the part before minus the '--', value is the part after. Add to dict.

Else, it's a positional argument and not part of the parameters. So skip.

Wait, but that would miss the case where the key is given without '=' and the next argument is the value. So, perhaps the code should first check if the current argument has '=', split it. If not, then check if the next argument is not a '--' argument.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to process all arguments, so that any --key that doesn't have '=' must be followed by a value that is not a key.

So here's a revised approach:

Initialize the dictionary.

Loop over each argument in the unparsed_arguments, using an index.

At each step, check if the current argument is a key (starts with --). If yes:

- Split on '='. If there is an '=', then process as key=value.

- Else, check if the next argument is not a key (doesn't start with --). Then take that as the value.

- If the next argument is a key, then this key has no value, so we can skip it, or perhaps leave it as None. But the problem's doc says to parse parameters, so maybe only include keys that have a value.

Wait, but how to handle that?

Alternatively, perhaps the function treats any argument that starts with '--' as a key, and the value is the next argument, unless the current argument has an '='. So the code would process:

for example, in the case of ['--name', 'John', '--age', '30'], it would pair them correctly.

In ['--email=john@ex.com', '--verbose'], the first is split into email and the value, then the second '--verbose' would be a key, but since there is no next argument (assuming it's the last element), it's added as a key with no value, but perhaps in the code, since it's the last element, index+1 is out of bounds, so the else clause would not execute, so the key is not added. So in that case, the '--verbose' would not be included in the dict, which is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the code should add the key with a value of True for flags that don't have a value. But the problem's doc doesn't mention that. So maybe that's beyond the scope here.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that all parameters are in the form of key=value. So each argument is like "--key=value", and the function splits each argument by '=', ignoring any without '='.

In that case, the code would be simpler. Let's see:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    args_dict = {}
    for arg in unparsed_arguments:
        if arg.startswith('--'):
            key, sep, value = arg[2:].partition('=')
            if sep:
                args_dict[key] = value
            else:
                # this would mean that the arg starts with -- but has no '=', so it's just a key without value. Maybe skip?
                # or perhaps the key is the entire string after --? Like if the arg is '--name', then the key is 'name' and the value is an empty string? Not sure.
                # Since the problem's doc says to parse parameters, maybe only include those with =.
                pass
    return args_dict

Wait, but that approach would only process arguments that have an '=', so in cases where the key is given without '=', then the next argument is the value, which would be missed. So this would only handle the key=value case, not the separate value case.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting that all arguments are in the form of key=value pairs, so that each argument is a single string with an '='. So the function can split each argument by '=' after stripping the '--'.

In that case, the code would be straightforward. But if that's the case, then the function can just loop through each argument, check if it starts with '--', split on '=', and add to the dict.

But the problem's function signature uses *unparsed_arguments, which suggests that the arguments can be given as separate elements. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle both scenarios.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a simple function where each argument is a key-value pair separated by '=', so each argument is like "key=value", but without the --. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to parse command line arguments where options are given with -- followed by name and then value, so that the arguments are in the form of a list like ['--name', 'John', '--age', '30'], and the function should pair the first with the second, third with fourth, etc. But how to do that without knowing which are the keys.

So, in that case, the code would loop through the arguments, and whenever an argument starts with '--', then the next argument is the value. So the key is the part after '--', and the next element is the value. So the code would need to track that.

Let me try coding that approach.

Initialize the dictionary.

index = 0

while index < len(unparsed_arguments):

    arg = unparsed_arguments[index]

    if arg.startswith('--'):

        key_part = arg.lstrip('-')

        key = key_part

        # check next argument. if it starts with '--', then the key has no value, so skip?

        # else take it as value

        if index +1 >= len(unparsed_arguments):

            # no value, so perhaps skip this key?

            pass

        else:

            next_arg = unparsed_arguments[index +1]

            if not next_arg.startswith('--'):

                value = next_arg

                args_dict[key] = value

                index +=2

            else:

                # next arg is also a key, so this key has no value. skip?

                # but maybe the user intended that, so we can't do anything. So just add the key with a default value?

                # perhaps the problem expects that each key is followed by a value.

                # So in this case, the code can't process it, so maybe skip this key.

                index +=1

    else:

        # not a key, so ignore

        index +=1

Wait, but this code would miss the case where the key is given with an '=', so like '--name=John'.

Wait, in that case, the first argument is '--name=John', which starts with '--', so key_part is 'name=John'? No, because lstrip('-') would remove the leading '--', so the key_part would be 'name=John', but that's not desired. So in that case, the code would split the key_part into 'name' and 'John'?

Wait, no. The code above would take the entire part after '--' as the key. So in the case of '--name=John', the key would be 'name=John', and since the next argument is not a '--', but in this case there is no next argument (since the current arg is the one with =), then the code would not process it correctly.

Ah, right. So the code needs to check if the current argument has an '=', and split it accordingly. So for an argument like '--name=John', the key is 'name' and the value is 'John'. So the code should split on '=', once.

So, perhaps:

for each arg in the list:

    if starts with '--', split into key and value by '=' once.

    else, skip.

But then, the code would process each argument individually. So in the case of ['--name', 'John'], the first argument is split into 'name', 'John'? No, because splitting on '=' would give ['--name', 'John'] if the first element is '--name', so key_part would be '--name' minus the leading '--', so 'name', but then since there's no '=', the split would not occur. So perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should process arguments in pairs, where the first element is a key (starting with --) and the second is the value, unless the first element contains an '='.

Wait, here's another approach: iterate through the arguments, and whenever an argument starts with '--', check if it has an '='. If it does, split into key and value. If not, then the next argument is the value. But to do that, we have to manage the index properly.

Let me try writing that again.

Initialize the dict.

index = 0

while index < len(unparsed_arguments):

    current = unparsed_arguments[index]

    if current.startswith('--'):

        # split on '=', if present.

        parts = current.split('=', 1) # split into two parts at first '='

        if len(parts) == 2:

            # key is parts[0][2:], value is parts[1]

            key = parts[0].lstrip('-')

            value = parts[1]

            args_dict[key] = value

            index +=1

        else:

            # no '=', so the next argument must be the value.

            if index +1 >= len(unparsed_arguments):

                # no value available, skip?

                index +=1

            else:

                next_part = unparsed_arguments[index+1]

                if next_part.startswith('--'):

                    # next is another option, so this option has no value. skip?

                    index +=1

                else:

                    key = current.lstrip('-')

                    value = next_part

                    args_dict[key] = value

                    index +=2

    else:

        # not an option, skip

        index +=1

Wait, that's more complicated. Let's see:

Example 1: ['--name', 'John', '--age', '30']

Processing index 0: current is '--name', split into ['--name', ...] but split(=,1) would split into parts[0] = '--name' (since no =), so len(parts) is 1. So else clause: check index+1 (1), which is 'John', not starting with '--'. So key is 'name', value 'John', add to dict. index becomes 2.

Next iteration, index=2: current is '--age', split into parts[0] = '--age', so else clause. next_part is index+1 (3) which is '30', so key 'age', value '30'. index becomes 4. loop ends.

Result is {'name': 'John', 'age': '30'}

Example 2: ['--email=john@example.com', '--country=US']

Processing index 0: current starts with '--', split on '=' into parts of 2. So key 'email', value 'john@example.com', add to dict. index becomes 1.

index 1: current is '--country=US', split into parts 2. key 'country', value 'US'. index becomes 2. loop ends. Result is correct.

Another example: ['--name', '--John', '--age=30']

Processing index 0: '--name', split into parts[0] (since no =), so check next_part (index+1 = 1, which is '--John'). since it starts with '--', then this key has no value, so skip. index +=1 to 1.

Then index 1: current is '--John', which starts with '--', but split on '=' gives parts[0] = '--John', so no value. So check next_part. index+1 is 2, which is '--age=30'. So that's another option, so skip. index +=1 to 2.

index 2: '--age=30' has '=', so split into parts. key 'age', value '30', added. index becomes 3. loop ends.

The result would be {'email': 'john@example.com', 'age': '30'}, but the '--name' was skipped because next argument is another option.

So that works.

Another case: ['--verbose', 'True', '--output', 'file.txt']

The '--verbose' is split into parts (len 1). next_part is 'True', which is not an option. So key 'verbose' with value 'True'. Then index increments by 2.

Then '--output' is processed similarly, leading to 'output' -> 'file.txt'.

Another case where the next argument is another option: ['--name', '--John'].

Then, the first '--name' would see that next_part is '--John' which starts with '--', so the key 'name' is not added. index becomes 1.

Then index 1 is '--John', which would check next_part (if any). Since it's the last element, index+1 is 2, which is beyond the length (assuming the list has two elements). So then, the code would not process it. The result would be empty.

But maybe '--verbose' without a value is just a flag, but the problem's doc says to parse parameters, so perhaps only include those with values. So the code would skip those.

So this approach seems to handle both cases.

Now, what about arguments that start with a single '-'? Like '-v'? The current code checks for starts with '--', so those would be ignored. But maybe the problem wants to support short options like '-n John' where '-n' is the key. Hmm, the problem's doc doesn't specify. Since the function is called parse_arguments, perhaps the user expects that any option starting with '-' (either single or double) is considered a key. Let me check that.

In the code above, if the current argument starts with '-', but not '--', then the code skips. So to include short options, the code should check for '-' instead of '--'.

But maybe the problem only considers double-dash options. Let's stick with the original plan.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check for either '-' or '--'. Let me adjust that.

Change the if condition to:

if current.startswith('-'):

But then, '-v' would be considered a key. Let's see:

Example: ['-v', '5', '--name', 'John']

Processing '-v' (since starts with '-'):

split on '=', but since there's none, parts would be 1. So then, check next_part. The next argument is '5', which is not an option. So key 'v' (from lstrip('-')), value '5'. index becomes 2.

Then process '--name' as before. So the result would have 'v': '5' and 'name': 'John'.

But maybe that's acceptable. The problem's doc doesn't specify, so perhaps the code should handle both single and double dashes. Or maybe not. Since the problem's example might have used '--', perhaps it's better to stick with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants to consider any argument starting with '-' as a key. Let me think. The function's name is parse_arguments, and the doc says to parse parameters. Maybe parameters are considered as any option with a key and value. So perhaps including short options.

But I'll proceed with the double dash, unless told otherwise.

Wait, the problem's description says "parameters" which are typically options with values, so maybe the code should process both single and double dash options. Let me adjust the code to check for starting with '-'. Because sometimes parameters can be '-v 5' or '-v5'.

Wait, but in that case, if the argument is '-v5', then it's a single argument, so splitting on '=' may not work, but splitting on '-' would complicate things. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that any argument starting with '-' is a key, and the key is the part after the '-', but only if it's followed by a space and the value. Or maybe in the case of '-v5', it's considered as a key 'v5' with no value? That's possible but maybe not intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to process only long options (double dashes) and expects the '=' or next argument. Let's proceed with that.

Now, back to the code.

Wait, in the code above, when splitting on '=', for parts = current.split('=', 1), so parts[0] is the part before the first '=', and parts[1] the rest. Then key is parts[0].lstrip('-').

Wait, in the first case, for '--name=John', parts would be ['--name', 'John'], so key is '--name'.lstrip('-')? No, that would be 'name', which is correct.

Wait, parts[0] is '--name', so lstrip('-') gives 'name'.

Yes, that's right.

Another example: '--email=john@example.com' gives parts[0] = '--email', so key is 'email', value 'john...'.

So that part works.

Now, the code's structure.

The function uses a while loop with index starting at 0.

Inside the loop, if current starts with '--', process as above.

So, the code would look something like this:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    result = {}
    index = 0
    while index < len(unparsed_arguments):
        arg = unparsed_arguments[index]
        if arg.startswith('--'):
            parts = arg.split('=', 1)
            if len(parts) == 2:
                key = parts[0].lstrip('-')
                value = parts[1]
                result[key] = value
                index +=1
            else:
                # no '=', so check next argument
                if index +1 < len(unparsed_arguments):
                    next_arg = unparsed_arguments[index+1]
                    if not next_arg.startswith('--'):
                        key = parts[0].lstrip('-')  # wait, parts[0] is arg here, since split into parts[0] when split into 1 part.

                        key = arg.lstrip('-')  # correct.

                        value = next_arg
                        result[key] = value
                        index +=2
                    else:
                        # next is another option, so can't take a value. just skip this key?
                        index +=1
                else:
                    # no next argument, so skip this key
                    index +=1
        else:
            index +=1
    return result

Wait, in the else part (when parts is length 1, i.e., no '=' in the current argument), the code first checks if there is a next argument. If yes, then check if the next argument starts with '--'. If not, then take it as value. Else, skip.

Wait, in the code above, in the 'else' clause (the part where the current argument has no '='), parts[0] is the same as arg. So key is arg.lstrip('-').

Wait, in the code, parts is arg.split('=', 1). So when there's no '=', parts is [arg], so parts[0] is the entire string. So key would be parts[0].lstrip('-') → that would be the key part.

Yes, that works.

Wait, let me test some examples.

Test case 1: arguments are ['--name=John', '--age=30']

Processing first arg: '--name=John' → split into ['--name', 'John'], parts length 2 → key 'name', value 'John', add to dict. index becomes 1.

Second arg: '--age=30' → split into parts → key 'age', value '30'. index becomes 2 → loop ends.

Result is {'name': 'John', 'age': '30'}

Test case 2: ['--name', 'John', '--age', '30']

First arg is '--name', split into parts of 1. So key is 'name'. check next argument (index 1) is 'John', which is not a '--' → so add to dict, index +=2 → index 2.

Second arg (index 2) is '--age', same process. Add 'age' → '30', index becomes 4 → done.

Result is correct.

Test case 3: ['--email=john@example.com', '--country']

First arg: '--email=john@...' → split into parts 2 → key 'email', value the email string. index becomes 1.

Second arg: '--country' → split into parts 1. Then check next arg (index 2). If there is no next argument (assuming list length is 2?), then index+1 is 2 which is equal to len (so 2 < 2 is false). So the else part would have:

if index+1 < len → no, so index increments by 1 to 2. The loop ends.

So '--country' is processed but there's no next argument. So it's skipped. So the result includes 'email' but not 'country'.

That's okay.

Another case: ['--output', 'file.txt', '--verbose']

Processing '--output', next is 'file.txt' → key 'output', value 'file.txt' → added. index becomes 2.

Next, the second argument (index 2) is '--verbose', split into parts of 1. Check next index (3) which is beyond the list (assuming length is 3? Wait, in this example, list has 3 elements: indexes 0,1,2. So when index is 2, next index is 3 which is beyond. So in the else clause, since next is beyond, skip, index becomes 3. So the '--verbose' is not added.

Hmm. So in this case, the '--verbose' is a flag with no value, so it's not included in the dict. That's correct if the function only wants parameters with values. But perhaps the user wants to include flags as True, but that's not mentioned here.

Alternatively, maybe the code should treat flags (options without values) as having a value of True. But since the problem didn't specify that, I'll stick to the current approach.

Another test case: ['--name', '--John', '30']

First, index 0: '--name', split into parts of 1. Check next arg (index1) is '--John', which starts with '--', so can't take value. So index +=1 → index 1.

Arg at index1: '--John', split into parts of 1. Check next arg (index2) is '30', not a '--', so key 'John', value '30'. So the result would have 'John' → '30'? That's probably not intended, but the code would do that. Hmm, but maybe the user intended that. Alternatively, perhaps '--John' is a key with no value, but since the next argument is a non-option, it's taken as its value. So in this case, the code would process the '--John' as a key, but that's a mistake. So maybe the code needs to check if the key is actually an option, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should only process arguments that are properly formed. Like, if the next argument is a '--', then the current key is not added. So in the first example, when the current is '--name' and the next is '--John', the code would not add 'name' to the dict, since the next argument is an option. So the code would increment index by 1 (so index becomes 1). Then, at index1, the next argument is '30', which is not an option. So the '--John' is a key (without '='), then check next arg (index2) is '30' → so key 'John', value '30' is added. The result would have 'name' not added, but 'John' is a key? That's probably a mistake. So perhaps the code needs to ignore keys that are not followed by a non-option argument.

Hmm, but in that case, the code would have to skip that key, and index +=1.

Wait, in the first step:

current is '--name', parts length 1. Check if next argument (index1) is '--John' → starts with '--', so we can't take it as a value. So in that case, the code would not add the 'name' key. Then index +=1 → index becomes 1.

Then, processing index1: '--John' → parts length 1. Check next argument (index2) is '30', which is not an option. So key 'John' with value '30' is added. So the result would have 'John' as a key. That's probably not intended, but according to the code's logic, that's what happens.

So maybe the problem's intended approach is to only process arguments that have an '=', so the code would need to ignore the '--name' case unless there's an '='.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects that only the arguments with '=' are processed, and those without are skipped unless followed by a non-option. But in that case, the code is correct as written, but the test case shows that it may allow some unexpected keys.

Hmm, perhaps the function is designed to process only arguments with the '=' in them, and ignore the ones that are followed by another option. So the code's approach is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the code should not consider any key that has no '=', unless it can find a value. So in the case where the next argument is not an option, then it can proceed. But in the case where the next argument is an option, then the current key is not added, and the index is incremented by 1.

So that's what the code is doing.

Another example: ['--name', 'John', '--age', '30', '--verbose']

Processing the first four elements, then at index4: '--verbose', split into parts of 1. next argument is none (since it's the last). So the code skips it. The result would have name and age, but not verbose.

So that's okay.

Now, code-wise, the split is done as parts = arg.split('=',1). So that's correct.

But what about if the value has '=' in it, like '--file=example=data.txt'? Then splitting on first '=' would give key 'file', value 'example', but the actual value should be 'example=data.txt'. So perhaps splitting on '=' is not the best approach here. But that's probably beyond the scope of the problem. The problem's description doesn't mention handling cases where the value contains '=', so perhaps we can proceed with split(=,1).

Alternatively, maybe the code should use partition, but split once.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects that the arguments are in key=value format, so each argument with an '=' is a single element. So the code's approach is okay.

Now, let me code this.

Wait, in the else clause (when parts is 1):

We have to check if there is a next argument, and whether it's an option.

So the code would be:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    result = {}
    index = 0
    while index < len(unparsed_arguments):
        arg = unparsed_arguments[index]
        if arg.startswith('--'):
            parts = arg.split('=', 1)
            if len(parts) == 2:
                key = parts[0].lstrip('-')
                value = parts[1]
                result[key] = value
                index +=1
            else:
                # no '=', so check next argument
                if index +1 < len(unparsed_arguments):
                    next_arg = unparsed_arguments[index+1]
                    if not next_arg.startswith('--'):
                        key = parts[0].lstrip('-')  # Wait, parts[0] is the original arg, since split into 1 part. So parts[0] is arg. So key is arg.lstrip('-') → '--name' becomes 'name'.

                        value = next_arg
                        result[key] = value
                        index +=2
                    else:
                        # next is another option, so can't take value. skip current key?
                        index +=1
                else:
                    # no next argument, skip
                    index +=1
        else:
            # not an option, ignore
            index +=1
    return result

Wait, in the else clause, after splitting (parts is length 1):

the key is parts[0].lstrip('-') → parts[0] is the original argument (since split into two parts, but since there's no '=', parts[0] is the entire arg. So, for '--name', parts[0] is '--name', so key is 'name'.

Yes.

Wait, but in the case of parts[0], the split is done even when there's no '='. So parts is [arg], so parts[0] is the whole string.

Yes.

This code should work.

Let me test it with some cases.

Test case 1: args = ['--name=John', '--age=30']

The loop starts at 0. The first arg is '--name=John' → split into ['--name', 'John'], so len(parts)=2 → key 'name', value 'John' → added. index becomes 1.

Second iteration: index is 1 → '--age=30' → split into parts → key 'age', value '30' → added. index becomes 2 → loop ends. The result is correct.

Test case 2: ['--name', 'John', '--age', '30']

index0: '--name' → split into parts of 1. So check next arg (index1) is 'John', not an option → key 'name', value 'John' → added. index becomes 2.

index2: '--age' → same → key 'age' and '30' → added. index becomes 4 → done. Correct.

Test case3: ['--email=john@example.com', '--country']

First arg: '--email=john...' → split into 2 parts → key 'email', value 'john...' → added. index becomes 1.

Second arg is '--country' → parts len 1. Check next index (2). Since the list length is 2, index+1 is 2 → which is not less than 2 (since len is 2, so 2 is equal, so the next_arg is not available. So the code goes to the else → index +=1 to 2 → loop ends. So '--country' is not added. Correct.

Another case: ['--output', 'file.txt', '--verbose']

Processing index0: '--output' → split into parts 1. next is 'file.txt' → not an option → key 'output', value 'file.txt' → added. index becomes 2.

index2 is '--verbose' → split into parts 1. next is index3 (out of bounds) → so can't add. So index becomes 3 → loop ends. So 'verbose' is not added. That's okay.

Another case where the next argument is an option but the current has no '=':

args = ['--name', '--John', '30']

Processing index0: '--name', split into parts 1. next argument is index1: '--John' → which starts with '--', so can't take it as value. So index +=1 → index becomes 1.

index1 is '--John' → split into parts 1. next is index2 '30' → not an option → key 'John' and value '30' → added. So the result includes 'John': '30'? That's probably a mistake. But according to the input, perhaps the user made an error, but the code can't handle that. So the code would process it as such. But maybe the user intended that '--name' is the key and the next argument is another option, so the code skips '--name' and proceeds. So '--John' is processed as a key with '30' as the value. That's not correct, but the code can't know that. So perhaps this is a case where the input is invalid, but the code just proceeds as best as it can.

Hmm, perhaps the code should also check that the next argument is not an option (starts with '--'), so in that case, '--John' is an option, so the code skips the current key (the first '--name') and moves to next index. But then, when processing '--John', the next is '30', so it's added. So the code would have 'John' : '30' in the dict, which is wrong. But that's the user's mistake in input. So the code can't do anything about that. It's just parsing as per the given input.

Alternatively, maybe the code should skip any key that has no '=', and the next argument is an option, so in that case, when the next argument is an option, the current key is not added, and index is incremented by 1. So in the first case, '--name' would not be added, and the next arg is '--John' → then that is processed as a key, but then next arg is '30', so it's okay. So 'John' would be a key with '30' as value. That's still a problem, but the code can't detect that.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that only the arguments with '=' are considered, so that the code would process only those. So in the first case, '--name' would have no '=', so it can't have a value unless the next is not an option. But in the case where next is an option, it can't get a value, so it's skipped.

So the code is okay.

Now, code-wise, perhaps I can write it as follows.

Wait, the code uses parts[0].lstrip('-'). But parts[0] is the first part of splitting the argument on '='. For example, in the case of '--name=value', parts[0] is '--name', so lstrip('-') gives 'name'.

Yes.

Wait, in the case of an argument like '-name=value', which starts with a single '-', the code would not process it because the code checks for starts with '--'.

So that's okay if we only want long options.

Now, let me see if there's any possible mistake in the code.

Wait, in the else clause (when parts is length 1):

the key is parts[0].lstrip('-'). But parts[0] is the original argument. So for '--name', that's correct.

Wait, the code is using parts[0], which is the entire argument (since split on '=' with maxsplit 1, but there was no '=', so parts is [arg]).

So yes, that's correct.

Another edge case: an argument with '--' but no '=', and the next argument is an option.

Like ['--name', '--age', '30'].

First arg is '--name', split into parts 1. next is '--age' (index1) → which is an option. So can't take it as value → so the code skips adding 'name' and increments index by 1 → index becomes 1.

Then, at index1: '--age' → split into parts 1. next is index2 (30) → not an option → so key 'age', value '30' → added. index becomes 3 → loop ends. The result is {'age': '30'}, missing 'name' because the next argument is an option. That's correct.

Another case where the next argument is not an option. Like ['--name', 'John'] → processed correctly.

What about if an argument has multiple equals signs, like '--path=C:/files/test=file.txt'? Then split(=,1) would split into parts[0] = '--path', parts[1] = 'C:/files/test=file.txt'. So the key is 'path', value is that string. So that's okay, the code would handle it.

Another case: an argument that's just '--verbose' (no value). The code would check next argument (if any). If there is none, then it's not added. If there is a next argument, but it's not an option, then it would be added as the value. But if the user intended '--verbose' as a flag, then this code would not include it unless followed by a value. So that's a possible limitation, but again, the problem's doc doesn't mention handling flags without values. So perhaps that's acceptable.

So I think this code should work. Let me code it properly.

Wait, in the else part (when parts is length 1):

the code has parts[0].lstrip('-'), but parts[0] is the same as arg. So key = arg.lstrip('-') → correct.

Yes.

Now, in the case where the next argument is not an option, so:

if next_arg is not starting with '--', then proceed to add.

Wait, code:

            else:
                # no '=', so check next argument
                if index +1 < len(unparsed_arguments):
                    next_arg = unparsed_arguments[index+1]
                    if not next_arg.startswith('--'):
                        key = arg.lstrip('-')  # parts[0] is arg, so same as arg
                        value = next_arg
                        result[key] = value
                        index +=2
                    else:
                        index +=1
                else:
                    index +=1

Wait, in the code above, parts[0] is the same as arg. So perhaps it's better to just write arg.lstrip('-') instead of parts[0].lstrip('-').

Ah, right. So in the first case (parts length 2):

    key = parts[0].lstrip('-') → which is the same as parts[0] is the part before the '=', so that's okay.

But in the else case (parts is length 1), parts[0] is the entire arg, so lstrip('-') gives the key correctly.

But perhaps using arg.lstrip('-') is better. Let me adjust:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    result = {}
    index = 0
    while index < len(unparsed_arguments):
        arg = unparsed_arguments[index]
        if arg.startswith('--'):
            parts = arg.split('=', 1)
            if len(parts) == 2:
                key = parts[0].lstrip('-')
                value = parts[1]
                result[key] = value
                index +=1
            else:
                # no '=', so check next argument
                if index +1 < len(unparsed_arguments):
                    next_arg = unparsed_arguments[index+1]
                    if not next_arg.startswith('--'):
                        key = arg.lstrip('-')
                        value = next_arg
                        result[key] = value
                        index +=2
                    else:
                        # can't take next as value, so skip current key
                        index +=1
                else:
                    # no next, skip
                    index +=1
        else:
            # not an option, skip
            index +=1
    return result

Wait, that's better. In the else clause, parts is length 1 (so no '='), so the key is arg.lstrip('-').

Yes. So this code should work.

Another test case: ['--file', 'data.txt', '--size', '100']

Processing first arg '--file' → next is data → so key 'file' → added. index becomes 2.

Next arg '--size' → split into parts of 1. next is '100' → so key 'size' → added. index becomes 4 → done. So the result is correct.

Another test case with a single argument: ['--test'] → no next argument. So in the else clause, index+1 is beyond, so increment by 1. So the key is not added. Correct.

Another case with a value that starts with '--'? Like ['--output', '--file.txt'].

Then the code would check next_arg is '--file.txt', which starts with '--', so can't take it as value. So the '--output' key is skipped, index becomes 1.

Then processing '--file.txt' → split into parts 1. Check next index (2), which is beyond, so it's skipped. So the dict is empty.

Hmm, but the user might have intended that the output is '--file.txt'? But that's a possible scenario. So the code would not include it unless it had an '='. So that's correct.

Another scenario: ['--key=value', 'another', '--flag'] → the 'another' is not an option, but since it's not preceded by an option, it's ignored. The '--flag' has no '=', and next is beyond, so it's not added. So the dict has 'key' → 'value'.

Yes.

So I think this code should work as per the problem's requirements. Let me write it now.
