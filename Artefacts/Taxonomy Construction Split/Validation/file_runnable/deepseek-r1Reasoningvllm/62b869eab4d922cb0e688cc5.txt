Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called update_last_applied_manifest_from_resp. It takes three arguments: last_applied_manifest, observer_schema, and response. The docstring says it's called recursively to update a partial last_applied_manifest from a Kubernetes response. 

Looking at the docstring, it mentions that the function goes through all observed fields and initializes their value in last_applied_manifest if they are not present. So, I need to loop through each key in observer_schema and check if it exists in the response. If it does, I update the corresponding key in last_applied_manifest. If not, I add it with a default value, probably an empty string.

Wait, the default value isn't specified in the docstring, but in the code example provided earlier, it was set to an empty string. So I'll use that as a default.

So, the steps are:

1. Iterate over each key in observer_schema.
2. For each key, check if it exists in the response.
3. If it exists, update last_applied_manifest with response[key].
4. If it doesn't exist, add the key to last_applied_manifest with an empty string value.

I should make sure that the function doesn't raise any KeyError if the field is missing because the raises section says KeyError if the observed field is not present. So, I should handle cases where the key isn't in the response.

Putting it all together, the code will loop through observer_schema, check each key in response, and update or add as needed.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
