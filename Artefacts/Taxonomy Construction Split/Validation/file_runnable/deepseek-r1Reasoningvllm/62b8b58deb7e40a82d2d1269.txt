Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called directlyProvidedBy and it takes an object as an argument. The docstring says it returns the interfaces directly provided by the object, and the return type is an IDeclaration from Zope's interface module.

Hmm, I remember that in Python, to get the interfaces an object directly implements, you can use the type(object).interfaces() method. But wait, isn't that part of the Zope library? Oh right, because in Zope, objects are often instances of Zope interfaces, and this method is available.

So the function should import IDeclaration from zope.interface. Then, inside the function, it should return type(object).interfaces(). But wait, what if the object is not a Zope object? Maybe it's better to handle cases where the object doesn't have interfaces. But the problem statement doesn't specify handling errors, so I'll proceed without error checking.

Putting it all together, the code should import IDeclaration, define the function, and return the interfaces. Let me write that.
