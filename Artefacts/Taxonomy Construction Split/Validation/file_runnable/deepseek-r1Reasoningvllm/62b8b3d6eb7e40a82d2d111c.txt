Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _normalizeargs, takes a sequence and an optional output parameter, and has a docstring explaining its purpose.

First, I'll start by writing the function definition. It's straightforward: def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):.

Next, I'll include the docstring. It should be properly indented and placed after the function definition. The docstring explains that the function normalizes declaration arguments which can be Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. It also mentions that anything that's not an individual interface or implements specs will be expanded.

I'll make sure the docstring is triple double-quoted and correctly formatted within the function. No need for any additional explanations, just the clear description provided.

I should check if there are any specific imports needed, but since the user didn't mention any, I'll assume that the necessary modules are already imported or that this is part of a larger codebase where imports are handled elsewhere.

Putting it all together, the code will have the function definition followed by the docstring. I'll ensure there are no markdown formats or extra explanations, just the code as specified.
