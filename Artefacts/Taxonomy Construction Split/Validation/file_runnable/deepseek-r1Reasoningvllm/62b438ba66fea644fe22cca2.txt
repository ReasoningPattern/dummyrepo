Okay, so I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that takes a list of nodes and merges any duplicates based on their keys. The docstring says that if there are duplicate keys, they should be merged, and if the values are non-MappingNodes, the last one remains. But if the values are MappingNodes, they should be deeply merged.

Hmm, first, I should think about what a MappingNode is. I guess it's a custom class that acts like a dictionary. So when two MappingNodes have the same key, instead of just overwriting, we need to merge their sub-values deeply.

I remember that for deep merging, especially with nested structures, a recursive approach is needed. So I'll probably need a helper function that can handle merging two nodes, whether they are MappingNodes or not.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Iterate through each node in the input list.
2. For each node, check if its key is already in a dictionary that's being built.
3. If the key isn't present, add it to the dictionary with the current node as its value.
4. If the key is present, check the type of the existing value and the current node's value.
5. If either is a MappingNode, perform a deep merge of the two.
6. If both are non-MappingNodes, simply replace the existing value with the current one (since we keep the last occurrence).

Wait, but how do I handle the deep merge? Maybe the helper function should take two nodes and return a merged node. If both are MappingNodes, it merges them recursively. Otherwise, it returns a new node with the later value.

So, the helper function could be something like deep_merge(a, b). It checks if both a and b are MappingNodes. If yes, it creates a new empty MappingNode and merges each key recursively. If only one is a MappingNode, it uses the other's value. If neither, returns b since we keep the last value.

But wait, in the case where both are MappingNodes, how do I handle the keys? I need to make sure that for each key, if both a and b have it, they are merged. Otherwise, the value from b (since it's the latter) is taken.

So, in the helper function, for each key in a, if the key exists in b, we merge their values. If not, we take b's value. But wait, that might not cover all cases because b might have keys that a doesn't. So, perhaps the helper function should collect all keys from both a and b, and for each key, decide whether to merge or take the value from b.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to create a new node. For each key in a, if the key is also in b, merge their values. Then, add any remaining keys from b that aren't in a.

Wait, but the helper function is called when a key exists, so a and b are the two nodes to merge. So, for each key in a, if the key is in b, merge their values. Then, for any keys in b that are not in a, add them to the new node. That way, we ensure that the later node's values take precedence.

Wait, no. Because if a key exists in both, we merge them. If a key is only in b, we add it as is. So the helper function should create a new node, and for each key in a, if it's also in b, merge. Then, add any keys from b that are not in a.

But that might not be the correct approach because in the case where a key is in a but not in b, we just take a's value. But since the helper is called when a key is already present, perhaps a is the existing value, and b is the new one. So, we should merge a and b, but since a is the existing, perhaps we should take b's value if it's a non-MappingNode.

Wait, maybe the helper function should always return a new node that is the result of merging a and b. If a is a MappingNode and b is a MappingNode, then we merge them. Otherwise, we take b's value.

Alternatively, perhaps the helper function should take a as the base and b as the value to merge in. So, for each key in a, if it exists in b, merge; else, take a's value. For keys in b not in a, add them. Wait, that might not be right because in the case where a is the existing node, and b is the new one, we should take b's value if it's not a MappingNode.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should structure the helper function to take two nodes, a and b, and return the merged result. If either is a MappingNode, merge them, else take the latter.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the helper function to handle the merging of two nodes. If both are MappingNodes, we merge them recursively. Otherwise, we return the latter node.

So, in code, something like:

def deep_merge(a, b):
    if isinstance(a, MappingNode) and isinstance(b, MappingNode):
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key, value in a.items():
            if key in b:
                merged[key] = deep_merge(value, b[key])
            else:
                merged[key] = b[key]
        return merged
    else:
        return b

Wait, but this might not handle all cases correctly. For example, if a has a key that b doesn't, we take a's value. If b has a key that a doesn't, we take b's value. But since the helper is called when a key is already present, perhaps a is the existing value, and b is the new one. So, in that case, if a is a MappingNode and b is a MappingNode, we merge them. Otherwise, we take b's value.

Wait, but in the helper function, when a is a MappingNode and b is not, we should take b's value, which is a single value, not a node. So, perhaps the helper function should return the latter value if one of them is not a MappingNode.

Alternatively, perhaps the helper function should create a new node, and for each key in a, if it exists in b, merge, else take a's value. Then, for any keys in b not in a, take b's value. But that might not be the right approach because in the case where a is a MappingNode and b is not, we should just take b's value.

Hmm, maybe the helper function should create a new node, and for each key in a, if it exists in b, merge the values. Then, for any keys in b that are not in a, add them to the new node. But in the case where a is a MappingNode and b is not, then for the key in a, we just take a's value, and any keys in b are added as is.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should be written to take two nodes, a and b, and if either is a MappingNode, merge them, else return the latter.

So, in code:

def deep_merge(a, b):
    if isinstance(a, MappingNode) or isinstance(b, MappingNode):
        if isinstance(a, MappingNode) and isinstance(b, MappingNode):
            # Both are MappingNodes, merge them
            new_node = MappingNode()
            for key in a:
                if key in b:
                    new_node[key] = deep_merge(a[key], b[key])
                else:
                    new_node[key] = b[key]
            return new_node
        else:
            # One is MappingNode, the other is not. Take the latter.
            return b if isinstance(b, MappingNode) else a
    else:
        # Both are not MappingNodes, return the latter
        return b

Wait, but in the case where a is a MappingNode and b is not, we should return b, because we keep the last occurrence. Similarly, if a is not and b is, return a? Or wait, no, because in the context where the helper is called, a is the existing node, and b is the new one. So if a is a MappingNode and b is not, then the new value is b, so we should return b. If a is not and b is, then we should return a (since it's the latter), but wait, no, because a is the existing, and b is the new. So in that case, we should take b's value, but since b is a non-MappingNode, it's just b. But wait, no, because a is the existing, and b is the new. So if a is not a MappingNode and b is, then a is the existing, and b is the new. So in that case, we should take b's value, which is a MappingNode. So perhaps the helper function should be:

if either a or b is a MappingNode, then merge them, else return b.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should always return the latter node. So if a is a MappingNode, it's the existing, and b is the new one. So if b is a MappingNode, we merge them, else, we take b's value.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the function's logic.

In the main function, we're iterating through each node. For each node, if the key is not in the result, we add it. If it is, we check the existing value. If the existing value is a MappingNode, we merge the new node into it. Otherwise, we replace the existing value with the new node.

So the helper function should take the existing node and the new node, and return the merged node.

So, in the helper function:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        # Both are MappingNodes, merge them
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key, value in existing.items():
            if key in new_node:
                merged[key] = merge_nodes(value, new_node[key])
            else:
                merged[key] = new_node[key]
        return merged
    else:
        # One is MappingNode, the other is not. Take the latter
        return new_node if not isinstance(existing, MappingNode) else existing

Wait, but in the case where existing is a MappingNode and new_node is not, we should return new_node because it's the latter. If existing is not a MappingNode and new_node is, we should return existing (since it's the latter). Wait, but that would mean that when existing is a MappingNode, we keep it, and when new_node is a MappingNode, we keep it. But that's not correct because if existing is a MappingNode and new_node is a non-MappingNode, we should replace existing with new_node. Similarly, if existing is not a MappingNode and new_node is, we should replace existing with new_node.

So, perhaps the helper function should be:

if either is a MappingNode, then if both are, merge them. Else, return the latter.

Wait, no. Because if existing is a MappingNode and new_node is not, we should return new_node. If existing is not and new_node is, we should return new_node. If both are MappingNodes, merge them.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should be written as:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        # Merge them
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key in existing:
            if key in new_node:
                merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
            else:
                merged[key] = new_node[key]
        return merged
    else:
        # Return the latter
        return new_node if existing is None else existing

Wait, but existing can't be None because we're in the case where the key already exists. So, in the else clause, we can just return new_node if it's a MappingNode, else existing. Wait, no, because if existing is not a MappingNode and new_node is, we should replace existing with new_node. Similarly, if existing is a MappingNode and new_node is not, we should replace with new_node.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should always return the latter node. So, if new_node is a MappingNode, return it, else return existing.

Wait, no, because if existing is a MappingNode and new_node is a MappingNode, we need to merge them, not just take the latter.

So, the helper function needs to handle three cases:

1. Both are MappingNodes: merge them.
2. Existing is MappingNode, new_node is not: replace with new_node.
3. Existing is not, new_node is: replace with new_node.

So, in code:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        # Merge them
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key, value in existing.items():
            merged[key] = merge_nodes(value, new_node.get(key, value))
        return merged
    else:
        # Return the latter
        return new_node if existing is None else new_node

Wait, but existing can't be None because the key exists. So, perhaps:

if both are MappingNodes, merge them.

else, return new_node.

Wait, but that would mean that if existing is a MappingNode and new_node is not, we return new_node, which is correct. If existing is not and new_node is, we return new_node, which is correct. If both are MappingNodes, we merge them.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the helper function can be written as:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key in existing:
            merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node.get(key, existing[key]))
        return merged
    else:
        return new_node

Wait, but in the case where new_node doesn't have the key, we take existing[key]. So, for each key in existing, if new_node has it, merge, else take existing's value.

But wait, that might not handle all cases. For example, if new_node has a key that existing doesn't, we should add it. But in the helper function, since we're only handling the case where the key exists, perhaps we should only process the existing keys and add any new ones from new_node.

Hmm, perhaps the helper function should create a new node, and for each key in existing, if it's in new_node, merge, else take existing. Then, add any keys from new_node that aren't in existing.

Wait, but that's more complex. So, perhaps the helper function should be:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    merged = {}
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode):
        merged = existing.copy()
    else:
        merged = existing
    for key, value in new_node.items():
        if key in merged:
            merged[key] = merge_nodes(merged[key], value)
        else:
            merged[key] = value
    return MappingNode(merged)

Wait, but this assumes that existing is either a MappingNode or a non-MappingNode. If existing is a MappingNode, we copy it, then iterate over new_node's items. If a key exists in both, we merge. Otherwise, add the key from new_node.

But wait, if existing is a MappingNode, we copy it, then for each key in new_node, if it's in merged, merge, else add it. That way, new_node's values overwrite existing's, but in the case of duplicates, they are merged.

But wait, in the context of the helper function, existing is the existing node, and new_node is the new one. So, if existing is a MappingNode, we make a copy, then for each key in new_node, if it's in the copy, merge, else add it. That way, the new_node's values take precedence, but duplicates are merged.

Wait, but in the case where existing is a MappingNode and new_node is also a MappingNode, this approach would correctly merge them. If new_node is a non-MappingNode, it would add it as a key to the new node.

But wait, in the helper function, new_node could be a MappingNode or not. So, perhaps the helper function should handle both cases.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should always create a new MappingNode, and for each key in existing, if it's in new_node, merge, else take existing's value. Then, for any keys in new_node not in existing, add them.

But I'm getting stuck on how to structure this. Maybe I should look for existing implementations or think of a simpler approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the helper function can be written recursively, checking each key in the existing node and merging if necessary.

Wait, perhaps the helper function can be written as:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        # Merge them
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key in existing:
            if key in new_node:
                merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
            else:
                merged[key] = new_node[key]
        return merged
    else:
        # Return the latter
        return new_node

But this might not handle all cases, especially when one is a MappingNode and the other is not. For example, if existing is a MappingNode and new_node is not, then the helper function returns new_node, which is correct because we keep the latter. Similarly, if existing is not and new_node is, it returns new_node.

But wait, if existing is not a MappingNode and new_node is, then the helper function returns new_node, which is correct. If both are MappingNodes, it merges them.

Yes, that seems to handle the cases correctly.

So, putting it all together, the deep_merge_nodes function would:

- Iterate through each node in nodes.
- For each node, check if the key is already in the result.
- If not, add it with the current node as the value.
- If it is, call the helper function to merge the existing value with the current node.
- Return the result.

So, the code would look like:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key  # Assuming nodes have a 'key' attribute
        if key in result:
            result[key] = merge_nodes(result[key], node)
        else:
            result[key] = node
    return result

Wait, but nodes are probably instances of MappingNode. So, in the function, each node is a MappingNode. So, the key is node's key attribute.

But wait, in the function definition, nodes is a list of nodes. So, each node is an instance of MappingNode. So, in the loop, for each node in nodes, extract the key (maybe node.key or similar), and proceed.

But wait, the function signature is given, and the docstring says that nodes is the argument. So, the code should be written accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the function should be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key  # Assuming each node has a 'key' attribute
        if key in result:
            result[key] = merge_nodes(result[key], node)
        else:
            result[key] = node.copy() if hasattr(node, 'copy') else node
    return result

Wait, but if nodes are MappingNode instances, perhaps they have a 'copy' method or we can create a new instance.

Alternatively, perhaps the helper function can handle the merging correctly regardless of whether the node is a MappingNode or not.

Wait, but in the helper function, if the existing value is a MappingNode and the new node is not, we return the new node, which is correct. Similarly, if the existing is not and the new is, we return the new node.

But in the main function, when we add a new node, we just assign result[key] = node. But if the node is a MappingNode, perhaps we should create a new instance to avoid modifying the original nodes.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the merged nodes, not modify the input. So, perhaps when adding a new node, we should create a new MappingNode instance with the same data.

Alternatively, perhaps the helper function can handle the merging, and the main function can just assign the result.

Wait, perhaps the main function can be written as:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        if key in result:
            result[key] = merge_nodes(result[key], node)
        else:
            result[key] = node
    return result

But wait, if node is a MappingNode, then result[key] would be a MappingNode, which is correct.

But perhaps when merging, the helper function should create new instances, not modify the existing ones. So, the helper function should return a new node each time.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        if key in result:
            result[key] = merge_nodes(result[key], node)
        else:
            result[key] = node
    return result

And the helper function is as discussed earlier.

But wait, the helper function is not defined inside deep_merge_nodes. So, perhaps I should define it inside.

Wait, but in Python, functions can be nested. So, perhaps I can define the helper function inside deep_merge_nodes.

So, the complete code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
        if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
            merged = MappingNode()
            for key in existing:
                if key in new_node:
                    merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
                else:
                    merged[key] = new_node[key]
            return merged
        else:
            return new_node

    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        if key in result:
            result[key] = merge_nodes(result[key], node)
        else:
            result[key] = node
    return result

Wait, but this assumes that nodes are instances of MappingNode and have a 'key' attribute. So, the code should work if that's the case.

But wait, in the helper function, when existing is not a MappingNode and new_node is, it returns new_node. Similarly, if existing is a MappingNode and new_node is not, it returns new_node. If both are MappingNodes, it merges them.

Yes, that should handle all cases.

But wait, in the helper function, when both are MappingNodes, it iterates over existing's keys. For each key, if it's in new_node, it merges; else, takes new_node's value. But what about keys in new_node that are not in existing? They are not added. So, in the helper function, after merging, any keys in new_node that are not in existing are not added. That's a problem because those keys should be added.

Ah, right, that's a mistake. The helper function only adds keys from existing and merges with new_node's keys. It doesn't add keys from new_node that are not in existing. So, for example, if new_node has a key 'a' that's not in existing, it's not added to the merged node.

So, the helper function needs to add all keys from new_node, even if they're not in existing.

So, the helper function should:

- Create a new node.
- Add all keys from existing, merging where possible.
- Add all keys from new_node that are not in existing.

So, the helper function should be rewritten.

Let me think again. The helper function should create a new node, and for each key in existing, merge if new_node has it, else add existing's value. Then, for any keys in new_node not in existing, add them.

So, perhaps the helper function should:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    merged = {}
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode):
        merged = existing.copy()
    else:
        merged = existing.copy()
    for key, value in new_node.items():
        if key in merged:
            merged[key] = merge_nodes(merged[key], value)
        else:
            merged[key] = value
    return MappingNode(merged)

Wait, but this assumes that existing is either a MappingNode or a non-MappingNode. If existing is a MappingNode, we copy it, then iterate over new_node's items. For each key in new_node, if it's in merged, merge; else, add it.

Yes, that way, all keys from new_node are added, even if they're not in existing.

But wait, in the case where both are MappingNodes, this approach would correctly merge all keys.

So, let me adjust the helper function.

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key in existing:
            if key in new_node:
                merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
            else:
                merged[key] = new_node[key]
        return merged
    elif isinstance(existing, MappingNode) or isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        # Create a new MappingNode and add all keys from new_node
        merged = MappingNode()
        if isinstance(existing, MappingNode):
            merged.update(existing)
        merged.update(new_node)
        return merged
    else:
        return new_node

Wait, but this might not handle all cases correctly. For example, if existing is a MappingNode and new_node is not, then we create a new MappingNode, add existing's data, then add new_node's data. But new_node is not a MappingNode, so adding it as a key with its value would just set it as a non-MappingNode.

Wait, but in the helper function, new_node can be a non-MappingNode. So, when we do merged.update(new_node), it will add the key-value pairs, where the values are not MappingNodes.

But in the main loop, when we assign result[key] = merge_nodes(...), which can return a MappingNode or a non-MappingNode, depending on the helper function.

But in the main function, we're adding to result as either a MappingNode or a non-MappingNode.

Wait, but in the helper function, when one is a MappingNode and the other is not, we create a new MappingNode, adding the existing's data and the new_node's data. So, the merged node would have some keys as MappingNodes and others as non-MappingNodes.

But when we call result[key] = merged, which is a MappingNode, but in the next iteration, if another node comes in with the same key, it would be a non-MappingNode, and the helper function would merge it with the existing MappingNode.

Wait, perhaps this is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the helper function should always return a MappingNode if at least one of the inputs is a MappingNode. But in the case where new_node is a non-MappingNode, the helper function would create a MappingNode with the merged data, including the new_node's key as a non-MappingNode.

Yes, that should work.

So, the helper function can be written as:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key in existing:
            if key in new_node:
                merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
            else:
                merged[key] = new_node[key]
        return merged
    elif isinstance(existing, MappingNode) or isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        merged = MappingNode()
        if isinstance(existing, MappingNode):
            merged.update(existing)
        if isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
            merged.update(new_node)
        else:
            merged[new_node.key] = new_node.value  # Wait, no, new_node is a node, not a key-value pair.
        # Wait, no, new_node is a node, which can be a MappingNode or a non-MappingNode.
        # So, if new_node is a non-MappingNode, we need to add it as a key in the merged node.
        # So, perhaps:
        if isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
            merged.update(new_node)
        else:
            merged[new_node.key] = new_node
        return merged
    else:
        return new_node

Wait, but new_node is a node, not a dictionary. So, perhaps in the helper function, when new_node is a non-MappingNode, we add it as a single key-value pair to the merged node.

Wait, but in the helper function, when one of the nodes is a MappingNode and the other is not, we create a new MappingNode, add the existing's data, then add the new_node's data as a single key-value pair.

Wait, but new_node could have multiple key-value pairs. So, perhaps the helper function should treat new_node as a dictionary, but if it's not a MappingNode, it's treated as a single key-value pair.

Wait, but in the function signature, nodes are MappingNodes, so new_node is a MappingNode. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should always treat new_node as a MappingNode, but if it's not, it's converted into a MappingNode with the same data.

But that might not be necessary because the helper function is called only when the key exists in the result, and the result is a MappingNode.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should be:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key in existing:
            if key in new_node:
                merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
            else:
                merged[key] = new_node[key]
        return merged
    elif isinstance(existing, MappingNode) or isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        # Create a new MappingNode and add both
        merged = MappingNode()
        if isinstance(existing, MappingNode):
            merged.update(existing)
        if isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
            merged.update(new_node)
        else:
            # If new_node is not a MappingNode, add it as a key-value pair
            merged[new_node.key] = new_node
        return merged
    else:
        return new_node

Wait, but new_node could be a MappingNode or not. So, if it's a MappingNode, we add all its key-value pairs. If it's not, we add it as a single key-value pair.

But in the helper function, when we have existing as a MappingNode and new_node as a non-MappingNode, we create a new MappingNode, add the existing's data, then add the new_node as a single key-value pair.

Yes, that should work.

So, putting it all together, the helper function would correctly merge the nodes.

But wait, in the helper function, when we do merged.update(new_node), that would add all key-value pairs from new_node, which is a MappingNode. But if new_node is a non-MappingNode, we need to treat it as a single key-value pair.

Wait, no. Because in the main function, each node is a MappingNode. So, perhaps the helper function can assume that new_node is a MappingNode.

Wait, but in the main function, when we assign result[key] = merge_nodes(result[key], node), node is a MappingNode. So, perhaps the helper function can assume that new_node is a MappingNode.

So, perhaps the helper function can be simplified to handle only cases where new_node is a MappingNode.

So, the helper function becomes:

def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
    if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
        merged = MappingNode()
        for key in existing:
            if key in new_node:
                merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
            else:
                merged[key] = new_node[key]
        return merged
    else:
        # If new_node is a MappingNode, but existing is not, return new_node
        # If existing is a MappingNode, but new_node is not, return existing
        # If both are not MappingNodes, return new_node
        if isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
            return new_node
        else:
            return existing

Wait, but this doesn't handle the case where existing is a MappingNode and new_node is a non-MappingNode. In that case, the helper function returns existing, which is correct because we keep the latter.

Similarly, if existing is not a MappingNode and new_node is, it returns new_node.

But when both are MappingNodes, it merges them.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, with this helper function, the code should work.

Testing the helper function:

Case 1: Both are MappingNodes.

existing = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, new_node = {'a': 3, 'c':4}

merged should be {'a': merge(1,3), 'b':2, 'c':4}

Which the helper function correctly does.

Case 2: existing is MappingNode, new_node is not.

existing = {'a': 1}, new_node = 2

merged returns existing, which is correct.

Case 3: existing is not, new_node is.

existing = 2, new_node = {'a':3}

merged returns new_node, which is correct.

Yes, this should handle all cases.

So, the final code is:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    def merge_nodes(existing, new_node):
        if isinstance(existing, MappingNode) and isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
            merged = MappingNode()
            for key in existing:
                if key in new_node:
                    merged[key] = merge_nodes(existing[key], new_node[key])
                else:
                    merged[key] = new_node[key]
            return merged
        else:
            if isinstance(new_node, MappingNode):
                return new_node
            else:
                return existing

    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        if key in result:
            result[key] = merge_nodes(result[key], node)
        else:
            result[key] = node
    return result

But wait, in the helper function, when new_node is a MappingNode and existing is not, it returns new_node. But what if new_node has a key that's not in existing? It would add that key. But if existing is not a MappingNode, it's just a value. So, when merged, it would be a regular value, not a MappingNode.

But in the main function, when we assign result[key] = merge_nodes(...), which can be a MappingNode or a non-MappingNode, the next iteration will handle it correctly.

Yes, this should work.

But I need to make sure that the helper function correctly handles the cases where new_node is a MappingNode or not.

Wait, in the helper function, when existing is a MappingNode and new_node is not, it returns existing, which is a MappingNode. So, when the helper function is called again with existing as a MappingNode and new_node as non-MappingNode, it will return existing again. That's correct because we keep the latter, which is existing.

Similarly, when existing is not a MappingNode and new_node is, it returns new_node, which is correct.

Yes, this should handle all cases correctly.
