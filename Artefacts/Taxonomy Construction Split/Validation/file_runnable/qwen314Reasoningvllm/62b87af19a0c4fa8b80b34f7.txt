Okay, I need to write a Python function called difference that takes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, and returns a new dictionary with items from d1 that are not in d2. The level parameter is optional and defaults to -1. Hmm, what does the level parameter mean here? The docstring says it's for returning items not contained in d2, but maybe level is for nested dictionaries? Like, if level is -1, it checks all levels, but if it's a specific number, it only checks up to that level?

Wait, the original function signature doesn't have any parameters other than d1, d2, and level. The docstring doesn't mention nested dictionaries, though. Maybe the level parameter is for something else. Or perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding. Let me think again.

The user's docstring says "return a dictionary with items from d1 not contained in d2." So, the standard difference between two dictionaries. But in Python, the standard way to do that is to iterate through the keys of d1 and check if they are not in d2. However, the level parameter is confusing here. Maybe it's a mistake, and the user didn't intend for it to be there? Or maybe they want to handle nested dictionaries up to a certain level?

Alternatively, maybe the level is for specifying the depth of comparison. For example, if the dictionaries are nested, and level=0 means only top-level keys, level=1 means one level deep, etc. But the docstring doesn't mention that. The original problem might have had a different intention.

Wait, the user provided the function signature with level=-1. The docstring doesn't mention it, so perhaps the level is a red herring, or maybe it's a parameter that's not used in the current problem. But the user wants me to generate code based on the given signature and docstring, so I have to include it.

But how does level affect the difference? Maybe the user intended for the function to handle nested dictionaries, and the level parameter determines how deep to check. For example, if level is -1, it checks all levels, otherwise, it checks up to the specified level. However, without more information, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter is not relevant here, and the user made a mistake in including it. But since the function signature includes it, I need to account for it. However, the docstring doesn't mention it. That's a problem. Maybe the level is for something else, like a version number or a specific context not explained here.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a function that compares dictionaries at a certain level, but given the lack of details, maybe the level parameter is not needed for the basic difference. Maybe it's a leftover from a previous version. But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring says to return items from d1 not in d2, which is the standard set difference for keys.

So, perhaps the level parameter is not used in this function. But that seems odd. Maybe the user wants to handle nested dictionaries, and level is the depth. For example, if level is 0, compare top-level keys. If level is 1, compare first-level nested dicts, etc. But how to implement that?

Alternatively, maybe the level is a typo and should be something else. But since I can't ask the user, I have to proceed with the given info.

Assuming that the level parameter is not required for the basic difference, but the user included it in the signature. However, the docstring doesn't mention it, so perhaps the level is a mistake. But the user might have intended for it to be part of the function. Maybe the function is supposed to work with nested dictionaries, and level determines how deep to go.

Let me think of an example. Suppose d1 is {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2}}, and d2 is {'a': 3, 'b': {'c': 4}}. The difference would be {'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2}} if we compare all levels. But if level is 0, then only the top-level keys are considered. So, the difference would be {'a': 1} if 'a' is different, but if the keys are the same, maybe it's not included. Wait, the function's purpose is to return items from d1 not contained in d2. So, perhaps it's checking for keys present in d1 but not in d2, regardless of the value. Or maybe it's checking for key-value pairs.

But the standard difference between two dictionaries is usually based on keys. For example, dict1 - dict2 would be the keys in dict1 not in dict2. However, the user's docstring says "items from d1 not contained in d2." So maybe they want to check both keys and values. But that's not standard. For example, if a key exists in both, but the value is different, should it be included? Or only if the key is not present in d2 at all?

The wording is a bit ambiguous. The term "items" could refer to key-value pairs. But in that case, the function would need to check for each key in d1 whether the corresponding value in d2 is different. However, the docstring says "not contained in d2," which might imply that if the key exists in d2 but with a different value, it's still considered as contained. So perhaps the function is to return a dictionary with keys present in d1 but not in d2. That would be the standard set difference.

But then why is the level parameter there? Maybe the user intended for the function to handle nested dictionaries, and the level parameter is for specifying the depth. For example, if level is -1, it checks all levels, otherwise, only up to that level. But how to implement that?

Alternatively, maybe the level is a parameter that's not used in this function, and the user made a mistake. But I need to follow the given signature. Since the docstring doesn't mention level, perhaps it's a mistake. But I can't assume that. Maybe the level is for something else, like a version or a specific context.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a function that works with nested dictionaries, and the level is the depth. But without more information, I have to make an assumption. Let's proceed under the assumption that the level is not needed for the basic difference, and perhaps it's a leftover parameter. However, the user might have intended for it to be used. Maybe the function is supposed to return the difference at a certain level of nesting.

Wait, maybe the level is for comparing the dictionaries recursively. For example, if level is -1, compare all levels, else compare only up to that level. But how to handle that? Let me think of a way to implement that.

But given that the user hasn't provided any more details, perhaps the level parameter is not relevant here, and the function is supposed to return the standard difference between the two dictionaries. So, the code would be something like:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    return {k: v for k, v in d1.items() if k not in d2}

But that ignores the level parameter. However, since the docstring doesn't mention it, maybe the level is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended for the level to be used in some way, but the docstring is incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for a specific use case, like comparing only certain levels of nested data. But without more info, it's hard to tell. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring doesn't mention level, so perhaps the level is not part of the required functionality. Maybe it's a parameter that's not used, but the user included it by mistake. However, I should not ignore parameters unless instructed otherwise.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for a different kind of comparison. For example, if the dictionaries are part of a multi-level structure, and level indicates how deep to check. But again, without more context, this is guesswork.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the standard difference between two dictionaries, ignoring the level parameter since the docstring doesn't mention it. But that would be incorrect if the level is supposed to be used. However, the user might have made a mistake in the function signature. Alternatively, maybe the level is for a different purpose, like a version number, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended for the function to return the difference in terms of key-value pairs, not just keys. For example, if a key exists in both, but the values are different, then include that key in the result. But that's more like a deep difference. However, the docstring says "not contained in d2," which might imply that if the key exists in d2, even with a different value, it's considered contained. So, the function would return keys present in d1 but not in d2.

In that case, the code is straightforward. But the presence of the level parameter is confusing. Maybe the user intended to have a recursive function that checks nested dictionaries up to a certain level. Let me think of how to handle that.

For example, if level is -1, then check all levels recursively. If level is 0, check only the top-level. If level is 1, check top-level and one level deep, etc. But how to implement that.

So, the function would need to recursively check the dictionaries, but the level parameter controls the depth. However, the docstring doesn't mention this. So, perhaps the user intended for the level parameter to be part of the function but forgot to update the docstring. But since I can't ask, I have to proceed with the given info.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for something else, like a specific key path. But again, not sure.

Given that the user's docstring is very brief and doesn't mention the level parameter, perhaps the correct approach is to write the standard difference between the two dictionaries, ignoring the level parameter. But that would be odd. However, the user might have included the level parameter by mistake. But since the function signature includes it, I need to include it in the code.

Wait, perhaps the level is a parameter that's not used in the current implementation. Maybe the user is planning to extend the function later. But the current task is to generate code based on the given signature and docstring. Since the docstring doesn't mention level, perhaps it's a mistake. But I can't change the parameters. So, the code must include the level parameter, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the level is for comparing only certain levels of the dictionary. For example, if the dictionaries are part of a data structure where each level has a specific meaning. But without knowing, perhaps the level is not used, and the code can just ignore it. But that's not good practice.

Alternatively, maybe the level is a typo for 'depth' or something else. But I have to work with what's given.

In the absence of more information, perhaps the correct approach is to write the function that returns the keys present in d1 but not in d2, and ignore the level parameter. However, that would not use the level parameter. But the user might have intended for it to be used. Maybe the level is for a different kind of comparison, like checking if the value is a dictionary and only considering that level.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for a specific version of the function. For example, if level is -1, perform a shallow difference, otherwise, a deep one. But again, without more info, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended for the level parameter to be part of the function but forgot to mention it in the docstring. However, the original problem might be expecting a standard difference function. Let me check the standard way.

In Python, the difference between two dictionaries (keys in d1 not in d2) can be done with a dictionary comprehension. So, the code would be:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    return {k: v for k, v in d1.items() if k not in d2}

But the level parameter is not used here. However, the user might have intended for it to be used. Maybe the level is for handling nested dictionaries. Let's think of a scenario where level is used. For example, if the dictionaries are nested, and we want to check up to a certain level of nesting.

But how to implement that. Let's say level is the maximum depth to check. For example, if level is 0, check only the top-level keys. If level is 1, check top-level and first-level nested dicts. But this requires a recursive approach.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for comparing the values as well. For example, if level is -1, compare the entire structure, but if it's a specific level, compare only up to that depth. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the level is not relevant, and the user made a mistake. In that case, the code would be as simple as the dictionary comprehension above. However, the presence of the level parameter might be a hint that the function is supposed to handle nested dictionaries. For example, in some contexts, people might have functions that compare nested dictionaries with a certain depth.

But without more details, I can't be certain. However, since the user hasn't provided any examples or further explanation, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the standard difference between the keys of the two dictionaries, and leave the level parameter as a placeholder, even if it's not used. But that's not ideal.

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter is for a specific use case, like a version number. But that's not related to the difference of dictionaries.

Wait, perhaps the level is for the depth of recursion. For example, if the dictionaries are nested, and the level determines how deep to check for differences. But the docstring says "items from d1 not contained in d2," which could imply that if a key exists in d2 but with a different value, it's considered as contained. So, the function should return keys in d1 that are not present in d2, regardless of the value. But then, the level parameter is still unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the level is a parameter that's not used in this function. The user might have included it by mistake. But I need to generate code that includes it. However, in Python, parameters are part of the function definition, so even if not used, they need to be included.

But the user's docstring doesn't mention level. Maybe the original function was supposed to have a different docstring. However, I have to follow the given instructions.

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to write a function that returns the keys present in d1 but not in d2, and include the level parameter as part of the function signature, even if it's not used. However, that would be incorrect if the level is supposed to be used. But since the user hasn't provided any more info, I'll proceed with that.

Wait, but the user might have intended for the level to be used. Let me think again. Maybe the level is for comparing the dictionaries in a way that considers nested structures. For example, if the dictionaries have nested dictionaries, and we want to check if the entire nested structure is not present in d2. But how?

Alternatively, the function could be designed to return a new dictionary where for each key in d1, if the value is not present in d2, or if it's a dictionary and the difference at that level is non-empty. But again, without knowing, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for a specific type of comparison, like checking if the value is a certain type. But that's not clear.

Given that I can't ask for clarification, and the user's docstring is minimal, I think the safest bet is to write a function that returns the keys in d1 not in d2, and include the level parameter as per the signature. However, since the parameter is not used, perhaps the user made a mistake. But the code must be generated as per the given signature and docstring.

Alternatively, perhaps the level is for a different purpose, like the depth of the dictionary. But I can't think of a standard use case for that.

In the end, the most straightforward implementation based on the docstring is to return a dictionary with keys from d1 that are not in d2. So, the code would be:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    """
    Return a dictionary with items from d1 not contained in d2.
    """
    return {k: v for k, v in d1.items() if k not in d2}

But the level parameter is not used. However, the user might have intended for it to be used. Maybe the level is for a different kind of difference, like checking for value differences. But the docstring says "not contained in d2," which implies that the presence of the key is what matters, not the value.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for a different kind of comparison. For example, if the dictionaries are part of a hierarchical structure, and level refers to the hierarchy level. But again, without more info, it's impossible to know.

Given the lack of information, I'll proceed with the standard implementation, ignoring the level parameter. But I need to make sure that the code is correct. However, the user might have intended for the level to be used. Maybe the function is supposed to handle nested dictionaries and the level determines how deep to check.

Let me try to think of a recursive approach. For example, if the dictionaries are nested, and we want to check for keys at each level. But how would the level parameter influence that?

Suppose level is the maximum depth to check. For example, level=-1 means check all levels. So, the function would recursively check each level up to the specified depth. But how to implement that.

But the docstring says "items from d1 not contained in d2," which is a bit vague. If the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key in d1 is not present in d2 at any level, then the code would need to recursively check. However, that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for comparing the values as well. For example, if level is 0, compare the top-level keys. If level is 1, compare the top-level keys and their values. But again, not sure.

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the user intended for the level parameter to be ignored, and the function is just a simple difference. So, the code would be as I wrote before. But I should check if that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the level is for a specific use case, like comparing only the top-level items when level is 0, and deeper when level is higher. But without examples, it's hard to code.

Since the user hasn't provided any examples or further details, I think the best approach is to proceed with the standard dictionary difference based on keys, and include the level parameter as per the signature, even if it's not used. The user might have intended to have a more complex function but forgot to update the docstring. But the code must match the given signature and docstring.

So, the final code would be:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    """
    Return a dictionary with items from d1 not contained in d2.
    """
    return {k: v for k, v in d1.items() if k not in d2}

But that's not using the level parameter. However, the user might have intended for it to be used. Maybe the level is for a different kind of comparison, like checking if the value is a dictionary and then going deeper. But again, without knowing, it's hard to code.

Alternatively, perhaps the level is for a specific version of the function. For example, in some contexts, level could be used to indicate the type of difference, but that's unclear.

In conclusion, I'll proceed with the standard implementation, assuming that the level parameter is either a mistake or not required for the current task. The code will return the keys in d1 not in d2, and the level parameter is included in the function signature as given.
