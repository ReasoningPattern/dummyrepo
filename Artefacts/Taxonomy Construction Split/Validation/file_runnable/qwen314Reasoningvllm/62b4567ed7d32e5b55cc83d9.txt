Okay, I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that merges nodes with duplicate keys. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. Hmm, so first, I should figure out what a MappingNode is. Maybe it's a class or a type that represents a mapping, like a dictionary. But since the user hasn't provided that, I'll assume that nodes are some kind of objects that have keys and values, and perhaps a way to check if they are mapping nodes.

Wait, the function takes a list of nodes. Each node probably has a key and a value. The goal is to merge them such that if multiple nodes have the same key, their values are merged. But for MappingNode values, we need to do a deep merge. For non-MappingNode values, just take the last one.

So, the approach would be to iterate through each node, track the keys, and when a key is encountered again, check if the existing value is a MappingNode. If it is, then merge the new value into it recursively. If not, replace it with the new value.

But how do I represent the nodes? Maybe each node is a dictionary with 'key' and 'value' fields. Or perhaps the nodes are objects with attributes. The problem statement isn't clear. Since the user hasn't provided any specific structure, I'll make an assumption here. Let's say each node is a dictionary-like object with 'key' and 'value' attributes. Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of tuples (key, value). But given the term "MappingNode", perhaps they are objects that have a 'mapping' attribute or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are instances of a class that has a key and a value, and the value can be a MappingNode (like a nested dictionary). But without knowing the actual structure, I need to make some assumptions. Let me think of a common scenario where this might be used. For example, in YAML parsing, there's a concept of nodes, and MappingNode represents a dictionary. So perhaps the nodes are from a YAML library, like PyYAML's nodes.

But since the user hasn't specified, maybe I should treat each node as having a key and a value, and the value can be a dictionary (Mapping) or not. So the function needs to process a list of nodes, each with a key and a value. The merging process would be:

- Create a result dictionary.
- For each node in the nodes list:
   - If the key is not in the result, add it directly.
   - If the key exists and the existing value is a Mapping (like a dict), then recursively merge the new value into it.
   - If the existing value is not a Mapping, replace it with the new value (since the last one remains).

Wait, but how do I check if a value is a MappingNode? Maybe the user expects that the nodes are of a certain type, but since it's not given, perhaps I should assume that the value is a Mapping if it's a dict or similar. Or maybe the nodes themselves are MappingNodes, and their value is something else. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and each node's key is the dictionary's key. But the function's name is deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that each node might be a structure that can have nested mappings. For example, if a node's value is another node (a MappingNode), then we need to merge those as well.

Wait, perhaps the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge them deeply. So, for example, if two nodes have the same key, and their values are dictionaries, then merge those dictionaries recursively. If the values are not dictionaries, then the last occurrence overwrites the previous ones.

So the function would take a list of nodes (each being a dictionary), and merge them into a single dictionary. For each key in the nodes, if the value is a dict, merge it recursively. Otherwise, take the last value.

But how to handle the order? The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So the order of processing the nodes matters. The function should process the nodes in the order they are given, and when there's a conflict, the last node's value is kept.

So, the steps could be:

Initialize a result dictionary.

Iterate over each node in the nodes list:

   For each key-value pair in the node:

      If the key is not in the result, add it.

      Else:

         If the existing value in result is a Mapping (like a dict), then recursively merge the new value into it.

         Else, replace the existing value with the new one.

But wait, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that each node might be a MappingNode itself. Maybe the nodes are a list of MappingNodes, and each has a key and a value. But again, without knowing the actual structure, I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and each node is a dictionary that represents a mapping. Then, the function is to merge all these dictionaries, with the rule that if a key exists in multiple nodes, and the value is a dict, then merge them deeply. Otherwise, take the last value.

So, for example, if nodes is [ {'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'b': {'c': 3}} ], then merging would result in {'a': 2, 'b': {'c': 3}}.

But if nodes is [ {'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}} ], then the merged result would be {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}.

So, the function needs to process each node in order, and for each key, if the existing value is a dict, merge the new value into it. Otherwise, replace it.

So, the code would be something like:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but that's assuming that each node is a dictionary. However, the original function signature says 'nodes' is passed as an argument. Maybe each node is an object with a 'key' and 'value' attribute. So perhaps the code should be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        value = node.value
        if key in result:
            existing = result[key]
            if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
            else:
                result[key] = value
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result

But then, how does the function handle the case where the existing value is a MappingNode and the new value is also a MappingNode? Maybe the function is supposed to merge their contents. However, without knowing the actual structure of the nodes, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of mappings (like dicts), and the function is supposed to merge them. The original function's docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys", which implies that each node has a key and a value. So perhaps the nodes are a list of (key, value) pairs, but that would be a list of tuples. However, the function's parameter is called 'nodes', which is plural, and the docstring mentions "duplicate keys", so perhaps each node is a mapping (like a dict) that contributes multiple key-value pairs.

Wait, maybe the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary represents a node's key-value pairs. The function is to merge all these dictionaries into one, with the deep merge rule.

In that case, the code would be as I wrote before, iterating through each node's items and merging into the result.

But the problem says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So, for example, if two nodes have the same key, their values are merged. But if the value is a MappingNode (like a dict), then merge them deeply. Otherwise, take the last one.

So the code would need to process each node in the list, and for each key in the node, check if it's already in the result. If it is, and both existing and new values are mappings, then recursively merge them. Otherwise, replace with the new value.

But how to handle the case where the existing value is a mapping and the new value is not? For example, if existing is a dict and new value is a string. Then, according to the docstring, the last value (the string) would replace the existing dict. Wait, but the docstring says "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So maybe if the existing value is a MappingNode and the new value is not, then the new value replaces the existing one. Or perhaps the existing value is a MappingNode, and the new value is not, then the new value is just taken as the last one.

But the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the docstring:

"Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains."

Ah, so when there's a collision (same key), if the values are non-MappingNode, then the last one remains. If they are MappingNodes, then merge them. So, perhaps the function is supposed to check if the existing value and the new value are MappingNodes. If both are, then deep merge. If either is not, then take the new value.

Wait, but the wording is "colliding keys with non-MappingNode values"â€”so if the colliding keys have values that are not MappingNodes, then take the last. If they are MappingNodes, then merge them.

So the logic is: for each key, if the existing value and the new value are both MappingNodes, then merge them recursively. Otherwise, replace the existing value with the new one (since the last one remains).

But how to represent MappingNode? Maybe it's a class, but since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps in the context of the problem, a MappingNode is a dictionary. So, for example, if the value is a dict, then it's considered a MappingNode.

So, the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but in this code, the nodes are passed as a list of dictionaries. The function is supposed to merge them. However, the function is called deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that each node might be a structure that can have children nodes. But again, without knowing the actual structure, I have to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are a list of objects that have a 'key' and 'value' attribute, and the value can be another node (a MappingNode) or a primitive value.

In that case, the code would need to check if the value is a MappingNode. But how to do that? Maybe there's a is_mapping_node function or a check for a specific type.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should assume that any value that is a dictionary is a MappingNode. So, the code would check if the value is a dict. If so, then merge recursively. Otherwise, take the last value.

But the original function's parameters are 'nodes'â€”so maybe each node is a single key-value pair. For example, nodes is a list of objects where each has a key and a value. So the function would process each node in the list, and for each, check if the key already exists in the result. If it does, and both existing and new values are dicts, then merge them. Otherwise, take the new value.

In that case, the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        value = node.value
        if key in result:
            existing = result[key]
            if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
            else:
                result[key] = value
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result

But this requires that each node has 'key' and 'value' attributes. However, if the nodes are dictionaries, then perhaps the code should be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But then, the function is called with a list of nodes, each of which is a dictionary. But the function is supposed to return the merged result.

Wait, but in the first example, if the nodes are dictionaries, then merging them would be done by iterating through each node's items. However, the function's name suggests that it's merging nodes, which might be more complex structures.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of mappings (like dicts) and the function is supposed to merge them into a single mapping, with the deep merge logic. So the code would be similar to the above.

But in that case, the function would take a list of dicts and return a merged dict. However, the function's name is 'deep_merge_nodes', which might imply that each node is a separate entity with a key and value, not a dict.

This is a bit confusing. Since the user hasn't provided any specific structure for the nodes, perhaps the code should be written with the assumption that each node is a dictionary, and the function merges all the dictionaries in the nodes list, with the deep merge rule.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of key-value pairs, and each node is a single key-value. For example, nodes could be a list of tuples (key, value). But the docstring says "duplicate keys", which would imply that each node contributes one key. So, for example, if nodes is a list of (key, value) pairs, then the function would merge them into a single dict, where for duplicate keys, if the value is a dict, merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last one.

But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard to tell. However, given the function's name and the docstring, perhaps the intended approach is to merge a list of dictionaries, with the deep merge logic.

Another thing to consider: the function is supposed to return the merged result. So, perhaps the nodes are a list of mappings, and the function merges them into one.

In that case, the code would be as follows:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But this code assumes that each node is a dictionary. However, the original function's parameters are called 'nodes', which might be a list of objects, not dicts. But given the lack of information, this is a possible approach.

Alternatively, if nodes are objects with a key and value, perhaps the code should be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        value = node.value
        if key in result:
            existing = result[key]
            if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
            else:
                result[key] = value
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result

But again, without knowing the actual structure of the nodes, this is speculative.

Another possibility is that the nodes are a list of mappings (like dicts), and the function is supposed to merge them. So the code would be as above.

But perhaps the user is referring to a specific library, like PyYAML, where nodes are objects with a 'key' and 'value' attribute. For example, in PyYAML, a MappingNode is a node that represents a mapping (dictionary). But again, without knowing the exact structure, this is hard.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of key-value pairs, and each value can be a MappingNode (like a dict) or not. The function is supposed to merge them into a single dict, handling the cases where the value is a dict by merging recursively.

In that case, the code would be as I wrote earlier.

But since the user hasn't provided any specific details about the node structure, I think the best approach is to assume that each node is a dictionary, and the function merges them. So the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    Merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        for key, value in node.items():
            if key in result:
                existing = result[key]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                    result[key] = deep_merge_nodes([existing, value])
                else:
                    result[key] = value
            else:
                result[key] = value
    return result

But wait, the function is called with a list of nodes. If each node is a dict, then this code would work. However, the function's name is 'deep_merge_nodes', which might imply that nodes can have children nodes. But again, without more info, this is the best guess.

Another thing: the function's docstring says "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So, if two nodes have the same key, and their values are not MappingNodes, then the last one is kept. If the value is a MappingNode, then merge them.

So, in the code, when a key is already present in the result, check if the existing value is a MappingNode (dict) and the new value is also a MappingNode. If so, merge them. Otherwise, take the new value.

But how to check if a value is a MappingNode? If the user is using a specific library, like PyYAML, then perhaps the nodes are instances of MappingNode. But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code should check if the value is a dict.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are objects with a 'value' that can be a MappingNode or not. So, perhaps the code should check if the value is an instance of a certain class. But without knowing that class, this is impossible. Therefore, the code must assume that a MappingNode is a dict.

So, the code would proceed as follows: for each node in the list, iterate through its key-value pairs. For each key, if it's already in the result, check if both existing and new values are dicts. If yes, merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the new value.

This code would handle the merging as per the docstring. However, the function is called 'deep_merge_nodes', which might suggest that nodes can be nested. But in the example code, the function is merging the values of the nodes, which are dicts.

Another edge case: what if the existing value is a dict, but the new value is not? Then, replace it with the new value. Similarly, if existing is not a dict and new is a dict, then replace with the new dict.

So, the code above would handle that.

Testing this code with some examples:

Example 1:
nodes = [{'a': 1}, {'a': 2}, {'b': {'c': 3}}]
The merged result would be {'a': 2, 'b': {'c': 3}}.

Example 2:
nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': {'c': 2}}]
The merged result would be {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}.

Example 3:
nodes = [{'a': {'b': 1}}, {'a': 2}]
The merged result would be {'a': 2}.

This seems to align with the docstring.

So, the code would be as written. However, the function's parameter is 'nodes', which is a list. But in the code, each node is a dict. So, the function is expecting a list of dicts. That's probably the intended usage.

So, the final code would be the one I wrote earlier.
