Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _group_files_by_xml_filename based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it groups files by xmls and returns a dictionary. The parameters are source, xmls, and files.

Hmm, maybe the xmls are filenames, and the files are some related files. The goal is to group the files under each xml filename. So, the function probably takes a list of XML filenames and a list of files, then maps each file to its corresponding XML filename.

Wait, the parameters are source, xmls, and files. The source might be a directory or some base path. The xmls could be a list of XML file names, and files are other files that need to be grouped by those XMLs. How do they relate? Maybe each file has a corresponding XML file, and the function is grouping them based on that.

So, the approach would be to create a dictionary where each key is an XML filename from the xmls list, and the value is a list of files associated with that XML. But how do we determine which files belong to which XML?

Perhaps the files have names that include the XML filename. For example, if the XML is 'data.xml', maybe there are files like 'data_1.txt', 'data_2.txt', etc. So the function would look for files that share the same base name as the XML files, excluding the extension.

Alternatively, maybe the source is a directory, and the files are in that directory. The XMLs are filenames, and the function is grouping the files by their corresponding XML. But how? Maybe each file has a metadata link to an XML file, or the XML files are in a specific location relative to the source.

Wait, the parameters are source, xmls, and files. The function's name suggests that it's grouping files by the XML filename. Let me think of an example. Suppose xmls is a list of XML file names, and files is a list of other files. For each XML file in xmls, find all files in 'files' that are associated with it. Maybe the files have the same name as the XML but different extensions.

So, the function might process each file in 'files' and check if it's associated with any XML in the xmls list. If the file's name (without extension) matches an XML filename (also without extension), then group them.

But how to handle the source? Maybe the source is a directory path, and the files are paths relative to that source. Or perhaps the source is used to construct the paths for the XML files. For example, if the source is a directory, then the XML files are located in that directory, and the other files are in another location, but their names correspond to the XMLs.

Alternatively, maybe the source is a string that's part of the file names. For example, if the source is 'projectA', then files might be named 'projectA_data.txt', and the XMLs are 'data.xml'. So the grouping is based on the common part of the filenames.

Wait, the function's name is _group_files_by_xml_filename. So perhaps the idea is that each file in 'files' is associated with an XML file, and the XML files are given in the 'xmls' list. The function needs to group the files under each XML based on their filenames.

Let me think of a possible implementation. For each XML in xmls, we can extract the base name (without extension) and then look for files in 'files' that have that base name. For example, if the XML is 'example.xml', then files named 'example.txt', 'example_data.csv' would be grouped under 'example.xml'.

But how to handle different extensions? Maybe the XML filenames are used as keys, and any file in 'files' that has the same name as the XML (but different extension) is grouped under that XML. However, the parameters are source, xmls, and files. The source might be a directory where the XMLs are located, and the files are in another directory. Or maybe the source is a common prefix.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are paths relative to that source. The 'xmls' are the XML filenames, and the function groups the files by their corresponding XML. But I'm not sure. The parameters are a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the function is supposed to group files by xmls. So the xmls are the keys, and the files are the values. But how to map them? Maybe each file has a corresponding XML file, and the function is creating a mapping where each XML is a key, and the associated files are grouped under it.

Another possibility is that the 'files' are being grouped based on their association with the XML files. For example, if the XML files are in a certain directory, and the other files are in another, but they share a common identifier in their names.

Let me think of a way to structure this. The function could create a dictionary where each key is an XML filename from the xmls list, and the value is a list of files that are associated with that XML. The association might be based on the filename without the extension. For example, if the XML is 'image1.xml', then files like 'image1.jpg' or 'image1_data.txt' would be grouped under it.

So, the steps could be:

1. Initialize a dictionary to hold the groups.
2. For each XML file in xmls, extract the base name (without .xml extension).
3. For each file in files, check if its base name (without extension) matches any of the XML base names.
4. If it matches, add the file to the corresponding group in the dictionary.

But how to handle the source parameter? Maybe the source is a directory where the XML files are located, and the files are in another directory. Or perhaps the source is used to construct the file paths. Alternatively, maybe the source is a string that is part of the file names.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are paths relative to that source. Then, for each XML in xmls, the function would look for files in 'files' that have the same name as the XML, but different extensions.

Wait, maybe the 'source' is a directory that contains both XML files and other files. The 'xmls' list is the list of XML filenames in that directory, and the 'files' list is other files. Then, the function groups those other files by their corresponding XML. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a string that's part of the file names. For example, if the source is 'projectA', then the XML files are 'projectA.xml' and the other files are 'projectA_data.txt', etc. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are file paths. The function would process each file, extract the XML filename from it, and group them. But the parameters include xmls as a separate list. That doesn't quite fit.

Wait, the parameters are source, xmls, and files. The function's name suggests that it's grouping the 'files' based on the 'xmls' filenames. So perhaps for each XML in xmls, we need to find all files in 'files' that are associated with that XML. The 'source' might be a directory where the XML files are located, and the 'files' are in another location. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are paths relative to that source. The 'xmls' are the names of XML files, and the function groups the files by their corresponding XML. For example, if a file's path is 'source/folder1/image1.xml', then other files in 'files' that have the same base name (like 'source/folder1/image1.jpg') would be grouped under 'image1.xml'.

But perhaps the 'source' is not directly used in the grouping. Maybe the 'xmls' are the keys, and the 'files' are the values. But how to map them?

Another approach: The function may be intended to group the 'files' list into a dictionary where each key is an XML filename from the 'xmls' list, and the value is a list of files that are associated with that XML. However, the exact method of association isn't clear.

Since the docstring is minimal, perhaps the intended logic is to create a dictionary where each XML in xmls is a key, and the value is a list of files that have the same name as the XML (without the .xml extension). For example, if an XML is 'test.xml', then files named 'test.txt' or 'test.data' would be grouped under it.

In that case, the code would process each XML in xmls, extract the base name (without .xml), and then collect all files in 'files' that have that base name. However, the 'source' parameter isn't used here. That might be a problem.

Wait, maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are file paths. The function could be taking the XML filenames from xmls and grouping the files that are in the same directory as the XML or have some relation.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a string that's part of the filename. For example, if the source is 'projectA', then the XML files are in a certain location, and the other files have the same base name as the XMLs, possibly with different extensions.

But since the parameters are given as source, xmls, and files, perhaps the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are file paths. The function could be grouping the files by their corresponding XML filename, which might be derived from the source or the files' names.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a string that is used to generate the XML filenames. For example, if source is a base path, then the XML files are located in that path, and the other files are in another path. But again, without more context, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'source' is a string that is part of the file names. For example, if the source is 'data', then the XML files are named 'data.xml', and the other files are named 'data_1.txt', 'data_2.txt', etc. Then, the grouping would be based on the common part.

But given that the parameters are source, xmls, and files, and the function's name, I think the most plausible approach is that the 'xmls' are the keys, and each file in 'files' is associated with an XML based on some naming convention. The 'source' might be a directory path, and the files are in that directory. For example, each XML file has a corresponding set of files with the same name but different extensions.

So, the code could be:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    """
    Groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format.
    """
    grouped = {}
    for xml in xmls:
        xml_base = os.path.splitext(xml)[0]
        grouped[xml] = [f for f in files if os.path.splitext(f)[0] == xml_base]
    return grouped

But then the 'source' parameter is not used. That's a problem. Maybe the source is a directory, and the files are paths relative to that directory. So, the function could be using the source to construct the full paths for the XML files, but the grouping is based on the filenames.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'source' is used to determine the directory where the XML files are located, and the 'files' are in another directory. But again, without more context, it's hard to know.

Wait, maybe the 'source' is a directory, and the 'files' are in that directory. The 'xmls' are the XML filenames, and the function groups the other files (non-XML) that share the same base name as the XML files.

In that case, the code would process each XML in xmls, take their base name (without .xml), and collect all files in 'files' that have that base name. The 'source' might not be directly involved in the grouping, but perhaps it's used for something else, like constructing paths.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a string that is part of the filename. For example, if the source is 'projectA', then the XML files are in a directory, and the other files have the same base name as the XMLs, possibly with different extensions.

But since the source is not used in the code, maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps the original code had more context. However, given the current parameters, perhaps the function is supposed to group the 'files' list into a dictionary where each key is an XML filename from xmls, and the value is a list of files that match the XML's base name.

In that case, the code would be as I wrote before, but the 'source' parameter is not used. That might be an issue. Maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are relative paths. The function could be using the source to create full paths for the XMLs and files, but the grouping is still based on the base names.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'source' is a directory, and the 'files' are in that directory. The 'xmls' are the names of XML files in the same directory, and the function groups other files (non-XML) by their corresponding XML filename.

But again, without more information, I have to make an assumption. Since the parameters are source, xmls, and files, and the function is supposed to group files by XML filenames, maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are file paths. The function could be grouping the files based on their association with the XML files, perhaps by checking if they are in the same directory as the XML or have some relation.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is used to generate the XML filenames. For example, if the source is a base name, then the XML filenames are constructed from that. But again, the parameters are given, so I have to use them as is.

Another possibility: The 'source' is a directory, and the 'files' are in that directory. The 'xmls' are the names of XML files, and the function groups the other files (non-XML) by their corresponding XML. But how to determine that correspondence?

Maybe the files are associated with the XML files based on their names. For example, if there's an XML file named 'example.xml', then any file named 'example.txt' would be grouped under it.

In that case, the code would process each XML in xmls, take the base name (without .xml), and collect all files in 'files' that have that base name. The 'source' might not be used here. But since the function is called with 'source', perhaps it's part of the file paths.

Wait, maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are relative paths. So, for each XML in xmls, we look for files in 'files' that are in the same directory as the XML. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where the 'source' is a directory containing both XML and other files, and the 'xmls' are the list of XML filenames in that directory. Then, the 'files' could be other files in the same directory, and the function groups them by their corresponding XML.

But again, the exact method is unclear. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the most straightforward approach that uses the parameters as given, even if the 'source' isn't used. Maybe the 'source' is a parameter that's not directly involved in the grouping logic, or perhaps it's a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a string that's part of the file names. For example, if the source is 'data', then the XML files are named 'data.xml', and the other files are named 'data_1.txt', 'data_2.txt', etc. Then, the grouping would be based on the source being a common prefix.

But that's just a guess. Without more context, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's proceed with grouping files by their base name matching the XML's base name, and ignore the 'source' parameter for now. However, the presence of 'source' suggests that it's used in the function.

Wait, maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are in that directory. The 'xmls' are the names of XML files, and the function is grouping the other files (non-XML) in the source directory by their corresponding XML. But again, how?

Alternatively, perhaps the 'source' is a directory, and the 'xmls' are the list of XML files in that directory. The 'files' are other files that need to be grouped based on their association with the XMLs. For example, each XML file has a corresponding set of files with the same name but different extensions. The function could be grouping those files under each XML.

In that case, the code would be:

import os

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    """
    Groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format.
    """
    grouped = {}
    for xml in xmls:
        xml_basename = os.path.splitext(xml)[0]
        grouped[xml] = [f for f in files if os.path.splitext(f)[0] == xml_basename]
    return grouped

But again, the 'source' isn't used here. Maybe the 'source' is used to construct the full path for the XML files, but the grouping is based on the filenames. However, if the 'files' are in the same directory as the XMLs, then the source might be redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'source' is a directory, and the 'files' are relative paths. The function would check if the files are in the same directory as the XMLs. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a string that is part of the file names. For example, if the source is 'projectA', then the XML files are named 'projectA.xml', and the other files are named 'projectA_data.txt', etc. Then, the grouping would be based on the source being part of the filename.

But again, without more info, this is speculative. The user might have intended that the 'source' is not used, or perhaps it's a placeholder. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the code that groups files by their base name matching the XML's base name, even if the 'source' isn't used. But that might not be correct.

Wait, the function's name is _group_files_by_xml_filename. So the key is the XML filename. The 'files' are being grouped under those keys. So for each XML in xmls, collect all files in 'files' that have the same base name as the XML. The 'source' could be a directory path where the XML files are located, but the grouping is based on the filenames of the files.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a directory, and the 'files' are in that directory. The 'xmls' are the names of XML files, and the function groups the other files (non-XML) by their corresponding XML. But again, the code would need to process filenames.

In the absence of more information, I think the most logical approach is to group the 'files' list into a dictionary where each key is an XML filename from the 'xmls' list, and the value is a list of files that have the same base name as the XML. So the code would use os.path.splitext to get the base name of each XML and match it with the base names of the files.

So the code would be:

import os

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    """
    Groups files by xmls and returns data in dict format.
    """
    grouped = {}
    for xml in xmls:
        xml_base = os.path.splitext(xml)[0]
        grouped[xml] = [f for f in files if os.path.splitext(f)[0] == xml_base]
    return grouped

But the 'source' is not used here. Maybe the user intended that the 'source' is used to generate the XML filenames. For example, if the source is a directory, then the XML files are in that directory, and the files are in another directory. However, without knowing how the files are related to the source, it's hard to incorporate it.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a string that is part of the file names. For example, if the source is 'data', then the XML files are named 'data.xml', and the other files are named 'data_1.txt', etc. So the code would check if the file starts with the source.

But that's another assumption. Since the parameters are given as source, xmls, and files, perhaps the 'source' is used to filter the files. For example, only consider files that are in the source directory. But again, without knowing how the files are structured, this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a directory path, and the 'files' are paths relative to that source. So the function would process each XML in xmls, and for each file in files, check if it's associated with that XML. But how?

Maybe the 'source' is a directory, and the 'files' are in that directory. The 'xmls' are the XML filenames. So for each XML, collect all files in the 'files' list that share the same base name as the XML. The 'source' might not be used in this case, but it's part of the parameters.

In that case, the code I wrote earlier would work. However, the presence of the 'source' parameter suggests that it's used. Maybe the 'source' is a directory, and the 'files' are absolute paths. The function would then group them based on their base name compared to the XMLs.

But perhaps the 'source' is not used in this function. Maybe it's a parameter from a larger context, like a parent function that also uses the source. For example, the source could be a directory where the XML files are located, and the files are other files in the same directory. The function then groups those files by their corresponding XML.

In any case, given the ambiguity, the code that uses the xmls and files parameters to group by base name is a possible solution. The 'source' parameter may be a leftover or used elsewhere, but in this function, perhaps it's not needed. However, the user might expect that the source is used.

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is a string that is part of the XML filenames. For example, the XML filenames are constructed with the source. But again, without more info, this is hard.

Given that the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the code that groups the files by their base name matching the XML's base name, even if the 'source' isn't used. That's the most straightforward approach based on the given parameters.
