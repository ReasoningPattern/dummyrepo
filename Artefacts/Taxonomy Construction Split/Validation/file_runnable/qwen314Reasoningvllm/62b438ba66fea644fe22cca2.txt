Okay, I need to write a Python function called deep_merge_nodes that merges nodes with duplicate keys. The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. Hmm, first, I should figure out what a MappingNode is. Oh right, in some YAML libraries, like PyYAML, there's a concept of nodes, and MappingNode represents a mapping (like a dictionary). But maybe the user is using a different library or a custom class. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should assume that MappingNode is a class that has a 'value' attribute which is a dictionary, and other nodes have values that are not dictionaries.

So the function takes a list of nodes. Each node might have a key and a value. The goal is to merge them such that if multiple nodes have the same key, their values are merged. But for non-MappingNode values, the last one in the list takes precedence.

Wait, the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So I think each node has a key, and the value. For nodes with the same key, if their value is a MappingNode, we need to merge them recursively. If not, just take the last value.

So first, I need to process the list of nodes, group them by their keys. Then for each group, if the value is a MappingNode, merge them deeply. Otherwise, take the last one.

But how do I check if a node is a MappingNode? Maybe the nodes are objects with a 'value' attribute, and the type of that value determines if it's a mapping. For example, if the value is a dict, then it's a MappingNode. But maybe the actual class is called MappingNode. Wait, the problem says "non-MappingNode values", so perhaps the nodes are instances of some class, and MappingNode is a subclass that represents mappings. So I need to check if the node's value is an instance of MappingNode.

Wait, but the function is called deep_merge_nodes, so perhaps the nodes are structured in a way that their values can be merged. Maybe each node has a key and a value, and the function is supposed to merge them into a single structure where keys are unique, and for each key, if there are multiple nodes, their values are merged if they are mappings, otherwise take the last one.

So the first step is to iterate through the nodes and collect them by their keys. Let's say each node has a 'key' attribute and a 'value' attribute. Then, for each key, we have a list of values. For each key, if all the values are MappingNodes, we need to merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last value.

Wait, but the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So maybe the nodes are in a list, and each node has a key. For example, if two nodes have the same key, their values are merged. But how are the nodes structured? Maybe the nodes are a list of dictionaries, each with 'key' and 'value' fields. Or maybe they are objects with attributes. The problem is a bit ambiguous here.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are a list of key-value pairs, where each node is a tuple (key, value), and the value can be a MappingNode (which is a dictionary-like structure) or another type. So the function needs to merge these pairs into a single dictionary, where for each key, if there are multiple entries, they are merged if the value is a MappingNode, else take the last one.

Assuming that, here's the approach:

1. Initialize a result dictionary.
2. Iterate through each node in the input list.
3. For each node's key, check if it's already in the result.
4. If not, add it directly.
5. If it is, then check the existing value and the new value.
6. If both are MappingNodes (like dicts), perform a deep merge: recursively merge their values.
7. If either is not a MappingNode, replace the existing value with the new one (since the last one remains).

But how to handle the deep merge? For example, if two MappingNodes have the same key, their values should be merged. So for each key in the list, if the existing value and the new value are both MappingNodes, then we need to merge them. Otherwise, take the new value.

Wait, but the problem says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys". So perhaps the nodes are structured in a way that their keys are the same, and their values need to be merged. So the function is supposed to take a list of nodes, each with a key and a value, and merge them into a single structure where keys are unique, and their values are merged if they are mappings.

But without knowing the exact structure of the nodes, maybe I should make some assumptions. Let's say each node is a dictionary with 'key' and 'value' fields. Or maybe the nodes are objects with 'key' and 'value' attributes. Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of (key, value) pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are a list of elements where each element has a key, and the value is something that can be merged. For example, in a YAML document, nodes might be part of a structure where each has a key and a value. But since the user hasn't provided details, I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary represents a node. But that's unclear. Let me think again.

The function's name is deep_merge_nodes, and the docstring says to merge values for duplicate keys. So perhaps the nodes are a list of key-value pairs, and the function returns a merged dictionary. For example, if two nodes have the same key, and their values are both dictionaries (MappingNodes), then merge them recursively. If the values are not dictionaries, take the last one.

So, assuming that each node is a dictionary with 'key' and 'value' attributes, or perhaps that the nodes are a list of (key, value) pairs, but the problem statement is not clear. Wait, the original function signature is def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):, and the docstring says "merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys".

Wait, perhaps the nodes are a list of objects, each with a 'key' and a 'value' attribute. For example, in some data structure, each node has a key and a value. So the function needs to process this list and merge the values based on their keys.

But without knowing the actual structure, maybe the code is supposed to work with a list of dictionaries, where each has a 'key' and 'value' field. Or maybe the nodes are a list of elements where each element is a key and a value. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Let me consider that each node is a dictionary with 'key' and 'value' fields. So, for example, nodes could be like [{'key': 'a', 'value': {'b': 1}}, {'key': 'a', 'value': {'c': 2}}], and the merged result would be {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}.

But if the values are not MappingNodes, like [{'key': 'a', 'value': 5}, {'key': 'a', 'value': 10}], then the merged value would be 10, the last one.

So the steps would be:

- Create a dictionary to hold the merged results.
- Iterate through each node in the input list.
- For each node's key, check if it's already in the result.
- If not, add it.
- If it is, then check if the existing value and the new value are both MappingNodes (like dicts). If yes, merge them recursively. Otherwise, replace the existing value with the new one.

But how to check if a value is a MappingNode? Maybe in the context of the user's code, MappingNode is a class, and the values are instances of that class. But if I don't have that class, perhaps I can assume that a MappingNode is a dictionary. Alternatively, maybe the user is using a library where MappingNode is a specific type. Since the problem mentions MappingNode, perhaps it's from the ruamel.yaml library, where nodes can be of different types, including MappingNode.

In that case, the value of a MappingNode is a list of key-value pairs. So merging two MappingNodes would involve merging their contents. But how to handle that in Python.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are a list of dictionaries, and the function is supposed to merge them into a single dictionary, with deep merging for nested dictionaries. But the docstring mentions "non-MappingNode values", which suggests that the nodes are objects of some type, and MappingNode is a specific type that can be merged.

This is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function's name and the docstring, I can proceed with the following approach:

Assume that each node has a key and a value. The function will merge the values of nodes with the same key. If the value is a MappingNode (like a dict), then merge them recursively. Otherwise, take the last value.

So, the code would need to:

- Iterate through the nodes, grouping by their keys.
- For each group of nodes with the same key, process their values.
- If the value is a MappingNode, merge all the values in the group recursively.
- Otherwise, take the last value in the group.

But how to represent the nodes? Let's assume that each node is a dictionary with 'key' and 'value' fields. Or perhaps the nodes are objects with 'key' and 'value' attributes. Let me check the original problem again. The user provided the function signature and docstring, but no more context. So perhaps the nodes are a list of key-value pairs, and the function is to merge them into a single dictionary, with the merging rules as specified.

But the term 'MappingNode' is not standard in Python. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps the user is referring to a specific class. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake and they meant 'dict' or 'mapping'.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are a list of elements where each element is a key and a value, and the value can be a dictionary (which is a mapping) or another type. Then, the function is supposed to merge the values for duplicate keys, and if they are dictionaries, merge them deeply, else take the last one.

In that case, the code would look like:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node['key']
        value = node['value']
        if key in result:
            existing = result[key]
            if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                # Deep merge
                merged = {}
                for k, v in existing.items():
                    merged[k] = v
                for k, v in value.items():
                    merged[k] = v
                result[key] = merged
            else:
                # Take the last value
                result[key] = value
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but that's just a shallow merge. For a deep merge, if the existing and new value are both dicts, we need to merge their contents recursively. For example, if existing is {'a': {'b': 1}} and new value is {'a': {'c': 2}}, the merged result should be {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}.

So the merging of two dicts should be done recursively. So the code for merging would need to handle nested dictionaries.

So, to do a deep merge, I can write a helper function that takes two dictionaries and merges them, with the second one overwriting the first for duplicate keys. But in this case, the helper function would need to be called recursively for each nested key.

Alternatively, the helper function could be something like:

def merge_dicts(d1, d2):
    merged = d1.copy()
    for k, v in d2.items():
        if k in merged and isinstance(merged[k], dict) and isinstance(v, dict):
            merged[k] = merge_dicts(merged[k], v)
        else:
            merged[k] = v
    return merged

Then, in the main function, when both existing and new value are dicts, we call this helper.

But in the original problem, the nodes may not be dicts. The function is called deep_merge_nodes, which suggests that the nodes are some kind of data structure that can be merged. However, given the lack of context, I'll proceed with the assumption that each node has a key and a value, and that the value can be a dictionary (which is a mapping) or another type.

So the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        value = node.value
        if key in result:
            existing = result[key]
            if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                # Deep merge
                merged = {}
                for k, v in existing.items():
                    merged[k] = v
                for k, v in value.items():
                    merged[k] = v
                result[key] = merged
            else:
                # Take the last value
                result[key] = value
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result

Wait, but in this code, I'm assuming that each node has 'key' and 'value' attributes. So the nodes are objects, perhaps instances of a class with those attributes. But if the nodes are, for example, tuples (key, value), then the code would need to be adjusted.

Alternatively, if the nodes are a list of dictionaries, then the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node['key']
        value = node['value']
        if key in result:
            existing = result[key]
            if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                # Deep merge
                merged = {}
                for k, v in existing.items():
                    merged[k] = v
                for k, v in value.items():
                    merged[k] = v
                result[key] = merged
            else:
                # Take the last value
                result[key] = value
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result

But again, without knowing the structure of the nodes, this is speculative. However, given the docstring, perhaps the nodes are objects with 'key' and 'value' attributes. So the code would use node.key and node.value.

But how to handle the deep merge? The current code for merging two dicts is a shallow merge, where the second dict's values overwrite the first. However, if the existing value is a dict and the new value is a dict, then we need to merge them recursively. For example, if existing is {'a': {'b': 1}} and new value is {'a': {'c': 2}}, the merged result should be {'a': {'b': 1, 'c': 2}}. But the code above would do that, because for each key in existing, it's copied into merged, then for each key in value, it's added. So if the existing and new value are both dicts, the code would merge them by updating the existing dict with the new one's keys. Wait, but that's a shallow merge. For example, if existing is {'a': {'b': 1}} and new value is {'a': {'b': 2}}, then the merged would be {'a': {'b': 2}}. But if the existing and new value are both dicts, and their keys are nested, then this approach would not merge them deeply. Wait, no. The code as written would take the existing value (a dict) and the new value (another dict), and for each key in existing, put them into merged, then for each key in new value, overwrite them. So in the case of {'a': {'b': 1}} and {'a': {'c': 2}}, the merged would be {'a': {'c': 2}}? Wait, no. Let me think:

existing is {'a': {'b': 1}}, value is {'a': {'c': 2}}.

In the code, for the first loop, merged starts as a copy of existing. So merged is {'a': {'b': 1}}.

Then, for the new value's items, which is {'a': {'c': 2}}, the code loops through each key in value. So k is 'a', v is {'c': 2}.

Since 'a' is in merged, and both merged['a'] and v are dicts, then merged['a'] would be replaced with the merged of the two dicts. Wait, no. The code as written would do:

for k, v in value.items():
    merged[k] = v

So if the existing value is {'a': {'b': 1}}, and the new value is {'a': {'c': 2}}, then during the second loop, when k is 'a', the code would set merged['a'] to {'c': 2}, overwriting the existing {'b': 1}.

But that's not a deep merge. That's just replacing the value of 'a' with the new value. So perhaps the code is incorrect here.

Wait, the function is supposed to merge node values corresponding to duplicate keys. So if two nodes have the same key, their values are merged. If the value is a MappingNode (dict), then merge them deeply. Otherwise, take the last one.

So, for example, if two nodes have the same key and their values are dicts, then we need to merge those dicts. So the code should recursively merge the two dicts.

So the correct approach would be to have a helper function that merges two dictionaries deeply. Let me adjust that.

The helper function would take two dicts and merge them, with the second dict's values taking precedence. For each key in the second dict, if the key exists in the first and both values are dicts, merge them recursively. Otherwise, replace the value.

So here's the helper function:

def merge_dicts(d1, d2):
    merged = d1.copy()
    for k, v in d2.items():
        if k in merged and isinstance(merged[k], dict) and isinstance(v, dict):
            merged[k] = merge_dicts(merged[k], v)
        else:
            merged[k] = v
    return merged

Then, in the main function, when both existing and new value are dicts, we call this helper function.

But in the original code, the way I had it would not do that. Let me correct that.

So, modifying the code:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        value = node.value
        if key in result:
            existing = result[key]
            if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                # Deep merge
                result[key] = merge_dicts(existing, value)
            else:
                # Take the last value
                result[key] = value
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result

But then, the helper function merge_dicts needs to be defined. However, the user's code may not have that. So perhaps the code should include that helper function.

But the user hasn't mentioned anything about helper functions. The problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the nodes are a list of objects with key and value attributes, and the merging is done as per the helper function.

But how to handle the case where the value is not a dict? The docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last one remains. So if the existing value is not a dict, and the new value is also not a dict, then take the new one. If existing is a dict and new is not, then replace the existing with the new value. Similarly, if existing is not a dict and new is a dict, then replace the existing with the new dict.

Wait, the docstring says that if there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last remains. So perhaps, if the key is duplicated and any of the values are not MappingNodes, then the last one is taken. But if all are MappingNodes, then merge them deeply.

But the original problem says to merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys. So for each key, if there are multiple nodes, their values are merged. But how to merge them? If the value is a MappingNode, then merge recursively. Otherwise, take the last one.

So the code should process each key, and for each occurrence, check if the current value is a MappingNode. If so, merge with the existing value (if it's also a MappingNode). Otherwise, replace with the new value.

But how to handle multiple occurrences. For example, if there are three nodes with the same key, and the first two have MappingNode values, and the third has a non-MappingNode value. Then, the third one would overwrite the previous merged value.

So the code would need to process each node in order, and for each key, if the existing value is a MappingNode and the new value is also a MappingNode, then merge them. Otherwise, replace the existing value with the new one.

So the helper function for merging two dicts is needed.

Putting it all together, the code would be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    """
    merge any node values corresponding to duplicate keys and return the result. If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains.
    """
    def merge_dicts(d1, d2):
        merged = d1.copy()
        for k, v in d2.items():
            if k in merged and isinstance(merged[k], dict) and isinstance(v, dict):
                merged[k] = merge_dicts(merged[k], v)
            else:
                merged[k] = v
        return merged

    result = {}
    for node in nodes:
        key = node.key
        value = node.value
        if key in result:
            existing = result[key]
            if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(value, dict):
                result[key] = merge_dicts(existing, value)
            else:
                result[key] = value
        else:
            result[key] = value
    return result

But this code assumes that each node has 'key' and 'value' attributes. If the nodes are, for example, tuples (key, value), then the code would need to be adjusted to node[0] and node[1]. However, the original problem does not specify the structure of the nodes, so this is an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the nodes are a list of dictionaries, each with 'key' and 'value' keys. Then, the code would use node['key'] and node['value'].

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say. However, the original problem mentions "duplicate keys", which implies that each node has a key. So the code must extract the key from each node.

Another possibility is that the nodes are a list of key-value pairs, and the function is supposed to merge them into a single dictionary, where for each key, if the values are mappings, merge them deeply, else take the last one.

But in that case, perhaps the nodes are a list of (key, value) pairs. So for example, nodes could be [(k1, v1), (k2, v2), ...]. Then, the code would need to process each key in the list, and for duplicates, merge the values.

But again, without knowing the exact structure of the nodes, this is challenging. However, the user's original code is to be written as a function that takes 'nodes' as an argument. So perhaps the nodes are objects with key and value attributes.

But given that, the code I wrote earlier would be correct. However, the problem says "non-MappingNode values", so maybe the check is not against isinstance but against whether it's an instance of MappingNode. But since the user hasn't provided that class, perhaps they meant that the value is a dictionary. So I can proceed with that.

Alternatively, maybe the user is using a library where MappingNode is a specific class. For example, in ruamel.yaml, there's a MappingNode. So perhaps the code should check if the value is an instance of that class. But without knowing the exact library, this is tricky.

But the problem says "If there are colliding keys with non-MappingNode values, the last of the values remains." So if a key has multiple nodes, and any of their values are not MappingNodes, then the last one is kept. So for example, if two nodes have the same key, and the first value is a MappingNode, and the second is not, then the result for that key is the second value.

So the code would check if the existing value and the new value are both MappingNodes. If yes, then deep merge. Otherwise, take the new value.

But again, without knowing what a MappingNode is, perhaps the user intended that the value is a dictionary. So the code can proceed with that.

Another thing to consider: the order of processing the nodes. Since the last value remains for non-MappingNode cases, the code should process the nodes in order, and for each key, if there's a collision, check the existing and new value types.

So, the code as written above would work if the nodes are objects with key and value attributes, and if the value is a dict, then it's considered a MappingNode.

But the user might have a different structure. However, given the information, this is the best approach I can think of.

So the final code would be as I outlined, with the helper function merge_dicts, and processing each node in the list, merging their values if they are dicts, else taking the last one.
