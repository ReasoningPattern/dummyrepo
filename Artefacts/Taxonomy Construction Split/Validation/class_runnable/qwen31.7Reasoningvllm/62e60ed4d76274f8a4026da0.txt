Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called keys and belongs to a class. The docstring says it returns the __keys property as a List.

First, I should figure out how to access the __keys property. In Python, properties are usually accessed via the dot notation. But the function is part of a class, so maybe the class has an __keys attribute that's a list.

Wait, the function is supposed to return the __keys property. So perhaps the class has a property called __keys, and the function keys() is meant to return that property as a list.

But how is the __keys property defined? The user didn't provide the class definition, so I need to assume that the class has an __keys attribute that's a list. Alternatively, maybe the __keys is a property that's being accessed here.

Wait, the docstring says "Returns the __keys property of a class as a List". So the function keys() is supposed to return the value of the __keys property, which is a list.

In Python, properties are defined with @property decorators. But here, the function keys() is just a method. So maybe the class has a property called __keys, and the method keys() is returning that property.

But how to implement that? Let's think. If the class has a property __keys, then accessing it would be done via the dot notation. So the method keys() would return the value of __keys.

But the function is defined as def keys(self): ... So the method is part of the class. So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    return self.__keys

But wait, the docstring says it returns the __keys property as a List. So maybe the __keys is a list, and the method returns it. But how is __keys defined? If the class has an __keys attribute that's a list, then the method would just return that attribute.

But perhaps the __keys is a property, not an attribute. So maybe the class has a property called __keys, and the method keys() is returning that property.

But in Python, properties are accessed via the dot notation. So if the class has a property __keys, then self.__keys would be the value. So the method keys() would return self.__keys.

But the function is supposed to return the __keys property as a list. So maybe the __keys is a list, and the method returns it.

So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    return self.__keys

But wait, the docstring says "Returns the __keys property of a class as a List". So maybe the __keys is a property, and the method returns that property. But how to implement that?

Alternatively, maybe the __keys is a list, and the method returns it. So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    return self.__keys

But the problem is that the __keys is not necessarily a property. It could be an attribute. So the code would be as simple as returning self.__keys.

But the user wants the code to generate based on the function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, and the docstring says it returns the __keys property as a list.

So the code would be:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return self.__keys

But wait, the docstring is part of the function. So the code would have the function definition with the docstring.

But the user said not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So the output should be just the code.

So the code is:

def keys(self):
    """
    Returns the __keys property of a class as a List
    """
    return self.__keys

But the user might expect that __keys is a list. So the code is correct as is. The function returns self.__keys, which is assumed to be a list.

So the final code is as above.
