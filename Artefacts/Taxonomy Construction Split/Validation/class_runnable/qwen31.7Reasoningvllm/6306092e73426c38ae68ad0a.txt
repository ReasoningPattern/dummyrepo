Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_choices_args function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is one of the available choices. But the function's parameter is 'args', which is a bit vague. Wait, maybe 'args' is a list or a dictionary? The function's purpose is to validate that each argument in 'args' is a valid choice. But the docstring isn't clear on what the 'available choices' are. Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the predefined choices, but the actual choices are not provided here. Wait, the function's parameters don't include any other parameters, just 'args'. So maybe the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is a valid choice, but the actual choices are not provided here. That's a problem.

Wait, the function's docstring mentions "available choices" but doesn't specify what they are. Maybe the function is part of a class, and the 'choices' are stored in the class's attributes? But the function's parameter is 'args', which is not clear. Maybe the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the choices defined in the class. But without knowing the choices, how can the function validate them?

Wait, maybe the function is part of a class, and the 'choices' are stored in the class. For example, maybe the class has a method that checks if the arguments are valid. But the function here is called validate_choices_args, which suggests that it's a method of a class. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the choices defined in the class. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the 'args' is a list of arguments, and the function is supposed to check that each argument is a valid choice. But without knowing the choices, the function can't do that. So perhaps the function is supposed to take the 'args' as a list, and check that each element is in a predefined set of choices. But the problem is that the function's parameters don't include the choices. So maybe the function is incomplete, but the user expects me to generate code based on the given signature and docstring.

Wait, the user provided the function signature and docstring, and wants me to generate the code. So maybe the function is part of a class, and the 'choices' are stored in the class. For example, maybe the class has a variable called 'choices' that contains the allowed values. But the function's parameters don't include that. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is in the 'choices' of the class. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the 'args' is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to check that each key in the dictionary is a valid choice. But again, without knowing the choices, it's impossible to know.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the choices, but the choices are not provided here. So maybe the function is incomplete, but the user expects me to generate code that checks that each argument is in a set of choices. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' are valid, but the actual choices are not provided. So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error if the arguments are invalid. But without knowing the choices, the code can't be written.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a class, and the 'choices' are stored in the class. For example, the class might have a method that validates the arguments. But the function here is called validate_choices_args, which is a method of the class. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the choices defined in the class. But how?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is a valid choice, but the actual choices are not provided. So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error if the arguments are invalid. But without knowing the choices, the code can't be written. Therefore, perhaps the function is incomplete, but the user expects me to generate code that checks that each argument is in a set of choices. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the 'args' is a list of values, and the function is supposed to check that each value is in the 'choices' of the class. But again, without knowing the choices, the code can't be written.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' are valid, but the actual choices are not provided. So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error if the arguments are invalid. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class, and the 'choices' are stored in the class. For example, the class has a variable called 'choices' that contains the allowed values. Then, the function would check that each argument in 'args' is in the 'choices' variable. But the function's parameters don't include that.

This is a bit of a puzzle. Given that the user provided the function signature and docstring, but the actual choices are not specified, perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is a valid choice, but the code is written in a way that the choices are stored elsewhere. However, since the function's parameters don't include the choices, the code can't be written without that information.

But the user is asking for code generation based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the choices, but the choices are not provided here. Therefore, the code would need to have a way to check that, but without knowing the choices, it's impossible. However, perhaps the function is part of a class, and the choices are stored in the class. For example, the class might have a method that validates the arguments, and this function is a helper.

But given that the function's parameters are just 'args', perhaps the code is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is a valid choice. But without knowing the choices, the code can't be written. Therefore, maybe the function is supposed to raise an error if the arguments are invalid. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that the 'args' are valid, but the actual choices are not provided. So the code would be something like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")

But without knowing what 'self.choices' is, this is just a guess. However, the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the code must be generated based on that. So perhaps the function is part of a class, and the 'choices' are stored in the class. Therefore, the code would check that each argument in 'args' is in the 'choices' of the class.

But since the function's parameters don't include 'choices', the code can't be written without that. Therefore, perhaps the function is supposed to be part of a class, and the 'choices' are stored in the class. So the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")

But the user's function signature doesn't include 'choices' as a parameter. So this is a bit of a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the 'args' is a list of values, and the function is supposed to check that each value is a valid choice. But without knowing the choices, the code can't be written. Therefore, perhaps the function is incomplete, but the user expects me to generate code that checks that each argument is in a set of choices. But how?

Wait, maybe the 'args' is a dictionary, and the function is supposed to check that each key in the dictionary is a valid choice. But again, without knowing the choices, it's impossible.

Hmm. Given that the user provided the function signature and docstring, but the actual choices are not specified, perhaps the function is supposed to check that each argument in 'args' is one of the choices, but the code is written in a way that the choices are stored elsewhere. So the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")

But since the function's parameters don't include 'choices', this is just a guess. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. Therefore, the code must be written with the assumption that 'choices' is a variable in the class.

So the final code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}")

But the user's docstring says "available choices" but doesn't specify what they are. So the code is written with the assumption that 'choices' is a variable in the class.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
