Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'pretty' and it's part of a class. The parameters are 'indent' and 'debug', both with default values. The docstring explains that the function returns a pretty formatted representation of self. 

So, the first thing I need to do is understand what the docstring is saying. It mentions that 'obj' is assigned to a string representation. If self.obj is a string, then it's enclosed in single quotes, else it's the repr of the object. Then, the function returns a string that starts with indentation, followed by the class name and some debug details and the obj.

Wait, the docstring has a line that says "return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"". But there's a variable called debug_details mentioned here. Oh, right, the parameter is 'debug', so maybe debug_details is a variable that's determined based on the debug flag. Let me check the original docstring again.

The original docstring says: "Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})""

Wait, the docstring seems to have a typo. The line after obj is assigned is the return statement. So, the return statement is using debug_details, but that variable isn't defined in the docstring. Maybe the user meant to use the debug parameter? Or perhaps there's a missing part. Let me think.

Looking at the parameters, there's a 'debug' boolean. So perhaps when debug is True, debug_details is something like "debug=" + ...? Or maybe the debug_details is a string that includes debug information. But the docstring doesn't explain that. Hmm. Maybe the user intended that if debug is True, then include some debug info, else not. But the way the docstring is written, it's not clear. However, the code example in the docstring seems to have a placeholder for debug_details. 

Wait, maybe the original code had a variable called debug_details that's constructed based on the debug parameter. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps I need to infer. Let me look again. The user's docstring says: "return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})""

So the debug_details is part of the format string. But how is it determined? The user's docstring might have a typo, perhaps they meant to use the debug parameter. Alternatively, maybe debug_details is a string that's built when debug is True. For example, maybe if debug is True, then debug_details is something like "debug: " followed by the object's debug info. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code is supposed to include that logic.

Wait, the user's docstring seems to have a mistake. Let me parse it again. The first line says: "Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})""

Ah, I see. The docstring is written in a way that's mixing code and explanation. So the actual code is supposed to have the obj variable assigned as per that condition, then return the formatted string with debug_details and obj. But the problem is that debug_details is not defined in the docstring. So maybe the user intended that debug_details is a string that's included when debug is True. For example, maybe if debug is True, then debug_details is something like "debug: " + str(debug) or some other info. But without more context, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, perhaps the docstring is incomplete. Maybe the original code had a line where debug_details is constructed. For instance, maybe when debug is True, it appends some debug information. But since the user hasn't provided that, I have to make an assumption. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the docstring is the actual code, but it's written in a way that's not properly formatted. Let me check again. The docstring starts with "Return a pretty formatted representation of self." Then the next line is "obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)" which seems like code. Then the return statement is written as "return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})""

So maybe the user intended that the function's code is as follows: 

First, assign obj to either a quoted string or repr of self.obj. Then, construct the return string by adding the indentation, the class name, and then the obj, but with debug_details inserted. However, the debug_details variable is not defined in the code. 

Wait, maybe the user made a typo and meant to use the debug parameter. For example, perhaps debug_details is a string that's determined by the debug flag. Like, if debug is True, then include some details. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the format. For example, maybe when debug is True, it adds "debug: " followed by some info. But without knowing what that info is, perhaps the code is supposed to have a conditional. 

Wait, the original docstring's return line is: return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})""

So the debug_details is a variable that's part of the format. But in the code, the function has a parameter called debug. So maybe the code is supposed to generate debug_details based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is something like "debug: " + str(debug), or maybe it's a string that's built from the debug flag. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code is supposed to have debug_details as a string that's either empty or contains some debug info. Let me think. Maybe the user intended that when debug is True, the debug_details is "debug: " followed by the object's debug info. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code is supposed to have a conditional that includes debug details if debug is True. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a placeholder for some other variable. But given the information, I have to work with what's provided. 

Wait, perhaps the user's docstring is not properly formatted. Let me check again. The docstring says:

"""
Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
"""

So the lines after the first are code, but they are part of the docstring. So the actual code for the function is supposed to be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But then debug_details is not defined. So maybe that's a mistake in the docstring. Perhaps the user meant to use the debug parameter. For example, maybe debug_details is a string that's included when debug is True. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that's built from the debug parameter. For instance, if debug is True, then include something like "debug: " followed by the object's details. But since the user hasn't provided that, I need to make an assumption. 

Wait, maybe the original code had a typo, and the debug_details is supposed to be the debug parameter. For example, maybe the return line is supposed to be f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})". But that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the format. For example, maybe when debug is True, it appends some debug info. But without knowing what that info is, perhaps the code is supposed to have a conditional. 

Wait, perhaps the user intended that the debug_details is a string that's either empty or contains debug information. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is "debug: " + str(some_debug_info), else it's empty. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the code is supposed to have a placeholder. 

But the user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code must include the obj assignment and the return statement as described. However, the debug_details is not defined. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring, and the intended code is to use the debug parameter. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's built based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then include "debug: " followed by some info. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code is supposed to have a conditional. 

Wait, maybe the user's docstring is not properly formatted. Let me think again. The first line is the return statement, then the next line is the obj assignment. But in the code, the function is supposed to have the obj variable assigned, then return the formatted string. 

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But then debug_details is not defined. That's a problem. Unless the user intended that debug_details is a variable that's part of the class. But since the user hasn't mentioned that, maybe it's a typo and they meant to use the debug parameter. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's constructed based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is "debug: " + str(debug), else it's empty. 

But since the user's docstring is unclear, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the debug_details is a string that's part of the format, and maybe the user intended to have it as a placeholder. However, that would result in an error. 

Wait, maybe the user's docstring is written in a way that's mixing code and explanation. Let me re-express the docstring. The first line says the function returns a pretty formatted representation. Then, the next line is code that assigns obj. Then, the return statement is written as code. 

So the actual code for the function should have the obj assignment and then the return statement. But the return statement uses debug_details, which is not defined. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant to use the debug parameter. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's built from the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then include "debug: " and some info. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the code should have a conditional. 

Wait, maybe the original code had a line where debug_details is determined. For example, maybe:

if debug:
    debug_details = "debug: " + str(some_debug_info)
else:
    debug_details = ""

But without knowing what some_debug_info is, I can't code that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that's part of the format, and the user intended to have it as a variable that's not shown. But that's not helpful. 

Given that the user is asking for code based on the function signature and docstring, and the docstring includes the line with debug_details, perhaps the code is supposed to have that variable. But since it's not defined, maybe the user intended that it's a string that's either empty or contains debug info. 

Wait, maybe the user's docstring is incorrect, and the return statement should use the debug parameter. For example, maybe the code is supposed to be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})"

But that would be a guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the class. For example, maybe the class has an attribute called debug_details. But again, without knowing, it's hard to say. 

But given that the user hasn't provided any more information, perhaps the correct approach is to code the function as per the docstring, but replace debug_details with something that makes sense. 

Wait, maybe the user intended that debug_details is a string that's either empty or contains debug information. For example, if debug is True, then include "debug: " followed by the object's debug info. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should include a conditional. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's constructed based on the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then it's "debug: " + str(debug), else empty. 

But since the user's docstring is unclear, maybe the code should be written as per the given lines, but with debug_details being a variable that's not defined. However, that would cause an error. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring and the return line should be using the debug parameter. For example, maybe the code is:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})"

But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the function's logic. For example, if debug is True, then include some details. 

But given that the user's docstring is the only guide, perhaps the code should be written as per the docstring, even if it's incomplete. However, that would result in an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that debug_details is a string that's built from the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is "debug: " + str(debug), else it's empty. 

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    """
    Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
    """
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = "debug: " if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But this is making an assumption about debug_details. However, given the docstring's mention of debug_details, perhaps that's the intended approach. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the class. But again, without knowing, it's hard. 

Wait, looking back at the original docstring, maybe the user intended that debug_details is a variable that's part of the code, but forgot to define it. So perhaps the code should include that variable. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the code should have a conditional. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's built from the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then include "debug: " followed by some info. 

But since the user's example code in the docstring uses debug_details, perhaps the code should have that variable. 

Wait, perhaps the user's docstring is actually a mix of explanation and code. So the first line is the description, then the next line is code, then the return line is code. So the actual code should be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But then debug_details is not defined. So this would raise a NameError. 

Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant to use the debug parameter. For example, maybe the return line is supposed to be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})"

But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the function's logic. For example, if debug is True, then include "debug: " and some details. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, I need to make an assumption. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the class. But again, no info. 

Hmm. Given that the user's docstring includes the line with debug_details, but that variable is not defined, perhaps the code is supposed to have that variable. But how? 

Wait, maybe the user intended that debug_details is a string that's determined by the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is "debug: " + str(self.debug), but again, without knowing, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the format, and the user intended to have it as a placeholder. But that's not helpful. 

In the absence of more information, perhaps the correct approach is to code the function as per the given lines, but replace debug_details with something that makes sense. 

Wait, maybe the user's docstring is not properly formatted. Let me check again. The docstring says:

"Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})""

Ah, perhaps the user intended that the return statement is using the debug parameter. For example, maybe the code should be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})"

But then, if debug is True, that would include True in the string, which isn't helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's built when debug is True. For example, if debug is True, then include some debug info. 

But without knowing what that info is, perhaps the code should have a conditional. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the class. For example, the class has an attribute called debug_details. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, I can't include that. 

Given that the user's docstring is the only guide, and the code is supposed to match that, perhaps the code should be written as per the docstring, even if it's incomplete. However, that would result in an error. 

Wait, maybe the user intended that the debug_details is a string that's either empty or contains debug info. For example, if debug is True, then debug_details is "debug: " + str(self.debug), but again, without knowing, this is guesswork. 

Alternatively, perhaps the debug_details is a string that's part of the function's logic. Maybe the user intended that when debug is True, it appends some details. 

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to code the function as per the docstring's code lines, but replace debug_details with a conditional based on the debug parameter. 

So, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    """
    Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
    """
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = "debug: " if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But I'm not sure if that's what the user intended. However, given that the docstring mentions debug_details, and the function has a debug parameter, this seems like a possible way to handle it. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the class, but that's not mentioned. 

Another possibility is that the user made a typo and meant to use the debug parameter. For example, maybe the return line is supposed to be:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})"

But that would include the boolean value of debug, which isn't helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's built from the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then include "debug: " and some info. 

But without knowing what that info is, I can't proceed. 

Given the ambiguity, but needing to generate code that matches the docstring, perhaps the correct approach is to code the function as per the docstring's code lines, but note that debug_details is not defined. However, that would be an error. 

Wait, maybe the user's docstring is not properly formatted and the return statement is supposed to be using the debug parameter. Let me think. 

The original docstring says: return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But perhaps the user meant to use the debug parameter. So maybe:

return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug}{obj})"

But then, if debug is True, that would be "True" in the string. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the function's logic, like including the debug parameter's value. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that debug_details is a string that's part of the format, and the code should include it. But since it's not defined, perhaps it's a mistake. 

In this case, perhaps the user intended that the debug_details is a string that's determined by the debug parameter. For example, if debug is True, then include "debug: " followed by some info. 

But since the user hasn't specified, maybe the code should have a conditional. 

So, I'll proceed with the assumption that debug_details is a string that's included when debug is True. For example, maybe it's "debug: " + str(self.debug) or something. 

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should have a conditional. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the function's return, like including the debug parameter. 

But given that, I'll write the code as per the docstring, but include a line that defines debug_details based on the debug parameter. 

So, the code would be:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    """
    Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
    """
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = "debug: " if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But this is an assumption. However, given that the user's docstring mentions debug_details, and the function has a debug parameter, this seems like the most logical way to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the debug_details is a string that's part of the class. But since the user hasn't mentioned that, I can't include that. 

So, I think the code should be written as per the docstring's code lines, but with debug_details being a string that's determined by the debug parameter. Hence, adding a line to define debug_details. 

Therefore, the final code would be as above. 

But wait, the user's docstring says that the return statement is (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})". So the debug_details is part of the format string. 

So, the code would have to include that. 

Therefore, I think the correct code is:

def pretty(self, indent=0, debug=False):
    """
    Return a pretty formatted representation of self. obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj) return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"
    """
    obj = f"'{self.obj}'" if isinstance(self.obj, str) else repr(self.obj)
    debug_details = "debug: " if debug else ""
    return (" " * indent) + f"{self.__class__.__name__}({debug_details}{obj})"

But I'm not sure. However, given the information, this seems like the best possible approach.
