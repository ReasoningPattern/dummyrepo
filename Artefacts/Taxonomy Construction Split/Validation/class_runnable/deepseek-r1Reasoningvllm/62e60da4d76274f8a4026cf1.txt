Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called values and takes self and *keys as parameters. The docstring says it returns the key filtered by self.index in the form of a list.

First, I should figure out what the function is supposed to do. The function is part of a class, probably because it's using self. The *keys parameter means it can accept any number of arguments, which are the keys to filter on.

The docstring mentions filtering by self.index. So, I think the idea is that each key in *keys is checked against self.index. Maybe it's looking for keys that are present in self.index.

Wait, but self.index could be a list or a set. So, the function should iterate over each key in *keys and include it in the result if it exists in self.index.

So, the steps are: take all the keys passed, check each one against self.index, and collect those that are present.

I'll start by initializing an empty list to hold the filtered keys. Then, loop through each key in the keys argument. For each key, check if it's in self.index. If it is, append it to the result list.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: create an empty list, loop through each key, check membership in self.index, and build the list. Finally, return the list.

I should make sure the code is clean and efficient. Using a list comprehension might be more concise. So, return [k for k in keys if k in self.index].

Wait, but what if self.index is a list and we need to check for sublists or exact matches? The problem statement doesn't specify, so assuming exact matches is safe.

So the final code is straightforward: iterate through each key, check if it's in self.index, and collect them into a list which is then returned.
