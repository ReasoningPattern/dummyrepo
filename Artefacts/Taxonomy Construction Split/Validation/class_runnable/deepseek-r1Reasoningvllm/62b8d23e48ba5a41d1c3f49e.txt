Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called popitem and it's an instance method, so it should have 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it finds, removes, and returns a random (key, value) pair using __choice in the class. 

Wait, __choice is a method in the random module that selects a random element from a sequence. So I should probably import the random module and use random.choice. 

The function should return a tuple of (key, value). Since it's an instance method, I'll access the underlying dictionary of the class using self.__dict__. But wait, if I modify self.__dict__, that might affect other parts of the application. Maybe I should make a copy first to avoid altering the original data structure.

So, I'll create a copy of self.__dict__ using dict() to get a new dictionary. Then, I'll use random.choice to pick a random key-value pair from this copy. Once I've selected the pair, I'll remove it from the dictionary using popitem. Finally, I'll return the selected (key, value) tuple.

Putting it all together, I'll import random at the top. Then define the function, make the copy, choose the item, remove it, and return it. I should also add a docstring that explains what the function does, as provided.

I think that's all. Let me write the code now.
