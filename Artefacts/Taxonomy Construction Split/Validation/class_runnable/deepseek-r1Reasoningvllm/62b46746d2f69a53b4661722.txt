Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called absorb and it takes self and args as parameters. The docstring says it returns a new list of expressions applying absorption. 

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what "absorption" means in this context. Maybe it's a specific transformation or operation on the expressions. Since the example isn't provided, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps absorption refers to combining like terms or simplifying the expressions in some way.

Let me think about how expressions are represented. If args is a list of strings or some kind of expression objects, maybe the function needs to process each expression, apply some absorption rules, and return a new list.

Wait, in the previous example, the user had a function called process that took an args list and returned a list of processed expressions. So maybe absorb is similar, but with a specific processing step for absorption.

I should probably define a helper function to process each argument. Let's say each argument is a string representing an expression. The helper function would parse each string, apply absorption rules, and return the processed expression.

What does absorption mean here? Maybe it's about combining terms where possible. For example, if an expression is "a + b + a", it would become "2a + b". Or if it's "a | a", it becomes "a". So the helper function would need to identify terms that can be combined.

I'll write a helper function called process_expression that takes an expression string and returns the absorbed form. It would split the expression into terms, count the coefficients for each term, and then reconstruct the expression with combined terms.

Next, the absorb function will loop through each argument, apply process_expression to each, and collect the results into a new list, which it then returns.

I should make sure that the code is clean and handles different cases, like terms with coefficients, variables, and operators. Also, I need to import any necessary modules, like re for regular expressions if parsing is involved.

Putting it all together, the code will have the absorb function, a helper function inside it, and return the processed list. I'll make sure to include the correct docstring explaining what the function does.
