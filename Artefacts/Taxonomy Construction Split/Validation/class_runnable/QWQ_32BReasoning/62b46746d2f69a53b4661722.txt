Okay, so I need to write a Python method called absorb that takes a sequence of expressions and applies absorption. Hmm, absorption in what context? Oh right, in logic, absorption is a rule where you can simplify expressions like A ∧ (A ∨ B) to A, or A ∨ (A ∧ B) to A. Wait, the problem says to return a new list applying absorption. So probably the expressions are in some form where we can check for these patterns.

First, I should figure out what the input expressions look like. Are they in a specific data structure? Maybe each expression is a tuple or a list representing the operation. Like, maybe something like ('and', A, ('or', A, B)) would be an example where absorption can be applied. Or perhaps the expressions are objects with some structure.

The function is a method of a class, so maybe the class has some way to represent expressions. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume that the expressions are represented as nested tuples where the first element is the operator, and the rest are operands. Like, for an AND operation between two terms, it would be ('and', term1, term2). Similarly for OR.

So the task is to go through each expression in the args list and check if any of them can be simplified using absorption laws. The absorption laws are:

1. A ∧ (A ∨ B) simplifies to A
2. A ∨ (A ∧ B) simplifies to A

So for each expression in the input, I need to see if it matches either of these patterns. If it does, replace the expression with A. Otherwise, leave it as is. Then return the new list with these simplified expressions.

Wait, but how do I process each expression? The method's parameter is a sequence of expressions, so maybe each element is an expression. The function should process each one individually. So I need to loop through each expression in args, check for the absorption pattern, and simplify if possible.

Let me think of how to structure this. The function will take self (so maybe part of a class that has helper methods?), but since the problem doesn't mention any other methods, perhaps I can do it with just this function.

Wait, but without knowing the structure of the expressions, maybe I should proceed with the tuple-based assumption. Let's proceed with that.

The plan is: For each expression in the args list, check if it's an AND or OR operation. Then check if one of its operands is an OR or AND respectively, and see if the first operand is the same as the first part of the inner operation.

For example, if the expression is ('and', 'A', ('or', 'A', 'B')), then the first operand is 'A', and the second is an OR of 'A' and 'B'. So this matches the first absorption law, so we return 'A'.

Similarly, if the expression is ('or', 'A', ('and', 'A', 'B')), then it can be simplified to 'A'.

So the steps for each expression:

- Check if the expression is a binary operation (has three elements: operator, left, right)
- For an 'and' expression, check if the right operand is an 'or' operation
- Then, see if the left operand of the 'and' is the same as the left operand of the 'or', and also check if the left of the 'and' is the same as the right of the 'or'? Wait no, the absorption law is A ∧ (A ∨ B) becomes A. So the left part of the AND must be the same as the first operand of the OR. The second part of the OR can be anything. Wait actually, the structure is (A) AND (A OR B). So the left of the AND is A, the right is an OR where the first element is also A (or maybe the second element is A? Because the OR is commutative). So maybe the OR can have A in either position.

Wait, the OR is commutative, so (A ∨ B) is the same as (B ∨ A). So for the absorption law, the condition is that the left operand of the AND is the same as one of the operands of the OR in the right part.

So, in code, for an expression like ('and', a, ('or', b, c)), we check if a is equal to either b or c. If so, then the absorption can be applied and the result is a. Similarly for the OR case.

Wait, but how to compare the terms? Are the expressions atomic? Like, the terms are variables or constants, so comparing them as strings or whatever their representation is would work. Let's assume that the expressions can be compared directly for equality.

So the steps:

Loop through each expr in args:

if expr is a binary operation (i.e., a tuple of length 3):

    op = expr[0]
    left = expr[1]
    right = expr[2]

    if op is 'and':

        check if right is an 'or' operation. So right should also be a tuple of length 3 with first element 'or'.

        Then, check if left is equal to either of the operands in the right's 'or' (right[1] or right[2]).

        If so, then this can be simplified to left.

    elif op is 'or':

        check if right is an 'and' operation.

        check if left is equal to either of the operands in the right's 'and'.

        If so, then simplify to left.

    else:

        leave as is.

Wait, but what about the left side being an operation? No, the absorption law is only applicable when the main operator is AND or OR, and the other operand is an OR or AND respectively. The left operand must be a single term, not another operation. Or maybe not? Wait, the absorption law applies to the form A ∧ (A ∨ B). So the left is a single term A, the right is (A ∨ B). So the entire expression is (A) AND (A OR B). So the left is a single term, and the right is an OR of that term and another.

Wait but in code, maybe the left can also be an expression? Like, maybe (A ∧ C) ∧ ((A ∧ C) ∨ B). In that case, the absorption would apply here. But how would I represent that? The left would be an AND expression, and the right would be an OR where the first operand is the same as the left's entire expression. That's more complicated.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects the simplest case where the left is a single variable and the right's OR has that variable as one of its terms. Or perhaps the terms can be any expressions, so we need to check for equality of the left and one of the OR's terms even if they are complex.

Wait, but equality in expressions can be tricky. For example, if left is ('and', 'A', 'B'), and the OR has ('and', 'A', 'B') as one of its terms, then that's a match. So in that case, the absorption applies.

So perhaps the code should recursively check expressions? Or maybe the problem is considering only the top-level structure, so that the left and the OR's first or second operand are exactly the same in terms of their structure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the absorption is applied only at the top level. So each expression in the args list is checked once for this pattern. So the function doesn't need to simplify nested expressions beyond the top level.

Wait the problem says "applying absorption", but it's not clear if it's just once or recursively. Let me read the docstring again. The function is given a sequence of expressions, and returns a new list after applying absorption. So maybe each expression in the list is considered individually, and if any of them matches the absorption pattern, it's simplified. The rest are kept as is. So the function doesn't need to process the arguments further, just each expression in the list.

So the code would process each expression in args, and for each, check if it can be simplified via absorption. If yes, replace it with the appropriate term, else leave it.

So let's start coding.

First, the function def absorb(self, args):. Since it's a method, maybe the class has some helper functions, but perhaps I can do it directly.

Wait, but how to compare expressions? Let's assume that the expressions are tuples where the operator is the first element, and the operands are the next. So, for example, an AND between two terms is a 3-tuple: ('and', a, b). An OR is similar. So, for each expression in the args list, check if it's a 3-tuple.

So in code:

def absorb(self, args):
    new_args = []
    for expr in args:
        if isinstance(expr, (tuple, list)) and len(expr) == 3:
            op, left, right = expr
            if op == 'and':
                if isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) ==3 and right[0] == 'or':
                    # check if left is in the operands of the right's or
                    if left == right[1] or left == right[2]:
                        new_args.append(left)
                        continue
            elif op == 'or':
                if isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) ==3 and right[0] == 'and':
                    if left == right[1] or left == right[2]:
                        new_args.append(left)
                        continue
        # if no absorption possible, add the original expr
        new_args.append(expr)
    return new_args

Wait, but what about if the right is an OR in the case of AND, and the left is part of the OR's terms. That's exactly what we need here. But in this code, if the right is an OR, then check if left is either of the OR's terms. Then replace the whole expression with left. Otherwise, leave it.

Wait, but what about the case where the right is an OR, but the left is the second term? Like, the expression is ('and', B, ('or', A, B)). Then the absorption would still apply because B is the same as the second operand of the OR. So the code should handle that.

Yes, this code should work for that case.

Wait, but in the first absorption law, it's A AND (A OR B). So the left is A and the OR has A as the first term, but the code also checks the second term. So if the OR is (B OR A), then the left (A) would equal the second term, so that's still okay.

So the code is correct here.

Wait, but what if the right side is a different operator? Like, if the expression is an AND whose right is a NOT, then it can't be absorbed. So the code correctly checks for the operator of the right.

Wait, the code first checks if the right is a tuple/list of length 3 and the first element is 'or' (for the AND case). So that's correct.

Similarly for the OR case, the right must be an 'and' operation.

Now, what about the left being a complex expression? Like, if left is ('and', A, C), and the right's OR is ( ('and', A, C) , B ), then the left would equal the first operand of the OR, so the absorption applies. So the code would handle that as long as the left and the OR's first operand are the same structure.

But in Python, comparing tuples would work. For example, ('and', A, C) == ('and', A, C) would return True. So that's okay.

What about if the right's first element is not the operator? Like, maybe a different structure. But the problem says that the input is a sequence of expressions, so they should follow the same structure.

So this code should work.

Wait, but what if the operator is in a different order? Like, the expression is an OR where the left is part of the AND's terms. Let's see:

Suppose the expression is ('or', A, ('and', B, A)). Then the right is an AND, and the left A is equal to the second operand of the AND (the second term is A). So in that case, the code would check if left (A) is equal to right[1] or right[2], which it is, so the absorption applies and we return A.

Yes, that's correct.

So this code should handle the cases. Let me think of some test cases.

Test case 1: args is [('and', 'A', ('or', 'A', 'B'))], the code should return ['A'].

Test case 2: args has [('or', 'A', ('and', 'B', 'A'))], the code would return ['A'].

Another case: if the right is an OR but the left isn't either of the terms, like ('and', 'C', ('or', 'A', 'B')), then it remains as is.

What if the expression is not a binary operation, like a single variable? Then it's added to new_args as is. That's correct.

What about a three-element tuple with a different operator, like ('implies', ...)? Then it's not handled, so stays.

Another edge case: the right is an OR but the left is not the first or second operand. So, ('and', 'A', ('or', 'B', 'C')), then the expression remains.

What about if the right is an OR but the left is one of the terms. So that's handled.

Wait, but in the code above, the right is checked to see if it's a 3-element tuple/list. So the code is okay with lists instead of tuples? The problem says the args are a sequence of expressions. So maybe they can be lists or tuples. So using isinstance(expr, (tuple, list)) is correct.

Hmm, but in the case where the right is an OR, but the left is the second operand, then the code works.

Wait, but what if the right is an OR with three terms? Oh, no, because the code checks for length 3. The OR would have to be a binary operator (since a 3-element tuple is operator, left, right). So if the OR has three terms, it's probably represented as nested operations. So this code won't handle those. But perhaps the problem assumes all expressions are in binary form.

So the code is correct for the given problem's constraints.

Wait, another possible case: what if the right is an OR, but the left is the same as the second term of the OR. Like ('and', 'B', ('or', 'A', 'B')). Then the code would check if B equals A (no) or B (yes), so it would simplify to B.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code should work. Let me think of another scenario. Suppose an expression is ('and', ('or', 'A', 'B'), 'A'). Then the left operand of the AND is the OR, but the right is A. So the pattern isn't matched because the left is the OR, and the right is A. The absorption law requires the left to be the same as in the OR. So in this case, the expression is (A∨B) ∧ A. Which is equivalent to A ∧ (A∨B), which can be simplified to A. But in the code's current structure, it would check the right operand (A) against the left's OR's terms?

Wait, in this case, the expression would be ('and', left_OR, right_A). The code's op is 'and', left is the OR, and the right is A. Then the code would check if the right (A) is an OR? No, because the right is just a variable. So the code would proceed to check if the right is an OR, which it isn't. So this expression wouldn't be simplified.

Hmm, that's a problem because the absorption law can also be written as A ∧ (B ∨ A) which would still be A. But in this case, the code's current approach would miss the case where the left is the OR and the right is the A.

Wait, the code currently only checks when the left is the term and the right is the OR. Because in the code, the left is the first operand, and the right's OR has two terms. So in the example where the AND's left is the OR and the right is A, the code would not trigger the absorption. But that expression is equivalent to A ∧ (A ∨ B), so it should be simplified to A. But the code isn't handling that because the left and right are swapped in the AND's operands.

Ah, right. So the code currently only checks if the left is the term and the right is the OR (for the AND case). But if the AND's right is the term and the left is the OR, then the code won't catch it. Because the code is looking at the left being the term and the right being the OR. But the absorption law is symmetric in terms of the order of the OR's terms. But the AND's order matters here.

Wait, the absorption law is for the form A ∧ (A ∨ B). The AND's left is A, the right is (A∨B). But if the AND is written as (A∨B) ∧ A, then the left of the AND is the OR, and the right is A. The code would check the op is 'and', then check the right (A) is an OR? No, so it wouldn't be simplified. But that's actually the same as the original form because AND is commutative. So the code isn't considering that.

Hmm, so the code as written would miss cases where the left and right operands of the AND are swapped. For example, the expression is ('and', ('or', 'A', 'B'), 'A'). The code's current logic would check the op is 'and', then the right is 'A', which is not an OR. So the code would not simplify it. But this expression should be simplified to 'A'.

So that's a problem. The code currently only checks if the right is an OR (for AND expressions). But in the absorption law, the OR is the second operand. So the code is only handling the case where the first operand is the term, and the second is the OR. But if the term is the second operand and the OR is the first, the code would not catch it.

So how to handle that? The absorption law applies regardless of the order of the AND's operands. But since the code is structured to check if the op is AND, and then if the right is an OR, then it misses the other way around.

Ah, so to handle both possibilities, perhaps the code should check whether either the second operand is an OR (and first is the term) or the first operand is an OR and the second is the term. Wait, no. Because the absorption law is specifically when the first operand is the term and the second is the OR. But since AND is commutative, the same applies if the term is the second operand and the first is the OR. So the code needs to check both possibilities.

Wait, in the code, the left is the first operand, right is the second. So for an expression like ('and', or_expr, term), then the left is the OR and the right is the term. To apply absorption here, we need to see if the term is one of the OR's operands. But how?

So perhaps the code should check both the left and right for the OR (in the case of an AND expression). Let me rework the code.

Alternative approach:

For an AND expression, check whether either the right is an OR and the left is one of its terms, OR the left is an OR and the right is one of its terms. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The absorption law is A ∧ (A ∨ B) = A. The same as (A ∨ B) ∧ A = A, since AND is commutative. So the code should check both the left and the right for the OR in the case of an AND operator.

So for an AND expression, the left and right could be in either order. So perhaps, instead of checking only the right operand, check if either the right is an OR and the left is one of its terms, or the left is an OR and the right is one of its terms.

Wait, but how would that work?

Let me think: For the AND case, the two operands are left and right. To see if either of them is an OR that includes the other operand as one of its terms.

So the code could be modified as follows:

In the AND case:

Check if either the right is an OR and the left is one of its terms, or the left is an OR and the right is one of its terms.

Wait, maybe that's better. Let me code that.

So for the 'and' case:

if ( (isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) ==3 and right[0] == 'or') and (left == right[1] or left == right[2] ) ) or ( (isinstance(left, (tuple, list)) and len(left) ==3 and left[0] == 'or') and (right == left[1] or right == left[2] ) ):

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me break it down.

First, check if the left is an OR. Then, see if the right operand of the AND is one of the OR's terms. Or check if the right is an OR and the left operand of the AND is one of its terms.

If either of those conditions is true, then the expression can be simplified to the term (the non-OR part). So in the first case (right is OR), the left is the term. In the second case (left is OR), the right is the term. So the simplified term would be either left or right, depending on which side is the non-OR part.

Wait, but in the first case, the term is left (so we return left), in the second case, the term is right (so we return right). So in that case, the code would need to check both possibilities and return the correct term.

Hmm, so modifying the code:

for expr in args:

    if it's a 3-element tuple/list:

        op, left, right = expr

        if op == 'and':

            # check if right is an OR and left is one of its terms
            if (isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) ==3 and right[0] == 'or'):

                if left == right[1] or left == right[2]:

                    new_args.append(left)

                    continue

            # check if left is an OR and right is one of its terms
            elif (isinstance(left, (tuple, list)) and len(left) ==3 and left[0] == 'or'):

                if right == left[1] or right == left[2]:

                    new_args.append(right)

                    continue

            # else, proceed as before

        elif op == 'or':

            # similar logic for OR case. Check if right is an AND, and left is one of its terms, or left is an AND and right is one of its terms.

            if (isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) ==3 and right[0] == 'and'):

                if left == right[1] or left == right[2]:

                    new_args.append(left)

                    continue

            elif (isinstance(left, (tuple, list)) and len(left) ==3 and left[0] == 'and'):

                if right == left[1] or right == left[2]:

                    new_args.append(right)

                    continue

        # if none of the above, append the original expr.

    new_args.append(expr)

Wait, but this approach uses elif for the second check. But in the first case, the first check (right is OR) could be true, or the second (left is OR) could be true. So using elif would miss the second case if the first was true. Wait, no, because in the first part, the code checks the first condition, and if it is true, then it appends left and continues, so the second check is not needed. So that's okay.

Wait, but what if both the left and the right are OR expressions? Probably that's not possible in the absorption law. Like, the expression would be 'and' between two ORs, but the absorption requires one of them to be a single term. So such a case wouldn't match the absorption pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the code should check both possibilities. Let me restructure the code so that it checks both possibilities for the AND case.

Like:

for the AND case:

if ( (right is an OR and left is one of its terms) or (left is an OR and right is one of its terms) ):

then choose the term (either left or right, depending on which is the non-OR part).

So maybe:

if op == 'and':

    # check right is OR and left is in its terms

    if (isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) ==3 and right[0] == 'or' and (left == right[1] or left == right[2])):

        new_args.append(left)

        continue

    # check left is OR and right is in its terms

    elif (isinstance(left, (tuple, list)) and len(left) ==3 and left[0] == 'or' and (right == left[1] or right == left[2])):

        new_args.append(right)

        continue

Similarly for OR.

Wait, but in this case, if the expression is (A AND (A OR B)), then the first condition is true, so we return left (A). If the expression is ((A OR B) AND A), then the second condition is true, so return right (A).

So that's correct.

So this code would handle the cases where the OR is either the left or right operand of the AND.

Same for the OR case with AND.

Okay, so the code needs to be adjusted to check both possibilities.

Hmm, so let's write the code accordingly.

Wait, also, in the OR case, the absorption is A ∨ (A ∧ B) simplifies to A. So similar logic.

So in the OR case:

if the right is an AND and the left is one of the terms of the AND, then we can simplify to left.

Or if the left is an AND and the right is one of its terms, then simplify to right.

So the code would check both possibilities.

Now, let me think of another example: an expression like ('or', ('and', 'A', 'B'), 'A'). The left is an AND, and the right is A. The left's AND has A as one of its terms, so the code should simplify to A (the right operand). Because the OR's left is an AND, and the right is A. The AND has A as its first term, so right (A) is one of the terms in the left's AND. So the code would check the left is an 'and', then see if the right (A) is in left's terms. Then append right (A).

Yes, that would work.

Another example: ('or', 'A', ('and', 'B', 'C')). The right is an AND, but the left (A) is not part of the AND's terms, so no absorption. So the expression remains.

So this approach should handle the cases where the OR or AND is on either side.

Now, let's code this.

Wait, in the code above, after checking for the first condition (right is OR and left is in its terms), if that's not true, then check the second condition (left is OR and right is in its terms). So the code would handle both.

Wait, but in the first condition, the code is checking for the right being an OR. If that's not the case, then it proceeds to check if the left is an OR. So the code would work.

Similarly for the OR case with AND.

So modifying the code:

Inside the loop:

if expr is a 3-element tuple/list:

    op, left, right = expr

    if op == 'and':

        # first check right is an OR and left is in the OR's terms

        if (isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) ==3 and right[0] == 'or' and (left == right[1] or left == right[2])):

            new_args.append(left)

            continue

        # else check if left is an OR and right is in the left's terms

        elif (isinstance(left, (tuple, list)) and len(left) ==3 and left[0] == 'or' and (right == left[1] or right == left[2])):

            new_args.append(right)

            continue

    elif op == 'or':

        # check if right is an AND and left is in its terms

        if (isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) ==3 and right[0] == 'and' and (left == right[1] or left == right[2])):

            new_args.append(left)

            continue

        # check if left is an AND and right is in its terms

        elif (isinstance(left, (tuple, list)) and len(left) ==3 and left[0] == 'and' and (right == left[1] or right == left[2])):

            new_args.append(right)

            continue

    # else, proceed normally

    # so after all checks, append the original expr

So, the code now checks both possibilities for the AND and OR cases.

Wait, but in the first case, when the left is part of an OR in the right, then the simplified term is the left. When the left is an OR, and the right is part of its terms, then the simplified term is the right. That's correct.

Now, what about the case where the operator is not 'and' or 'or'? Then the code just appends the original expr.

Also, what about if the expression is a 3-element list but the right is not an OR (for AND case), then it's not simplified.

What about nested expressions? Like, the left is an AND, and the right is an OR, but the left's first operand is an OR. Wait, but in that case, the code would not simplify it, unless the inner structure matches.

But the problem's docstring says to apply absorption. So perhaps the code only applies the absorption once, at the top level. Because if it's nested, maybe the code isn't supposed to handle that. The problem might assume that the input expressions are already in a form where absorption can be applied at the top level. Or maybe the function should recursively simplify expressions? But the problem doesn't say that. The function's job is to return a new list applying absorption, so probably just check each expression once, and simplify it if possible. The rest are left as is.

So the code should be okay.

Wait, but the code is written as a method. So maybe the class has some other helper functions. But since the problem doesn't mention that, perhaps the code is supposed to be a standalone method. Let's proceed with the code as above.

Wait, let me test another scenario. Suppose the expression is ('and', ('or', 'A', 'B'), 'A'). So the left is an OR, and the right is A. The code checks the first condition (right is OR?), no, the right is A. So then it checks the left being an OR. Yes, left's op is 'or', then check if the right (A) is in the left's terms (left[1] is A and left[2] is B). So yes, right (A) is equal to left[1], so the code appends right (A). That's correct.

Another case: ('and', 'A', ('or', 'B', 'A')). The right is an OR with B and A. So left is A, which is equal to the second operand of the OR. So first condition is met, so append A.

Okay.

Now, what about the OR case with AND?

Suppose ('or', 'A', ('and', 'B', 'A')). The left is A, the right is an AND with B and A. So check if the right is an AND (it is). The left (A) is equal to the second term (A) of the AND, so that's a match. So we can simplify to A. So the code would do that.

Another example: ('or', ('and', 'A', 'B'), 'A'). The left is an AND. Then the code checks if left is an AND (which it is) and the right (A) is part of the AND's terms. The AND's terms are A and B. So right is A, which is equal to left[1], so append the right (A). Which is correct.

Hmm, this seems to handle the cases where the OR/AND is on either side.

Now, the code as written would work. But let's think about possible errors.

What if the right is a list or a tuple? The code uses isinstance for tuple or list, so that's okay.

What about if the expression is a list of length 3, but the operator is 'or', and the right is an 'and' with the left term being part of it?

Yes, the code would handle that.

Wait, another possible case: the expression is ('and', 'A', ('or', 'B', 'C')). Then left is A, but the OR's terms are B and C. So A isn't in there, so no absorption. So it remains.

Okay, so the code should be correct.

Now, putting it all together into the absorb method.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so maybe the 'args' is a list of expressions. The code loops through each expression, applies the checks, and builds a new list.

So the code would look like this:

def absorb(self, args):
    new_args = []
    for expr in args:
        if isinstance(expr, (tuple, list)) and len(expr) == 3:
            op, left, right = expr
            if op == 'and':
                if (isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) == 3 and right[0] == 'or' and (left == right[1] or left == right[2])):
                    new_args.append(left)
                    continue
                elif (isinstance(left, (tuple, list)) and len(left) == 3 and left[0] == 'or' and (right == left[1] or right == left[2])):
                    new_args.append(right)
                    continue
            elif op == 'or':
                if (isinstance(right, (tuple, list)) and len(right) == 3 and right[0] == 'and' and (left == right[1] or left == right[2])):
                    new_args.append(left)
                    continue
                elif (isinstance(left, (tuple, list)) and len(left) == 3 and left[0] == 'and' and (right == left[1] or right == left[2])):
                    new_args.append(right)
                    continue
        new_args.append(expr)
    return new_args

Hmm, that should work. Let me see if there's any other case I might have missed.

Wait, what if the expression is an AND where the left is an OR, and the right is one of the OR's terms. But the OR has three terms? Wait, but in the code, the OR has to be a 3-element tuple, so it's a binary operation. So the code can't handle ORs with more than two terms. But that's probably beyond the scope here, since the problem likely assumes binary operations.

Another possible issue is that the code is checking for the operator of the inner expression (right[0] == 'or' for AND case). So it's specifically looking for those operators. That's correct.

Wait, but what if the left or right is a list/tuple of length 3 but the first element isn't an operator? Like, maybe a list with three elements but not starting with 'and' or 'or'? Then the code would not simplify it, which is correct.

I think this should handle the cases properly.

Wait, but what about the case where the right is an OR, and left is one of the terms, but the left is also a nested operation? Like, the left is ('and', 'A', 'C'), and the OR is ( ('and', 'A', 'C'), 'B'). So the code would check if left is equal to right[1], which it is, so it appends left. Which is correct.

Yes, because comparing the tuples would work. So the code should handle that.

Okay, so the code is as above. Let me write it properly with proper indentation and structure.
