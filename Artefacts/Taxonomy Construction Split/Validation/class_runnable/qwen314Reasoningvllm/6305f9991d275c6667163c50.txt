Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function set_cut_chars based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does. The docstring says it's for setting bytes used to delimit slice points, with before and after parameters. So probably, this function is part of a class that handles splitting files, and these delimiters determine where the splits occur.

First, the parameters are before and after, both of type bytes. The function doesn't return anything, so the return type is None. The user probably expects that these bytes are stored as instance variables so they can be used later when splitting the file.

I should check if the parameters are valid. Since they are bytes, maybe the function should validate that they are not empty or something. But the docstring doesn't mention any validation, so maybe it's assumed that the inputs are correct. However, good practice would include some checks. But the user didn't specify that, so maybe just assign them directly.

So the function would take the before and after bytes and set them as attributes of the instance. Let me see, the function is a method of a class, so self is the first parameter. The variables should be stored as self._before and self._after perhaps, using underscores to indicate they're internal.

Wait, the original code example the user provided had the function signature but no implementation. So I need to write the code that assigns these parameters to instance variables. Let me make sure that the code is correct. The function body would be something like:

self._before = before
self._after = after

That's straightforward. But maybe there's more to it. For example, if the class has some other logic related to these delimiters, but the docstring doesn't mention anything else. The user just wants the function that sets these bytes. So the code is simple.

I need to output only the code in Python markdown format. So the answer should be:

```python
def set_cut_chars(self, before: bytes, after: bytes) -> None:
    """
    Set the bytes used to delimit slice points.

    Args:
        before: Split file before these delimiters.
        after: Split file after these delimiters.
    """
    self._before = before
    self._after = after
```

Wait, but the user said not to include any explanation, so just the code. Also, the original docstring had Args but maybe the user wants the code to have the same docstring. So I should make sure that the docstring is exactly as provided, except maybe adding a blank line after the Args if needed. Let me check the original docstring:

The original docstring has:

Args:
    before: Split file before these delimiters.
    after: Split file after these delimiters.

But in Python docstrings, it's common to have a blank line after the Args section. However, the user provided the docstring as is, so I should replicate it exactly. Wait, the user's docstring has the Args section but no blank line. Let me check the original input again.

Looking back, the user's docstring is:

"""
Set the bytes used to delimit slice points.

Args:
    before: Split file before these delimiters.
    after: Split file after these delimiters.
"""

So there's a line break after the first sentence, then the Args. So in the code, the docstring should have that structure. The generated code should have the same docstring. Therefore, the code would assign the parameters to instance variables. That's all. I think that's the correct approach.
