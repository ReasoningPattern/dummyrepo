Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. The function is called index and takes a key as an argument. The docstring says it returns the key as an int. So the task is to convert the key into an integer and return it.

Wait, but how is the key provided? The function is a method, so 'self' is the first parameter. Maybe the key is a string that can be converted to an integer. The most straightforward way is to return int(key). But I should make sure that the key can be converted. However, the problem doesn't mention error handling, so maybe it's assumed that the key is a valid integer string.

So the code would be just returning the integer version of the key. Let me write that. The function definition is given, so I just need to fill in the body. The code would be:

def index(self, key):
    """
    Returns the key in the form of int.
    """
    return int(key)

That's it. No other operations are needed. The function converts the key to an integer and returns it. I don't see any other possible interpretations here. The user probably wants a simple conversion.
