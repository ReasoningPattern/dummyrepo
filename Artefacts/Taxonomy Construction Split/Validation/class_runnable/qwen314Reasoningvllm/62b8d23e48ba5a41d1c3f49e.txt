Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says it should find, remove, and return a random (key, value) pair using __choice in the class. 

First, I remember that in Python, the popitem() method for dictionaries usually removes and returns a (key, value) pair. But the user mentioned using __choice, which makes me think they want a random selection. However, the standard dict in Python doesn't have a __choice attribute. Maybe they're referring to a custom class that has a __choice method or attribute?

Wait, the docstring says "via __choice in the class". So perhaps the class this method belongs to has a __choice attribute that's a list of items or something similar. But the method is part of a class, so I need to figure out how to access that.

Assuming that __choice is a list of key-value pairs stored in the class instance. For example, maybe the class is a custom dictionary that maintains a list of items in __choice. Then, popitem would need to select a random element from that list, remove it from the data structure, and return it.

But how is __choice structured? If it's a list of tuples, then using random.choice would pick one. However, the standard dict doesn't have such an attribute. So this is likely a custom class. Let me think about the steps:

1. The method should select a random item from __choice. So I need to import random and use random.choice.
2. Once the item is chosen, it needs to be removed from the data structure. But if __choice is just a list, removing it might not be straightforward because the same key-value pair might be present multiple times, or maybe it's a list that's maintained in sync with the actual data storage.
3. Also, the method needs to return the (key, value) pair.

Wait, but if the class is a dictionary-like structure, maybe it's using a list to keep track of items for random access. However, in a real dictionary, you can't just have a list of items because when you remove one, you have to update the list as well. But maybe the __choice is a list that's maintained separately. Alternatively, perhaps the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a list of items (key, value) pairs, and the class is maintaining this list. So when popitem is called, we pick a random element from __choice, then remove it from the class's internal storage and from the __choice list.

But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the full context of the class. So I need to make some assumptions here. Let me think: the function is part of a class, and __choice is an attribute of that class. So, the code would be something like:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
    # Now remove the key from the data structure
    # Assuming that the class has a data structure like a dictionary
    # and __choice is a list of items. But how to remove it from the data structure?
    # Also, need to remove the item from __choice list.
    # However, if there are duplicate entries in __choice, this might not work correctly.
    # Maybe __choice is a list that's in sync with the actual items in the class.
    # For example, if the class has a dictionary 'data' and a list '__choice' that contains all items.
    # Then, after selecting the item, we need to remove it from 'data' and from '__choice'.

But without knowing the exact structure of the class, it's a bit tricky. However, the user's docstring says "via __choice in the class", so perhaps the __choice is a list of items, and the class's data is stored elsewhere. But maybe the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in another structure. Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a list of items, and when you pop one, you remove it from that list and from the main storage.

Wait, the standard dict.popitem() in Python 3.7+ returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair. But here, the user wants a random one. So perhaps the class is a custom dictionary that maintains a list of items in __choice, and when popitem is called, it selects a random one from that list, removes it from the internal storage (like a dictionary), and also from the __choice list.

So, assuming that the class has a dictionary called 'data' and a list called '__choice' that contains all the (key, value) pairs. Then, the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove((key, value))
    del self.data[key]
    return key, value

But wait, the problem is that if there are multiple entries with the same key and value in __choice, removing the first occurrence might not be correct. However, in a standard dictionary, each key is unique, so perhaps __choice is a list of items where each item is unique. But even then, if the same key-value pair is present multiple times, this could be an issue.

Alternatively, maybe __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in another structure. But the docstring says it's a (key, value) pair, so probably __choice is a list of tuples.

But the user hasn't provided the class's other attributes. So perhaps the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in a separate dictionary. But then, how to get the value? For example, if the class has a 'data' dictionary, and __choice is a list of keys. Then:

key = random.choice(self.__choice)
value = self.data.pop(key)
self.__choice.remove(key)
return key, value

But the docstring says "random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So maybe __choice is a list of items (key, value) pairs. However, in that case, when you remove the key from the data structure, you need to make sure that the value is also removed. But if the data structure is a dictionary, then each key is unique, so once you pop the key, the value is gone.

But the problem is that the __choice list would have to be maintained properly. For example, when adding items, they are added to both the dictionary and the __choice list. When removing, they are removed from both.

But given the limited information, I think the code should use random.choice on self.__choice, which is a list of (key, value) pairs. Then, remove that pair from the list and delete the key from the internal data structure.

But how is the internal data structure stored? The user's code might be part of a class that has a dictionary as an instance variable, perhaps called 'data' or something similar. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe I should assume that the class has a 'data' dictionary, and __choice is a list of items.

So the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    item = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove(item)
    key, value = item
    del self.data[key]
    return key, value

But again, the exact name of the data structure isn't given. Maybe the class uses self.items as the dictionary? Or perhaps the __choice is the list of items, and the actual data is stored in another way. Without knowing, perhaps the user expects that __choice is a list of items, and the class is managing them. But maybe the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in a separate dictionary. Let me check the docstring again. It says "remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So __choice is probably a list of (key, value) pairs.

Another thing: in Python, the __choice attribute is not a standard one. So the user is probably working with a custom class. Therefore, the code should be written with that in mind.

But the user's code is to be generated as a method of the class. So the code will be part of a class that has __choice as an instance variable. The method needs to pick a random item from __choice, remove it from the class's data structure, and return it.

But since the user hasn't provided the class's other attributes, perhaps the code is supposed to use __choice directly. For example, if the class is a dictionary and __choice is a list of items, then:

But in that case, the code would need to have access to the underlying data. However, without knowing the exact structure, maybe the user expects that __choice is a list of items, and the class is a dictionary-like structure that uses that list. So, perhaps the code is:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove((key, value))
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But then, how does del self[key] work? If the class is a subclass of dict, then that would work. But if it's a custom class, maybe it has a __delitem__ method. However, the user hasn't specified that. But the function signature is def popitem(self), which suggests that it's a method of a class that has __choice as an instance variable.

Alternatively, maybe the class is using __choice as a list of keys, and the values are stored in another structure. But the docstring says it returns a (key, value) pair, so I think the __choice is a list of such pairs.

But perhaps the user is referring to a class that has a __choice attribute which is a list of keys, and the values are stored in a dictionary. Then, the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = random.choice(self.__choice)
    value = self.data.pop(key)
    self.__choice.remove(key)
    return key, value

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, the user's docstring says "via __choice in the class", so maybe the __choice is a list of items (key, value), and the code uses that.

Another approach: maybe the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in the instance's dictionary. So, the code would select a random key from __choice, then delete it from the instance's dictionary and remove the key from __choice.

But the problem is that if the class is a dictionary, then self would be the dictionary itself. But in that case, the __choice would be a list of keys. However, the standard popitem() returns a (key, value) pair, so maybe the code is:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = random.choice(self.__choice)
    value = self.pop(key)
    self.__choice.remove(key)
    return key, value

But this would require that the class has a __choice list of keys. However, the user's docstring says "random (key, value) pair via __choice", which might imply that __choice contains the pairs.

Alternatively, maybe __choice is a list of items, and the class is maintaining that list. So, the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    item = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove(item)
    key, value = item
    del self.data[key]  # assuming data is the internal dict
    return key, value

But again, the name of the internal data structure is not given. However, since the user hasn't provided any other details, perhaps the code is intended to be part of a class that uses __choice as a list of (key, value) pairs, and the actual data is stored in another structure. But without knowing, I have to make an assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the class is a subclass of dict, and __choice is a list of items. But in that case, the code would need to manage both the dict and the __choice list. For example:

class MyDict(dict):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.__choice = []

    def popitem(self):
        if not self.__choice:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
        self.__choice.remove((key, value))
        return super().popitem()

Wait, but that would not use __choice. The standard popitem() returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair, but here the user wants a random one. So maybe overriding the popitem method to select randomly from __choice.

But perhaps the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in the dict. Then:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = random.choice(self.__choice)
    value = self[key]
    self.__choice.remove(key)
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But again, the exact structure is unclear. However, given the limited information, I think the most straightforward approach is to assume that __choice is a list of (key, value) pairs, and that the class has a way to remove the key from its internal storage. Since the user hasn't provided the class's other attributes, perhaps the code is supposed to use the __choice list directly, and the actual data is stored in another way, but the method is supposed to remove it from wherever it's stored.

But maybe the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in the instance's dictionary. Then, the code would pick a key from __choice, get the value from the dict, remove the key from __choice, and delete it from the dict.

In that case, the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = random.choice(self.__choice)
    value = self[key]
    self.__choice.remove(key)
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But the user's docstring says "remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So maybe the __choice is a list of (key, value) pairs, and the code selects one, removes it from the list, and deletes the key from the internal storage.

But again, without knowing the internal storage's name, perhaps the code is supposed to use the standard dict methods. However, the user hasn't indicated that.

Alternatively, perhaps the class is using __choice as a list of items, and the popitem method is supposed to remove that item from the class's data structure. But if the class is a dictionary, then maybe the __choice is a list of items, and when you pop one, you have to remove it from the dictionary. However, that would require that the __choice list is in sync with the dictionary.

But given the ambiguity, I think the best approach is to write code that uses random.choice on self.__choice, which is a list of (key, value) pairs, removes that pair from the list, and deletes the key from the class's internal dictionary. Assuming that the class has a 'data' attribute as a dictionary, but since the user hasn't specified, maybe the class itself is the dictionary. So perhaps:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove((key, value))
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But this would require that the class has a __choice list and that the instance itself is a dictionary. However, if the class is a subclass of dict, then self is the dict, and __choice is a list of items. But when you delete the key from self, that would remove it from the dict. However, the __choice list would need to be maintained properly. For example, when adding items, they are added to both the dict and the __choice list. But the user hasn't provided that code.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in the instance's dictionary. Then, the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = random.choice(self.__choice)
    value = self[key]
    self.__choice.remove(key)
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But the user's docstring says "random (key, value) pair via __choice", which could imply that __choice contains the pairs. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But given that the method is called popitem, which in standard dicts returns a (key, value) pair, perhaps the code is intended to be for a custom dict-like class that has a __choice list of items.

So, the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    item = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove(item)
    key, value = item
    del self.data[key]  # assuming data is the internal dict
    return key, value

But since the user hasn't specified the internal data structure's name, maybe the code should use self directly as a dictionary. However, if the class is a dictionary, then the __choice might be a list of keys. But in that case, the code would need to delete the key from the dict and remove it from __choice.

But in this case, the user's function is part of a class, which may or may not be a dict. Since the user hasn't provided the class definition, but only the method, I think the code should assume that the class has a __choice attribute which is a list of (key, value) pairs, and that removing the key from the class's data structure is handled by some method. However, without knowing the data structure, perhaps the code is supposed to use the standard dict methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the __choice is a list of keys, and the values are stored in the instance's dictionary. Then, the code would pick a key, get the value, remove the key from __choice, and delete it from the dict.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, I need to make an assumption. The most likely scenario is that the class is a custom dictionary that maintains a list of items in __choice, and when you pop an item, you remove it from both the list and the dictionary.

So, assuming that the class has a dictionary called 'data' and a list called '__choice', the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove((key, value))
    del self.data[key]
    return key, value

But since the user hasn't mentioned 'data', perhaps the class is using self as the dictionary. But that's not possible because if __choice is a list of items, then self would be the instance, which may not be a dict. So maybe the class is a subclass of dict and has an additional __choice list. For example:

class MyDict(dict):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.__choice = []

    def popitem(self):
        if not self.__choice:
            raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
        key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
        self.__choice.remove((key, value))
        return super().popitem()

Wait, but that doesn't use the __choice. The super().popitem() would remove a random item from the dict, but the __choice is a separate list. So this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a list of keys, and the code uses that to select a key, then deletes it from the dict and the __choice list. So:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key = random.choice(self.__choice)
    value = self.pop(key)
    self.__choice.remove(key)
    return key, value

This would work if the class is a subclass of dict and __choice is a list of keys. However, the standard popitem() in dict returns a (key, value) pair, but here, the code is using self.pop(key) to get the value, then returns key and value.

But the user's docstring says "remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So maybe the __choice contains the pairs, not just keys. Therefore, the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    item = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove(item)
    key, value = item
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But again, assuming that the class is a dict and that __choice is a list of (key, value) tuples. However, if the class is a dict, then self[key] would access the value, but when you delete the key, you need to make sure that the value is also removed. But in a dict, deleting the key removes the value.

But in this case, the code would need to have the __choice list maintained properly. For example, when adding items, they are added to both the dict and the __choice list.

But given the lack of context, I think the best approach is to write the code that selects a random item from __choice, removes it from the list, and deletes the key from the instance's dictionary. However, since the user hasn't provided the internal data structure's name, perhaps the code should use self directly as the dictionary. But that would require that __choice is a list of keys, and the code deletes the key from self.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a list of items, and the class uses that list to manage the items. But without knowing how the class stores its data, this is speculative.

In the absence of more information, I think the user expects that __choice is a list of (key, value) pairs, and that the class has a way to remove the key. So the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove((key, value))
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But again, the 'del self[key]' part assumes that the instance is a dictionary. If the class is a custom class that isn't a dict, then this might not work. However, given the function name and the docstring, this seems plausible.

Another thing to consider: in Python, the popitem() method for a dict returns and removes a (key, value) pair. So if the class is a subclass of dict, then the code could be overriding that method to select randomly from __choice. But again, the __choice's role is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a list that contains all the items, and the class is not a dict. For example, the class might have a list of items and a way to look up values by key. But that's more complex.

Given that the user's docstring says "via __choice in the class", I think the code should use self.__choice as the source of the items. Therefore, the code would select a random item from self.__choice, remove it from that list, and then remove it from the class's data structure. However, without knowing the data structure's name, perhaps the code is supposed to use the standard dict methods, and the __choice is a list of keys. But that's just a guess.

In conclusion, given the ambiguity, the code that uses random.choice on self.__choice (assuming it's a list of (key, value) tuples), removes the item from the list, and deletes the key from the instance's dictionary. So the code would be:

import random

def popitem(self):
    if not self.__choice:
        raise KeyError('popitem(): dictionary is empty')
    key, value = random.choice(self.__choice)
    self.__choice.remove((key, value))
    del self[key]
    return key, value

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. However, the 'del self[key]' part may not be correct if the class isn't a dict. But given that the user provided the function signature and the docstring, and no other context, this is the best I can do.
