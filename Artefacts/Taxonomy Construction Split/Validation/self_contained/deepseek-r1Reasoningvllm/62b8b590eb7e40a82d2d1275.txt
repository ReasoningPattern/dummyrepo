Okay, I need to write a Python function called _legacy_mergeOrderings that takes a list of orderings and combines them into a single list without duplicates, maintaining the order of their first occurrence. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand the problem. The function receives multiple lists, and I need to merge them into one. But the key is that the resulting list should have no duplicates, and the order should follow the first occurrence of each element across all the input lists.

So, for example, if the input is [[1,2,3], [3,4,5], [2,6]], the output should be [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Because 1 comes first, then 2, then 3, then 4, 5, and finally 6. Even though 2 and 3 appear in multiple lists, they only appear once in the result.

How can I achieve this? I think I can use a set to keep track of the elements I've already added. As I iterate through each list, I'll go through each element. For each element, if it's not in the set, I add it to the result list and the set. If it's already in the set, I skip it.

Wait, but the order needs to be based on the first occurrence. So I need to process each list in the order they appear. For each list in orderings, I'll loop through its elements. For each element, if it's not in the seen set, I add it to the result and mark it as seen. This way, the first occurrence from each list is preserved.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize an empty list called result to store the merged elements.
2. Initialize an empty set called seen to keep track of elements already added.
3. Iterate over each ordering in the input list orderings.
4. For each ordering, iterate over each element in the ordering.
5. For each element, check if it's in seen.
   a. If not, append it to result and add it to seen.
   b. If yes, skip it.
6. After processing all elements from all orderings, return the result list.

This approach should work. Now, I'll translate this into Python code.

I'll start by defining the function:

def _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings):

Then, initialize result and seen:

result = []
seen = set()

Loop through each ordering in orderings:

for ordering in orderings:
    for element in ordering:
        if element not in seen:
            result.append(element)
            seen.add(element)

Finally, return result:

return result

I think this should handle all cases. Let me test with the example I had earlier. If orderings is [[1,2,3], [3,4,5], [2,6]], the code should process each element:

First ordering: 1 is added, then 2, then 3. So result is [1,2,3].

Second ordering: 3 is already seen, skip. 4 is added. 5 is added. Result becomes [1,2,3,4,5].

Third ordering: 2 is seen, skip. 6 is added. Final result is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Which is correct.

What about duplicates within a single ordering? Like [[1,1,2], [2,3]]. The code should add 1 once, then 2, then 3. So the result is [1,2,3]. That's correct.

What if orderings is empty? The function returns an empty list, which is correct.

What if an ordering is empty? It's handled because the inner loop doesn't run.

I think this should cover all cases. So the code should be as written.
