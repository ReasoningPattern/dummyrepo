Okay, I need to write a Python function called vertex3tuple that takes a list of vertices and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain three points: the vertex itself and the two points adjacent to it. But if the indices are out of bounds, I should wrap around using modulo operation so that it takes the value from the start or end of the list as needed.

Hmm, let's think. The function should process each vertex in the input list. For each vertex at position i, the tuple should include vertices[i-1], vertices[i], and vertices[i+1]. But since the list is circular, when i-1 is negative, or i+1 exceeds the length, I have to handle those cases.

Wait, how exactly do I handle the indices? Like for the first element, the previous would be the last element of the list. Similarly, the next element after the last one is the first. So using modulo len(vertices) would work here. Let's see.

The input is vertices, which is a list. The output is a list of tuples. Each tuple is (prev, current, next). So for each i in range(len(vertices)), I can compute prev_index as (i-1) % len(vertices), and next_index as (i+1) % len(vertices). Then get those elements from the vertices list.

Wait, but in Python, lists are zero-based. Let me test the modulo idea. Suppose the list has 3 elements. For i=0, prev_index would be (0-1) mod 3 = 2, next is 1. For i=2, next would be (3) mod 3 is 0. That works. So that's the right approach.

So the steps are:

1. Iterate over each index i from 0 to len(vertices)-1.

2. For each i, compute the previous index (i-1) % len(vertices) and next index (i+1) % len(vertices).

3. Then, the three points are vertices[prev_index], vertices[i], vertices[next_index].

Wait, but the function's docstring says "the 2 points on both sides of the vertex". Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again. Oh, the vertex is one of the points, and the two points on either side. So yes, the previous and next points in the list, considering it's a polygon (so closed loop).

So the tuples should be (vertices[i-1], vertices[i], vertices[i+1]) but adjusted for the indices. So using modulo is correct here.

Wait, but when the list is empty? Probably, the function should return an empty list. But the problem says vertices are to be converted, so maybe the input is non-empty. But better to handle that case.

The code structure would be something like:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        prev = (i - 1) % n
        curr = i
        next_ = (i + 1) % n
        # but the elements are vertices[prev], vertices[curr], vertices[next]
        # So the tuple is (vertices[prev], vertices[curr], vertices[next])
        # Wait, no. Wait the function says each vertex and the two points on both sides. So the current is vertices[i], the previous is vertices[prev], and next is vertices[next]. So the tuple should have three elements: vertices[prev], vertices[i], vertices[next].

        triplet = (vertices[prev], vertices[i], vertices[next])
        result.append(triplet)
    return result

Wait, but the example in the docstring? Let me see. Suppose vertices is [A,B,C,D], then for i=0:

prev is (0-1) mod 4 = 3. next is 1. So triplet would be (D, A, B). Then for each vertex, that's the three points around it. That makes sense.

Wait the function returns a list of tuples where each tuple is three elements. So that's correct.

Wait, but the problem says "if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". Wait, maybe that's a different way to handle it. Like, when accessing vertices[i+1], if i+1 is out of bounds, then use 0? But that's not exactly the same as modulo. For example, if the list has length 4, and i is 3 (the last index), then i+1 is 4 which is out of bounds. So then, the next index would be 0. But using modulo, (3+1) mod 4 is 0, so that works. So the modulo approach handles that.

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking of using the previous index as i-1, but if that's negative, set to 0? Wait, no, the problem says "if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". Wait, perhaps I misunderstood. Let me read the docstring again.

"if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". Wait, maybe that's not exactly the modulo approach. Wait, maybe when trying to get the previous or next element, if the index is out of bounds, we use vertices[0]?

Wait, perhaps the problem wants that when accessing vertices[i-1], if i-1 is negative, then use vertices[0]. Similarly, for i+1, if it's >= len(vertices), then use 0. But that would also work, but perhaps the modulo approach is better here.

Wait for example, with a list of length n, the previous index for i=0 is n-1, but according to the problem's instruction, if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, the problem says "if the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0". Wait, perhaps when the index is out of bounds, instead of throwing an error, we use vertices[0]? Like, if the previous index is -1 (out of bounds), then we use 0. But that might not work for a polygon, since the first element's previous is the last.

Wait that instruction is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again:

"If the subscript is out of bounds, take the value of index as 0"

Hmm, maybe when the index is out of bounds, the element is taken as vertices[0]. So for example, for the first vertex, the previous would be -1, which is out of bounds, so take vertices[0], but the next would be 1. Wait that would be for vertex 0, the triplet would be (vertices[0], vertices[0], vertices[1])? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is expecting that when the previous index is negative, you take vertices[0], and when the next index is beyond the length, also take vertices[0]. But that would not give the correct circular behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that if you go out of bounds, you should use the vertex at index 0. Wait, but that would only be for the first element's previous? Or perhaps the indices are taken modulo the length, but in the problem's wording, maybe they're just capping it to 0? That can't be right.

Wait maybe the problem's instruction is similar to using modulo but in a way that for the previous index, when i is 0, the previous is len(vertices)-1. For the next index, when i is the last element (n-1), next is 0. So using modulo is correct here.

So perhaps the instruction is to handle wrapping around, but using modulo is the right way.

Therefore, the code I wrote before with modulo would work.

Wait, let me test with an example. Suppose vertices is [v0, v1, v2, v3].

For i=0, previous is 3, next is 1. So triplet is (v3, v0, v1).

For i=3, previous is 2, next is (3+1) mod 4 =0. So triplet is (v2, v3, v0). That's correct.

So that code should work. So the function would be:

Wait but the code I have in mind is:

def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        prev = (i - 1) % n
        next_ = (i + 1) % n
        res.append( (vertices[prev], vertices[i], vertices[next_]) )
    return res

Wait, that's the core of it. Let me see if that's correct.

Yes, that should work. Let's see for a list of 3 elements:

indices 0,1,2.

i=0: prev is 2, next is 1. So triplet (v2, v0, v1).

i=1: prev 0, next 2. (v0, v1, v2)

i=2: prev 1, next 0. (v1, v2, v0).

Which is correct for a polygon.

Another case, when the list has only 1 element, n=1. Then for i=0:

prev is (0-1) mod 1 = -1 mod 1 is 0 (since 1*0=0, 0-1 =-1, but mod 1 would give 0?), wait wait, (i-1) mod 1 when i=0 is ( -1 ) mod 1. Let me compute that. In Python, (-1) % 1 is 0, because 1 * (-1) =-1, but remainder is 0? Wait no, 1 divides into -1 exactly -1 times. So -1 = 1*(-1) + 0. So yes, mod is 0. So prev would be 0, next would be (0+1) mod 1 = 0 mod1 =0. So triplet is (v0, v0, v0). Which is correct since for a single-vertex polygon, both sides are itself.

So the code works for that case.

Another case, when there are two vertices. Let's say [a, b].

For i=0:

prev is ( -1 ) mod 2 → 1 (since -1 = 2*(-1) +1). So prev is 1, current is 0, next is 1 mod2 → 1. So triplet is (b, a, b).

Wait, the next index is (0+1) mod2 → 1, which is correct. So the triplet would be vertices[1], vertices[0], vertices[1]. So that's correct.

Wait for i=1:

prev is 0 mod2 (since 1-1=0), next is 2 mod2 → 0. So triplet is (a, b, a). That makes sense. The two vertices each have their previous and next as the other one. So that's correct.

So the code should handle all cases correctly. The only thing is that the vertices are a list, and each element is a point (maybe a tuple or coordinate). But the function just needs to create tuples of three elements. The code seems okay.

Wait, the function's docstring says "the elements of vertices represented by tuple". Wait, the return is a list of tuples, each tuple has three elements from vertices. So the code is correct. The input vertices can be any list, like a list of coordinates, but the code just uses their indices. So the code is correct.

I think that's the solution. Let me code that.
