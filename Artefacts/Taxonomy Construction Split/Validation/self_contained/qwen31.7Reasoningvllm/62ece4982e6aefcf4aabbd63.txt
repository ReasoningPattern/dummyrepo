Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_none_string that checks if a given value is a string representing None. The docstring says it returns True if the type is string and the lowercase of the value is 'none'. 

First, the function takes 'val: any' as input. So the function must handle any type. Then, it checks if the type of val is string. Wait, but in Python, the type of None is NoneType, not string. So if val is None, its type is NoneType, so the check type(val) == str would be False. But the problem says to check if the string represents None. So maybe the function is supposed to check if the string is 'none' when lowercased.

So the steps are: check if the input is a string. If it is, then check if the lowercase version is 'none'. Return True if both conditions are met. Otherwise, False.

So the code would be:

def is_none_string(val: any) -> bool:
    return isinstance(val, str) and val.lower() == 'none'

Wait, but what about if val is None? Then type(val) is NoneType, so isinstance(val, str) would be False. So that's handled. So the function works as intended.

Testing examples: if val is 'none', returns True. If val is 'NONE', also True. If val is 'none ', then lower() would be 'none', so True. If val is a number, like 42, then False. If val is None, then False. So that's correct.

So the code is straightforward. Just check if the type is str and the lowercased string is 'none'.
