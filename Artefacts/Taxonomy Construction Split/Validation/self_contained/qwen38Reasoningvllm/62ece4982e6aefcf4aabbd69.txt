Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the function _replace_register based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring says that the function should replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and then delete flow_params[register_value]. 

Wait, so the function takes flow_params, which is probably a list or a dictionary. But the way the indices are used, like register_number and register_value, maybe it's a list? Or maybe a dictionary where the keys are register numbers. Hmm. Let me think. The docstring mentions flow_params[register_number] and flow_params[register_value], which suggests that flow_params is a list or a dictionary. But since the function is named _replace_register, maybe it's a list of registers?

Wait, if it's a list, then register_number and register_value would be indexes. But the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, then delete the register_value entry. Wait, but if it's a list, deleting an index would shift the elements. But maybe flow_params is a dictionary? Because in a dictionary, you can have keys that are numbers, and deleting a key is straightforward.

Wait, the function is called _replace_register. Let me think about the parameters. The first parameter is flow_params, which is probably a list or a dictionary. The second is register_number, which is the index or key of the register to be replaced. The third is register_value, which is the index or key of the value to take. 

But the docstring says replace flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value], then delete flow_params[register_value]. So, for example, if flow_params is a list, then maybe we take the value from register_value index and put it into register_number index, then delete the register_value index. But if it's a list, deleting an index would require shifting elements. However, if it's a dictionary, then we can just assign the value and delete the key. 

Wait, but the function is named _replace_register. Maybe the flow_params is a list of registers, and the function is replacing the value at a certain register index with another register's value, then removing that other register. But how does that work? Let me think of an example. Suppose flow_params is a list where each element represents a register's value. Let's say we have flow_params = [a, b, c, d]. If register_number is 1 and register_value is 2, then we replace flow_params[1] with flow_params[2], which is c, then delete flow_params[2]. So the list would become [a, c, d]. But then the index 2 is still there. Wait, maybe the function is intended to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, then remove the register_value from the list. But if it's a list, removing an element would change the indices. Alternatively, maybe it's a dictionary where the keys are register numbers, and the values are the register values. So if register_number is a key, and register_value is another key, then we take the value from register_value and assign it to register_number, then delete the register_value key. 

But the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to replace the value at the register_number with the value from register_value, then delete the register_value. But that would imply that register_value is a value, not an index or key. Or perhaps there's a confusion in the parameter names. Let me recheck the docstring.

The docstring says: Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]. So the syntax suggests that flow_params is a list or a dictionary. If it's a list, then register_number and register_value are indexes. So for example, if flow_params is a list, then we take the value at index register_value and assign it to index register_number, then delete the element at index register_value. But if it's a list, deleting an element would shift the elements after it. However, the function might be intended to work with a list where the indices are not contiguous or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a dictionary where the keys are register numbers, and the values are the register values. So, for example, if flow_params is a dictionary, then we take the value from register_value key and assign it to register_number key, then delete the register_value key. 

But the parameter names are register_number and register_value. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, then delete the register_value. But that would mean that register_value is a key or index, not a value. So perhaps the function is intended to work with a dictionary. Let me assume that flow_params is a dictionary. Then, the steps would be:

1. Get the value from flow_params[register_value].
2. Assign that value to flow_params[register_number].
3. Delete the key register_value from flow_params.

But wait, the docstring says "delete flow_params[register_value]". So if flow_params is a dictionary, then that's straightforward. However, if it's a list, then deleting an element by index would require knowing the index. But the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value. Maybe the function is intended to work with a list, and the register_value is the index of the value to take. So, for example, if flow_params is a list, then:

flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
del flow_params[register_value]

But that would modify the list. However, if the list is being used as a register file, perhaps the indices are fixed, and the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, then remove the register_value. But that would leave the list with one fewer element. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, and then delete the register_value entry. But if flow_params is a list, then register_value is an index. So, for example, if the list has elements [10, 20, 30], and register_number is 0, register_value is 1, then after replacement, the list becomes [20, 20, 30], then delete index 1, resulting in [20, 30]. 

But the problem is that when you delete an element from a list, the indices of the elements after it change. However, the function might not care about that. 

But the user hasn't specified the type of flow_params. The function signature is given as def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):. So the parameters are flow_params, register_number, and register_value. 

So, the function needs to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, then delete the register_value. 

Assuming that flow_params is a list, then:

flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, if register_value is an index, then after deleting, the list is modified. However, if register_number and register_value are the same, then this would cause an error because you can't delete an element that's already been replaced. But the function's docstring doesn't mention handling that case. 

Alternatively, if flow_params is a dictionary, then:

flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
del flow_params[register_value]

But then, the keys are register numbers. So, for example, if the dictionary has keys 'reg1', 'reg2', etc., but the parameters are integers. Maybe the function is intended to work with a dictionary where the keys are integers. 

But the user hasn't specified. However, the function's name suggests that it's dealing with registers, which are often numbered. So perhaps flow_params is a list where each index represents a register. 

But the problem is that when you delete an element from a list, the indices shift. However, the function might not need to handle that. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to work with a list where the register_value is the value to be used, not an index. But that would be confusing with the notation flow_params[register_value]. 

Wait, the docstring says "Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value]". So the syntax is that flow_params is a structure that can be indexed with register_number and register_value. So, perhaps flow_params is a dictionary. 

Let me proceed under the assumption that flow_params is a dictionary. Then, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    # Assign the value from register_value to register_number
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    # Delete the register_value key
    del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, what if register_value is not present in the dictionary? That would cause a KeyError. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that. So perhaps the function assumes that register_value exists. 

Alternatively, if flow_params is a list, then:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    # Replace the value at register_number with the value at register_value
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    # Delete the element at register_value index
    del flow_params[register_value]

But again, if register_number and register_value are the same, this would cause an error. 

But the user hasn't provided any examples. So perhaps the function is intended to work with a list. However, the problem is that when you delete an element from a list, the indices of the elements after it change. For example, if the list is [a, b, c, d], and you delete index 1, then the list becomes [a, c, d]. But if register_number is 0 and register_value is 1, then after replacement, the list would be [b, b, c, d], then deleting index 1 would result in [b, c, d]. 

But perhaps the function is intended to work with a list where the indices are not contiguous, or perhaps it's a different data structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, and then remove the register_value. But if flow_params is a list, then register_value is an index. 

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is intended to work with a dictionary. Let me check the parameters again. The function parameters are register_number and register_value. So, if flow_params is a dictionary, then register_number and register_value are keys. 

But the function's name is _replace_register, which might imply that it's replacing a register's value. So, for example, in a CPU's register file, each register has a number, and the function is replacing the value of register_number with the value of register_value, then deleting register_value. 

But how would that work? Let's say the registers are stored in a dictionary. So, if you have register 1 and register 2, you take the value of register 2 and assign it to register 1, then delete register 2. 

So the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, what if register_number is the same as register_value? Then, you would be deleting the key after assigning it to itself, which would be redundant but not an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to work with a list. But in that case, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But again, if flow_params is a list, then the indices are positions. 

But the user hasn't specified the type of flow_params. However, given that the function is named _replace_register, and the parameters are register_number and register_value, perhaps it's a dictionary. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, and then remove the register_value. But perhaps the function is intended to work with a list where the register_value is the value to be used, not an index. But that would be conflicting with the notation. 

Hmm. The user might have made a mistake in the parameter names. Maybe register_value is supposed to be the index, not the value. But given the docstring, it's written as flow_params[register_value], which suggests that register_value is an index or key. 

So, the code would be as follows. Let me proceed with the dictionary assumption. 

But perhaps the function is intended to work with a list. Let me think of possible test cases. Suppose flow_params is a list, and register_number is 0, register_value is 1. Then, the code would replace flow_params[0] with flow_params[1], then delete flow_params[1]. 

But in Python, lists are mutable, so this would work. However, if the list is being used as a register file, maybe the indices are fixed. But the function's behavior is to replace and delete. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, and then delete the register_value. But if flow_params is a list, then register_value is an index. 

But in any case, the code would be straightforward. So, regardless of whether it's a list or a dictionary, the code would be:

flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
del flow_params[register_value]

But the user might have intended flow_params to be a list. However, the function's name and the parameters are a bit ambiguous. 

Wait, the function's name is _replace_register. Maybe the function is part of a larger system where flow_params is a list of registers. For example, in some simulation or processing context. 

But without more information, I'll proceed with the assumption that flow_params is a list. 

So, the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, if flow_params is a list, then register_value is an index. So, for example, if the list has elements [10, 20, 30], and register_number is 0, register_value is 1, then after replacement, the list becomes [20, 20, 30], then deleting index 1 would result in [20, 30]. 

But what if register_value is larger than the length of the list? That would cause an error. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that. 

Alternatively, maybe flow_params is a dictionary. Let me think again. 

If flow_params is a dictionary, then the code would be the same. 

But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps the function is intended to work with a list. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace the value at register_number with the value from register_value, and then delete the register_value. But perhaps the function is supposed to take the value from register_value and assign it to register_number, then remove register_value. 

In any case, the code would be as written. 

But perhaps the function is supposed to replace the value of the register at register_number with the value of the register at register_value, then delete the register_value. 

So the code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But in Python, if flow_params is a list, then this would work. However, if it's a dictionary, then the same code would work. 

But the user might have intended flow_params to be a list. However, the function's parameters are named register_number and register_value, which could be either. 

But given that the function is called _replace_register, and the parameters are register_number and register_value, perhaps the function is intended to work with a dictionary where the keys are register numbers. 

But the code would be the same regardless. 

So, the code would be as above. 

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me think again. 

The docstring says to replace flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value], then delete flow_params[register_value]. 

So, the steps are:

1. Assign the value at register_value to register_number.
2. Delete the entry at register_value.

So, the code would be:

flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
del flow_params[register_value]

But in Python, if flow_params is a list, then del flow_params[register_value] would delete the element at that index. 

But if flow_params is a dictionary, then del flow_params[register_value] would delete the key. 

So, the code is correct regardless of whether flow_params is a list or a dictionary. 

But the function's name suggests that it's replacing a register, which is more commonly represented as a dictionary. However, without more context, it's hard to say. 

But given the parameters, the code is straightforward. So the generated code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But wait, the user might have intended that register_value is the value to be used, not the index. But that would be conflicting with the notation. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace the register_number's value with the register_value's value, but that would be different. 

But according to the docstring, it's flow_params[register_number] and flow_params[register_value], which implies that register_number and register_value are indices or keys into flow_params. 

Therefore, the code is as above. 

But perhaps the function is supposed to take the value from register_value and assign it to register_number, then delete register_value. 

Yes, that's what the docstring says. So the code would be correct. 

But I need to make sure that the parameters are passed correctly. 

So the final code would be:

def _replace_register(flow_params, register_number, register_value):
    """
    Replace the value of flow_params[register_number] with flow_params[register_value] and delete flow_params[register_value]
    """
    flow_params[register_number] = flow_params[register_value]
    del flow_params[register_value]

But I should check if the parameters are integers or strings. But since the function is called _replace_register, perhaps they are integers. 

So, the code is as written. 

But maybe the user wants to handle some edge cases. For example, if register_number and register_value are the same. In that case, the code would assign the value to itself and then delete it, which would result in the register_number's value being lost. But the docstring doesn't mention this, so perhaps it's acceptable. 

Therefore, the code is correct.
