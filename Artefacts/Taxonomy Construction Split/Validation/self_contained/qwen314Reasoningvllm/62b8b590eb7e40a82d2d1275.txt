Okay, I need to write a Python function called _legacy_mergeOrderings that takes a list of orderings and combines them into a single list without duplicates, preserving the order of elements based on their first occurrence. Let me think about how to approach this.

So, the input is multiple lists. The goal is to merge them sequentially, but make sure that each element appears only once in the final list. The order should be determined by the order in which elements first appear across all the orderings. For example, if the first list has [a, b], and the second has [b, c], the merged list should be [a, b, c], not [b, a, c] because a appeared first in the first list.

Hmm, how to do that. I remember that in Python, to maintain insertion order and avoid duplicates, you can use a list and a set. But since the order depends on the first occurrence, I need to iterate through each list in order and add elements to the result list only if they haven't been added before.

Let me outline the steps. Initialize an empty list for the result and an empty set to track seen elements. Then, loop through each ordering list in the order they are given. For each element in the current list, check if it's not in the seen set. If it's not, add it to the result list and the set. If it is, skip it.

Wait, but the function is named _legacy_mergeOrderings. Maybe it's part of a class or uses some older method? But the problem doesn't mention that, so probably just a regular function.

So the code structure would be:

def _legacy_mergeOrderings(orderings):
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for ordering in orderings:
        for item in ordering:
            if item not in seen:
                seen.add(item)
                result.append(item)
    return result

Wait, but what if the orderings are not lists? The function signature says orderings is a parameter, but the docstring says it's multiple lists. So assuming that orderings is a list of lists. So the code should work as is.

Let me test with an example. Suppose orderings is [[1,2], [2,3], [4,5]]. The merged list should be [1,2,3,4,5]. The code loops through each list. First list adds 1 and 2. Second list checks 2 (already in seen), skips, then adds 3. Third list adds 4 and 5. That's correct.

Another example: [[ 'a', 'b', 'c'], ['b', 'a', 'd']]. The result should be ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']. The code would process the first list, adding a, b, c. Then in the second list, 'b' is already there, 'a' is there, then 'd' is added. So yes.

What about if there are multiple duplicates across different lists? Like [[1,2], [3,1], [4,5]]. The merged list would be [1,2,3,4,5]. The code adds 1 from the first list, then 2. Then in the second list, 3 is new, added. 1 is already in seen, so skipped. Third list adds 4 and 5. Correct.

I think that's the right approach. So the code should be as I outlined. Let me make sure there are no edge cases. What if orderings is empty? Then return an empty list. If a list in orderings is empty, it's skipped. Also, if elements are of different types, like integers and strings, but the problem doesn't mention handling that, so the code should handle them as per their hashability. Since sets in Python can only contain hashable types, the function assumes that all elements in the orderings are hashable. That's probably acceptable given the context.

So the code should be straightforward. Use a set to track elements that have been added, and a list to maintain the order. Iterate through each list in orderings, then each item in the list, check if in the set, add if not. That's the plan.
