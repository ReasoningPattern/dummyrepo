    Get or set the scale of the graph.

    If *other* is ``None``, return the scale of this graph.

    If a numeric *other* is provided, rescale to that value.
    If the graph has unknown or zero scale,
    rescaling that will raise :exc:`~.LenaValueError`.

    To get meaningful results, graph's fields are used.
    Only the last coordinate is rescaled.
    For example, if the graph has *x* and *y* coordinates,
    then *y* will be rescaled, and for a 3-dimensional graph
    *z* will be rescaled.
    All errors are rescaled together with their coordinate.
