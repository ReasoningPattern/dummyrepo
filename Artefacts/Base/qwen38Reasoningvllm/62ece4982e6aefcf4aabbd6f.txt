Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function get_repo_archive. Let me read the problem statement again. The function takes a URL and a destination path, downloads the .tar.gz archive, and extracts it. Then, it returns the path where the archive was extracted. The docstring says that the archive contains 'desc' files for each package. 

First, I should handle downloading the file. Using the requests library makes sense. So I'll start by importing requests. Then, I'll use requests.get to fetch the content from the URL. But wait, I need to make sure the URL is correct and the response is successful. So I'll check if the response status code is 200, else raise an exception.

Next, I need to save the downloaded content to a temporary file. Maybe create a temporary directory first. Oh, the destination_path is given, so perhaps I should download the file into that directory. Wait, the function is supposed to extract the archive to the destination_path. So maybe first download the .tar.gz file to the destination_path, then extract it there.

Wait, but the destination_path is a Path object. So I should check if it's a directory. If not, maybe create it. But the function's responsibility is to extract the archive to that path. So steps: download the file, save it to a temporary location, then extract it to destination_path.

Wait, but the user might want to download the archive and then extract it. So perhaps the function downloads the archive to a temporary file, then extracts it to the destination_path. Or maybe the archive is downloaded directly to the destination_path and then extracted there. Let me think: the destination_path is where the extraction happens. So the archive file itself might be stored in a temporary location first, then extracted to the destination.

Alternatively, maybe the function downloads the archive to the destination_path as a temporary file, then extracts it. For example, the user provides the destination path, so the code should download the file into that directory, then extract it. But maybe the destination_path is the directory where the extracted files should go, so the archive is first saved as a file in that directory, then extracted.

So, first, I need to download the .tar.gz from the URL. Let's use requests.get. Then, check if the response is successful. Then, save the content to a temporary file in the destination_path. Wait, but the destination_path might not exist. So I should create it if it's not a directory. Or maybe the function assumes that the destination_path is a valid directory? The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps I should create the directory if it doesn't exist.

Wait, the destination_path is a Path object. So maybe the function should ensure that the destination directory exists. So I'll add a check: if the destination_path is not a directory, create it. Or maybe the user expects that the destination is a directory. But the function's return type is Path, which is the path where the archive is extracted. So perhaps the destination_path is the directory where the extraction happens. Therefore, the code should first download the archive to a temporary file, then extract it into the destination_path.

So, steps:

1. Check if the destination_path is a directory. If not, create it.
2. Download the .tar.gz file from the given URL.
3. Save the downloaded content to a temporary file in the destination_path directory.
4. Extract the .tar.gz archive to the destination_path.
5. Return the destination_path.

But how to handle the temporary file? Maybe the function can download the file directly to the destination_path, perhaps with a temporary name, then extract it. Alternatively, maybe the function downloads the file to a temporary location and then moves it, but that's more complicated. Probably, it's easier to download the file to the destination directory, then extract it.

Wait, but if the destination_path is a directory, then the archive file would be saved there. For example, if the URL is 'http://example.com/repo.tar.gz', then the code would download it to destination_path / 'repo.tar.gz', then extract it into destination_path.

But maybe the destination_path is the directory where the files should be extracted, not where the archive is stored. So perhaps the code should first download the archive to a temporary file, then extract it into the destination_path. But the problem says that the archive contains 'desc' files for each package. So the extraction would create files in the destination_path.

So, code steps:

- Use requests to get the content from the URL.
- Check if the response is successful.
- Save the content to a temporary file in the destination_path directory. Maybe using a temporary filename like 'archive.tar.gz'.
- Then, use tarfile to open the archive and extract all contents into the destination_path.

Wait, but the destination_path might not be a directory. So first, check if it's a directory. If not, maybe create it. Or perhaps the function expects that the destination_path is a directory. But to be safe, perhaps create the directory if it doesn't exist.

So, in code:

import requests
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    """
    Given an url and a destination path, retrieve and extract .tar.gz archive which contains 'desc' file for each package

    Args:
        url: url of the .tar.gz archive to download
        destination_path: the path on disk where to extract archive
    Returns:
        path where the archive is extracted to
    """
    # Ensure the destination path is a directory
    destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Download the archive
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad responses
    
    # Save the downloaded content to a temporary file in the destination directory
    archive_path = destination_path / "archive.tar.gz"
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    
    # Extract the archive
    with tarfile.open(archive_path) as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    
    # Return the destination path
    return destination_path

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the path where the archive is extracted. So if the archive is extracted into destination_path, then return that. But maybe the extraction creates a directory inside destination_path? For example, if the tar.gz has a top-level directory, then extractall would extract into destination_path, but maybe the archive is structured with a directory inside. Wait, the problem says that the archive contains 'desc' files for each package. So perhaps the archive is a directory structure with each package's desc file. But the extraction would place the contents into the destination_path. So the function returns the destination_path.

But maybe the archive is a single directory, and the extraction would create that directory inside destination_path. However, the problem says that the archive is extracted to the destination_path. So the code as written would extract all files into the destination_path. But maybe the archive is structured such that when you extract it, it's a directory inside the destination_path. For example, if the tar.gz is named 'repo.tar.gz' and contains a directory 'repo', then extracting to destination_path would place 'repo' inside it. But the problem says that the archive contains 'desc' files for each package. So perhaps the extraction is done into the destination_path, and the function returns that path.

But the problem says that the destination_path is where to extract the archive. So the code should extract the archive into that path. Therefore, the code above is correct.

But wait, what if the destination_path is not a directory? The code uses mkdir with exist_ok=True, so if it's a file, this would raise an error. So perhaps the function should check that destination_path is a directory. But the function's argument is a Path, so maybe the user is supposed to pass a directory. However, the code as written would create the directory if it doesn't exist. So that's okay.

Another thing: the archive is saved as 'archive.tar.gz' in the destination_path. But maybe the URL's filename is different. For example, if the URL is 'http://example.com/repo.tar.gz', then the code saves it as 'archive.tar.gz' in the destination directory. That might not be correct. Wait, the problem says that the URL is the .tar.gz archive. So perhaps the code should save the file with the same name as the URL's filename. But how to extract the filename from the URL?

Ah, right. The code as written uses a fixed name 'archive.tar.gz', but that's not correct. The actual filename from the URL should be used. So, for example, if the URL is 'http://example.com/repo.tar.gz', then the file should be saved as 'repo.tar.gz' in the destination_path. So to get the filename from the URL, we can use the last part of the URL.

So, modifying the code:

filename = url.split('/')[-1]
archive_path = destination_path / filename

But what if the URL has parameters or other parts? For example, 'http://example.com/repo.tar.gz?version=1'. Then splitting on '/' would get 'repo.tar.gz?version=1' as the filename. That's not ideal. Maybe using urlsplit from urllib.parse to get the filename.

Alternatively, using requests to get the filename from the response headers. But if the URL doesn't have a filename, maybe the code can use a default. However, the problem says that the URL is of the .tar.gz archive, so perhaps it's safe to assume that the URL ends with .tar.gz. But to be more robust, maybe extract the filename from the URL.

So, perhaps:

from urllib.parse import urlparse

url_parts = urlparse(url)
filename = url_parts.path.split('/')[-1]
archive_path = destination_path / filename

But then, if the URL is something like 'http://example.com/repo.tar.gz', this would work. However, if the URL is a local path, but that's unlikely since it's a URL. So, maybe that's acceptable.

But maybe the user wants to save the file with the same name as the URL's path. So, the code should use that.

So, updating the code:

import requests
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    """
    Given an url and a destination path, retrieve and extract .tar.gz archive which contains 'desc' file for each package

    Args:
        url: url of the .tar.gz archive to download
        destination_path: the path on disk where to extract archive
    Returns:
        path where the archive is extracted to
    """
    # Ensure the destination path is a directory
    destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Parse the URL to get the filename
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    filename = parsed_url.path.split('/')[-1]
    archive_path = destination_path / filename
    
    # Download the archive
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad responses
    
    # Save the downloaded content to the archive_path
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    
    # Extract the archive
    with tarfile.open(archive_path) as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    
    # Return the destination path
    return destination_path

But wait, what if the URL doesn't have a filename? Like if it's 'http://example.com/'? Then parsed_url.path would be '/', and split would give [''], so filename would be empty. That's a problem. But the problem states that the URL is of a .tar.gz archive, so it's safe to assume that the URL has a proper filename. However, to handle such cases, perhaps we can check if the filename is empty and use a default, but that's beyond the scope here. The problem says the URL is for a .tar.gz, so maybe the code can proceed.

Another thing: the code uses 'requests.get' which may not be the best for large files, but given the problem statement, it's acceptable.

Also, need to handle possible exceptions, like network errors, but the problem doesn't specify error handling, so perhaps just raise them.

So the code would download the file, save it to the destination_path with the filename extracted from the URL, then extract it into the destination_path. Then return the destination_path.

But what if the destination_path is not writable? The code would raise an error, which is acceptable.

Another point: the function is supposed to return the path where the archive is extracted. So after extraction, the destination_path is the directory where the files are extracted. So the code returns that.

So this should be the correct approach. Let me check if there are any other issues.

Wait, the code uses 'tarfile.open(archive_path)' and then extractall into destination_path. That should work. But maybe the archive is a .tar.gz, so the open function should handle that. The tarfile module can open .tar.gz files.

Yes, tarfile.open can handle .tar.gz by default if the file is compressed. So that's okay.

So the code seems correct. Now, I need to make sure that the code is written in Python markdown format, and only the code is output, no explanations.

So the final code would be:

import requests
import tarfile
from pathlib import Path
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_repo_archive(url: str, destination_path: Path) -> Path:
    """
    Given an url and a destination path, retrieve and extract .tar.gz archive which contains 'desc' file for each package

    Args:
        url: url of the .tar.gz archive to download
        destination_path: the path on disk where to extract archive
    Returns:
        path where the archive is extracted to
    """
    destination_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    filename = parsed_url.path.split('/')[-1]
    archive_path = destination_path / filename
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    with open(archive_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    with tarfile.open(archive_path) as tar:
        tar.extractall(path=destination_path)
    return destination_path

But wait, what if the URL is a local file? Like 'file:///path/to/archive.tar.gz'? The urlparse would still extract the path correctly. So that's okay.

Another thing: the code may need to handle cases where the URL is not a .tar.gz. But the function's docstring says that the URL is for a .tar.gz, so perhaps it's not necessary.

So this should be the code. Now, check for any possible errors. For example, if the URL is invalid, requests.get would raise an exception. The code uses response.raise_for_status(), which would raise HTTPError if the response is 4xx or 5xx. That's correct.

Also, the code uses the Path object for destination_path, so the mkdir is handled properly.

Yes, this should work. So the code is as above.
