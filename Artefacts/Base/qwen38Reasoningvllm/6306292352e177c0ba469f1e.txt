Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function process_text_links based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring says it processes links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links. Let me think about what that means.

First, the function should identify links within the text. Textual links are probably URLs that are embedded in the text, like "Visit https://example.com for more info." So the task is to find those URLs and convert them into HTML links, maybe adding attributes like target="_blank" or rel="noopener noreferrer" for security.

But the docstring mentions adding some attributes. Maybe the user wants to add specific attributes, but since it's not specified, I'll assume common ones. Also, linkifying means turning the text into clickable links. So the main steps are: find all URLs in the text, replace them with <a> tags, and add attributes.

How to find URLs? Regular expressions can help. I'll need a regex pattern that matches URLs. The pattern should cover common URL formats. Let me recall a standard URL regex. Something like r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\$\-])+'?

Wait, maybe I should use a more robust pattern. Also, need to consider different URL schemes like ftp,mailto, etc. But the example given is https, so maybe focus on that. Alternatively, use a library like BeautifulSoup or a regex that can handle various cases.

But since the user wants a standalone function, perhaps using regex is better. Let me think about the regex. Let's use a pattern that matches http, https, and maybe ftp. Also, ensure it doesn't match email addresses unless they're in the format mailto:.

Wait, the docstring says "textual links," which might refer to URLs written in the text, not email addresses. So maybe the regex should target URLs starting with http:// or https://.

So the regex pattern could be r'(https?://\S+)'.

Then, for each match, replace it with an <a> tag. The attributes part: maybe add target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" to prevent security issues when clicking links. Also, maybe add class or other attributes, but since the docstring doesn't specify, I'll stick with the common ones.

So the function will use re.sub with a callback function to replace each URL with the <a> tag. The callback function will take the match object, extract the URL, and return the HTML link.

Wait, but how to handle cases where the URL is part of a larger word? Like "Check out my site https://example.com" â€“ the regex should capture the entire URL. The \S+ ensures that it's non-whitespace characters following the protocol.

But maybe the regex needs to be more precise. For example, it should match the entire URL, including possible paths, query parameters, etc. Also, need to avoid matching parts of other words. For instance, "http://example" should not match if it's part of a longer word. But with the regex as r'(https?://\S+)', it would match "http://example.com" but not "http://example" if it's not followed by a dot and more characters. Hmm, maybe not perfect, but it's a starting point.

Another consideration: the function should not modify the text if it's not a URL. So using a regex to find all occurrences and replace them.

So the code structure would be:

Import re.

Define the function process_text_links(text).

Use re.sub with a pattern to find URLs, and a replacement function that wraps the URL in <a> tags with attributes.

Wait, but what about email links? The docstring doesn't mention them, so perhaps focus on http/https.

So the replacement function would take the match, get the URL, and return f'<a href="{url}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{url}</a>'.

But maybe the user wants to add other attributes? Since the docstring says "some attributes," but it's not specified, I'll assume those common ones.

Now, code:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    """
    Process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying textual links.
    """
    # Define the regex pattern for URLs
    url_pattern = re.compile(r'(https?://\S+)')
    # Replace each URL with an <a> tag
    return url_pattern.sub(lambda m: f'<a href="{m.group(1)}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{m.group(1)}</a>', text)

Wait, but maybe the user wants to allow other protocols like ftp? Or maybe not. The docstring says "textual links," which could be any URL, but perhaps the function is intended for web links. Let me check the example again. The example in the docstring isn't provided, but the function's purpose is to linkify URLs.

Another thing: the replacement should not add any other text, just the link. So the function replaces the URL with the HTML anchor tag.

But what about if the URL is part of a larger string? For example, "Check out https://example.com/page?query=1". The regex would capture the entire URL, so that's okay.

Testing this function: if the input is "Visit https://example.com", the output should be "Visit <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://example.com</a>".

But maybe the user wants to add attributes like class, title, etc. However, since the docstring doesn't specify, I'll proceed with the common attributes.

Another thing: the regex might not handle all edge cases. For example, URLs with ports, like "http://example.com:8080". But the current pattern would capture that.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to use a more sophisticated approach, like using the linkify library. But since the user hasn't mentioned that, and wants a standalone solution, regex is the way to go.

So the code above should work. Let me make sure to include the import statement. The user didn't mention it, but the code will need re module.

So the final code is as written. Let me check for any possible errors. The lambda function in re.sub is correct. The pattern is compiled once, which is efficient.

Yes, that should do it. The function processes the text by replacing URLs with linkified HTML.
