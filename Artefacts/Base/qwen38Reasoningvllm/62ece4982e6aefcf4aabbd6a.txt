Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called replace_dots. The function's purpose is to replace all dots in a string with a specified argument. The function signature is given as def replace_dots(value, arg):, and the docstring explains that it takes an old string and a new string to replace the dots.

First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements. The function should take a string 'value' and another string 'arg', then replace every occurrence of '.' in 'value' with 'arg'. Wait, but replacing each '.' with 'arg' could mean that if 'arg' is a longer string, each dot is replaced by that string. For example, if value is "a.b.c" and arg is "X", the result should be "aXbXc". But if arg is "YZ", then it becomes "aYZbYZc".

So the approach here is to iterate through each character in the input string 'value', check if it's a dot, and replace it with 'arg'. But how to do that efficiently in Python. The simplest way is to use the replace method of strings. Wait, the replace method can replace all occurrences. So maybe value.replace('.', arg) would work. But wait, the replace method in Python replaces all instances of the old string with the new one. However, in this case, the old string is a single character, '.', so replacing that with 'arg' should work.

Wait, let me test this. Suppose value is "hello.world", and arg is "!", then value.replace('.', arg) would result in "hello!world". That's correct. So the function can be as simple as returning value.replace('.', arg). But I need to make sure that the function is handling the replacement correctly. Also, the parameters are named 'value' and 'arg', which might be a bit confusing. But according to the docstring, 'value' is the old string, and 'arg' is the new string to replace '.'.

Wait, the docstring says "arg: new string to replace '.'". So the function is supposed to replace every '.' in 'value' with 'arg'. So the replace method is the right approach here. So the code would be straightforward.

But wait, what if 'arg' is a string that contains dots? For example, if arg is "a.b", then replacing each '.' with arg would result in "a.b" being inserted each time. But that's exactly what the function is supposed to do. The problem statement doesn't mention any restrictions on 'arg', so we can assume it's a valid string.

So the function can be written as:

def replace_dots(value, arg):
    """
    Replaces all values of '.' to arg from the given string
    Args:
        value: old string
        arg: new string to replace '.'
    Returns:
        str, the replaced string
    """
    return value.replace('.', arg)

Wait, but the docstring says "Replaces all values of '.' to arg", which might be a bit ambiguous. Does it mean replacing each '.' with 'arg', or replacing the substring '.' with 'arg'? But in Python, the replace method replaces all occurrences. So for example, "a.b.c".replace(".", "X") becomes "aXbXc". So that's correct.

So the code is simple. Just return the replace method. But I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly named. The function is called replace_dots, and the first argument is 'value', which is the string to process. The second argument is 'arg', which is the replacement string. So the code should be as straightforward as that.

Wait, but maybe the user wants to replace each '.' with the 'arg' string, which could be multiple characters. The replace method does exactly that. So the code is correct.

I think that's all. So the generated code is just using the built-in string replace method. No edge cases mentioned, so assuming that 'value' is a string and 'arg' is a string. The function returns the modified string. So the code should be as simple as possible.
