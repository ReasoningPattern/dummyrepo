Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _validate_labels based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it checks that keys and values in the given labels using validate_key() and validate_value(). But wait, the problem is that the user hasn't provided the definitions for validate_key and validate_value. Hmm, maybe those are helper functions that are supposed to validate the keys and values of the labels dictionary.

So the function _validate_labels takes a labels parameter, which I assume is a dictionary. The task is to iterate through each key-value pair and apply validate_key to the key and validate_value to the value. If any of them fail, the function should probably raise an exception. But the user didn't specify what exactly to do on validation failure. Maybe they expect that the helper functions will raise exceptions if validation fails, and _validate_labels just needs to call them and propagate any errors?

Let me structure the code. First, the function will check if labels is a dictionary. If not, maybe raise a TypeError. Then, for each key in the labels dictionary, call validate_key(key). Similarly, for each value, call validate_value(value). But wait, the docstring mentions checking keys and values, but it's not clear if the labels are a dictionary or something else. The function name suggests it's for labels, which in some contexts (like Kubernetes) are dictionaries. So I'll proceed under the assumption that labels is a dictionary.

So the code would start by checking if the input is a dictionary. Then loop through each key and value. But how to handle the validation? Let's say validate_key and validate_value are functions that perform some checks. For example, validate_key might check that the key is a string, and validate_value might check that the value is a boolean or something else. But since those functions aren't provided, the code will have to call them and possibly raise exceptions if they return False or if there's an error.

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe the actual implementation is to call those two functions for each key and value. But how? Let me think. The function _validate_labels needs to validate all keys and values. So perhaps for each key in labels, we call validate_key(key), and for each value, we call validate_value(value). If any of these calls raise an exception, then the function should propagate it. Otherwise, it's okay.

But the user hasn't provided the definitions for validate_key and validate_value. So maybe the code should just call those functions and not do anything else. However, the function needs to handle the validation process. Let me write code that loops through each key and value in the labels dictionary and applies the validation functions. Also, maybe the labels could be None, so we need to check that first.

So here's the plan:

1. Check if labels is None. If so, maybe return early or raise an error? The docstring doesn't specify, but perhaps it's allowed. Or maybe the function expects labels to be a dictionary. Let me check the docstring again. It says "Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value()." So the labels are expected to be a dictionary. So maybe first check if it's a dict. If not, raise a TypeError.

2. Iterate over each key in labels and call validate_key on it. Similarly for each value.

But how to handle the validation? Let me assume that validate_key and validate_value are functions that take a single argument and return True if valid, False otherwise. Or maybe they raise exceptions when invalid. The docstring doesn't specify, but since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps the code should just call them and let any exceptions propagate. Alternatively, maybe the functions return a boolean, and _validate_labels should check each one.

But without knowing the exact behavior of validate_key and validate_value, it's hard to say. However, the user's instruction is to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says "Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value()." So the function is supposed to perform the validation. Therefore, the code should probably call those functions for each key and value.

So the code would be something like:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    """
    Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
    """
    if not isinstance(labels, dict):
        raise TypeError("Labels must be a dictionary")
    for key in labels:
        validate_key(key)
    for value in labels.values():
        validate_value(value)

But wait, the user might have intended that the labels are a dictionary where each key is validated and each value is validated. However, the original code might have had some other structure. Alternatively, maybe the labels are a list of key-value pairs, but that's less likely given the function name.

Alternatively, perhaps the labels are a dictionary, and the function is supposed to check that all keys and values are valid. So the code would loop through each key and value, applying the respective validation functions.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual validation logic, the code can't include that. So the generated code would just call validate_key and validate_value on each key and value respectively. However, the user might expect that the function returns something or raises an error if any validation fails. But without knowing the exact validation rules, the code can't do that. So perhaps the function is supposed to call those validators and raise exceptions if any of them fail.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code should be as per the docstring's description. The docstring says "Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value()." So the function is supposed to perform that check. Therefore, the code would need to iterate over the keys and values and apply the validation functions.

But how to handle the validation? Let me think. Maybe the validate_key and validate_value functions are part of the same module, so we can import them. But the user hasn't mentioned that. Alternatively, maybe they are defined elsewhere. Since the user hasn't provided them, the code can't include their definitions. Therefore, the code for _validate_labels would just call them.

But the user might be expecting that the function is supposed to validate each key and value. So the code would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    """
    Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
    """
    if not isinstance(labels, dict):
        raise TypeError("Labels must be a dictionary")
    for key in labels:
        validate_key(key)
    for value in labels.values():
        validate_value(value)

But the user might have intended that the labels are a list of key-value pairs. Wait, the function name is _validate_labels, which suggests it's for validating a dictionary of labels. For example, in Kubernetes, labels are key-value pairs in a dictionary.

So the code above seems reasonable. However, the user might have wanted to check that the labels are a dictionary and that each key and value passes their respective validators. So the code would first check if labels is a dict, then iterate through each key and value.

But the user hasn't provided the validate_key and validate_value functions. So the code can't include their logic. Therefore, the generated code would just call those functions. However, the user might have intended that the function is part of a class, but the given signature is a standalone function.

Another possibility: maybe the labels are a list of tuples, each being a key-value pair. But the function name suggests it's for a dictionary. So I'll stick with the dictionary assumption.

So the code would be as follows. Also, need to make sure that the function is properly structured. The user said to output only the code, no explanations. So the code should be written with the function definition, the docstring, and the implementation.

But the user's original code has the function signature and the docstring, but the code is empty. So I need to fill in the code.

Another thing to consider: maybe the labels are a dictionary, and the function is supposed to validate that each key and value meets certain criteria. But since the actual validation is done by validate_key and validate_value, the code just needs to call those functions for each key and value.

So the code would be:

def _validate_labels(labels):
    """
    Check that keys and values in the given labels by validate_key() and validate_value().
    """
    if not isinstance(labels, dict):
        raise TypeError("Labels must be a dictionary")
    for key in labels:
        validate_key(key)
    for value in labels.values():
        validate_value(value)

But maybe the user wants to check that the labels are not empty? Or perhaps there are other checks. However, the docstring doesn't mention that, so I shouldn't assume.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the labels are a dictionary and that each key and value is valid. So the code would check the type and then validate each key and value.

But since the user hasn't provided the actual validation functions, the code can't include their logic. Therefore, the code would just call them.

So the final code would be as above. But the user might have wanted to include error handling. For example, if validate_key or validate_value raises an exception, the function should propagate it. So the code would not have try-except blocks unless specified, which it isn't.

Therefore, the generated code is as written.
