Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function is_fill_request_el(obj) based on the given docstring. The docstring says to check if the obj class has the 'fill' and 'request' attributes. Wait, the function is named is_fill_request_el, which might be a typo. Oh, maybe it's supposed to check if the object has both 'fill' and 'request' attributes. Let me think.

So the function should return True if the object has both attributes, else False. But how to check that? In Python, I can use the hasattr() function. So for the given obj, check if hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request'). That seems straightforward.

Wait, but the docstring mentions "obj class". Does that mean checking the class of the object, not the instance? Hmm, maybe the user meant the class of the object. So, perhaps the function is supposed to check if the class (not the instance) has those attributes. But the function is called with an object, so maybe they want to check the instance. Let me re-read the docstring.

The docstring says "Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes." Oh, right, so it's the class of the object, not the instance. So, for example, if obj is an instance of a class, we need to check if that class has the attributes 'fill' and 'request'.

But how to get the class of the object? Well, in Python, obj.__class__ gives the class. So, the function should check if both 'fill' and 'request' are present in the class's attributes.

Wait, but attributes can be inherited. Should the function check for the presence in the class itself, not including parents? Or should it check the entire inheritance chain? The docstring isn't clear on that. But maybe the user just wants to check if the class has those attributes directly, not via inheritance. Or maybe they want to check if the instance has them. Let me think.

The function name is is_fill_request_el, which might be a typo for is_fill_request_element or something else. But regardless, the docstring says to check the obj class. So, perhaps the correct approach is to check if the class (not the instance) has those attributes. But how to do that?

Wait, in Python, when you check hasattr(obj, 'attribute'), it checks the instance's attributes, including those inherited from the class. So if the class has the attribute, the instance will have it too. But if the docstring is asking to check the class itself, not the instance, then we need to check the class's attributes directly.

But maybe the user actually wants to check if the instance has those attributes. Because sometimes people refer to an object's attributes as the class's attributes. But the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me look at the function name again. The function is called is_fill_request_el, which might be a method that checks if the object is of a certain type that has those attributes. But the docstring says "obj class has the fill and request attributes".

Hmm. Let's assume that the user wants to check if the class (not the instance) has those attributes. So, for example, if the object is an instance of a class that has 'fill' and 'request' as attributes, then return True. But how to check that?

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to the class of the object. For example, if the object is an instance of a class, check if that class has the attributes. So, the code would be something like:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'request')

But maybe the user meant the instance. Let me think again. The function's name is is_fill_request_el, which could be a method that checks if the object has those attributes. For example, if the object is a class that has fill and request methods or variables. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the object is an instance of a class that has those attributes. But the wording is confusing. Let me try to think of possible scenarios.

If the function is supposed to check if the instance has the attributes, then the code would be:

return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request')

But the docstring says "obj class has the fill and request attributes", which suggests checking the class, not the instance. So perhaps the correct approach is to check the class.

But maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring and actually wants to check the instance. Without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given the function name and the docstring, I'll proceed with checking the class.

So, the code would be:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'request')

But wait, what if the object is None? Then obj.__class__ would be NoneType. But the function's parameters don't specify any constraints, so perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to check if the object has both attributes, regardless of whether they are on the class or instance. But the docstring specifically says "obj class has the fill and request attributes", so I think checking the class is correct.

Another possibility: maybe the function is supposed to check if the object is a class that has those attributes. But that would be different. For example, if obj is a class, not an instance. But the function is called with obj, which is probably an instance.

Hmm. Well, given the ambiguity, but based on the docstring, I'll go with checking the class of the object. So the code would be as above.

Wait, but maybe the user wants to check if the object has both attributes, meaning that the instance has them. Because sometimes people refer to an object's attributes as the instance's attributes. Let me think again.

The function's name is is_fill_request_el, which might be a method that checks if the object is of a type that has those attributes. For example, if the object is an instance of a class that has fill and request methods or properties.

But the docstring says "obj class has the fill and request attributes", so the correct approach is to check the class. So the code would check if the class of the object has those attributes.

So, the code would be:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'request')

But maybe the user intended to check the instance. Let me check the function name again. Maybe it's a typo and they meant 'has' instead of 'has the'. But regardless, the code should be written according to the docstring.

So, the final code is as above. Let me make sure that the function returns a boolean. Yes, because hasattr returns True or False. So combining two hasattrs with 'and' would return True only if both are present.

I think that's the correct approach. So the code is:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    """
    Check whether the obj class has the fill and request attributes.
    """
    return hasattr(obj.__class__, 'fill') and hasattr(obj.__class__, 'request')

But maybe the user wants to check if the object has those attributes, not the class. Let me think. If the function is called on an instance, and the docstring says "obj class has...", then checking the class is correct. But if the user intended to check the instance, then it's the other way. However, given the wording, I think checking the class is the right approach.

So, the code is as written.
