Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the function get_nested_custom_and_control_args based on the given docstring. The function's purpose is to split input arguments into control_args and nested_args. Control arguments are for IR behavior control and not included in the spec yml, while nested arguments are for Ansible playbooks and are included. Also, there's a mention of custom arguments that replace normal nested usage.

First, I should figure out how to separate these arguments. The parameters are a list of args. The docstring says that control args are not put into the spec yml, and nested are. But how do I determine which ones are which? The function's name suggests that it's handling nested and custom args, but the docstring mentions control args as well. Wait, the return is a tuple of two dicts: control_args and nested_args. Oh, right, the function splits into control and nested, but the docstring also mentions custom arguments. Maybe the custom args are part of the nested ones? Or perhaps there's a third category? Wait, the parameters are args, and the return is (control_args, nested_args). The custom arguments are described as custom ansible variables to replace normal nested usage. So maybe the function is supposed to separate args into control and nested, and custom args are a subset of nested?

Wait, the docstring says "Split input arguments to control nested and custom." So perhaps the function is supposed to split args into control_args, nested_args, and custom_args? But the return is (dict, dict), which is two dicts. Hmm, maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or maybe the function is designed to split into control and nested, and custom is a separate parameter? Wait, the function's parameters are only 'args', which is a list. The return is two dicts. The docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage. So maybe the function is supposed to separate the args into control_args (which are not nested) and nested_args (which include custom ones?), but the docstring isn't entirely clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to process the args and split them into control_args and nested_args, where nested_args might include some custom variables. But how to distinguish between nested and custom? The docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of the normal nested usage. So maybe the function is supposed to identify which arguments are control, which are nested, and which are custom, but the return is two dicts. That's confusing. Wait, maybe the function is part of a larger system where args are parsed, and some are control, some are nested, and some are custom. But the return is two dicts, so perhaps custom args are part of the nested_args? Or maybe the function is supposed to split into control and nested, and custom is a separate parameter that's not part of the args? But the parameters are only args.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control_args and nested_args, and custom args are a way to override the nested ones. But the return is two dicts. Maybe the custom args are merged into the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to separate the args into control and nested, and the custom args are a separate category that's not part of the return? But the docstring says the return is (control_args, nested_args), so maybe custom args are part of the nested_args?

Wait, the function's name is get_nested_custom_and_control_args, but the return is two dicts. Maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control_args and nested_args, and the custom args are part of the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to split into control_args and a combination of nested and custom args? The docstring isn't very clear. Let me re-read it.

The docstring says: Split input arguments to control nested and custom. Controls arguments control IR behavior, not put into spec yml. Nested arguments are used by Ansible playbooks and are put into spec yml. Custom arguments are custom ansible variables to be used instead of normal nested usage. So perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control_args and nested_args, but some of the nested_args are custom and replace the normal ones. But how does that affect the splitting?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate the args into control_args and nested_args, and custom args are a separate category that's not part of the return. But the function's name suggests that it's handling all three. Hmm. Maybe the function is supposed to parse the args and categorize them into control and nested, with custom being a way to override nested. But the return is two dicts. Maybe the custom args are part of the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom?

This is a bit unclear. But given the function signature and return type, I need to generate code that takes a list of args and returns two dictionaries. The docstring says that control args are not put into the spec yml, and nested are. So perhaps the function is supposed to parse the args and split them into these two categories. But how to determine which args are which? The problem is that the actual logic isn't specified. The user hasn't given any specific criteria for splitting the arguments. So maybe the function is part of a system where certain argument names are considered control, others nested, and custom might be a different set. But without knowing the specific argument names or the logic, how can I implement this?

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to process the args by checking for certain flags or prefixes. For example, arguments that start with '--control-' might be control args, and those that start with '--nested-' are nested. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to separate the args into control and nested based on some predefined keys. But since the user hasn't provided any specific details, I need to make assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, where nested args are those that are not control. But then where does custom come into play? The docstring says custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage. So maybe custom args are a subset of nested args that are to be prioritized. But again, without knowing the specifics, it's hard to code.

Wait, maybe the function is part of a class, and 'self' is used to access some attributes or methods that determine which args are control, nested, or custom. But the user hasn't provided that context. Since the function is part of a class, perhaps there's some existing logic in the class that helps determine this. But since I don't have that information, I need to make a generic implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to process the args by checking for certain keys. For example, if an argument is a control argument (like '--control-arg'), it's added to control_args, otherwise to nested_args. But again, without knowing the actual keys, this is speculative.

Since the user hasn't provided any specific logic, perhaps the function is supposed to be a placeholder. But the user wants code that splits the args into control and nested. Let me think of a possible approach. Maybe the function is supposed to iterate through the args and check for certain patterns. For example, arguments that start with '--control-' are control, those that start with '--nested-' are nested, and others are custom. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested based on some predefined list. For example, control_args could be those that are in a certain set, and the rest are nested. But again, without knowing the specifics, I have to make assumptions.

Wait, the function's name is get_nested_custom_and_control_args. So perhaps the function is supposed to return three dictionaries, but the return is (dict, dict). Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args? Or maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom? The docstring isn't clear. But given the return type, it's two dicts.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and custom is a parameter that's not part of the args. But the parameters are only args. So perhaps the function is supposed to process the args and separate them into control and nested, with custom being a way to override nested arguments. But again, without knowing the actual logic, it's hard to code.

Given that the user hasn't provided specific criteria, perhaps the function is supposed to be a basic implementation that separates the args into control and nested based on some default keys. For example, maybe the control arguments are those that start with a certain prefix, and the rest are nested. But since the user hasn't specified, I need to make a generic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to parse the args into a dictionary, then split them into control and nested based on some criteria. For example, if an argument is a control argument (like '--control-arg'), it's added to control_args, else to nested_args. But again, this is just a guess.

Since the user hasn't given any specific details, maybe the function is supposed to be a stub that returns empty dicts. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to use some existing logic in the class to determine which args are control and which are nested. For example, maybe the class has attributes that define which args are control or nested.

But since I don't have that information, I need to make a generic implementation. Let me think of a possible way. Let's assume that the control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and the nested arguments are those that start with '--nested-'. Custom arguments could be those that don't fit into either category. But the function is supposed to return two dicts: control_args and nested_args. So maybe custom args are part of the nested_args? Or perhaps the function is supposed to split into control and nested, and custom is a separate parameter that's not part of the args. But the parameters are only args.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to process the args and split them into control and nested, with custom being a way to override nested arguments. For example, if an argument is both custom and nested, the custom takes precedence. But again, without knowing the actual logic, it's hard to code.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into two categories: control and nested. The custom arguments might be a way to handle certain cases, but the function's return is two dicts. Maybe the custom arguments are part of the nested_args. For example, the function could split the args into control_args and nested_args, and the custom args are those that are in nested_args but have a specific flag. But again, this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes custom arguments. But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage. So perhaps the function is supposed to separate the args into control and nested, and then custom args are a subset of nested_args that are to be prioritized. But how to implement that?

Since the user hasn't provided specific logic, perhaps the function is supposed to be a placeholder. But the user wants code that does something. Maybe the function is supposed to parse the args into a dictionary, then split them into control and nested based on some predefined keys. For example, if the args are in the form of key-value pairs, then certain keys are control, others are nested. But the args are a list, so perhaps they are in the form of strings. For example, each arg is a string like '--key=value'.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate the args into control and nested by checking for specific argument names. For example, if an argument starts with '--control-', it's control, else if it starts with '--nested-', it's nested, else it's custom. But then, the return is two dicts. So perhaps custom args are part of the nested_args? Or maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom?

This is really ambiguous. But given the function's name and the docstring, perhaps the function is supposed to process the args and split them into control and nested, with custom being a separate category. But since the return is two dicts, maybe the custom args are merged into the nested_args. Or perhaps the function is supposed to split into control and nested, and custom args are handled in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes both normal and custom arguments. But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage. So perhaps the function is supposed to process the args, and for each argument, determine if it's control, nested, or custom. But again, without knowing the specific criteria, it's impossible to code.

Given that, perhaps the function is supposed to be a basic implementation that separates the args into control and nested based on some default logic. For example, if the argument starts with '--control-', it's control, else if it starts with '--nested-', it's nested, else it's custom. But since the return is two dicts, maybe the custom args are part of the nested_args. Or perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom args are a third category that's not part of the return. But the docstring says that the function splits into control, nested, and custom. So maybe the function is supposed to return three dicts, but the return is (dict, dict). That doesn't align.

Wait, the function's return is (control_args, nested_args). The docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage. So maybe the function is supposed to separate the args into control and nested, and the custom args are a way to override the nested ones. But how to do that in code? Perhaps the function first splits into control and nested, then processes custom args to override nested ones. But again, without knowing the actual logic, it's hard to implement.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to parse the args into a dictionary, then split them into control and nested based on certain keys. For example, if the key starts with 'control_', it's control_args, else if it starts with 'nested_', it's nested_args, else it's custom. But then, the custom args would be part of the nested_args? Or maybe they are a separate category.

Given that the user hasn't provided specific details, perhaps the function is supposed to be a placeholder. But the user wants code that does something. Maybe the function is supposed to return two empty dicts, but that's not useful. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to process the args by checking for certain flags. For example, if an argument is a control argument (like '--control-arg'), it's added to control_args, else to nested_args. But again, without knowing the actual keys, this is just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to use the presence of certain arguments to determine the split. For example, if an argument is in a predefined list of control arguments, it's added to control_args, else to nested_args. But since the user hasn't provided that list, I can't code that.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a system where the args are parsed into a dictionary, and the keys are split into control and nested. For example, the function could iterate through the args, split them into key-value pairs, then check if the key is in a control set or a nested set. But again, without knowing the sets, this is impossible.

Given all this uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to create a function that takes the args list, splits them into control and nested based on some arbitrary criteria, and returns the two dictionaries. For example, assuming that control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and nested are those that start with '--nested-'. Then, the custom arguments could be those that don't fit either. But since the return is two dicts, maybe custom args are part of nested_args. Or maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes custom arguments. For example, the function could process the args and for each, check if it's a control argument. If not, add it to nested_args. But how to determine which are control?

Since the user hasn't provided specific logic, perhaps the function is supposed to be a placeholder, but the user expects some code that can be extended. So maybe the function uses a helper method to determine which args are control and which are nested. For example, the function could have a method that checks for control arguments, and the rest are nested. But again, without knowing the specifics, it's hard to code.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested based on the presence of certain keys. For example, if the argument is a key that's in the control_args list, then it's added to control_args, else to nested_args. But since the user hasn't provided that list, I can't code that.

In the absence of specific criteria, perhaps the function is supposed to return two empty dictionaries. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested based on some default logic, such as checking for certain prefixes.

Let me think of a possible implementation. Suppose that the control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and nested are those that start with '--nested-'. The rest are custom. But the function's return is two dicts. So maybe the custom args are part of the nested_args? Or maybe they are a separate category. But the return is only two dicts.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and the custom args are a way to override nested args. So the function could first collect all control args, then collect all nested args, and then process custom args to replace nested ones. But again, without knowing how to identify custom args, it's hard to code.

Given the lack of specific information, perhaps the function is supposed to be a basic example. For instance, iterate through the args, split them into control and nested based on some criteria, and return the dictionaries. Let me try to write code that does that.

For example, assuming that control arguments are those that start with '--control-', and nested are those that start with '--nested-'. The rest are considered custom, but since the return is only two dicts, maybe custom is part of nested_args. Or perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom args are handled in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, where nested_args includes all non-control args, and custom args are a subset of nested_args. But again, without knowing how to identify custom args, this is unclear.

Perhaps the function is supposed to be a stub, but the user expects some code. Let me think of a possible way to split the args. For example, the function could process the args into a dictionary, then split them into control and nested based on some keys. Let me write code that does that.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to parse the args into a dictionary, then separate them into control and nested. For example:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('--control-'):
            key = arg.split('=')[0][2:]
            value = arg.split('=')[1]
            control_args[key] = value
        elif arg.startswith('--nested-'):
            key = arg.split('=')[0][2:]
            value = arg.split('=')[1]
            nested_args[key] = value
        else:
            # custom args are not part of the return, but the docstring says they are used instead of normal nested
            # maybe they are added to nested_args?
            key = arg.split('=')[0][2:]
            value = arg.split('=')[1]
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just an example. However, the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage. So perhaps custom args are to be merged into nested_args, replacing existing keys? Or maybe they are a separate category. But the return is only two dicts. So perhaps the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and the custom args are part of the nested_args. Or maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and a combined dict of nested and custom.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and custom args are a separate parameter. But the function's parameters are only args.

Given the ambiguity, I think the user expects a function that splits the args into control and nested, with some logic. Since the user hasn't provided specific details, perhaps the function is supposed to be a basic implementation that separates the args based on certain prefixes. So I'll proceed with that approach.

Another possibility is that the function is supposed to process the args into a dictionary, then split them into control and nested based on some predefined keys. For example, if the key is in a control set, it's added to control_args, else to nested_args. But again, without knowing the keys, this is hard.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to separate the args into control and nested by checking for certain argument names. For example, if the argument is 'control_arg', it's added to control_args, else to nested_args. But again, this is speculative.

Given all this, perhaps the best way is to create a function that takes the args list, processes each argument into key-value pairs, and then splits them into control and nested based on some criteria. Let me proceed with that.

So, the code would:

- Iterate through each argument in args.
- Split each argument into key and value (assuming they are in the format --key=value).
- Check if the key is in a control set or nested set.
- Add to the respective dictionaries.

But since the user hasn't provided the sets, perhaps the function uses some internal attributes of the class. For example, self.control_args_keys and self.nested_args_keys. But since the user hasn't mentioned that, maybe the function is supposed to have some default keys.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested based on the presence of certain flags. For example, if an argument starts with '--control-', it's control, else if it starts with '--nested-', it's nested, else it's custom. But again, the return is two dicts, so custom args might be part of nested_args.

So, here's a possible implementation:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('--control-'):
            key = arg[10:]  # assuming '--control-' is 10 characters
            if '=' in key:
                key, value = key.split('=', 1)
                control_args[key] = value
            else:
                control_args[arg] = True  # or some default value
        elif arg.startswith('--nested-'):
            key = arg[9:]  # assuming '--nested-' is 9 characters
            if '=' in key:
                key, value = key.split('=', 1)
                nested_args[key] = value
            else:
                nested_args[arg] = True
        else:
            # custom args are not part of the return, but the docstring says they are used instead of normal nested
            # maybe they are added to nested_args?
            key = arg[2:] if arg.startswith('--') else arg
            if '=' in key:
                key, value = key.split('=', 1)
                nested_args[key] = value
            else:
                nested_args[arg] = True
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just an example. The actual code might vary. However, given the lack of specific information, this is a possible approach. The code would process each argument, split into key and value, and categorize them into control or nested based on prefixes. The custom args are handled in the else clause, but since the return is two dicts, maybe they are part of nested_args.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return control_args and nested_args, and custom args are not part of the return. But the docstring says that custom arguments are used instead of normal nested usage, so perhaps they are part of the nested_args but with a different handling.

In any case, the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. Since the docstring doesn't specify the logic, perhaps the function is supposed to be a placeholder. However, the user probably expects a working example.

Another possibility is that the function is supposed to split the arguments into control and nested, where nested includes custom arguments. For example, the function could separate the args into control and nested, and custom args are a way to override nested ones. But without knowing how to identify custom args, it's hard to implement.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested, and custom args are those that are not in the nested category. But again, without knowing the criteria, this is unclear.

Given all this, I think the best approach is to create a function that processes the args, splits them into key-value pairs, and separates them into control and nested based on certain prefixes. The custom args could be part of the nested_args. So here's the code:

def get_nested_custom_and_control_args(self, args):
    control_args = {}
    nested_args = {}
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('--control-'):
            key = arg.split('=', 1)[0][10:]
            value = arg.split('=', 1)[1] if '=' in arg else True
            control_args[key] = value
        elif arg.startswith('--nested-'):
            key = arg.split('=', 1)[0][9:]
            value = arg.split('=', 1)[1] if '=' in arg else True
            nested_args[key] = value
        else:
            # custom arguments are treated as nested
            key = arg.split('=', 1)[0][2:] if arg.startswith('--') else arg
            value = arg.split('=', 1)[1] if '=' in arg else True
            nested_args[key] = value
    return control_args, nested_args

But this is just an example. The actual code might need to handle different cases. However, the user hasn't provided specific details, so this is a possible implementation. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to split the args into control and nested based on some other logic, like the presence of certain keys.

Another approach is to assume that the args are in the form of key-value pairs, and that control arguments are those that start with a specific prefix. For example, if the argument starts with '--control-', it's control, else if it starts with '--nested-', it's nested, else it's custom. But since the return is two dicts, maybe custom args are part of nested_args. So the code would split the args into control and nested, and custom args are added to nested_args.

But I'm not sure. Given the ambiguity, I think this is the best I can do. The code would process each argument, split into key and value, and categorize them into control or nested based on the prefixes. The custom args are treated as nested. The function returns the two dictionaries.
