Okay, I need to generate Python code for the _convert_non_cli_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it casts arguments to correct types by modifying the values_dict. So the function's purpose is to take a dictionary of arguments and convert their values to the appropriate data types. The default is that all values are strings, so I need to handle different types based on the parser_name.

First, I should consider possible scenarios. The parser_name could be something like 'main', 'virsh', 'ospd', etc. Maybe each parser has different arguments that need conversion. For example, 'virsh' might have arguments that are integers or booleans, while 'ospd' might have different ones.

But the problem is, without knowing the specific arguments each parser uses, how can I handle the conversion? The function needs to be generic enough to handle different parsers. Wait, maybe the function is part of a class that has some knowledge of the parsers and their expected argument types. So the method would check the parser_name and then apply the necessary conversions to the values_dict.

Let me think of possible conversions. For instance, if the parser is 'virsh', maybe some arguments like 'port' should be integers, 'enable' should be booleans, etc. Similarly, 'ospd' might have arguments that require different types. But since the user hasn't specified, I need to make some assumptions or perhaps create a generic approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses a predefined mapping of parser names to their argument conversion rules. So the code could have a dictionary that maps each parser to a list of argument names that need conversion, along with their target types. Then, for each argument in values_dict, if it's in the mapping, convert it accordingly.

But how to structure this? Let's outline the steps:

1. Check the parser_name to determine which conversion rules to apply.
2. For each argument in values_dict, apply the conversion if needed.
3. Modify the values_dict in place or return a new one? The docstring says it modifies the values_dict param, so probably in place.

Wait, the function is part of a class, so maybe the class has some attributes or methods that define the conversion rules based on the parser_name. But since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the function is supposed to handle some common cases.

Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to handle specific parsers, and the user expects a placeholder or example code. Since the user hasn't given specifics, I need to make a general approach.

Let me think of possible conversions. For example, if the parser is 'virsh', maybe arguments like 'port' should be integers, 'timeout' as integers, 'enable' as booleans. For 'ospd', maybe 'count' is integer, 'verbose' is boolean.

So the code could have a series of if-elif conditions based on parser_name, and for each, convert the relevant arguments. But since the exact arguments aren't specified, perhaps the code should be a template that can be extended.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check for certain keys in values_dict and convert them. For example, if the parser is 'main', convert 'port' to int, 'debug' to bool, etc.

But without knowing the specific arguments, I need to create a generic method. Maybe the function is part of a larger system where each parser has its own set of arguments, and this method is responsible for converting them.

Wait, the user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So maybe they expect a method that handles some common conversions, or perhaps uses a predefined set of rules.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle arguments that are not CLI arguments, but perhaps from another source. But the name suggests it's converting non-CLI arguments, which might be parsed from a config file or something else.

Let me think of an example. Suppose for 'virsh' parser, the arguments 'port' and 'timeout' need to be integers, and 'debug' needs to be a boolean. For 'ospd', maybe 'count' is integer and 'verbose' is boolean.

So the code could have a series of if-elif blocks for each parser, and within each, check for specific keys and convert them.

But since the user hasn't provided specific conversion rules, perhaps the code should be a skeleton that can be expanded. However, the user wants the code generated, so maybe I should assume some common conversions.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert arguments based on some predefined schema. But again, without knowing, it's hard to say.

Wait, the function is part of a class. Maybe the class has a way to determine the conversion rules based on the parser_name. For example, a dictionary in the class that maps parser names to their argument conversion rules.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should have a default set of conversions. Let me try to write code that handles some common cases.

For example, the code could check the parser_name and then apply conversions. Let me outline the code structure.

First, the function is part of a class, so 'self' is available. Maybe the class has a method or attribute that defines the conversion rules. But again, without that info, perhaps the code should have a basic implementation.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert arguments that are known in advance. For instance, if the parser is 'virsh', then certain arguments are expected to be integers or booleans.

Let me think of a possible implementation. The function could have a series of if statements for each parser, and for each, convert the relevant keys.

For example:

if parser_name == 'virsh':
    if 'port' in values_dict:
        values_dict['port'] = int(values_dict['port'])
    if 'timeout' in values_dict:
        values_dict['timeout'] = int(values_dict['timeout'])
    if 'debug' in values_dict:
        values_dict['debug'] = bool(values_dict['debug'])
elif parser_name == 'ospd':
    if 'count' in values_dict:
        values_dict['count'] = int(values_dict['count'])
    if 'verbose' in values_dict:
        values_dict['verbose'] = bool(values_dict['verbose'])

But since the user hasn't specified which arguments to convert, this might not be accurate. However, given the lack of information, this is a possible approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to handle all possible conversions, but that's not feasible. So perhaps the code should be a placeholder with some example conversions.

Another possibility is that the function uses a predefined list of conversion rules based on the parser_name. For example, a dictionary that maps parser names to a list of (key, type) pairs.

So the code could look like:

conversion_rules = {
    'virsh': [('port', int), ('timeout', int), ('debug', bool)],
    'ospd': [('count', int), ('verbose', bool)],
}

for key, typ in conversion_rules.get(parser_name, []):
    if key in values_dict:
        try:
            values_dict[key] = typ(values_dict[key])
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            # handle error, maybe log or raise?
            pass

But again, without knowing the actual rules, this is speculative. However, the user probably expects some code that demonstrates the conversion logic, even if it's a placeholder.

So putting it all together, the function would check the parser_name, then iterate over the conversion rules for that parser, and convert the values accordingly.

But since the user hasn't provided specific rules, perhaps the code should have a basic structure that can be extended. Let me write that.

Also, the function is supposed to modify the values_dict in place. So the code should directly change the values in the dictionary.

So the code might look like:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    if parser_name == 'virsh':
        if 'port' in values_dict:
            values_dict['port'] = int(values_dict['port'])
        if 'timeout' in values_dict:
            values_dict['timeout'] = int(values_dict['timeout'])
        if 'debug' in values_dict:
            values_dict['debug'] = bool(values_dict['debug'])
    elif parser_name == 'ospd':
        if 'count' in values_dict:
            values_dict['count'] = int(values_dict['count'])
        if 'verbose' in values_dict:
            values_dict['verbose'] = bool(values_dict['verbose'])
    # Add more parser-specific conversions as needed

But again, this is just an example. Since the user hasn't specified the exact conversions, this is a possible approach. However, maybe the function is supposed to handle all possible conversions, but that's not practical.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger system where the conversion rules are defined elsewhere, like in a configuration or a data structure. But without that info, I can't know.

Another approach: perhaps the function is supposed to convert arguments that are known to be of certain types, regardless of the parser. For example, if the argument is 'port', convert to int; if 'debug', convert to bool, etc. But again, without knowing the specific arguments, this is a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check for certain keys and convert them based on some common logic. For example, if the key is 'port', convert to int; if 'timeout', convert to int; if 'enable', convert to bool.

But since the user hasn't provided specifics, I need to make an example. Let me proceed with that.

So the code would have a series of if-elif conditions for different parser names, and within each, convert specific keys. Let me write that.

Also, the function should handle possible exceptions, but maybe the user expects it to just try converting and not handle errors. Or perhaps it's assumed that the values are valid.

In any case, the code would need to be in Python, and the function is part of a class. So the code would be:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    if parser_name == 'virsh':
        if 'port' in values_dict:
            values_dict['port'] = int(values_dict['port'])
        if 'timeout' in values_dict:
            values_dict['timeout'] = int(values_dict['timeout'])
        if 'debug' in values_dict:
            values_dict['debug'] = bool(values_dict['debug'])
    elif parser_name == 'ospd':
        if 'count' in values_dict:
            values_dict['count'] = int(values_dict['count'])
        if 'verbose' in values_dict:
            values_dict['verbose'] = bool(values_dict['verbose'])
    # Add more parser-specific conversions as needed

But maybe the user expects a more general approach. For example, using a dictionary to map parser names to their conversion rules. Let me try that.

So:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    conversion_rules = {
        'virsh': {
            'port': int,
            'timeout': int,
            'debug': bool,
        },
        'ospd': {
            'count': int,
            'verbose': bool,
        },
    }
    for key, typ in conversion_rules.get(parser_name, {}).items():
        if key in values_dict:
            values_dict[key] = typ(values_dict[key])

But this is assuming that the conversion rules are defined in the method. However, maybe the conversion rules are stored in the class, so the method could access them via self.

Alternatively, the code could be:

def _convert_non_cli_args(self, parser_name, values_dict):
    """
    Casts arguments to correct types by modifying values_dict param.

    By default all the values are strings.

    :param parser_name: The command name, e.g. main, virsh, ospd, etc
    :param values_dict: The dict of with arguments
    """
    if parser_name == 'virsh':
        for key in ['port', 'timeout', 'debug']:
            if key in values_dict:
                values_dict[key] = int(values_dict[key]) if key in ['port', 'timeout'] else bool(values_dict[key])
    elif parser_name == 'ospd':
        for key in ['count', 'verbose']:
            if key in values_dict:
                values_dict[key] = int(values_dict[key]) if key == 'count' else bool(values_dict[key])

But again, this is just an example. Since the user hasn't provided specific details, I need to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to convert all arguments that are known to be of certain types, but without knowing which ones, it's hard to code.

Given that, perhaps the best approach is to write a method that has some example conversions for different parsers, as a template. That way, the user can expand it as needed.

So the code would have if-elif blocks for different parser names, and within each, convert specific keys. Let me proceed with that.
