Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_from_file method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do.

The function is part of a class, as indicated by the 'cls' parameter. It's supposed to load a YAML file and validate that all required fields are present. If mandatory data is missing, it should raise an IRValidatorException. The return value is a dictionary with the loaded data.

First, I should handle the YAML file loading. In Python, the PyYAML library is commonly used for this. So I'll need to import yaml. But wait, the user might not have it installed. However, the problem says to generate code, so I'll assume it's available.

The function takes an optional yaml_file parameter. If it's not provided, maybe the method expects a default file path? But the docstring doesn't specify that, so perhaps it's up to the implementation. But since the parameter is optional, I should check if it's None and maybe handle that case, maybe by using a default file path or raising an error. Wait, the docstring says "param yaml_file: Path to YAML file", but it's optional. So maybe if it's None, the method uses a default? Or perhaps it's expected that the user provides it. The docstring doesn't mention a default, so perhaps the function expects the user to pass the file path. But the parameter is optional, so maybe it's better to have a default, like 'default.yaml'? Or maybe the method is part of a class that has a default file. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so I'll proceed with the given parameters.

So, the first step is to load the YAML file. Using yaml.safe_load might be safer to prevent arbitrary code execution. Then, check if all required fields are present. But wait, the required fields aren't specified in the docstring. Oh, right, the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file has all required fields. But which ones? The docstring doesn't mention them. Maybe the class has a predefined set of required fields? Since the function is a class method, perhaps the required fields are defined within the class. But how to access them?

Wait, the function is called validate_from_file, and it's a class method. So maybe the class has a class attribute that lists the required fields. For example, maybe the class has a 'required_fields' list. So the method would check if all those fields exist in the loaded data.

But since the user hasn't provided that information, I need to make an assumption. Let me think. The function is part of a class, perhaps called IRValidator or something similar. The method would load the YAML file, then check for the presence of required fields. If any are missing, raise IRValidatorException.

So the code structure would be:

Import yaml.

Check if yaml_file is None. If so, maybe raise an error or use a default. But the docstring doesn't mention a default, so perhaps the function expects the user to provide it. However, the parameter is optional, so maybe it's better to have a default. Wait, the user might have intended that the function can be called with or without the file path. But without knowing the default, perhaps the function should raise an error if yaml_file is not provided. Or maybe the class has a default file path. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code should check if yaml_file is None and handle it accordingly. But the docstring says "param yaml_file: Path to YAML file" which implies it's optional, but maybe the function requires it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate the YAML structure against some schema, but again, without knowing the schema, it's hard to code. Since the required fields aren't specified, perhaps the function is supposed to check for a specific set of fields that are mandatory for the class. For example, if the class has certain attributes that must be present in the YAML.

But since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the code should assume that the required fields are defined in the class. Wait, the function is a class method, so maybe the required fields are part of the class's metadata. For instance, maybe the class has a class variable called REQUIRED_FIELDS that contains the list of required keys.

So, the code would:

- Load the YAML file into a dictionary.
- Check if all keys in REQUIRED_FIELDS are present in the dictionary.
- If any are missing, raise IRValidatorException with an appropriate message.
- Return the loaded data.

But how to get the required fields? Since the function is a class method, perhaps the required fields are defined in the class. So the code would need to reference that. For example, if the class has a class attribute called REQUIRED_FIELDS, then:

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
    return data

But wait, the user hasn't mentioned anything about REQUIRED_FIELDS. Maybe the exception is raised when the data is invalid, but without knowing the required fields, this code can't be written. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring mentions that the function raises IRValidatorException when mandatory data is missing. So perhaps the code should check for the presence of certain fields, but since they aren't specified, maybe the code is supposed to be a template.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a specific structure, and the required fields are known. For example, if the class is for validating some configuration, the required fields could be things like 'name', 'version', etc. But without knowing, perhaps the code should assume that the required fields are defined in the class. So the code would need to have access to those required fields.

But since the user hasn't provided that info, maybe the code should be written in a way that it checks for the presence of certain fields. However, that's not possible without knowing what they are. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a skeleton that raises an error if the required fields are missing, but the actual fields are determined by the class.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file is properly formatted and contains all the necessary keys for the class. For example, if the class is for some specific data structure, like a configuration file, then the required fields are part of the class definition.

But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should be written in a way that it checks for the presence of certain fields. However, without knowing which ones, maybe the code can't be written. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the data is not empty, but that's not what the docstring says.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a method to validate the data, and this method is supposed to call that. But again, without more info, it's hard to tell.

Wait, the function is called validate_from_file, and it's a class method. So maybe the class has a set of required fields that need to be checked. So the code would need to access those required fields from the class. For example:

Assuming that the class has a class attribute called REQUIRED_FIELDS, which is a list of strings.

So the code would:

- Open the YAML file.
- Load it into a dictionary.
- Check each required field is present.
- If any missing, raise the exception.
- Return the data.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the required fields. However, the function's docstring says that it validates that the YAML file has all required fields. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a generic implementation, but the actual required fields are determined by the class. Therefore, the code would need to have a way to access those required fields.

So, the code would look like:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    """
    Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

    :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
    """
    if yaml_file is None:
        # Maybe raise an error or use a default? The docstring doesn't specify.
        # Assuming that the user is supposed to provide the file path.
        # But if it's optional, perhaps we need to handle it.
        # However, the docstring says "param yaml_file: Path to YAML file" which might imply it's required.
        # Wait, the parameter is optional, but the function might require it. So maybe if it's None, raise an error?
        # Or perhaps the function has a default. But the user hasn't specified. Hmm.
        # Since the docstring doesn't mention a default, perhaps the function expects the user to provide it. So if yaml_file is None, raise an error?
        # Or maybe the function uses a default file path. But without knowing, perhaps the code should check if yaml_file is provided. If not, maybe raise a ValueError?
        # However, the docstring says to raise IRValidatorException, not ValueError. So maybe the function is designed to have yaml_file as optional, but if not provided, it's considered invalid?
        # Or perhaps the function is part of a class that has a default. For example, maybe the class has a class attribute like DEFAULT_YAML_FILE.

        # Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code should assume that yaml_file is provided. But the parameter is optional. So maybe the code should check if yaml_file is None and raise an error?

        # Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to have a default, but the user hasn't mentioned it. Since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the code should proceed with the assumption that yaml_file is provided, and if not, raise an error.

        # However, the docstring says "param yaml_file: Path to YAML file" which is optional. So maybe the function can be called without it, but in that case, how to proceed? Maybe the code should have a default, but since it's not specified, perhaps the code should raise an error if yaml_file is None.

        # Let me check the function signature again: the parameter is optional, so maybe the code should have a default. But the docstring doesn't mention a default. So perhaps the code should have a default, but the user might not have specified it. This is a bit ambiguous.

        # For the purpose of this code, perhaps the function expects the yaml_file to be provided, and if not, it's an error. So, if yaml_file is None, raise an error. But the docstring says to raise IRValidatorException, so maybe the code should check if the file exists and is readable, but that's beyond the scope of the docstring.

        # Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to have a default, but since it's not specified, perhaps the code should not assume that. So, proceed with the code that requires yaml_file to be provided.

    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    # Now check required fields
    # Assuming that the class has a required_fields attribute
    for field in cls.required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
    return data

But wait, the function is a class method, so 'cls' refers to the class. So, if the class has a class attribute called required_fields, then this code would work. However, the user hasn't specified that. So perhaps the code should be written in a way that it checks for certain fields. But without knowing which ones, this is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file is not empty. But that's not what the docstring says. The docstring says that mandatory data is missing. So, perhaps the code is supposed to check for the presence of certain keys, but since they aren't specified, maybe the code is a template that the user would fill in.

But the user wants the code generated based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the code should be written in a way that it checks for the presence of required fields, but the actual fields are determined by the class. Therefore, the code would need to have access to those required fields.

Alternatively, maybe the required fields are part of the class's __init__ method or some other method. But again, without knowing, it's hard to code.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to validate that the YAML file contains all the fields that the class expects. For example, if the class is for validating a certain data structure, then the required fields are known. But since the user hasn't provided that info, perhaps the code is supposed to be a generic implementation, but the actual required fields are not specified. Therefore, the code may need to have a way to determine them, perhaps through the class's attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the required fields are defined in the class as a list, like cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS. So the code would check each of those fields.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code should be written with that assumption. So, in the code, we can check if the class has a REQUIRED_FIELDS attribute, and if not, raise an error. But that's complicating things.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to check for the presence of certain fields that are mandatory for the class. For example, if the class is for validating some configuration, then the required fields could be 'name', 'version', etc. But again, without knowing, this is speculative.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should be written to load the YAML file and check for the presence of required fields, which are assumed to be defined in the class. So the code would look like:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    """
    Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

    :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
    """
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise ValueError("yaml_file is required")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    # Check required fields
    required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
    return data

But the docstring says to raise IRValidatorException, not ValueError. So maybe the code should raise that exception if the file is not provided. However, the function's parameter is optional, so perhaps the code should handle the case where yaml_file is None by using a default. But since the default isn't specified, maybe the code should raise an error.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to have a default file path. For example, if yaml_file is None, use 'default.yaml'. But again, without knowing, this is an assumption.

Given that, perhaps the code should proceed with the assumption that the yaml_file is provided, and if not, raise an error. However, the docstring says the parameter is optional. So maybe the code should have a default. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should not assume that and raise an error if yaml_file is None.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature allows yaml_file to be None, but the docstring says it's a parameter. So perhaps the code should check if yaml_file is None and raise an error, or maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a default YAML file, so the code can proceed without checking. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

In the absence of specific information, the code should be written to handle the case where yaml_file is provided, and if not, perhaps raise an error. However, the docstring doesn't mention that. So maybe the code should proceed with the assumption that yaml_file is provided, and if not, it's an error.

But the user might have intended that the function can be called without the yaml_file parameter, perhaps using a default. Since the parameter is optional, maybe the code should have a default, like 'config.yaml' or something. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should not assume that and proceed with the given parameter.

So, the code would first check if yaml_file is None. If it is, perhaps raise an error. But the docstring says to raise IRValidatorException, so maybe the code should do that.

But the problem is that the user hasn't specified what the required fields are. So the code can't check for them unless they are defined in the class. Therefore, the code should have a way to access those required fields. For example, if the class has a class attribute called REQUIRED_FIELDS, then the code can use that.

So, putting it all together, the code would:

- Import yaml.
- Check if yaml_file is None, raise an error.
- Load the YAML file.
- Check each required field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS is present.
- Raise IRValidatorException if any are missing.
- Return the data.

But the user may not have defined REQUIRED_FIELDS. However, the function is supposed to validate that the YAML has all required fields, so the code must have a way to know which ones. Therefore, the code should assume that the class has such an attribute.

So, the code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
    """
    Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

    :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
    :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
    :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
    """
    if yaml_file is None:
        raise IRValidatorException("YAML file path is required")
    with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in data:
            raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
    return data

But wait, the function is a class method. So when called as a class method, 'cls' is the class itself. So, if the class has a REQUIRED_FIELDS attribute, this code would work.

But what if the YAML file is empty? Then data would be None, and the code would raise an error. Also, if the YAML file is not properly formatted, yaml.safe_load would return None, but that's not necessarily an error. However, the function's purpose is to validate the presence of required fields, not the structure of the YAML. So maybe the code should handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the YAML is not empty. But again, the docstring doesn't specify that.

In any case, the code should load the YAML file, check for required fields, and raise an exception if any are missing. The rest of the validation (like structure) is beyond the scope here.

So the final code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the user said to output only the code in python markdown format. So I need to write the code without any explanations.

Wait, the user also said "Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I need to write the code as a Python function, using markdown code blocks.

But the code needs to be written as a class method. Wait, the function is defined as def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):, which is a class method. But in Python, to make it a class method, it should be decorated with @classmethod. However, the user hasn't specified that. So perhaps the function is intended to be a class method, but the code as written would be a static method. Wait, no, the first parameter is 'cls', which is typical for a class method. So the code should be written as a class method.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the class definition. So the code is just the method. So the code would be:

import yaml

But the user's function signature doesn't include the decorator. However, the function is supposed to be a class method, so the code should include it.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature. So the function signature is given as def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):, which is the signature for a class method. Therefore, the code should be written as a class method, with the @classmethod decorator.

So the code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        """
        Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

        :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
        """
        if yaml_file is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("YAML file path is required")
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
        required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
        return data

But the user hasn't provided the class name. So perhaps the code is supposed to be part of a class, but the class name is not specified. Therefore, the code would be written as a class method, but without the class definition. However, that's not possible. So the code must be written as a method inside a class.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is for a class method, so the code should be written as such.

In conclusion, the code should be a class method that loads the YAML file, checks for required fields defined in the class, and raises the exception if any are missing. The code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class MyClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        """
        Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

        :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
        """
        if yaml_file is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("YAML file path is required")
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
        required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
        return data

But since the user hasn't provided the class name, perhaps the code should be written as a function inside a class, but the class name is not specified. However, the user's function signature is given as part of a class, so the code must be written as a class method.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. So the code should have the function as a class method, with the 'cls' parameter. Therefore, the code should include the @classmethod decorator.

So the final code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        """
        Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

        :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
        """
        if yaml_file is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("YAML file path is required")
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
        required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
        return data

But the user hasn't provided the class name. However, the function is part of a class, so the code must be inside a class. Therefore, the code should be written as a class method, with the class name being whatever the user's class is named.

But since the user hasn't provided the class name, perhaps the code should be written with a placeholder class name, like 'SomeClass', and the required_fields as a class attribute.

But the user's function signature is given as part of a class, so the code should be written as a class method. Therefore, the code would be as above.

However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in python markdown format. So the code should be written as a class method, with the class name not specified, but the function is part of a class. Therefore, the code should have the class definition, even if the class name is not given.

But the user's function signature is given as 'def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):', so the code should be written with that signature. Therefore, the code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        """
        Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

        :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
        """
        if yaml_file is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("YAML file path is required")
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
        required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
        return data

But the user may not have provided the class name. However, the code must be written as a class method. So the code is as above.

But the user's function is supposed to be part of a class, but the class name is not given. Therefore, the code should have a class with the method, but the class name can be arbitrary.

So the code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class Validator:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        """
        Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

        :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file

        """
        if yaml_file is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("YAML file path is required")
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
        required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
        return data

But the user's function signature is 'def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):', so the code should have that signature. Therefore, the code is as above.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code should have the function as a class method, with the 'cls' parameter. Therefore, the code should include the @classmethod decorator.

So the final code would be:

import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        """
        Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

        """
        if yaml_file is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("YAML file path is required")
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:

        required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
        return data

But the user hasn't specified the class name. So perhaps the code should be written as a function inside a class, but without the class name. However, that's not possible. Therefore, the code must be written with a class name, even if it's a placeholder.

In conclusion, the code should be written as a class method that checks for required fields in the class and raises the exception if any are missing. The code should also handle the case where yaml_file is None by raising an error.

But the user's docstring says that the parameter is optional. So maybe the code should have a default value. For example, if yaml_file is None, use a default file path. But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should raise an error if yaml_file is None.

So the code is as written above. Now, the user may have intended that the function is part of a class, and the required fields are defined in that class. Therefore, the code should be written accordingly.

Now, the user also mentioned that the code should not include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. So the code should be in Python markdown format, which is just the code block with triple backticks.

So the final code would be:

```python
import yaml

class IRValidatorException(Exception):
    pass

class SomeClass:
    @classmethod
    def validate_from_file(cls, yaml_file=None):
        """
        Loads & validates that a YAML file has all required fields

        :param yaml_file: Path to YAML file
        :raise IRValidatorException: when mandatory data is missing in file
        :return: Dictionary with data loaded from a YAML file
        """
        if yaml_file is None:
            raise IRValidatorException("YAML file path is required")
        with open(yaml_file, 'r') as file:
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
        required_fields = getattr(cls, 'REQUIRED_FIELDS', [])
        for field in required_fields:
            if field not in data:
                raise IRValidatorException(f"Mandatory field '{field}' is missing")
        return data
```

But the user might have intended that the function is part of a class that has the required fields. So the code is correct as per the given function signature and docstring.
