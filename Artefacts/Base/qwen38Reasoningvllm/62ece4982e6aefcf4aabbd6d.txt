Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function string_to_int based on the provided signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do. The docstring says it converts a string to a number using a given alphabet. The parameters are a string and a list of letters. The return is an integer representing the number.

So, the first thing that comes to mind is that each character in the string should be mapped to a digit based on its position in the alphabet list. For example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 'a' would be 0, 'b' 1, 'c' 2, and so on. Then, the string is treated as a base-(length of alphabet) number. 

Wait, but how do I handle the conversion? Let's say the string is "ab", and the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c']. Then 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1. So the number would be 0 * 3^1 + 1 * 3^0 = 1. But maybe the function is supposed to treat the string as a sequence of digits in a certain base. So each character's position in the alphabet is a digit, and the entire string is a number in base len(alphabet).

But the function's return type is int. So the steps would be:

1. Check that each character in the string is present in the alphabet. Otherwise, maybe raise an error? The docstring says the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so perhaps we don't need to handle invalid cases.

2. For each character in the string, find its index in the alphabet list. That index becomes a digit.

3. Convert the sequence of digits from the alphabet's base to an integer. For example, if the alphabet has 3 letters, each digit is 0, 1, 2, and the string is treated as a base-3 number.

So, the code would need to:

- Iterate over each character in the input string.

- For each character, get its index in the alphabet list.

- Then, compute the value as if it's a number in base len(alphabet). For example, for "ab", it's 0*3 + 1 = 1.

But how to implement that? Let's think about the algorithm. Let's say the alphabet is a list of characters. For each character in the string, we find its position (index) in the alphabet. Then, we calculate the value by treating these indices as digits in a base system. 

For example, if the string is "abc" and the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], then each character is 0, 1, 2. The number would be 0 * 4^2 + 1 * 4^1 + 2 * 4^0 = 0 + 4 + 2 = 6.

So the code would need to:

- Initialize a result variable to 0.

- For each character in the string:

   - Find its index in the alphabet.

   - Multiply the current result by the base (len(alphabet)) and add the index.

But wait, the base is the length of the alphabet. So for each character, the contribution is index * (base ** (position from the end)).

Alternatively, starting from the left, each step multiplies the current total by the base and adds the next digit. For example, for "ab":

Start with 0.

First character 'a' is 0: 0 * 3 + 0 = 0.

Second character 'b' is 1: 0 * 3 + 1 = 1.

Which gives the correct result. So that's the standard way to convert a string in a certain base to an integer.

So the steps are:

- Check that the string is composed of characters from the alphabet. But the docstring says the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so maybe we can assume that. However, in practice, maybe we should handle that, but since the problem says to not include explanations, perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the input is valid.

- Get the base as the length of the alphabet list.

- Initialize result as 0.

- For each char in the string:

   - digit = alphabet.index(char)

   - result = result * base + digit

- Return result.

But wait, what if the alphabet is empty? Well, the function's parameters say alphabet is a List[str], but in practice, the function would need to have a non-zero base. However, the problem might not require handling that edge case.

So the code would be something like:

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    base = len(alphabet)
    result = 0
    for char in string:
        digit = alphabet.index(char)
        result = result * base + digit
    return result

But wait, the alphabet is a list of strings. Wait, the parameters are string (a str) and alphabet (List[str]). So each element in the alphabet is a single character string? Or could they be multi-character? The docstring says the string consists of the letters in the alphabet. So I think each element in the alphabet is a single character, and the string is made up of those characters.

But the code as written would work regardless. For example, if the alphabet has elements like ['a', 'ab'], then the string would have to consist of those elements. But the problem says the string consists of the letters in the alphabet, so perhaps each element in the alphabet is a single character. So the code is okay.

But what about the order of the alphabet? For example, if the alphabet is ['b', 'a'], then 'b' is 0, 'a' is 1. So the string "ba" would be 0 * 2 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.

So the code seems to handle that.

But the problem says that the alphabet is a list of letters. So perhaps the function is intended to map each character in the string to its position in the alphabet, and then treat the entire string as a number in base len(alphabet).

Yes, that's the approach.

So the code would be as above.

Wait, but in Python, the List type needs to be imported from typing. However, the user might have that in their code. The function signature includes 'List[str]' so the code should have that.

But the user is asking for the code, so I need to make sure that the code uses the correct parameters.

So the code would be:

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    """
    Convert a string to a number, using the given alphabet.
    :param string: a string consist of the letters in alphabet
    :param alphabet: list of letters
    :return: int, the corresponding number of the given string using the given transition rule.
    """
    base = len(alphabet)
    result = 0
    for char in string:
        digit = alphabet.index(char)
        result = result * base + digit
    return result

But wait, what if the alphabet is empty? Well, the function would have a base of 0, which would cause errors. But the problem says the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so the alphabet must have at least one element. So perhaps we don't need to handle that case.

This code should work. Let me test with some examples.

Example 1:

alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c']

string 'a' → 0.

string 'b' → 1.

string 'ab' → 0 * 3 + 1 = 1.

string 'abc' → 0 *3^2 + 1*3 + 2 = 0 +3 +2=5.

Wait, but according to the code, for 'abc', the first character is 'a' (0), then result becomes 0*3 +0=0. Then next character 'b' (1): 0*3 +1=1. Then next 'c' (2): 1*3 +2=5. Which is correct.

Another example: alphabet is ['a', 'b'], string 'ba' → 1*2 + 0 = 2.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code seems to handle that.

But what about uppercase letters? The problem says the string consists of the letters in the alphabet. So if the alphabet has lowercase letters, the string must be lowercase. But the code doesn't handle that. However, the problem doesn't mention case sensitivity, so perhaps it's assumed that the string and alphabet are in the same case.

So the code is correct as per the given specifications.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
