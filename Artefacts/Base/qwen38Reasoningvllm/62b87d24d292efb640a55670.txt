Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called get_versions with the given docstring. The function is supposed to obtain version information, and if it can't, return a default value. But the problem is, the docstring doesn't specify what the default value is. Hmm, maybe I need to make an assumption here.

Wait, the function's name is get_versions, so maybe it's intended to return a list of version numbers or something similar. But how do I get version information in Python? Common ways could be using __version__ attributes in modules, or checking the version of the Python interpreter itself. But the user didn't specify, so I should probably go with a general approach.

Let me think. If the function is meant to retrieve version info from a module, perhaps it's looking for a __version__ attribute. But if that's not present, return a default. Alternatively, maybe it's about the Python version, like sys.version. But again, the docstring is vague.

The user's example might be expecting something like trying to get a version from a specific module or a package. But without more context, it's hard to tell. Since the docstring says "version information" in general, maybe the function is supposed to return the Python version. But then, how to handle cases where that's not available?

Wait, maybe the function is part of a package that has version info, and the default is something like '1.0.0' if it can't find the actual version. But since the user hasn't provided specific details, I need to make a generic implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check for a version string in the environment variables or some configuration. But again, no info. So, maybe the safest approach is to assume that the version info is stored in a variable, and if it's not present, return a default.

Wait, the user's example might be expecting code that tries to get the version from a specific source. Let me think of a common scenario. For instance, in many projects, there's a version.py file or a __version__ variable. So maybe the function is supposed to import that and return the version, defaulting to something else if it fails.

But how to handle that in code? Maybe using a try-except block. So, the code would try to import a module or access an attribute, and if it raises an error, return the default. But since the function is called get_versions, perhaps it's supposed to return a list of versions, like major, minor, patch.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version of the current Python interpreter. So using sys.version, but that returns a string like '3.9.7', which might need parsing. But the docstring says "if the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned." So maybe the function is supposed to attempt to get the version and return it, else a default.

But how to structure that. Let me think. For example, trying to get the version from a package, but if that's not available, return a default. Let's say the default is 'unknown' or a tuple like (1, 0, 0). But the user hasn't specified, so maybe the default is an empty string or a specific value.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of version numbers, like ['1.0.0', '2.0.0'] if multiple versions are present, but again, without specifics, it's hard to code.

Wait, perhaps the user expects a generic implementation where the function tries to get the version from a specific source, like a file or a module, and if it can't, returns a default. Let me create a sample code that does that.

For example, maybe the function is supposed to read a version from a file called 'version.txt' and return it, else return a default. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps the default is an empty string or a tuple.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the Python version as a tuple. Let me check. The standard way to get Python version is sys.version_info, which is a tuple. So perhaps the function is supposed to return that, but if for some reason it can't get it (like in some restricted environment?), return a default.

But how would that scenario happen? Well, maybe in a case where the code is run in an environment where sys is not available. But that's unlikely. So perhaps the function is simply supposed to return the Python version, and the default is something like (1, 0, 0) if it can't get it. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a package that has a version attribute, and the default is '1.0.0' if that attribute isn't found. So the code would try to import the package and access its __version__ attribute, else return the default.

But since the function is called get_versions, maybe it's supposed to return a list of versions. However, without knowing the exact context, it's challenging.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a function that retrieves the version of a software package, and if that's not possible, returns a default. For example, using pkg_resources to get the version from setup.py, but that might not always be available.

But again, without specific details, I need to make an assumption. Let me proceed with the idea that the function is trying to get the version from a module, say, a 'version' module, and if that's not found, returns a default.

So, the code could be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        from . import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return '1.0.0'

But wait, the function is called get_versions, which might imply returning multiple versions. Maybe it's supposed to return a list. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the version as a string, and the default is an empty string or a specific value.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version of the current package, and the default is 'unknown'. Let me think of a common approach. For example, in some projects, they have a version.py file with a __version__ variable. So the function could try to import that and return the version, else return a default.

But since the user hasn't provided specifics, perhaps the default is an empty string. However, the docstring says "the default value is returned" but doesn't specify what. Maybe the default is an empty string or None.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version of the Python interpreter. Let me write code that tries to get that, and if it can't, returns a default. But how would it fail? Well, maybe in some environments, sys is not available. But that's not common.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of versions, like major, minor, patch. For example, using sys.version_info, which is a tuple. So converting that to a list or a string.

But the user's docstring says "version information" in general. Maybe the function is supposed to return the version as a string, and the default is '1.0.0'.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the version from a specific package, like using importlib.metadata or pkg_resources, but again, without knowing the package name, it's hard to code.

Wait, maybe the user is referring to a function that is part of a larger project, and the version info is stored in a variable. For example, in a package, there might be a __version__ variable. So the function could try to access that, and if it's not present, return a default.

So, the code could be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        import pkg_resources
        return pkg_resources.get_distribution("package_name").version
    except Exception:
        return "1.0.0"

But again, the package name is unknown. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the version of the current module. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version of the current Python interpreter. So using sys.version, but that's a string. Let me check.

In that case, the code would be:

import sys

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return sys.version
    except Exception:
        return "1.0.0"

But that seems too simplistic. However, the user hasn't provided any specifics, so perhaps this is the intended approach. But the function name is get_versions, which might suggest multiple versions. Maybe the function is supposed to return a list of versions, but again, without knowing the context, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a tuple of version numbers. For example, (1, 2, 3) for major, minor, patch. But again, the default is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the user is referring to a function that is part of a package and is supposed to retrieve the package's version. So, using importlib.metadata or distutils. But again, without knowing the package name, it's hard to code.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a default value if the version can't be retrieved. Let's assume that the version is stored in a variable called __version__ in the same module. So the code could be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return __version__
    except NameError:
        return "1.0.0"

But then, the __version__ variable needs to be defined. However, the user hasn't provided that. So maybe the function is supposed to return the default value if the version isn't found.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return a list of versions, like the versions of dependencies or something. But again, no info.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that tries to get the version from a specific module or attribute and returns a default if it fails. Since the user hasn't specified, I'll make a generic example.

Let me think of a common scenario where version info is stored in a variable. For example, in a package, there might be a __version__ variable. So the function could try to access that, and if it's not present, return a default.

So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        from . import __version__
        return __version__
    except ImportError:
        return "1.0.0"

But that's assuming the version is in a module. Alternatively, maybe it's in the same module. Wait, but the function is in a module, so perhaps the __version__ is a variable in that module. But the function is called get_versions, which might imply that it's supposed to return a list or multiple versions.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version as a string, and the default is an empty string. But again, not sure.

Since the user hasn't provided specifics, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that returns the Python version, and if that's not possible (which is unlikely), returns a default. Let's go with that.

So the code would be:

import sys

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return sys.version
    except Exception:
        return "1.0.0"

But maybe the user expects a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a tuple of version numbers. For example, sys.version_info is a tuple, so converting that to a string or list.

But the docstring says "version information" which could be a string. So perhaps the function returns the Python version as a string, defaulting to '1.0.0' if there's an error.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of versions, like ['1.0.0', '2.0.0'], but again, no info.

Given the lack of specifics, I think the safest bet is to assume that the function is supposed to return the Python version, and the default is '1.0.0' if it can't get it. But how would it fail? Well, maybe in some restricted environments, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the version of the current package, and the default is 'unknown'. So using importlib.metadata.

But since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the code should be a generic example. Let me check the original question again.

The user says: Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format.

So the function signature is given, but the docstring is the one provided. The user hasn't given any specifics about how to obtain the version info, so I need to make a reasonable assumption.

Maybe the function is supposed to return a list of version numbers, like major, minor, patch. So using sys.version_info, which is a tuple. For example:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        import sys
        return list(sys.version_info)
    except Exception:
        return [1, 0, 0]

But that would return a list of integers. However, the default could be a string or another format.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version as a string, like '1.0.0', and the default is the same. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version from a file, like a VERSION file. So the code could read that file, else return default.

But again, without knowing the specifics, it's hard. Since the user hasn't provided any, perhaps the code should be a simple example that tries to get the version from a module and returns a default if it fails.

So, here's a possible code:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        from . import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return "1.0.0"

But this assumes there's a 'version' module with a __version__ attribute. However, since the user hasn't specified, this is just an example.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a default value if the version can't be retrieved. So, perhaps the function is designed to be used in a package where the version is stored in a variable, and if that variable isn't present, return the default.

But again, without knowing, I need to make an assumption. Let me go with the first approach where it tries to import a version module and returns its __version__, else returns a default string.

So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        from . import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return "1.0.0"

But the user might have a different expectation. However, given the information, this seems reasonable. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version of the current package, using importlib.metadata.

But to use that, the code would need to import importlib.metadata and get the distribution. However, that requires knowing the package name. So perhaps:

import importlib.metadata

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return importlib.metadata.version(__package__)
    except importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError:
        return "1.0.0"

But again, __package__ might not be available in all contexts. Also, the function name is get_versions, which might imply multiple versions. Maybe the function is supposed to return a list of versions, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a single version string, and the default is an empty string or 'unknown'.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to return the Python version as a string, defaulting to '1.0.0' if there's an error. So:

import sys

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return sys.version
    except Exception:
        return "1.0.0"

But sys.version is a string, so that's possible. However, in practice, sys.version is always available. So maybe the default is not needed, but the docstring says to return the default if it can't be obtained. So perhaps the function is designed to be more generic.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check for a version in the environment variables. For example, checking for 'APP_VERSION' and returning that, else default.

But again, without specifics, it's hard. Since the user hasn't provided any, I think the best is to write a function that tries to get the version from a module, and returns a default if it can't. Let's proceed with that.

So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        from . import __version__
        return __version__
    except ImportError:
        return "1.0.0"

But again, this is just an example. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of version numbers, like major, minor, patch. For example:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        import sys
        return list(sys.version_info)
    except Exception:
        return [1, 0, 0]

But the default here is a list. However, the user might have intended a string. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a string like '1.0.0' by default. 

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the user expects a simple function that returns a default value. For example:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        # Some code to get version
        pass
    except:
        return "1.0.0"

But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version of the current module. But how?

In Python, you can use __version__ if it's defined. So:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return __version__
    except NameError:
        return "1.0.0"

But this would require that __version__ is defined in the same module. However, the function is called get_versions, which might suggest that it's part of a package. 

Hmm. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I think the best approach is to write a function that tries to get the version from a module named 'version' and returns a default if it can't. So:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        from . import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return "1.0.0"

But since the user hasn't specified, this is just an example. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of versions, like ['1.0.0', '2.0.0'], but without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version as a tuple, like (1, 0, 0), and the default is that tuple. So:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        import sys
        return sys.version_info
    except Exception:
        return (1, 0, 0)

But again, sys.version_info is always available. 

Given all these possibilities, perhaps the user expects a function that returns a default value, and the 'version information' is a placeholder. So maybe the function is supposed to return a string, and the default is '1.0.0'.

But since the user hasn't provided specifics, I'll have to make an assumption. Let me go with the first example where it tries to import a version module and returns its __version__, else returns a default. That seems like a common pattern.

So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        from . import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return "1.0.0"

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. However, the user might have intended something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version of the package it's part of. So using importlib.metadata.version. Let me check that.

In Python 3.8+, you can use importlib.metadata.version. So:

import importlib.metadata

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        return importlib.metadata.version(__package__)
    except importlib.metadata.PackageNotFoundError:
        return "1.0.0"

But this requires that the package is installed and that __package__ is available. 

But since the user hasn't specified, I think the best approach is to write a function that returns the Python version as a string, defaulting to '1.0.0' if there's an error. Although sys.version is always available, maybe the user wants to handle cases where it's not. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version of a specific library, but again, no info.

In the absence of specific information, I'll proceed with the first example, assuming that the version is in a module named 'version' with a __version__ attribute. So the code would be:

def get_versions():
    """
    Obtains the version information. If the version information cannot be obtained, the default value is returned.
    """
    try:
        from . import version
        return version.__version__
    except ImportError:
        return "1.0.0"

But I need to make sure that this code is valid. The 'from . import version' assumes that the version module is in the same package. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the version from a file. For example, reading a VERSION file. 

But without knowing, I'll stick with the module approach. 

So the final code would be as above. But the user might have a different expectation. However, given the information, this is a reasonable implementation.
