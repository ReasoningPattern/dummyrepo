Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _resolve_string based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it gets a value from the environment using a matcher that has a name and an optional default value in its group dict. If the variable isn't defined and there's no default, it raises an error. So the function probably takes a matcher object, extracts the name and default from its groups, checks the environment variables, and returns the appropriate value.

First, I should check the matcher's group dict. The name is likely in group 1, and the default in group 2. So maybe the matcher is a regex match object where group 1 is the variable name and group 2 is the default. Or perhaps it's a dictionary with keys like 'name' and 'default'. The docstring mentions "group dict," so I think it's referring to a match object's groups.

So, the function would first check if there's a default value. If the environment variable exists, return it. If not, check if there's a default provided by the matcher. If no default and the variable isn't set, raise an error.

Wait, the function is called _resolve_string, so maybe it's handling environment variables that are strings. The matcher could be a regex match object, like from a pattern that captures the variable name and optional default. For example, a pattern like (name)(?:\((default)\))? would capture name in group 1 and default in group 2.

So, the code would start by getting the name and default from the matcher's groups. Then, check if the environment variable is present. If it is, return its value. If not, use the default if provided. Otherwise, raise an error.

But how to access the environment variables? Using os.environ.get, perhaps. So, name = matcher.group(1), default = matcher.group(2) if it exists. Then, check if os.environ has the name. If not, and default is not present, raise ValueError or something.

Wait, the docstring says "given a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict." So the matcher is an object that has a group method, like a regex match object. So group(1) gives the name, group(2) gives the default.

So code steps:

1. Extract name from matcher.group(1).
2. Check if the environment variable exists. If yes, return its value.
3. If not, check if there's a default in matcher.group(2). If yes, return that.
4. If neither exists, raise an error.

But wait, the function is called _resolve_string, so maybe it's part of a larger system, like parsing a string with environment variables. For example, something like ${VAR} or ${VAR:default}.

So the matcher might have captured the variable name and optional default. Then, the function resolves it by checking the environment.

So, in code:

import os

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    name = matcher.group(1)
    default = matcher.group(2)
    value = os.environ.get(name)
    if value is None:
        if default is not None:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Environment variable {name} not found and no default provided")
    else:
        return value

Wait, but the docstring says "if the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised." So the error should be raised when both are missing. But what type of error? The docstring says "an Error is raised," but in Python, it's better to specify the type. Maybe KeyError or ValueError? The original example might use KeyError since it's about environment variables. But perhaps the user expects a specific exception. Since the docstring doesn't specify, maybe use KeyError.

But maybe the function is part of a template processing system, and the error is more specific. However, the user hasn't specified, so I'll go with KeyError.

Wait, but in the code, if the default is provided, then return it. Otherwise, raise. So the code would be:

import os

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    """
    Get the value from environment given a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict.
    If the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised.
    """
    name = matcher.group(1)
    default = matcher.group(2)
    value = os.environ.get(name)
    if value is None:
        if default is not None:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Environment variable {name} not found")
    return value

Wait, but maybe the default is in the group dict as a separate key. Or maybe the matcher is a dictionary. Wait, the docstring says "group dict," which suggests that the matcher has a group method, like a regex match object. So group(1) is the name, group(2) is the default.

But perhaps the matcher is a named group. For example, if the regex has groups named 'name' and 'default', then matcher.group('name') and matcher.group('default'). But the function signature uses group(1) and group(2), so maybe the groups are numbered.

Alternatively, maybe the matcher is a dictionary with keys 'name' and 'default'. But the term "group dict" is a bit ambiguous. However, given the function name and the context, it's more likely that the matcher is a regex match object.

So the code would extract the name and default from the match groups. Then check the environment.

But what if the default is not provided? For example, if the matcher's group 2 is None. So in that case, if the environment variable isn't present, raise an error.

So the code would be as above.

Wait, but the function is called _resolve_string, so maybe it's intended to return a string. The environment variables are strings, and the default is also a string. So that's okay.

But perhaps the default is not a string? Well, the docstring says "optional default value," but since it's part of a string resolution, maybe the default is also a string.

So the code seems correct. Let me check again.

Another possibility: the matcher is a dictionary that has 'name' and 'default' keys. Then, name = matcher['name'], default = matcher.get('default'). But the docstring says "group dict," which makes me think of regex groups.

But the function signature is def _resolve_string(matcher):, so the code should work with whatever matcher is passed. The docstring says "group dict," perhaps implying that the matcher has a group method that returns a dictionary. Wait, no, the group method of a regex match object returns a string, but groups() returns a tuple. Maybe the matcher is a regex match object, and the groups are numbered.

So, for example, if the regex is something like r'\$(?P<name>[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\$$(?P<default>[^$]*)$'? Not sure. But the function uses group(1) and group(2), so the regex probably has two groups.

So the code as written would work.

But perhaps the default is optional. So if the matcher has only one group, then group(2) would be None. So the code checks if group(2) is present.

But the user might have a different structure. However, given the information, this is the best assumption.

So the code would be:

import os

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    """
    Get the value from environment given a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict.
    If the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised.
    """
    name = matcher.group(1)
    default = matcher.group(2)
    value = os.environ.get(name)
    if value is None:
        if default is not None:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Environment variable {name} not found")
    return value

But wait, the docstring says "group dict," which might mean that the matcher has a group dictionary. Wait, maybe the matcher is an object that has a group_dict attribute? Or perhaps the function is intended to work with a dictionary of groups. But the standard way is that a regex match object has group(1), group(2), etc.

Alternatively, maybe the matcher is a dictionary, and the groups are stored as keys. But the function name suggests it's part of a regex processing.

In any case, the code above seems to fit the description. The function takes a matcher, gets the name and default from groups 1 and 2, checks the environment, returns the value or default, else raises KeyError.

But the user says "Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

So I need to write the code as per the function signature and docstring. The code should be in Python, using the matcher's group method. So the code would be:

import os

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    """
    Get the value from environment given a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict.
    If the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised.
    """
    name = matcher.group(1)
    default = matcher.group(2)
    value = os.environ.get(name)
    if value is None:
        if default is not None:
            return default
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Environment variable {name} not found")
    return value

But maybe the error should be more specific. The original docstring says "an Error is raised," but in Python, it's better to specify the exception type. The user might expect a ValueError or something else. However, since the docstring doesn't specify, using KeyError is acceptable, as it's related to environment variables.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where the error is a custom one, but without more info, KeyError is the standard.

So this code should be correct. Let me check again.

Another thing: the function is called _resolve_string, so maybe it's intended to return a string. The environment variables are strings, and the default is also a string. So the code returns strings.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the final code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, perhaps the default is in group 2, but maybe the group is named. But the code uses group(1) and group(2), so the regex pattern would have two groups. For example, a pattern like r'\$(?P<name>[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\$(?P<default>[^$]*)$' would have named groups, but the function uses group(1) and group(2), so perhaps the regex is using numbered groups.

So the code is correct. The user didn't specify the exact structure of the matcher, but based on the docstring, it's safe to assume that group(1) is the name and group(2) is the default.

So the code is as written.
