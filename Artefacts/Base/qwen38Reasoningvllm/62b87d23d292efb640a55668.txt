Okay, I need to generate Python code for the get_config function based on the given signature and docstring. The user specified not to include any explanations or markdown, so I'll focus solely on the code.

First, the function is called get_config and it returns a new VersioneerConfig instance. The docstring mentions setting various attributes of the config. Since the actual attributes aren't specified, I should assume that VersioneerConfig is a class with some attributes that need initialization.

I should start by importing the VersioneerConfig class. But wait, the user didn't mention where it's from. Maybe it's part of a module, like versioneer? So I'll add an import statement for that. Then, the function creates an instance of VersioneerConfig.

The docstring says to set various attributes. Without specific details, I'll have to make some educated guesses. Common configuration attributes might include things like the version file path, the version format, whether to use semantic versioning, etc. Let me think of some typical attributes that a version configuration might have.

Perhaps the config has attributes like version_file, version_format, use_semver, and maybe others. I'll need to set these. For example, default values could be set. Let me check the versioneer library's documentation to see what attributes are standard. Wait, I can't access external resources, so I'll proceed with common sense.

Assuming VersioneerConfig has attributes like version_file, version_format, use_semver, and maybe a flag for git. So in the code, after creating the config instance, I'll set these attributes. Let me assign some default values. For instance, version_file could be 'version.txt', version_format might be '{major}.{minor}.{patch}', use_semver as True, and maybe a git flag as False.

Wait, but the user might expect that the function initializes the config with certain defaults. So the code would be:

def get_config():
    """
    Return a new VersioneerConfig() and set various attribute of it.
    """
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.version_file = 'version.txt'
    config.version_format = '{major}.{minor}.{patch}'
    config.use_semver = True
    config.use_git_tag = False
    return config

But I need to make sure that the attributes are correctly named. If VersioneerConfig is from a specific module, maybe the attributes are different. However, since the user hasn't provided specifics, this is a reasonable assumption. Also, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, which I think refers to triple backticks. But the user said to output only the code, so I should just write the function.

Wait, the user said "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So they want the code enclosed in triple backticks. But the example they gave has the function definition and the docstring. So I'll write the function with the assumed attributes.

Another thought: maybe the function is part of a larger codebase, and the VersioneerConfig class is already imported. But since the user hasn't specified, I should include the import statement. However, sometimes in code, the import is at the top. But since the function is standalone, perhaps the import is inside? Or maybe the user expects that the VersioneerConfig is already available.

Hmm, but to make the code self-contained, I should include the import. So adding 'from versioneer import VersioneerConfig' at the top. Wait, but the user's code might have that already. However, since the function is supposed to return a new instance, the import is necessary.

So the complete code would be:

from versioneer import VersioneerConfig

def get_config():
    """
    Return a new VersioneerConfig() and set various attribute of it.
    """
    config = VersioneerConfig()
    config.version_file = 'version.txt'
    config.version_format = '{major}.{minor}.{patch}'
    config.use_semver = True
    config.use_git_tag = False
    return config

But maybe the attributes are different. For example, maybe it's 'version_tag' or 'git_tag'. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to set attributes based on some logic. But without more info, I can't know. So I'll proceed with the most common ones.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set up the config with default values, but the user's docstring says "set various attribute of it." So perhaps the function is initializing the config with some defaults. Let me check if there are standard attributes for versioning. For example, in versioneer, the config might have attributes like 'version_file', 'version_format', 'use_semver', 'use_git_tag', etc.

So the code would include those. I'll go with that. Also, maybe the function is part of a module that already has the import, but since the user hasn't specified, it's safer to include the import.

Wait, but the user's example code doesn't include an import. Maybe they expect that the VersioneerConfig is already imported. However, in practice, the code would need the import. But perhaps the user wants the minimal code, so maybe just the function without the import. But that would cause an error if VersioneerConfig isn't imported. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class or module where the import is already handled. Since the user hasn't provided that context, I'll include the import statement to make the code valid.

So the final code would have the import, create the config instance, set the attributes, and return it. That should be the answer.
