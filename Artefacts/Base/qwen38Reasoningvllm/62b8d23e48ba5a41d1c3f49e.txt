Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this method is supposed to do.

The docstring says it should find, remove, and return a random (key, value) pair using __choice in the class. Wait, __choice is a special method in Python, but I remember that in Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain insertion order. However, the standard dict class doesn't have a __choice method. Maybe the user is referring to a custom method called __choice that's part of their class?

So the function is part of a class, probably a dictionary-like class. The popitem method is supposed to remove and return a random item. In standard Python, there's dict.popitem() which removes and returns a (key, value) pair, but it's not random. It removes the last inserted item. To make it random, the class must have a way to select a random key.

The docstring mentions using __choice in the class. Maybe the class has a __choice method that selects a random key? So the popitem method would use that to get a key, then remove it and return the pair.

Wait, but the user says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is defined as def popitem(self):, so it's a method of a class. The docstring says to use __choice in the class. So perhaps the class has a __choice method that returns a random key, and popitem uses that.

So the steps would be: use __choice to get a random key, then delete that key from the dictionary and return the (key, value) pair.

But how to implement that? Let me think. Assuming that the class is a subclass of dict, or has a dictionary attribute. Let's say the class has a dictionary, maybe called self.data.

So first, get a random key using self.__choice(). Then, get the value from self.data, then delete the key. But wait, if __choice is a method that returns a key, then perhaps the code would be:

key = self.__choice()
value = self.data[key]
del self.data[key]
return (key, value)

But I need to make sure that __choice is properly called. Also, what if the dictionary is empty? Should handle that case, maybe raise a KeyError.

Wait, the standard popitem raises KeyError if the dictionary is empty. So maybe the code should check if the dictionary is empty first. But the user didn't mention error handling in the docstring. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method is responsible for handling empty cases. But the docstring doesn't specify that. Let me proceed with the basic implementation.

So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    return (key, value)

But wait, where is self.data? If the class is a subclass of dict, maybe self.data is the underlying dictionary. Or perhaps the class has a dictionary attribute. Let me assume that the class has a dictionary attribute called data. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be self._data or something else. But since the user didn't specify, I'll go with self.data.

Alternatively, if the class is a dict itself, then maybe self is the dictionary, and __choice is a method that selects a key. But in that case, the code would be:

key = self.__choice()
value = self[key]
del self[key]
return (key, value)

But the user's function signature is def popitem(self):, so it's a method of a class. So the class must have a dictionary, perhaps as an instance variable. Let me think of a possible class structure. For example, if the class is a custom dictionary, maybe it's initialized with a data attribute.

But since the user hasn't provided the class structure, I need to make assumptions. Let's assume that the class has a dictionary called data. So the code would be as above.

But wait, the standard dict's popitem() method is implemented in C, and for a custom class, you'd need to override it. However, the user's code is supposed to be in Python, so perhaps they are creating a custom dictionary-like class.

Another thing: the __choice method. Maybe it's a typo and they meant to use the built-in choice function from random? Like, perhaps they want to select a random key from the dictionary. But the docstring says via __choice in the class, so it's likely that the class has a method named __choice that returns a random key.

So the code would call self.__choice() to get the key, then proceed to remove it.

But how does __choice work? Let's say that __choice returns a random key from the dictionary. So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    return (key, value)

But then, what if the dictionary is empty? The __choice method might raise an error, or maybe the code should handle that. Since the standard popitem raises KeyError when empty, perhaps the code should do the same. But the user didn't mention that, so maybe it's up to the __choice method to handle it.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method is supposed to return a key, and the code assumes that the dictionary is not empty. But to be safe, perhaps we should check if the dictionary is empty before calling __choice. However, the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe it's not necessary.

Another consideration: the __choice method might be a private method, so using self.__choice() is correct. But in Python, double underscores trigger name mangling, so if the class is named MyDict, the method would be _MyDict__choice. However, the user's docstring refers to __choice, so perhaps they intended it to be a private method, but in the code, it's called as self.__choice().

So putting it all together, the code would be as follows. Also, the user says to output only the code in Python markdown format, so I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted.

Wait, but the user's function is part of a class. So the code should be inside the class. However, the user hasn't provided the class definition, just the function signature. So the code should be the method's implementation.

So the final code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    return (key, value)

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, perhaps the class has a different attribute for the data. For example, if the class is a dict subclass, maybe self is the dictionary, and the data is stored in self. So maybe the code should be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

Wait, but the __choice method is supposed to be called. If the class has a method named __choice, then self.__choice() would call it. However, in Python, __choice is not a standard method. Maybe the user made a typo and meant to use the built-in random.choice? But the docstring says via __choice in the class, so it's likely that the class has its own __choice method.

So the code would call self.__choice() to get the key. Then, retrieve the value from the dictionary and delete the key.

Another thing: the __choice method might need to return a key from the dictionary. So perhaps the __choice method is implemented to return a random key. For example, in the class, there's a method:

def __choice(self):
    import random
    return random.choice(list(self.keys()))

But that's part of the class's implementation, which the user isn't asking for. The user only wants the popitem method.

So the code for popitem would be as I wrote before. However, the user's code may have a different structure. For example, if the class is a dict subclass, then self is the dictionary, and the data is stored in self. So maybe the code should be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

But the __choice method would need to be defined in the class. However, the user hasn't provided that, so the code for popitem is just as written.

But the user's function signature is def popitem(self):, so the code should be part of a class. However, the user hasn't given the class name. So the code is just the method.

So the final code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

Wait, but in the docstring, it says "via __choice in the class", so maybe the __choice is a method that the class has. So the code would call self.__choice() to get the key. But in Python, if the method is named __choice, then it's a special method, but perhaps the user is using it as a custom method. So the code would be as above.

But what if the class is not a dict subclass? Then, self would have a data attribute. So the code would need to access that. For example, if the class has a dictionary called data, then:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self.data[key]
    del self.data[key]
    return (key, value)

But again, without knowing the class structure, it's hard to say. However, the user's docstring says "via __choice in the class", implying that the class has a __choice method. So the code would use that method to get the key, then retrieve the value from the dictionary.

But how to get the value? If the class is a dict subclass, then self is the dictionary, so self[key] would get the value. If the class has a separate data attribute, then self.data would be the dictionary.

Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the safest assumption is that the class is a dict subclass, and the __choice method returns a key. Therefore, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

But wait, the __choice method might not be defined in the class. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the __choice is a method that the class has, and the code is supposed to use it.

Another possibility is that the user intended to use the built-in random.choice, but wrote __choice by mistake. But since the docstring says "via __choice in the class", it's more likely that the class has a method named __choice.

So the code would be as written. However, the user's function signature is def popitem(self):, so the code is just the method.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the user might have intended that the __choice method is part of the class, so the code would call it.

Therefore, the generated code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

But wait, the __choice method might not return a key. Maybe it returns something else. But according to the docstring, it's supposed to find a random (key, value) pair via __choice, so perhaps __choice returns the key, and then the value is retrieved from the dictionary.

Alternatively, maybe __choice returns a (key, value) pair directly. But that's less likely. The docstring says "via __choice in the class", so perhaps the __choice method is used to select the key, then the value is fetched.

So the code would be as above. Also, need to make sure that the method is properly handling the case when the dictionary is empty. However, the user didn't mention that, so maybe it's not necessary. But in practice, if the dictionary is empty, self.__choice() might raise an error. So perhaps the code should handle that. But since the user hasn't specified, maybe we can leave it as is.

Another thing: in Python, the standard popitem() for dict raises KeyError if the dictionary is empty. So the code should do the same. But how? If __choice() is called on an empty dictionary, it might raise an error. So perhaps the code is safe as is.

So the final code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

But I need to check if the __choice method is supposed to be called without parentheses. Wait, the docstring says "via __choice in the class", which could mean that the method is called as self.__choice, but in Python, methods are called with parentheses. So it's more likely that it's self.__choice().

So the code is correct. Now, I need to output this in Python markdown format. The user says to output only the code, no explanations. So the code should be written as:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Find, remove and return a random `(key, value)` pair via __choice in the class
    """
    key = self.__choice__()
    value = self[key]
    del self[key]
    return (key, value)

But wait, the user's function signature is def popitem(self):, so the code is correct. Also, the docstring is as given.

I think that's the correct approach. So the code is as above.
