Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called match that checks if a filename's type is 'doxyfile'. The docstring says to return True if the filename's type in lowercase is 'doxyfile'. Wait, what does 'type of the filename' mean here? Oh, maybe they mean the file extension. Like, checking if the file ends with .doxyfile.

So the function should take a filename string and check if the extension is doxyfile, case-insensitive. So first, I need to split the filename into the name and extension parts. But how to handle cases where there's no extension, or multiple dots?

Hmm, maybe split on the last occurrence of '.' to get the extension. For example, 'example.doxyfile' would split into 'example' and 'doxyfile'. But if the filename is 'file', then there's no extension. So in that case, the function should return False.

Wait, the docstring says "type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". Maybe the entire filename is supposed to be 'doxyfile'? But that's unlikely. More probably, the extension is what's important. So the function should check if the extension part (after the last dot) is 'doxyfile' when lowercased.

So steps: split the filename into parts using split('.'), then check if the last part is 'doxyfile' in lowercase. But need to handle cases where there are multiple dots. Like 'file.config.doxyfile' would have the last part as 'doxyfile', so that's okay.

But what if the filename has no dots at all? Then the extension is the entire filename. So for example, if the filename is 'doxyfile', then split would return ['doxyfile'], so the last part is 'doxyfile', which would match. But if it's 'Doxyfile', then lowercasing would make it 'doxyfile' and match.

Wait, the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So maybe the entire filename is checked in lowercase? Like, if the filename is 'DoxyFile', then lowercasing gives 'doxyfile', which would return True. But that seems too simplistic. Probably, the intention is to check the extension.

But the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the docstring. It says "Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". The term 'type' here might refer to the file extension. So perhaps the function is supposed to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension.

So the approach would be: split the filename into parts by '.', take the last part, convert to lowercase, and check if it equals 'doxyfile'.

But how to handle cases where there are multiple dots? Like 'file.doxyfile.txt' would have the last part as 'txt', so that's not a match. But if the filename is 'file.doxyfile', then the last part is 'doxyfile', which is a match.

So the code would be something like:

def match(filename):
    parts = filename.split('.')
    if len(parts) == 0:
        return False
    ext = parts[-1].lower()
    return ext == 'doxyfile'

Wait, but split('.') can return an empty list if the filename is empty, but that's probably not a case we need to handle. However, for filenames like 'file', split('.') would return ['file'], so parts[-1] is 'file', lowercased, which would not match. So that's correct.

But what about filenames like 'doxyfile'? Split would return ['doxyfile'], so parts[-1] is 'doxyfile', lowercased, which matches. So that's correct.

Another example: 'test.Doxyfile' would split into ['test', 'Doxyfile'], then lower to 'doxyfile', which matches. So return True.

So the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    parts = filename.split('.')
    if not parts:
        return False
    return parts[-1].lower() == 'doxyfile'

Wait, but if the filename is empty, split would return an empty list. So the check for not parts would handle that. But maybe the function is supposed to return False in that case.

Alternatively, maybe the function should return True only if the filename ends with .doxyfile, regardless of other parts. So using the split method is a way to get the extension.

But another approach is to use os.path.splitext, which splits into root and ext. For example, os.path.splitext('file.doxyfile') returns ('file', '.doxyfile'), so the extension is '.doxyfile'. Then we can check if the extension part (without the dot) is 'doxyfile' when lowercased.

Wait, but splitext returns a tuple. So for 'file.doxyfile', the extension is '.doxyfile', so we can take the second part and check. But if the filename has no extension, like 'file', then splitext returns ('file', ''), so the extension is empty. So in that case, the function would return False.

So using splitext might be more accurate. Let me think. Let's try that approach.

So code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    _, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    return ext.lower() == '.doxyfile'

Wait, but the docstring says to return True if the type in lowercase is 'doxyfile'. So if the extension is '.DoxyFile', then lowercasing would make it '.doxyfile', which matches. So this code would work.

But the user's docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So maybe the entire filename is checked in lowercase? Like, if the filename is 'Doxyfile', then lowercasing gives 'doxyfile', which would return True. But that's not considering the extension. So perhaps the user intended to check the extension.

But the wording is ambiguous. Let me check the original function signature again. The function is called match, and the docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile'. So maybe the type refers to the file extension.

But perhaps the user wants to check if the filename, when lowercased, is exactly 'doxyfile'. For example, if the filename is 'DOXYFILE', then lowercasing gives 'doxyfile', which would return True. But that's a very specific case. However, the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So maybe the type is the entire filename, but in lowercase. So the function should return True if filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'.

But that's a bit odd. For example, if the filename is 'doxyfile.txt', then lowercasing would not make it 'doxyfile'. So perhaps the correct approach is to check the extension.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended to check the extension. Let me think about the possible scenarios.

If the function is supposed to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension, then using os.path.splitext is better. However, if the function is supposed to check if the filename (without any path) is exactly 'doxyfile' in lowercase, then just compare the lowercased filename to 'doxyfile'.

But the original function's docstring says "the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". The term 'type' here is unclear. However, considering that doxyfile is a configuration file for Doxygen, it's likely that the function is supposed to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension.

But the user's docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So maybe the type is the entire filename, but in lowercase. So for example, if the filename is 'Doxyfile', then lowercasing gives 'doxyfile', which would return True. But if it's 'doxyfile.txt', then lowercasing would be 'doxyfile.txt' which is not equal to 'doxyfile', so returns False.

But that's conflicting with the usual understanding of file types. So which is correct?

Looking back at the function's docstring: "Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". The 'type' here might refer to the file extension. So the function is supposed to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension.

But the return statement says "Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So maybe the type is the entire filename, but in lowercase. So the function should return True if filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'.

But that would only be true for filenames that are exactly 'doxyfile' (case-insensitive). So for example, 'Doxyfile' would return True, but 'doxyfile.txt' would return False.

But the user might have intended to check the extension. So perhaps the correct approach is to check the extension part.

But since the user hasn't provided examples, I need to make an assumption. Let me check the original function's docstring again. The function is called match, and the docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile' when lowercased. So maybe the type is the entire filename, but in lowercase. So the function should return True if the filename, when converted to lowercase, is exactly 'doxyfile'.

But that's a very specific case. For example, if the filename is 'doxyfile', then it's True. If it's 'Doxyfile', then lowercasing gives 'doxyfile' and returns True. But if the filename is 'doxyfile.txt', then lowercasing gives 'doxyfile.txt' which is not equal to 'doxyfile', so returns False.

Alternatively, maybe the user meant that the file's extension is 'doxyfile', regardless of the rest of the name. So the function should check if the extension is .doxyfile.

But the wording is ambiguous. However, given that the function is named 'match' and the docstring says 'type of the filename', perhaps the user is referring to the file extension.

But how to resolve this? Let me think about the possible code.

If the user wants to check the extension, then using os.path.splitext is better. But if they want to check the entire filename, then just compare.

But the original function's docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So maybe the type is the entire filename. So for example, if the filename is 'Doxyfile', then lowercasing it gives 'doxyfile', which matches. So the code would be:

def match(filename):
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But that's very restrictive. However, the user's docstring says "the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". So perhaps that's what they want.

But maybe the user made a mistake in the wording and meant the extension. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'type' refers to the file's extension. So the function should check if the extension is .doxyfile.

In that case, the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, for a filename like 'doxyfile', os.path.splitext would split into ('doxyfile', ''), so the extension is empty. So that would return False. But according to the docstring, if the filename is 'doxyfile', then it should return True.

So this suggests that the user wants to check if the entire filename (without any path) is 'doxyfile' in lowercase. So the correct code would be:

def match(filename):
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But then, what if the filename is 'doxyfile.txt'? That would return False. But maybe the user wants to check if the extension is .doxyfile, regardless of the base name. So the function should return True for 'something.doxyfile', 'Doxyfile', etc.

But the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So perhaps the type is the entire filename. So the code should check if the filename, when lowercased, equals 'doxyfile'.

But that's a bit strange. For example, if the filename is 'Doxyfile', then lowercasing gives 'doxyfile', which would return True. But if the filename is 'doxyfile.txt', then it's not.

But maybe the user intended to check the extension. Let me think again. The function is called 'match', which is a bit generic. However, given that the docstring says "type of the filename", perhaps the user is referring to the file's extension.

But the wording is unclear. However, given that the function is supposed to return True if the type in lowercase is 'doxyfile', perhaps the 'type' is the extension. So the code should check if the extension is .doxyfile.

But then, for a filename like 'doxyfile', the extension is empty. So the function would return False. But according to the docstring, maybe that's considered as having type 'doxyfile'? That's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to check if the filename ends with .doxyfile, regardless of other parts. So for example, 'file.doxyfile' would return True, 'doxyfile' would return False, 'Doxyfile' would return False, but 'DoxyFile' would return False unless the extension is .doxyfile.

Wait, but if the filename is 'doxyfile', then the extension is empty. So perhaps the user wants to consider that as a valid case. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant to check the extension. But without more info, I have to make a choice.

Looking at the original function's docstring again: "Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'". The 'type' here might be a typo for 'extension'. But assuming that the user wants to check the extension, then the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, if the filename is 'doxyfile', the extension is empty, so returns False. However, if the user wants to consider that as a valid case, then maybe they want to check if the filename is exactly 'doxyfile' in lowercase.

But the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So maybe the entire filename is considered the type. So the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But then, what about filenames like 'doxyfile.txt'? The docstring says to check the type, which might be the extension. But this is ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to check if the filename ends with .doxyfile, but the docstring is written incorrectly. For example, if the filename is 'doxyfile', then the extension is empty, but maybe the user considers that as a valid case. Or maybe they want to check if the extension is .doxyfile, but the docstring says 'type' instead of 'extension'.

In the absence of more information, perhaps the safest approach is to check the extension. So using os.path.splitext to get the extension part and compare it to '.doxyfile' in lowercase.

But then, the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the extension, then the code would check if the extension is .doxyfile. However, the docstring says 'doxyfile' without the dot. So maybe the user intended to check if the extension is 'doxyfile' (without the dot), but in that case, the code would be:

def match(filename):
    parts = filename.split('.')
    if len(parts) == 0:
        return False
    return parts[-1].lower() == 'doxyfile'

But this would return True for 'doxyfile' (since split gives ['doxyfile'], parts[-1] is 'doxyfile'), and also for 'file.doxyfile'.

But what if the filename is 'file.doxyfile.txt'? Then split would give ['file', 'doxyfile', 'txt'], so parts[-1] is 'txt', which would return False.

So this approach checks if the last part of the filename (after the last dot) is 'doxyfile' in lowercase.

But the user's docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So maybe the 'type' refers to the entire filename. But that's not typical. So perhaps the user intended to check the extension.

But given that the function is named 'match', and the docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile', it's possible that the user wants to check if the filename is exactly 'doxyfile' in lowercase. So the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But that's very restrictive. However, given the wording, that's what it says.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension, regardless of the base name. So the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    _, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    return ext.lower() == 'doxyfile'

Wait, but os.path.splitext returns the extension including the dot. For example, 'file.doxyfile' would have ext as '.doxyfile', so lowercasing it would be '.doxyfile', which equals the desired value. But if the filename is 'doxyfile', then ext is '', so returns False. But the docstring says to return True if the type in lowercase is 'doxyfile'. So if the filename is 'doxyfile', then the type is 'doxyfile', so returns True. But with this code, it would return False.

So this suggests that the user wants to check if the entire filename (without any path) is 'doxyfile' in lowercase. So the code should compare the entire filename to 'doxyfile' after lowercasing.

But then, what about filenames like 'doxyfile.txt'? The docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile', so that would not match. So the function would return False.

But maybe the user intended to check the extension. However, the wording is not clear. Since the user provided the docstring, perhaps they made a mistake in the wording. For example, maybe they meant to check the extension, but wrote 'type' instead of 'extension'.

But given the current docstring, the correct code would be to check if the entire filename, when lowercased, equals 'doxyfile'. So the code is straightforward.

But I need to make sure. Let's think about possible test cases.

Test case 1: filename is 'doxyfile' → returns True.

Test case 2: filename is 'Doxyfile' → lower to 'doxyfile' → returns True.

Test case 3: filename is 'doxyfile.txt' → lower is 'doxyfile.txt' → not equal to 'doxyfile' → returns False.

Test case 4: filename is 'file.doxyfile' → lower is 'file.doxyfile' → not equal to 'doxyfile' → returns False.

So according to the current docstring, the function should return True only if the entire filename (case-insensitive) is exactly 'doxyfile'.

But that's very specific. However, given the wording, that's what the code should do.

So the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But maybe the user intended to check the extension. In that case, the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, for 'doxyfile', the extension is empty, so returns False. Which would contradict the docstring if the user intended that case to return True.

So which is correct? The user's docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the entire filename, then the first code is correct. If the type is the extension, then the second code is correct.

But the term 'type' is ambiguous. However, given that the function is named 'match', and the docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile', perhaps the user intended to check the extension. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the file's type as determined by its extension. So for example, a .doxyfile file is of type doxyfile.

In that case, the code should check if the extension is .doxyfile. So using os.path.splitext.

But then, the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So the type is 'doxyfile', which would be the extension. So the code would check if the extension is '.doxyfile' (lowercase).

So in that case, the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, if the filename is 'doxyfile', the extension is empty, so returns False. But perhaps the user considers that as a valid case. Maybe they want to check if the filename is 'doxyfile' or has a .doxyfile extension.

But the docstring doesn't mention that. It says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the extension, then the code should check if the extension is '.doxyfile'. But if the type is the entire filename, then check if it's 'doxyfile'.

But the user might have made a mistake in the docstring. For example, maybe they meant to check the extension, but wrote 'type' instead of 'extension'.

But since the user provided the docstring, I should follow it. So according to the docstring, the function should return True if the type (whatever that is) in lowercase is 'doxyfile'.

But what is the 'type' of a filename? It's unclear. However, given that the function is named 'match', and the docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile', perhaps the user is referring to the file's extension.

But again, without more context, it's ambiguous. However, considering that 'doxyfile' is a known configuration file for Doxygen, which has a .doxyfile extension, it's possible that the user wants to check for that extension.

But the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'", which might imply that the entire filename is considered the type. For example, if the filename is 'doxyfile', then its type is 'doxyfile'. But if the filename is 'file.doxyfile', then the type is 'doxyfile' (the extension). So perhaps the user wants to check if the extension is 'doxyfile'.

In that case, the code should check the extension. But the wording is confusing. Let me think about the possible correct answer.

The user's docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the extension, then the code should check if the extension is '.doxyfile' (lowercase). But if the type is the entire filename, then check if it's 'doxyfile'.

But perhaps the user intended to check the extension. So the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, if the filename is 'doxyfile', the extension is empty, so returns False. But maybe the user wants to consider that as a valid case. For example, if the filename is 'doxyfile', then the type is 'doxyfile' (without extension). But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to check if the filename ends with .doxyfile, but also allows for the filename to be exactly 'doxyfile'.

In that case, the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower().endswith('.doxyfile') or filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But that's making an assumption not stated in the docstring.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to check if the filename's extension is 'doxyfile', but if there's no extension, then it's considered as 'doxyfile'?

But that's not standard. For example, a file named 'doxyfile' would have no extension, so its type is not 'doxyfile'.

But given the ambiguity, I think the most likely scenario is that the user wants to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension. So using os.path.splitext to get the extension part and compare it to '.doxyfile' in lowercase.

So the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, for a filename like 'doxyfile', the extension is empty, so returns False. However, if the user intended to include that case, then the code should also check if the filename is exactly 'doxyfile' in lowercase.

But the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the entire filename, then the code is straightforward. But if the type is the extension, then the code is as above.

Since the user hasn't provided examples, I need to make a decision. Given that the function is named 'match', and the docstring mentions 'type', I think the most probable intention is to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension. So the code using os.path.splitext is better.

But maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant to check the extension. So the code should check if the extension is '.doxyfile'.

Therefore, the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    _, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    return ext.lower() == '.doxyfile'

But then, for a filename like 'doxyfile', the ext is '', so returns False. However, the docstring says to return True if the type in lowercase is 'doxyfile'. So if the type is the entire filename, then the code should be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But again, this is very restrictive. However, given the wording, this is what the docstring says.

But perhaps the user intended to check the extension. Let me think of possible scenarios where the function would be used. For example, if they are trying to determine if a file is a Doxyfile, which typically has the .doxyfile extension. So in that case, the code should check the extension.

But the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the extension, then the code should check if the extension is '.doxyfile'.

But the wording is not precise. Given that, perhaps the user intended to check the extension. So I'll proceed with that code.

But I need to make sure. Let me check the original function signature again. The function is called match, and the docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile'.

Another possibility: maybe the 'type' refers to the file's suffix, like the part after the last dot. So for example, 'file.doxyfile' would have type 'doxyfile', and 'doxyfile' would have type 'doxyfile'.

In that case, the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    parts = filename.split('.')
    if len(parts) == 0:
        return False
    return parts[-1].lower() == 'doxyfile'

This code splits the filename into parts by dots and checks if the last part is 'doxyfile' in lowercase. So for 'doxyfile', it returns True. For 'file.doxyfile', it returns True. For 'file.doxyfile.txt', it returns False.

This seems like a plausible approach. So the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    parts = filename.split('.')
    if not parts:
        return False
    return parts[-1].lower() == 'doxyfile'

But what if the filename is empty? Well, split would return an empty list, so parts is empty, returns False.

But this code would return True for 'doxyfile', 'Doxyfile', 'FILE.DOXYFILE', etc., as long as the last part is 'doxyfile' when lowercased.

So this seems to align with the docstring's wording. The docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the suffix after the last dot, then this code works.

But the user might have intended that. So I think this is the correct approach. So the code is as above.

So the final code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    parts = filename.split('.')
    if not parts:
        return False
    return parts[-1].lower() == 'doxyfile'

But what about filenames like 'doxyfile.txt'? The last part is 'txt', so returns False. Which is correct if the type is the suffix.

But if the user wants to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension, then the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, for 'doxyfile', the extension is empty, so returns False. Which might not be desired.

So which is correct? The user's wording is ambiguous. However, given that the function is supposed to return True if the type in lowercase is 'doxyfile', and assuming that the 'type' refers to the file extension, then the code should check for the extension. But if the 'type' refers to the entire filename, then compare directly.

But since the function is called 'match', and the docstring says "type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'", I think the most probable scenario is that the user wants to check if the file has a .doxyfile extension. So the code using os.path.splitext is better.

But the user's docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the extension, then the code should check if the extension is '.doxyfile' in lowercase. So the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, for a filename like 'doxyfile', the extension is empty, so returns False. However, if the user considers that as a valid case, then the code should also check if the filename is exactly 'doxyfile'.

So combining both possibilities:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    filename_lower = filename.lower()
    return filename_lower == 'doxyfile' or filename_lower.endswith('.doxyfile')

But this is making an assumption not stated in the docstring. However, it's possible that the user wants to match both cases.

But the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the entire filename, then it's just comparing to 'doxyfile'. If the type is the extension, then comparing to '.doxyfile'.

But the wording is not clear. Given that, perhaps the user intended to check the extension. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

In the absence of more information, I think the safest approach is to check if the extension is '.doxyfile', as that's the standard way to check file types. So the code using os.path.splitext.

But the user's docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the extension, then the code should check if the extension is '.doxyfile'.

So the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, the function would return True for 'file.doxyfile', 'File.Doxyfile', etc.

But the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the extension, then this code is correct.

But if the user intended to check if the entire filename is 'doxyfile', then the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But again, this is ambiguous.

Since the user hasn't provided examples, I need to choose based on the wording. The docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the entire filename, then the code is straightforward. Otherwise, if the type is the extension, then the code is different.

But given that the function is named 'match', and the docstring says "type of the given filename", I think the user might have intended to check the extension. However, the wording is not precise.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the file's type as determined by its name, not the extension. For example, if the filename is 'doxyfile', then the type is 'doxyfile'.

In that case, the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But that's very restrictive. However, given the wording, it's possible.

But I'm not sure. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended to check the extension. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.

But since the user provided the function signature and docstring, and the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'", I think the correct interpretation is that the entire filename is considered the type. So the code should return True if the filename, when lowercased, equals 'doxyfile'.

So the code would be:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    return filename.lower() == 'doxyfile'

But then, what about filenames like 'doxyfile.txt'? The docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile', so that would not match.

But maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring and meant to check the extension. In that case, the code using os.path.splitext.

But since the user hasn't clarified, I have to make a choice. Given that the function is called 'match', and the docstring says to check if the type is 'doxyfile', I think the most likely correct code is to check the extension. So using os.path.splitext.

But the docstring says "the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'". So if the type is the extension, then the code should check if the extension is '.doxyfile' in lowercase.

Therefore, the code would be:

import os

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    ext = os.path.splitext(filename)[1].lower()
    return ext == '.doxyfile'

But then, for a filename like 'doxyfile', the extension is empty, so returns False. However, if the user considers that as a valid case, then the code should also check if the filename is exactly 'doxyfile'.

But the docstring doesn't mention that. So perhaps the user intended to check the extension.

In conclusion, I think the correct code is to check if the extension is '.doxyfile' in lowercase. So the code using os.path.splitext.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me test some cases.

Case 1: filename is 'doxyfile' → splitext gives ('doxyfile', '') → ext is '' → returns False. But according to the docstring, if the type is 'doxyfile', then this should return True. So this code would not handle that case.

But if the user considers that a file without an extension has type 'doxyfile' if the name is 'doxyfile', then the code should check both cases.

So perhaps the correct code is:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    parts = filename.split('.')
    if not parts:
        return False
    return parts[-1].lower() == 'doxyfile'

This code would return True for 'doxyfile', 'Doxyfile', 'file.doxyfile', etc.

For example:

filename = 'doxyfile' → parts is ['doxyfile'] → parts[-1] is 'doxyfile' → lower is 'doxyfile' → return True.

filename = 'file.doxyfile' → parts is ['file', 'doxyfile'] → parts[-1] is 'doxyfile' → return True.

filename = 'file.doxyfile.txt' → parts is ['file', 'doxyfile', 'txt'] → parts[-1] is 'txt' → return False.

filename = 'Doxyfile' → parts is ['Doxyfile'] → lower is 'doxyfile' → return True.

This seems to align with the docstring's wording. So the code is:

def match(filename):
    """
    Check if the type of the given filename is 'doxyfile'

    Args:
        filename: filename to be check
    Returns:
        Return True if the type of the given filename in lower case is 'doxyfile'
    """
    parts = filename.split('.')
    if not parts:
        return False
    return parts[-1].lower() == 'doxyfile'

But what if the filename is empty? Well, split would return an empty list, so parts is empty, returns False.

This code seems to fit the docstring's description. So I'll go with this code.
