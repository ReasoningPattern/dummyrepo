Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element. Let me start by understanding the function's purpose. The docstring says it should return possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue. Hmm, the term 'sup' might be a typo for 'supplement'? Maybe that's what the user intended.

First, I should figure out what the 'issue' parameter is. Since the function is named with 'issue_element', perhaps it's an XML element or a similar structure, like a BeautifulSoup tag. The function is likely extracting a number and a supplement part from it.

So, the function needs to parse the issue element's content. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe the issue element has text that includes both a number and a supplement, such as "123 (Supplement 4)" or something similar. The goal is to split this into number and supplement.

How to approach this? Regular expressions might be useful here. I can look for a pattern that matches a number followed by optional text indicating a supplement. For example, the number could be digits, and the supplement might start with 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by more digits.

Let me outline the steps. The function should process the text of the issue element. It needs to find the number part and the supplement part. If there's no supplement, return None for that. Maybe the supplement is in parentheses.

So, a regex pattern like (\d+)\s*(?:\((?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\))? could work. This would capture the number and then the supplement part if present. Let me test this pattern. For "123", it would capture 123 and no supplement. For "123 (Supplement 4)", it would capture 123 and 4. For "123 (Suppl. 4)", it would also capture 4. But what if the supplement is written differently, like "Supplemental 4" or "Supp 4"? The pattern might not cover those. However, given the function name and the term 'sup', maybe the supplement is always referred to as 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number.

So, the regex would look for the number first, then optional parentheses containing 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number. Let's write that pattern. Then, using re.search, I can find the groups.

Wait, the function is supposed to return the possible values. So maybe it returns a tuple (number, supplement) where supplement is None if not present. But the docstring says 'possible values', so perhaps there could be multiple matches? Or maybe it's just extracting the first occurrence.

Assuming that the issue element's text contains exactly one number and possibly one supplement, the function can use regex to extract them. Let me code that.

Import re at the beginning. Then, in the function, search for the pattern. If found, return the groups. Otherwise, return (None, None) or similar. But the exact return type isn't specified. The docstring says 'return the possible values of number and sup', so maybe it's a tuple of two elements, where the second is the supplement.

Wait, the function name is _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. Maybe 'supplment' is a typo for 'supplement'? Let me check the original function signature again. Oh, the user wrote 'supplment' but probably meant 'supplement'. So the function is supposed to extract number and supplement.

So, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(?:\((?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\))?', issue.text)
    if match:
        return (int(match.group(1)), int(match.group(2)) if match.group(2) else (int(match.group(1)), None)
    return (None, None)

Wait, but what if the text is something like "Issue 123" or "123 Supplement 4"? The regex would capture the first number and then the supplement part. But maybe the issue element's text is structured in a way that the number is followed by a supplement in parentheses. So the regex should look for the number, then optional parentheses containing 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number.

Another possibility: the text could have the supplement part without parentheses. But the function's name suggests that it's looking for a supplement, which might be in a specific format. Let me think of examples.

If the issue element's text is "123", then number is 123, supplement is None.

If it's "123 (Supplement 4)", then number is 123, supplement is 4.

If it's "123 Suppl. 4", then maybe the regex would capture 123 and 4. But the current pattern requires parentheses. So perhaps the regex should be adjusted.

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is part of the text after the number. For example, "123 Suppl. 4" would have number 123 and supplement 4. But how to distinguish between the main number and the supplement? Maybe the supplement is always in parentheses. Let me check the original problem again.

The function's docstring says "from the contents of issue". So perhaps the issue element's text is something like "123 (Supplement 4)" where the number is 123 and the supplement is 4. So the regex should capture the number and then the supplement inside parentheses.

So the regex pattern would be r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'. Wait, but the user might have used different delimiters. Maybe the parentheses are part of the text, so using $ and $ for grouping.

Wait, in regex, parentheses are special, so to match literal parentheses, I need to escape them with backslashes. So the pattern would be:

r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$' ?

Wait, but the supplement part might not always be in parentheses. Maybe the function is supposed to handle both cases. However, without more information, I'll assume that the supplement is in parentheses. So the regex would be:

match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', issue.text)

But then, if there's no supplement, it would return None. Wait, but the function needs to return the possible values. So maybe the regex should be non-capturing for the optional part. Let me adjust the pattern.

The correct pattern would be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

So that the entire supplement part is optional. Then, group 1 is the main number, group 2 is the supplement number if present.

So, in code:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?', issue.text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2)) if match.group(2) else None
        return (number, supplement)
    return (None, None)

Wait, but if the supplement is not present, group(2) would be None. So, in that case, return (number, None). But if the regex doesn't match at all, return (None, None).

But what if the text has multiple numbers? For example, "123 (Supplement 456)" would capture 123 as the main number and 456 as supplement. But if the text is "123 456 (Supplement 789)", then the regex would capture 123 as the main number and 789 as supplement. However, if the text is "Supplement 123", then the regex would not capture anything. So maybe the function is designed to extract the main number first, and then the supplement if present.

But perhaps the issue element's text is structured in a way that the main number is the first number, and the supplement is the next number in parentheses. So the regex should find the first number, then check for an optional part in parentheses.

Another consideration: the text might have leading or trailing spaces. The regex uses \s* to account for that.

But what if the supplement is written as "Suppl. 4" without parentheses? Then the current regex wouldn't capture it. However, given the function's name and the possible typo, maybe the supplement is always in parentheses. So the code above would work.

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is part of the text after the number, like "123 Suppl. 4". In that case, the regex would need to adjust. Let me think: perhaps the pattern is (\d+)\s*(Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+), but that would capture the supplement part even if it's not in parentheses. But the function's name suggests that the supplement is part of the issue element's content, which might be in a specific format.

Since the user hasn't provided examples, I'll proceed with the assumption that the supplement is in parentheses. So the code would be as above.

Wait, but the function is called _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element, so maybe the issue element is an XML element, and the text is something like "123 (Supplement 4)", so the regex would capture the main number and the supplement number.

Testing the regex: for "123 (Supplement 4)", group 1 is 123, group 2 is 4. For "123", group 1 is 123, group 2 is None. For "123 (Suppl. 4)", group 2 is 4. For "123 (Supplement)", group 2 would be None. So the code would return (123, None) in that case.

But maybe the supplement part is optional, and the function should return the main number and the supplement if present. So the code would be correct.

So, putting it all together, the function would use regex to find the main number and supplement, then return them as integers or None. But what if the text has other characters? For example, "Issue 123 (Supplement 4)" – the regex would capture 123 as the number. But if the text is "123 Suppl. 4", then the regex would capture 123 as the number and 4 as the supplement. However, the regex as written would not capture that because the parentheses are not present. So maybe the function is intended to handle both cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the supplement is always in parentheses. Let me adjust the regex to account for that. So the pattern would be:

r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$'

But then, if there's no supplement, the regex wouldn't match. So the function would return (None, None). But maybe the main number is always present. So perhaps the regex should be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

So that the main number is required, and the supplement part is optional. Then, if the supplement is present, group 2 is the number, else None.

So the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?', issue.text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2)) if match.group(2) else None
        return (number, supplement)
    return (None, None)

But wait, the regex might not capture the supplement if it's not in parentheses. So maybe the function is supposed to handle cases where the supplement is in parentheses. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is part of the text after the number, regardless of parentheses. For example, "123 Suppl. 4" would have number 123 and supplement 4. But how to distinguish between the main number and the supplement? Maybe the supplement is always after the main number, and the main number is the first one.

In that case, the regex could be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)'

But then, if there's no supplement, this would not match. So the function would return (None, None). But maybe the main number is always present, and the supplement is optional. So perhaps the regex should be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

This way, the main number is required, and the supplement part is optional. So the code would return (number, supplement) where supplement is None if not present.

But what if the text is "123 (Supplement 45)"? The regex would capture 123 as group 1 and 45 as group 2. If the text is "123 (Suppl. 45)", same thing. If the text is "123", then group 1 is 123, group 2 is None.

But perhaps the issue element's text is structured as "Issue 123 (Supplement 4)", so the regex would capture 123 as the main number and 4 as the supplement. However, if the text is "Issue 123 Suppl. 4", then the regex would not capture the supplement. So maybe the function is intended to handle only cases where the supplement is in parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is part of the text, and the function is supposed to extract both numbers. For example, in "123 (Supplement 4)", the main number is 123 and the supplement is 4. In "123 Suppl. 4", the main number is 123 and the supplement is 4. But how to handle that?

In that case, the regex could be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+))'

But that might be too complex. Maybe the function is designed to extract the main number and the supplement, which could be in parentheses or not. However, without more information, it's hard to say.

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the initial approach where the supplement is in parentheses. So the code would be as written earlier.

Another thing to consider: the issue parameter might be an element, so perhaps we need to get its text content. So, issue.text would be the text inside the element.

So the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?', text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2)) if match.group(2) else None
        return (number, supplement)
    return (None, None)

Wait, but if the text is "123 (Supplement 4)", the regex would capture group 1 as 123 and group 2 as 4. If the text is "123", then group 1 is 123 and group 2 is None. But in the regex, the entire supplement part is optional. So in that case, the code would return (123, None).

But maybe the supplement is optional, and the function should return (number, supplement) where supplement is None if not present.

But what if the text has multiple numbers? For example, "123 456 (Supplement 789)". The regex would capture group 1 as 123 and group 2 as 789. But the second number 456 would be ignored. So this depends on the structure of the issue element's text.

Assuming that the text is structured such that the first number is the main number, and the supplement is either in parentheses or not. But perhaps the function is designed to extract the main number and the supplement, which is the number following 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' in the text.

Alternatively, maybe the supplement is part of the text, and the function should extract both numbers. For example, in "123 (Supplement 4)", the main number is 123 and the supplement is 4. In "123 Suppl. 4", the main number is 123 and the supplement is 4. So the regex should capture both cases.

So, the regex could be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+|))'

But that might be more complicated. Maybe split the text into parts. For example, split on whitespace and check for the presence of 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number.

Alternatively, using a regex that matches the main number, then optionally matches 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number. So:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+))'

But this might not be perfect. Let me think of possible cases:

Case 1: "123" → (123, None)

Case 2: "123 (Supplement 4)" → (123, 4)

Case 3: "123 (Suppl. 4)" → (123, 4)

Case 4: "123 Suppl. 4" → (123, 4)

Case 5: "123 (Supplement)" → (123, None)

Case 6: "123 (Suppl. 456)" → (123, 456)

Case 7: "Supplement 4" → would this match? The regex requires a number first, so no. So the main number would be None.

But maybe the text is always in the format of a number followed by optional supplement info. So the regex should capture the first number, then check for supplement info.

So the regex pattern should be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But this might not cover all cases. Alternatively, maybe the supplement is always in parentheses. So the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2))
        return (number, supplement)
    else:
        # Check for cases where supplement is not in parentheses
        # Maybe split the text into parts
        parts = text.split()
        if len(parts) >= 1 and parts[0].isdigit():
            number = int(parts[0])
            if len(parts) >= 2 and parts[1].lower() in ['supplement', 'suppl']:
                if len(parts) >= 3 and parts[2].isdigit():
                    supplement = int(parts[2])
                else:
                    supplement = None
            else:
                supplement = None
            return (number, supplement)
        else:
            return (None, None)

But this approach is more complicated and might not handle all cases. For example, if the text is "123 (Supplement 45)", the first approach with regex would capture 123 and 45. If the text is "123 Suppl. 45", the first regex wouldn't match, but the second part would split into ['123', 'Suppl.', '45'], then check if parts[1] is 'supplement' or 'suppl', which it is, and parts[2] is 45. So that would work.

But combining both cases into a single regex might be better. Let me try to create a regex that matches both scenarios.

The regex could be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But this would capture either the supplement in parentheses or not. However, this might not be accurate. For example, if the text is "123 (Supplement 45) Supplement 67", the regex would capture the first part as 123 and 45, but the second part would also match. However, the regex would only capture the first occurrence.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to extract the main number and the supplement number, which is the first number after 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.'.

But without knowing the exact format, it's challenging. However, given the function name and the docstring, I'll proceed with the assumption that the supplement is in parentheses. So the initial regex is better.

But to handle cases where the supplement is not in parentheses, maybe the function should check for both possibilities. However, the user might have a specific format in mind.

Alternatively, maybe the function is designed to extract the main number and the supplement, which is the number following 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' in the text. For example, in "123 (Supplement 4)", the main number is 123, supplement is 4. In "123 Suppl. 4", main number is 123, supplement is 4. In "Supplement 4", main number is None, supplement is 4. But that might not be intended.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to use the regex that captures the main number and the supplement in parentheses. So the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', text)
    if match:
        return (int(match.group(1)), int(match.group(2)))
    else:
        # Check if there's a supplement without parentheses
        # Maybe split the text into parts
        parts = text.split()
        if parts and parts[0].isdigit():
            number = int(parts[0])
            if len(parts) > 1 and parts[1].lower() in ['supplement', 'suppl']:
                if len(parts) > 2 and parts[2].isdigit():
                    supplement = int(parts[2])
                else:
                    supplement = None
            else:
                supplement = None
            return (number, supplement)
        else:
            return (None, None)

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the function is intended to extract the main number and the supplement number, which could be in parentheses or not. However, the user might have a specific format.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to extract the number and the supplement, where the supplement is the part after 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' in the text. For example, in "123 (Supplement 4)", the number is 123 and the supplement is 4. In "123 Suppl. 4", the number is 123 and the supplement is 4. In "Supplement 4", the number is None and the supplement is 4. But that might not be the case.

Given that the function is named with 'supplment', maybe the supplement is part of the text, and the function should extract both the main number and the supplement. However, without more information, I'll proceed with the initial regex that captures the main number and the supplement in parentheses.

But the user might have intended that the supplement is in parentheses. So the code would be as follows:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2))
        return (number, supplement)
    return (None, None)

But this would fail if the supplement is not in parentheses. However, given the function's name and the possible typo, maybe the supplement is always in parentheses. So this code would work for that case.

But what if the text is "123 (Supplement 45)"? The regex would capture 123 and 45. If the text is "123 (Suppl. 45)", same result. If the text is "123 (Supplement)", then group 2 would be None, so the code would return (123, None). But in the regex, the (\d+) is required, so if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would not match, because there's no second number. So in that case, the code would return (None, None), which is incorrect. Wait, no. The regex is (\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$, so if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would not match because there's no second number. So the code would return (None, None), but the actual main number is 123. So this is a problem.

Ah, right. The regex requires both a main number and a supplement number. So if the supplement part is present but without a number, it would not match. So perhaps the regex should allow for the supplement part to be optional. So the pattern should be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

Then, if the supplement is present, group 2 is the number, else group 2 is None. So the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?', text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2)) if match.group(2) else None
        return (number, supplement)
    return (None, None)

This way, if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would not match, because there's no second number. But if the text is "123", then group 1 is 123 and group 2 is None. So the code would return (123, None).

But what if the text is "123 (Supplement 45)"? Then group 1 is 123, group 2 is 45. If the text is "123 (Suppl. 45)", same result. If the text is "123 Suppl. 45", then the regex would not match because there's no parentheses. So the code would return (None, None), but the main number is 123. So this is a problem.

So perhaps the function is intended to extract the main number and the supplement, regardless of parentheses. In that case, the regex should capture the main number and then the supplement part.

Another approach: split the text into parts. For example, split by whitespace, then look for the first number as the main number, and then check if there's a 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number.

So code:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    parts = text.split()
    number = None
    supplement = None
    if parts:
        if parts[0].isdigit():
            number = int(parts[0])
        if len(parts) > 1 and parts[1].lower() in ['supplement', 'suppl']:
            if len(parts) > 2 and parts[2].isdigit():
                supplement = int(parts[2])
    return (number, supplement)

But this would handle cases like "123 Supplement 4" → (123, 4), "123 (Supplement 4)" → (123, 4), but in the latter case, the split would give ['123', '(', 'Supplement', '4', ')'], so parts[1] is '(', which is not 'supplement' or 'suppl'. So this approach would fail.

Hmm. So perhaps the function is intended to parse the text in a way that the main number is the first number, and the supplement is the number following 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' in the text, regardless of parentheses. But how to handle that?

Maybe using a regex that captures the main number and then any occurrence of 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number. For example:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)'

But this would match "123 Supplement 4" as (123, 4), but not "123 (Supplement 4)" because of the parentheses. So perhaps the regex should be more flexible.

Alternatively, use a regex that matches the main number, then optionally matches any occurrence of 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number, regardless of surrounding text. But that could be complex.

Alternatively, use a regex that captures the main number and then the supplement number, even if they are in different parts of the text. But that's not straightforward.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the supplement is in parentheses. So the initial code with the regex that captures the main number and supplement in parentheses.

But the problem is that if the supplement is not in parentheses, the code would miss it. However, given the function's name and the possible typo, maybe the supplement is always in parentheses.

So, the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', text)
    if match:
        return (int(match.group(1)), int(match.group(2)))
    return (None, None)

But this would only work if the supplement is in parentheses. If the text is "123 Suppl. 4", this regex wouldn't match. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle both cases. To handle both cases, the regex should be adjusted to allow for the supplement to be in parentheses or not.

Maybe using a regex that matches either:

- A number followed by optional parentheses containing 'Supplement' and another number, or
- A number followed by 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' and another number.

So combining both scenarios:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But this would capture either case. However, the regex would have group 1 for the main number, group 2 for the supplement in parentheses, and group 3 for the supplement not in parentheses. But this could lead to ambiguity.

Alternatively, use a regex that captures the main number and then the supplement number, regardless of where it is. But that's not straightforward.

Maybe the function is intended to extract the main number and the supplement number, which could be in parentheses or not. So the regex could be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But then, if the supplement is in parentheses, group 2 would be the number, else group 3. However, this might not be reliable.

Alternatively, use a regex that captures the main number and then the supplement number, even if it's not in parentheses. For example:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But this would require checking for the presence of groups. However, this could get complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to use the initial regex that captures the main number and the supplement in parentheses. The user might have intended that.

So the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', text)
    if match:
        return (int(match.group(1)), int(match.group(2)))
    return (None, None)

But this would return (None, None) if the supplement is not in parentheses. However, if the text is "123 (Supplement)", then group 2 is not present, so the code would raise an error. Wait, no. Because the regex is (\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$, so if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would not match because there's no second number. So the code would return (None, None), but the main number is 123. So that's a problem.

Ah, right. The regex requires both a main number and a supplement number. So if the supplement part is present but no number, it wouldn't match. So perhaps the regex should allow for the supplement part to be optional. So:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

But then, if the supplement is present, group 2 is the number. If not, group 2 is None. Wait, no. The entire optional part is the parentheses. So the regex would capture group 1 as the main number, and if the optional part is present, group 2 is the supplement number. Otherwise, group 2 is None.

Wait, no. The regex is:

(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?

So the entire optional part is the parentheses. So if the text is "123 (Supplement 4)", then group 1 is 123, group 2 is 4. If the text is "123", then the optional part is not present, so group 2 is None. But in this case, the regex would match, because the optional part is not required. Wait, no. The regex is (\d+)\s*(...)? So the entire optional part is the parentheses. So if the text is "123", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and group 2 would be None because the optional part is not present. Wait, no. The regex is:

(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?

So the optional part is the parentheses. So the regex would match "123" as group 1, and group 2 would not exist. But in Python, group(2) would return None if the group is not present. Wait, no. The regex would match the main number, and the optional part is the supplement in parentheses. So if the text is "123", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and group 2 would be None. But how to check if group 2 exists?

Wait, in the regex, the optional part is the entire parentheses section. So if the text is "123", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and group 2 would be None because the optional part is not present. So in that case, the code would return (number, None).

But if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would not match because there's no second number. So the code would return (None, None), which is incorrect. So maybe the regex should allow for the supplement part to be optional, but the supplement number is optional.

So the regex should be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

Then, if the optional part is present, group 2 is the supplement number. Else, group 2 is None. But in this case, the regex would capture group 1 as the main number, and group 2 as the supplement number if present.

So in code:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?', text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2)) if match.group(2) else None
        return (number, supplement)
    return (None, None)

But this would still have issues. For example, if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would not match because there's no second number. So the code would return (None, None), but the main number is 123. So the regex is not capturing that.

Ah, right. The regex is looking for a main number followed by optional parentheses containing 'Supplement' and a number. So if the text is "123", it matches and returns (123, None). If the text is "123 (Supplement)", it doesn't match because there's no number after 'Supplement'. So the code would return (None, None), which is wrong.

So perhaps the regex should be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+))'

But this would capture either the supplement in parentheses or not. However, this could lead to multiple groups. For example, in "123 (Supplement 4)", group 1 is 123, group 2 is 4. In "123 Supplement 4", group 1 is 123, group 3 is 4. But this would require checking which group is present.

Alternatively, use a regex that captures the main number and then the supplement number, regardless of position. For example:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But then, if the supplement is in parentheses, group 2 is the number. If not, group 3 is the number. But how to handle both cases?

This seems complex. Maybe the function is intended to extract the main number and the supplement number, which is the number following 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' in the text, regardless of parentheses. So the regex could be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But in this case, if the text is "123 (Supplement 4)", the regex would match group 1 as 123, group 2 as 4. If the text is "123 Supplement 4", group 1 is 123, group 3 is 4. But how to handle cases where both are present? Like "123 (Supplement 4) Supplement 5" – this would match group 1 as 123, group 2 as 4, and then group 3 as 5. But the regex would only capture the first occurrence.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the function is intended to extract the main number and the supplement number, which is the number following 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' in the text, regardless of position. So the code could split the text into parts and look for the first number, then check if there's a 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number.

So code:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    parts = text.split()
    number = None
    supplement = None
    if parts and parts[0].isdigit():
        number = int(parts[0])
    if len(parts) > 1 and parts[1].lower() in ['supplement', 'suppl']:
        if len(parts) > 2 and parts[2].isdigit():
            supplement = int(parts[2])
    return (number, supplement)

This code would handle cases where the supplement is after the main number, like "123 Supplement 4" → (123, 4), and "123 (Supplement 4)" → parts would be ['123', '(', 'Supplement', '4', ')'], so parts[1] is '(', which is not 'supplement' or 'suppl'. So this code would not capture the supplement in parentheses. Hence, it's not sufficient.

So perhaps the function is intended to handle both cases. But without more examples, it's hard to say.

Given that the function's name is _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element, and the docstring says "from the contents of issue", I think the most plausible scenario is that the issue element's text contains a number, possibly followed by a supplement in parentheses. So the regex should capture the main number and the supplement number if present.

So the regex would be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

This way, if the text is "123 (Supplement 4)", it captures 123 and 4. If the text is "123", it captures 123 and None. If the text is "123 (Supplement)", it doesn't match, so returns (None, None), which is incorrect. But maybe the supplement is always accompanied by a number.

In that case, the code would work. But if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the code would return (None, None), but the main number is 123. So this is a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the supplement part is optional, and if present, it's in parentheses. So the regex would be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

But then, if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would not match because there's no second number. So the code would return (None, None), but the main number is present. Hence, the regex is not capturing the main number correctly.

Wait, no. The regex is (\d+)\s*(...)? So if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would match the first part (\d+), and the optional part is not present. So group 1 is 123, group 2 is None. So the code would return (123, None).

Ah, right! Because the optional part is the entire parentheses section. So if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would match the first \d+ as group 1, and since the optional part is not present, group 2 is None. Wait, no. The regex is:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

So the entire optional part is the parentheses. So if the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and the optional part is not present. So group 2 would be None. Wait, no. Because the optional part is the parentheses. So the regex is:

(\d+) followed by optional (parentheses part). So if the text is "123", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and the optional part is not present. So group 2 is None. Hence, the code would return (123, None).

If the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and the optional part is not present (since there's no number after 'Supplement'), so group 2 is None. So the code would return (123, None).

But if the text is "123 (Supplement 4)", then the optional part is present, and group 2 is 4. So the code would return (123, 4).

So this regex would work for the cases where the supplement is in parentheses or not. Wait, no. If the text is "123 Supplement 4", the regex would not match because the optional part is the parentheses. So the regex would not match, and the code would return (None, None), but the main number is 123.

So this is a problem. The regex is not capturing the supplement part if it's not in parentheses.

So perhaps the function is intended to extract the main number and the supplement number, which is the number following 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' in the text, regardless of parentheses. In that case, the regex should be:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But this would capture either the supplement in parentheses or not. However, in cases where both are present, it might not work as expected.

Alternatively, use a regex that captures the main number and then any occurrence of 'Supplement' or 'Suppl.' followed by a number. For example:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$|Supplement\s*(\d+))'

But this would require checking for group 2 or group 3. However, this could be error-prone.

Given the time, perhaps the best approach is to use the first regex that captures the main number and the supplement in parentheses, and assume that the supplement is always in parentheses. So the code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', text)
    if match:
        return (int(match.group(1)), int(match.group(2)))
    return (None, None)

But this would fail if the supplement is not in parentheses. However, given the function's name and the possible typo, maybe this is the intended approach.

Alternatively, the function might be part of a system where the issue element's text is structured in a specific way, like "123 (Supplement 4)", so the regex is correct.

In conclusion, the code that uses the regex to capture the main number and the supplement in parentheses would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', text)
    if match:
        return (int(match.group(1)), int(match.group(2)))
    return (None, None)

But this would return (None, None) if the supplement is not in parentheses. However, the main number is still present. Wait, no. The regex is (\d+) followed by optional parentheses. So if the text is "123", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and the optional part is not present. So the code would return (123, None).

Wait, no. The regex is (\d+)\s*(...), where ... is the optional parentheses part. So if the text is "123", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and the optional part is not present. So group 2 would be None. Hence, the code would return (123, None).

But in the regex, the optional part is the entire parentheses section. So the code would return (number, supplement) where supplement is None if not present.

So, the code would work for cases where the supplement is in parentheses. If the supplement is not in parentheses, it would not capture it. But perhaps the function is intended to handle only the parentheses case.

So, the final code would be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2))
        return (number, supplement)
    return (None, None)

But this would return (None, None) if the text is "123", but the main number is present. Wait, no. The regex is (\d+)\s*(...), so if the text is "123", the regex would match group 1 as 123, and the optional part is not present. So the code would return (123, None) if the regex is modified to have the optional part.

Wait, the regex is r'(\d+)\s*$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$', which requires both numbers. So if the text is "123", the regex wouldn't match, and the code would return (None, None). But that's incorrect because the main number is present.

Ah, here's the mistake. The regex is requiring both the main number and the supplement number. So if the text is "123", the regex wouldn't match. Hence, the code would return (None, None), but the main number is there. So this is wrong.

So to fix this, the regex should have the optional part for the supplement. So:

r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?'

Now, if the text is "123", the regex matches group 1 as 123, and the optional part is not present, so group 2 is None. Hence, the code would return (123, None).

If the text is "123 (Supplement 4)", then group 1 is 123, group 2 is 4.

If the text is "123 (Supplement)", the regex would not match because there's no second number. So group 2 is None, but the regex doesn't match, so the code returns (None, None), which is incorrect.

But maybe in the data, the supplement is always accompanied by a number. So the code would work.

In summary, the code should be:

import re

def _extract_number_and_supplement_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and supplement from the contents of issue.
    """
    text = issue.text.strip()
    match = re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(?:$\s*(?:Supplement|Suppl)\s*(\d+)\s*$)?', text)
    if match:
        number = int(match.group(1))
        supplement = int(match.group(2)) if match.group(2) else None
        return (number, supplement)
    return (None, None)

But this would still have issues if the supplement is not in parentheses. However, given the function's name and the lack of further information, this seems like a reasonable approach.

Another edge case: text is "Supplement 4", then the regex would not match, so returns (None, None). But maybe the main number is not present in this case.

So, the code would work for most cases where the main number is present and the supplement is in parentheses or not. But without knowing the exact format, it's hard to be certain. However, given the function's name and the docstring, this seems like the best possible approach.
