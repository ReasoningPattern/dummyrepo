Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called format, and it takes sql and params as arguments. The return type is a tuple containing the formatted SQL and the parameters. The docstring says to convert sql using self._converter.convert.

Wait, the parameters are of type Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]. So params can be either a dictionary or a sequence. And the return type is a tuple where the first element is AnyStr, which I think refers to a string, maybe with some specific type like str or bytes. The second element is the same type as params, so it's either a dict or a sequence.

The function's purpose is to convert the sql using the converter. But how exactly? The docstring is a bit vague. Maybe the converter is a method that processes the SQL string and parameters. Let me think about possible implementations.

Perhaps the function is part of a class that has a _converter attribute. The _converter might have a convert method that takes sql and params. So the format method would call that convert method and return the result as a tuple. But the parameters need to be passed correctly. Wait, the function's parameters are sql and params, and the return is a tuple of the formatted sql and the params. So maybe the converter is supposed to process the sql and return the formatted version, while the params are kept as-is?

Alternatively, maybe the converter is used to format the parameters within the SQL. For example, if the SQL has placeholders, the converter might replace them with actual values. But the function's return type includes the params, so perhaps the formatted SQL is modified, and the params are adjusted accordingly?

Wait, the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert". So the function is likely to call the converter's convert method, passing sql and params. Then return the result of that conversion as a tuple. But what's the expected return type of self._converter.convert? The docstring says the return is a tuple of AnyStr and the params. So maybe the converter's convert method returns two values: the formatted SQL and the parameters. But the function's return type is Tuple[AnyStr, ...], so perhaps the format function is just a wrapper that calls the converter and returns the formatted SQL and the original params?

Wait, the function's parameters are sql and params. The return is a tuple where the first element is the formatted SQL, and the second is the params. So maybe the converter is used to process the SQL, and the params are passed through. But how does the converter interact with them? Maybe the converter is responsible for both converting the SQL and the parameters, but the function's return type suggests that the params are kept as they are. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the converter is used to format the SQL string, and the params are adjusted in some way. For example, if the SQL uses named placeholders, the converter might replace them with actual values, but the params are still needed for other purposes. But the docstring isn't clear on that.

Wait, the function's return type is a tuple of (AnyStr, Union[Dict, Sequence]). So the first element is the formatted SQL, and the second is the params. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the same params as they were passed in, but the SQL is modified. But then why is the params part of the return? Maybe the converter returns both the formatted SQL and the processed params. But the function's docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert", which implies that the params are part of the conversion process.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the converter is a class that has a convert method that takes sql and params and returns the formatted SQL and the params. Then the format function would just call that method and return the result. But the parameters are passed as either a dict or a sequence. So the code would be something like:

def format(self, sql, params):
    return self._converter.convert(sql, params)

But the return type is a tuple. So maybe the _converter.convert returns two values, and the format function returns them as a tuple. However, the parameters in the function's signature are of type Union[Dict, Sequence], and the return type's second element is the same. So perhaps the converter's convert method returns the formatted SQL and the params, but the function is supposed to return them as a tuple. Wait, but the function's name is format, which might imply that it's formatting the SQL, perhaps with parameters. Maybe the converter is a SQL formatter that also handles parameters. For example, if the SQL has placeholders like %s or named placeholders, the converter might replace them with the actual parameters. But the params are passed as either a dictionary or a sequence, and the function returns the formatted SQL and the params. So maybe the params are not modified, but the SQL is. But then why would the function return the params? Unless the converter is supposed to process the SQL and return the formatted version, and the params are kept as-is. But that seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that is used to format SQL queries, and the _converter is an object that can handle the conversion. For instance, if the SQL is a string with placeholders, the converter might format it with the parameters, but the params could be in a different format. However, the return type suggests that the formatted SQL is the first element, and the params are the second. So perhaps the function is designed to return both the formatted SQL and the original params, but the docstring says to convert sql using the converter. Maybe the converter is used to process the SQL, and the params are passed along. 

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the formatted SQL and the parameters in a specific format. For example, if the params are a dictionary, maybe the converter is supposed to format the SQL with the parameters, and return the formatted SQL and the params. But that would require the converter to handle the formatting. However, the function's parameters are sql and params, and the return is a tuple of the formatted sql and the params. So perhaps the format function is a wrapper that calls the converter's convert method, which takes sql and params and returns the formatted sql and the params. But that seems redundant. 

Alternatively, maybe the converter is supposed to process the SQL and the params, and the format function returns the processed SQL and the processed params. But the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert", which might imply that the params are not converted, but just passed along. 

Hmm, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a converter, and the format method is supposed to apply the converter to the SQL string, while keeping the params as they are. So the code would be:

def format(self, sql, params):
    formatted_sql, _ = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return formatted_sql, params

But then the docstring says to convert sql using the converter, and the return is the formatted sql and the params. However, the second element of the return is the same as the input params. Maybe the converter is supposed to return the formatted sql and the params, but the function is just passing them through. 

Alternatively, maybe the converter is supposed to process the SQL and the params, and the function returns the formatted SQL and the processed params. But the docstring isn't clear. 

Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll have to make an assumption. The most straightforward approach is that the format method calls self._converter.convert with sql and params, and returns the result as a tuple. However, the _converter.convert might return a single value or multiple. But according to the return type, it's a tuple of two elements: the first is AnyStr (probably a string), and the second is the same type as params. 

So perhaps the _converter.convert method returns two values: the formatted SQL and the params. But that seems odd. Maybe the _converter is a formatter that takes the SQL and params and returns the formatted SQL, and the params are kept as-is. But then the return type would be (AnyStr, ...), but the second element is the same as the input params. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the formatted SQL and the params in a specific format, like a tuple. But without more info, I'll proceed with the assumption that the _converter.convert method is called with sql and params, and the result is a tuple where the first element is the formatted SQL and the second is the params. 

So the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql, processed_params = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return formatted_sql, processed_params

But wait, the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and the params type. So maybe the _converter.convert returns the formatted SQL and the processed params. However, the original params are passed as the second argument. 

Alternatively, maybe the _converter.convert is a function that takes sql and params and returns the formatted SQL. Then the function would return (formatted_sql, params). But that's just passing params through. 

In that case, the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return formatted_sql, params

But the return type is a tuple with two elements. So the _converter.convert must return a single value, and the function returns that along with the original params. But the return type annotation shows a tuple of two elements. 

Wait, the return type is Tuple[AnyStr, ...], but the second element is Union[Dict, Sequence]. So the function returns two elements: the first is a string (AnyStr), and the second is either a dict or a sequence. 

Therefore, the _converter.convert must return two values. So the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql, processed_params = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return formatted_sql, processed_params

But the user's docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert", which might imply that the params are not converted, but just passed along. However, the return type includes the params as the second element. 

Alternatively, maybe the _converter.convert is a method that returns the formatted SQL and the params. So the format function is just a wrapper. 

But without knowing the exact behavior of _converter.convert, I have to make the code as per the given signatures. So the function would call self._converter.convert with sql and params, and return the result as a tuple. 

Wait, but the return type of the function is a tuple where the first element is AnyStr and the second is the same as params. So perhaps the _converter.convert returns a tuple of (formatted_sql, params). But that would mean the function is just returning the result of the converter's convert method. 

But then why is the function named format? Maybe the converter is supposed to format the SQL and return the formatted SQL and the params. 

So the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    return self._converter.convert(sql, params)

But the return type annotation shows a tuple of two elements. Wait, the return type is Tuple[AnyStr, ...], but the second element is Union[Dict, Sequence]. So the function returns a tuple with two elements: the first is a string, the second is either a dict or a sequence. 

Therefore, the _converter.convert must return two values. So the code would be as I wrote earlier. 

But the user hasn't provided any details about what the converter does. So the code is just a wrapper. 

So the final code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql, processed_params = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return formatted_sql, processed_params

But I need to make sure that the return type matches. The function returns a tuple with two elements: the first is AnyStr (so a string), and the second is the same type as params. 

Alternatively, maybe the _converter.convert returns a single value, and the function returns that as the first element and the original params as the second. But that would require the _converter.convert to return a single value, which would be the formatted SQL. 

But the return type is a tuple of two elements. So the function must return two elements. Therefore, the code should assume that self._converter.convert returns two elements. 

So the code is as above. However, the user's docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert", which might mean that the params are not converted, but the SQL is. So maybe the converter is supposed to process the SQL, and the params are passed as-is. 

In that case, the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return formatted_sql, params

But then the return type would be a tuple of (AnyStr, Union[Dict, Sequence]), which matches the given return type. 

But the problem is that the _converter.convert's return type isn't specified. However, the user's function signature says that the return is a tuple of AnyStr and the params type. So the code would have to return those two elements. 

So perhaps the _converter.convert is a method that returns the formatted SQL and the params. But that's just a guess. 

In any case, the code should be written to call self._converter.convert with the given sql and params, and return the result as a tuple. 

But the function's parameters are sql and params, and the return is a tuple of formatted sql and params. So the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    result = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return (result[0], params) if isinstance(result, tuple) else (result, params)

Wait, but that's assuming that the converter returns a single value or a tuple. However, the return type annotation suggests that it's a tuple of two elements. So maybe the _converter.convert returns a tuple, and the function returns that tuple. 

But the docstring says to convert sql using the converter, so perhaps the converter is supposed to process the SQL and return the formatted SQL, and the params are kept as-is. 

In that case, the function would return (formatted_sql, params). 

So the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return (formatted_sql, params)

But the return type is a tuple of two elements. So the first element is AnyStr, the second is the same as params. 

But then, what does self._converter.convert return? If it returns a string, then the first element is that string, and the second is the original params. 

But the user's function signature says the return is a tuple, so maybe the converter returns a tuple. 

Alternatively, maybe the converter is a function that returns the formatted SQL and the processed params. 

In the absence of more information, I think the most straightforward code is to call self._converter.convert with sql and params, and return the result as a tuple. However, the function's return type is a tuple of two elements, so the code should return a tuple. 

Wait, the function's return type is Tuple[AnyStr, ...], but the second element is the same as params. So the code should return a tuple where the first element is the formatted SQL (a string), and the second is the params. 

Therefore, the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return (formatted_sql, params)

But then, the return type is a tuple of (AnyStr, params type). However, the _converter.convert might return a tuple. 

Alternatively, maybe the _converter.convert returns a single value, and the function returns that as the first element and the params as the second. 

But without knowing the exact return type of _converter.convert, I have to make an assumption. 

Given the docstring, I think the code should call self._converter.convert with sql and params, and return the result as a tuple. However, the function's return type is a tuple of two elements, so perhaps the _converter.convert returns a single string, and the function returns that string along with the original params. 

But that would require the function to return a tuple of (formatted_sql, params). 

So the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return (formatted_sql, params)

But then the return type is a tuple of two elements, which matches the given signature. 

Alternatively, if the _converter.convert returns a tuple, then the code would return that tuple. 

But the user's function signature says the return is a tuple of AnyStr and the params type. So the code should return a tuple where the first element is a string, and the second is the params. 

Therefore, the code would call the converter, get the formatted SQL, and return it along with the original params. 

But how does the converter convert the SQL? Maybe it's a method that takes the SQL and params and returns the formatted SQL. 

So the code is as above. 

I think that's the best approach given the information. So the final code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return (formatted_sql, params)

But wait, the return type is a tuple of two elements. The first is AnyStr, which is a string, and the second is the same as params. So the code returns a tuple with the formatted SQL and the original params. 

But maybe the _converter.convert is supposed to return the formatted SQL and the processed params. For example, if the params are a dictionary, maybe the converter is supposed to replace placeholders in the SQL with the parameters, and return the formatted SQL and the params. 

In that case, the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql, processed_params = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return (formatted_sql, processed_params)

But again, without knowing what the converter does, it's hard to tell. However, the function's return type is a tuple of the formatted SQL and the params. So the code should return those two elements. 

Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll go with the assumption that the _converter.convert returns the formatted SQL and the processed params, and the function returns them as a tuple. 

But the original params are passed as the second argument. So maybe the converter is supposed to process the SQL and return the formatted SQL, and the params are kept as-is. 

In that case, the code would be:

def format(
    self,
    sql: AnyStr,
    params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]],
) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    formatted_sql = self._converter.convert(sql, params)
    return (formatted_sql, params)

But the return type is a tuple of two elements. So this code would return a tuple with the formatted SQL and the original params. 

I think this is the correct approach. Therefore, the generated code would be as follows.
