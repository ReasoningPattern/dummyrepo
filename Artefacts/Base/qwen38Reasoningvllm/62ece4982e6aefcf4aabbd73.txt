Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for the split function based on the given signature and docstring. The function needs to split a string according to the platform, with 'this' auto-detecting the current platform, 1 for POSIX, and 0 for Windows/CMD.

First, I need to figure out how to determine the current platform. Oh right, the os module has os.name or platform.system() which can tell. But wait, the docstring says if platform is 'this', auto-detect. So maybe check the platform and decide the delimiter.

POSIX style splitting usually uses colon (':') as the delimiter, while Windows uses backslash ('\\'). Wait, no, wait. Wait, in Windows, the path separator is backslash, but when splitting paths in commands, maybe it's different. Wait, the function is about splitting a string, perhaps path-like strings. So for example, on POSIX, splitting by colon, on Windows by backslash. But maybe the function is meant to split the string into parts based on the platform's path separator.

So, the function should split the input string s using the appropriate delimiter based on the platform. Let me confirm: when platform is 1 (POSIX), split on colon. When 0 (Windows/CMD), split on backslash. And if 'this', check the current platform.

So, first, determine the delimiter. For that, I can use os.name. On POSIX systems (like Linux, macOS), os.name is 'posix', and on Windows, it's 'nt'. Alternatively, using platform.system() might be more accurate. But maybe the user expects using os.path.sep, which gives the separator for the current platform. Wait, but the function is supposed to split the string into parts based on the platform's style. So for example, if the input is a path, splitting by the separator.

Wait, but the function's name is split, so perhaps it's splitting the string into parts using the platform's path separator. So, for example, on Windows, splitting by backslash, on POSIX by colon.

So the code needs to:

- Check the platform argument. If it's 'this', determine the current platform.
- Based on that, choose the delimiter.
- Split the string s using that delimiter.
- Return the list of parts.

But how to handle the platform parameter? Let's see:

If platform is 'this', then auto-detect. So, perhaps using os.name. Let's think: os.name returns 'posix' or 'nt' for Unix-like or Windows. So, for 'posix', use colon, for 'nt' use backslash. But wait, maybe the user wants to split the string into parts using the platform's path separator. For example, if the string is a path, splitting it into components.

Wait, but the function is called split, so maybe it's splitting the string into parts based on the platform's path separator. So, for example, on Windows, splitting by backslash, on POSIX by colon.

So, the code would first determine the delimiter. Let's code that.

First, import os.

Then, inside the function:

if platform == 'this':
    if os.name == 'posix':
        delimiter = ':'
    else:
        delimiter = '\\'
elif platform == 1:
    delimiter = ':'
elif platform == 0:
    delimiter = '\\'
else:
    raise ValueError("Invalid platform parameter")

Then, split the string s using split(delimiter). But wait, the split method in Python splits on every occurrence. So, for example, 'a:b:c'.split(':') gives ['a', 'b', 'c'].

But wait, what if the string is something like 'a\\b\\c' on Windows? Splitting by backslash would split into ['a', 'b', 'c'].

But maybe the function is intended to split the string into parts using the platform's path separator. However, the function's docstring says "split the input str under given platform", so perhaps it's splitting the string into parts based on the platform's path separator.

But then, how to handle cases where the string might have multiple separators? For example, if the input is 'a:b:c', splitting by colon would split into three parts. Similarly for backslash.

So the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        if os.name == 'posix':
            delimiter = ':'
        else:
            delimiter = '\\'
    elif platform == 1:
        delimiter = ':'
    elif platform == 0:
        delimiter = '\\'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform parameter")
    return s.split(delimiter)

Wait, but what about if the platform is something else? The docstring says platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So the code should handle those cases.

But wait, the function's parameters say platform is either 'this', 1, or 0. So the code checks for those.

Wait, but in the function signature, the platform argument is described as 'this' (string), 1 (integer), 0 (integer). So the code should handle those.

But in Python, the function's parameters are passed as strings or integers. So when platform is 'this', it's a string. When it's 1 or 0, it's integers.

Wait, but the user's docstring says platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So the code should check if platform is 'this', then check the current platform. Else, if it's 1, use POSIX style (colon), else if 0, use Windows style (backslash).

But wait, the function's parameters are passed as platform='this', so the code should check for the platform argument.

Wait, but in the code, when platform is 1, it's using POSIX style. But maybe the user intended that platform=1 is POSIX and platform=0 is Windows. So the code above is correct.

But wait, the function's docstring says: If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform. If platform equals 1, use POSIX style. If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.

So the code should check if platform is 'this', then determine the current platform. Otherwise, if it's 1, use colon, else if 0, use backslash.

But wait, in the code, when platform is 'this', the code checks os.name. However, os.name can be 'posix' or 'nt', but maybe the user wants to use the platform's path separator. For example, on Windows, the path separator is backslash, but in some cases, maybe it's different. However, os.path.sep gives the correct separator for the current platform. So perhaps using that would be better.

Wait, but the function is supposed to split the string using the platform's style. So for example, if the string is a path, splitting by the separator. So for POSIX, split by colon, but wait, no. Wait, the path separator in POSIX is slash ('/'), not colon. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the docstring.

Wait, the docstring says: If platform equals 1, use POSIX style. If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style. So perhaps the splitting is done based on the path separator of the platform. For example, on POSIX, split by '/', on Windows by '\'.

But the original code I wrote splits by colon for POSIX and backslash for Windows. That's conflicting with the actual path separators. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring? Or maybe the function is intended to split the string into parts using the platform's path separator. Let me recheck the docstring.

The docstring says: "Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result. If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform. If platform equals 1, use POSIX style. If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style."

Hmm, maybe the splitting is not based on the path separator, but on some other style. Wait, perhaps the function is meant to split the string into parts using the platform's default path separator. For example, on Windows, splitting by backslash, on POSIX by slash. But then, why does the docstring mention POSIX style and Windows/CMD style? Maybe the user is referring to splitting paths in a way that's compatible with the platform's style. For example, in Windows, paths are split by backslash, and in POSIX by slash.

But then, the function's name is split, so maybe it's splitting the string into parts using the platform's path separator. So the code should split the string s using the appropriate delimiter.

So, for platform 'this', check the current platform's path separator. For platform 1 (POSIX), use '/'. For platform 0 (Windows), use '\\'.

Wait, but in the original code I wrote, for platform 'this', it uses os.name, which is 'posix' or 'nt', and then uses colon or backslash. That's incorrect. Because the path separator for POSIX is '/', not colon. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring? Or perhaps the function is intended to split the string using the platform's path separator. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to split the string using the platform's path separator. So for example, if the input is a path, splitting it into components. So for POSIX, split by '/', and for Windows, split by '\\'.

But then, the docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style and 0 is Windows/CMD style. So perhaps the function is intended to split the string using the platform's path separator. So in that case, the code should use os.path.sep for the current platform.

So, let's adjust the code. For platform 'this', use os.path.sep. For platform 1, use '/', for platform 0, use '\\'.

Wait, but in Windows, the path separator is '\', but in Python, when you use os.path.sep, it's '\\', so that's correct.

So the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        delimiter = os.path.sep
    elif platform == 1:
        delimiter = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        delimiter = '\\'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform parameter")
    return s.split(delimiter)

But wait, the user's docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style, which uses colon? Or maybe the user is referring to splitting by the platform's path separator. Because in the original problem statement, the user might have confused the delimiter. For example, in some contexts, like environment variables, POSIX uses colon as separator, while Windows uses semicolon. But the function's name is split, which is ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to split the string into parts using the platform's path separator. So for example, splitting a path string into components. So on Windows, splitting by backslash, on POSIX by slash.

But the docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style, which might imply using colon as the delimiter. Wait, maybe the user is thinking of splitting environment variables, which in POSIX use colon, and in Windows use semicolon. But that's not clear.

Hmm. The original problem is ambiguous. But given the function signature and docstring, the user probably wants to split the string using the platform's path separator. So for example, if the input is a path, split it into parts. So for POSIX, split by '/', for Windows by '\\'.

But the docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style, which may imply using colon. However, that's conflicting with the actual path separators. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring. But since the user provided that, I need to follow it.

Wait, the user says: If platform equals 1, use POSIX style. If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style. So maybe the splitting is done based on the platform's path separator. So for POSIX, it's '/', for Windows, it's '\\'.

But then, the original code in the example would split by colon for POSIX and backslash for Windows. Which is wrong. So perhaps the user intended that platform 1 uses colon and platform 0 uses backslash. But that's not standard. For example, in POSIX, the path separator is slash, not colon. So maybe the user is referring to splitting environment variables, which use colon in POSIX and semicolon in Windows. But the docstring says Windows/CMD style, which might imply splitting by backslash.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to splitting the string into parts using the platform's default path separator. So for example, on Windows, split by backslash, on POSIX by slash.

But the docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style. So perhaps the user is thinking of splitting by the path separator. So the code should use os.path.sep for the current platform, and for platform 1, use '/', and for 0, use '\\'.

But then, the function's name is split, which is a bit generic. However, given the docstring, I'll proceed with that.

So, the code would check the platform parameter. If it's 'this', use the current platform's path separator. If 1, use '/'. If 0, use '\\'.

But then, the function's docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style, which may imply using colon. But that's conflicting. So perhaps the user intended that platform 1 uses colon as the delimiter, and platform 0 uses backslash. Let me think again.

The original problem may have been inspired by splitting paths, but perhaps the user is thinking of splitting strings using the platform's default delimiter. For example, in Windows, the default path delimiter is backslash, and in POSIX it's slash. But the docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style, which may mean using colon. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to splitting the string into parts using the platform's default path separator. So for example, on Windows, splitting by backslash, on POSIX by slash. So the code would use os.path.sep for 'this', '/' for 1, and '\\' for 0.

But in that case, the function's name is split, which is a bit generic. However, given the user's instructions, I need to code according to the docstring.

So, the code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        delimiter = os.path.sep
    elif platform == 1:
        delimiter = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        delimiter = '\\'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform parameter")
    return s.split(delimiter)

But then, what if the input string is not a path? For example, if it's a string with colons, then splitting by '/' would not make sense. But the function's purpose is to split the input string based on the platform's style, which may be intended for paths. However, the function is called split, so it's possible that it's intended for splitting paths.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended that for platform 1 (POSIX), split by colon, and for 0 (Windows), split by backslash. Because in some contexts, like environment variables, POSIX uses colon and Windows uses semicolon. But the function's docstring says Windows/CMD style, which might imply backslash.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to splitting the string into parts using the platform's default path separator. So for example, on Windows, splitting by backslash, on POSIX by slash.

But the original code in the example (the user's initial code) uses colon for POSIX and backslash for Windows. Wait, no, the user's initial code is not provided. The user provided the function signature and docstring.

So the user's docstring says that platform 1 is POSIX style, platform 0 is Windows/CMD style. So perhaps the splitting is done based on the platform's path separator. So for POSIX, it's '/', for Windows, it's '\\'.

But then, the function's name is split, which is a bit generic. However, given the user's instruction, I need to code accordingly.

So, the code would be as follows:

Check the platform argument. If it's 'this', use os.path.sep. If it's 1, use '/'. If it's 0, use '\\'.

But wait, in the case of platform 1, the user says "use POSIX style". So maybe the delimiter is the same as the path separator for that platform. So POSIX uses '/' and Windows uses '\\'.

So the code should split the string using that delimiter.

But then, what if the input string is something like 'a/b/c' on POSIX? Splitting by '/' would give ['a', 'b', 'c'].

But the user's docstring says that the function splits the input string under the given platform. So I think the correct approach is to split using the platform's path separator.

Therefore, the code should be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        delimiter = os.path.sep
    elif platform == 1:
        delimiter = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        delimiter = '\\'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform parameter")
    return s.split(delimiter)

But then, what about the case where the platform is not 'this', 1, or 0? The code raises a ValueError.

But the user's docstring says that platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So that's covered.

But wait, in the function signature, the platform argument is passed as 'this', 1, or 0. So the code checks for those.

But what about if the user passes platform as a string like 'posix' or 'nt'? The docstring says that platform is 'this', 1, or 0. So the code should not handle other values.

So the code is correct.

But then, the user's example may have different expectations. For example, if the input is 'a:b:c', and platform is 1 (POSIX), then splitting by '/' would not split it. But if the user intended to split by colon, then the code would be different.

But given the ambiguity, perhaps the user intended that platform 1 uses colon and platform 0 uses backslash. Let me check the original problem again.

The user's docstring says:

"If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style."

So perhaps the splitting is done based on the platform's default path separator. So for POSIX, it's '/', for Windows, it's '\\'.

But the user might have made a mistake in the docstring, perhaps intending that platform 1 uses colon (as in environment variables) and platform 0 uses semicolon (as in Windows). But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to split the string into parts using the platform's default path separator. For example, splitting a path string.

In that case, the code is as written above.

But to make sure, perhaps the user is referring to splitting the string using the platform's path separator. So the code uses os.path.sep for 'this', '/' for 1, and '\\' for 0.

But then, in the case of platform 1, the delimiter is '/', and for 0, it's '\\'.

So the code is correct.

Another thing: when platform is 'this', the code uses os.path.sep, which is the correct path separator for the current platform. So on Windows, it's '\\', on POSIX, it's '/'.

So the code would split the string s using that delimiter.

But what about if the string is empty? Or if the delimiter is not present? The split method in Python handles that by returning the original string as a single-element list.

So the code should work.

But the user's docstring says that the function returns a list of splitting str. So that's correct.

So the final code would be:

import os

def split(s, platform='this'):
    """
    Split the input str under given platform, return the splitting result
    If platform equals 'this', auto-detect current platform.
    If platform equals 1, use POSIX style.
    If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style.
    Args:
        s: input str
        platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD
    Returns:
        a list of splitting str
    """
    if platform == 'this':
        delimiter = os.path.sep
    elif platform == 1:
        delimiter = '/'
    elif platform == 0:
        delimiter = '\\'
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid platform parameter")
    return s.split(delimiter)

But wait, in the case of platform 1, the delimiter is '/', which is the POSIX path separator. For platform 0, it's '\\', which is the Windows path separator.

Yes, that makes sense. So this code should split the string s using the appropriate delimiter based on the platform.

But the user's initial code example (if any) isn't provided, so I have to rely on the docstring.

So the code above should be correct.
