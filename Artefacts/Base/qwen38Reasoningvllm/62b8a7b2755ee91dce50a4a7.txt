Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function default_tzinfo based on the given signature and docstring. Let's see. The function's purpose is to set the tzinfo parameter on naive datetimes only. So, if the input datetime is already aware (has a timezone), we leave it as is. Otherwise, we assign the provided tzinfo.

First, I should check if the datetime object is naive. How do I do that in Python? Oh right, a naive datetime doesn't have a timezone. So, I can check if dt.tzinfo is None. Wait, but in Python's datetime module, the tzinfo attribute is present even for naive datetimes, but it's set to None. So, the condition would be if dt is naive, then set its tzinfo.

Wait, but how to handle the case where the datetime might already have a timezone. So the function should only assign tzinfo if the dt is naive. So the code would be something like:

if dt.tzinfo is None:
    dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
return dt

But wait, the function is supposed to return an aware datetime. So, if the input dt is already aware, we just return it. Otherwise, we replace the tzinfo.

But wait, the replace method returns a new datetime object. So, the function needs to return the modified dt if it's naive, else the original.

Wait, but what if the input dt is a naive datetime? Then we replace its tzinfo with the provided one. But the replace method creates a new instance, so we need to return that. However, the original dt might be a naive object, and modifying it would not affect the original. So, the function should return the new aware datetime.

But the function's parameters are dt and tzinfo. So, the code would be:

def default_tzinfo(dt, tzinfo):
    if dt.tzinfo is None:
        dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
    return dt

Wait, but the docstring says that it returns an aware datetime. So, if the input dt is already aware, it's returned as is. If it's naive, then after replacing tzinfo, it becomes aware.

But wait, in Python, when you call replace on a datetime object, it returns a new object with the tzinfo set. So, the original dt remains unchanged. So, the function would need to return that new object if it's naive, else return the original.

But the function is named default_tzinfo, and the example shows that when parsing a datetime without timezone, it assigns the tzinfo. Let me check the examples.

In the first example, the input is a datetime parsed with UTC, which is aware. So the function returns it as is. The second example is a naive datetime, so it's assigned the EST timezone (which is a tzoffset instance). The output shows the datetime with the new timezone.

So the code should check if the datetime is naive. If it is, replace the tzinfo and return the new object. Otherwise, return the original.

But wait, the function's parameters are dt and tzinfo. So, the code would be:

def default_tzinfo(dt, tzinfo):
    """
    Sets the ``tzinfo`` parameter on naive datetimes only

    This is useful for example when you are provided a datetime that may have
    either an implicit or explicit time zone, such as when parsing a time zone
    string.

    .. doctest::

        >>> from dateutil.tz import tzoffset
        >>> from dateutil.parser import parse
        >>> from dateutil.utils import default_tzinfo
        >>> dflt_tz = tzoffset("EST", -18000)
        >>> print(default_tzinfo(parse('2014-01-01 12:30 UTC'), dflt_tz))
        2014-01-01 12:30:00+00:00
        >>> print(default_tzinfo(parse('2014-01-01 12:30'), dflt_tz))
        2014-01-01 12:30:00-05:00

    :param dt: The datetime on which to replace the time zone
    :param tzinfo: The datetime.tzinfo subclass instance to assign to dt if (and only if) it is naive.
    :return: Returns an aware datetime.datetime.
    """
    if dt.tzinfo is None:
        dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
    return dt

Wait, but in the first example, the parsed datetime is already aware (with UTC), so the function returns it as is. The second example is naive, so it's replaced with the EST timezone.

But wait, the replace method may not be the correct way to set the timezone. Because in Python's datetime module, the replace method allows you to set the tzinfo, but you have to make sure that the tzinfo is a proper subclass. So, if the dt is naive, then replacing tzinfo with the provided instance should work.

But what if the dt is already aware? Then we just return it. So the code seems correct.

But wait, the function is supposed to return an aware datetime. So, if the input dt is naive, after replacement, it's aware. If it's already aware, it's returned as is. So the code should work.

But I need to make sure that the function doesn't modify the original dt object. Because in Python, the replace method returns a new object. So, the code is correct.

But wait, in the examples, when they parse '2014-01-01 12:30 UTC', the result is an aware datetime. So the function returns that as is. When they parse '2014-01-01 12:30', it's naive, so the function replaces the tzinfo with dflt_tz, which is a tzoffset instance.

So the code seems to fit. But I need to make sure that the function is written correctly. Also, the function is part of dateutil.utils, so maybe it's intended to be a utility function.

But the code as written would work. However, I need to check if the function is supposed to return a new datetime instance or modify the existing one. Since the examples show that the original is returned if it's aware, and a new one if naive, the code is correct.

Wait, but in the first example, the output is 2014-01-01 12:30:00+00:00. The input was parsed with UTC, so the tzinfo is already set. So the function returns the original dt. But the example shows that the output is the same as the input. So the code is correct.

But what about if the input dt is a naive datetime? Then, the code replaces the tzinfo and returns the new object. So that's correct.

So the code is straightforward. The function checks if the datetime is naive (tzinfo is None), and if so, replaces it. Otherwise, returns the original.

But wait, the function is called default_tzinfo, but in the examples, they use it as a function. So the code is correct.

But I need to make sure that the function is written properly. Also, the parameters are dt and tzinfo. So the code is as follows.

But wait, in Python, the replace method for datetime objects does not take a tzinfo parameter. Wait, no, it does. Let me check. Oh right, the replace method allows you to set the tzinfo. For example, datetime.datetime.replace(tzinfo=...). So that's correct.

So the code should be:

def default_tzinfo(dt, tzinfo):
    if dt.tzinfo is None:
        dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
    return dt

But wait, the function is supposed to return an aware datetime. So, if the input dt is naive, after replace, it's aware. If it's already aware, it's returned as is. So this code should work.

But what about if the input dt is a naive datetime but the tzinfo is not a proper tzinfo subclass? Well, the function's parameter says that tzinfo is a datetime.tzinfo subclass instance, so it's assumed that the user provides a valid one.

So the code is correct. Let me check the examples.

First example: parse('2014-01-01 12:30 UTC') returns an aware datetime. So dt.tzinfo is not None. So the function returns dt as is. The output is 2014-01-01 12:30:00+00:00, which matches.

Second example: parse('2014-01-01 12:30') is naive. So dt.tzinfo is None. Replace with dflt_tz (EST), which is a tzoffset instance. The output is 2014-01-01 12:30:00-05:00, which matches.

So the code should work. But wait, the function is in dateutil.utils, so maybe it's intended to be a utility function. However, the code is straightforward.

But wait, the function is supposed to return an aware datetime. So, in the case where dt is naive, after replacing, it's aware. So the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as above. But I need to make sure that the function is written with the correct parameters and returns the correct type.

So the final code is:

def default_tzinfo(dt, tzinfo):
    """
    Sets the ``tzinfo`` parameter on naive datetimes only

    This is useful for example when you are provided a datetime that may have
    either an implicit or explicit time zone, such as when parsing a time zone
    string.

    .. doctest::

        >>> from dateutil.tz import tzoffset
        >>> from dateutil.parser import parse
        >>> from dateutil.utils import default_tzinfo
        >>> dflt_tz = tzoffset("EST", -18000)
        >>> print(default_tzinfo(parse('2014-01-01 12:30 UTC'), dflt_tz))
        2014-01-01 12:30:00+00:00
        >>> print(default_tzinfo(parse('2014-01-01 12:30'), dflt_tz))
        2014-01-01 12:30:00-05:00

    :param dt: The datetime on which to replace the time zone
    :param tzinfo: The datetime.tzinfo subclass instance to assign to dt if (and only if) it is naive.
    :return: Returns an aware datetime.datetime.
    """
    if dt.tzinfo is None:
        dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=tzinfo)
    return dt

But wait, the function is supposed to return an aware datetime. However, if the input dt is already aware, then it's returned as is. If it's naive, then after replace, it's aware. So the code is correct.

But in Python, the replace method returns a new datetime object. So the function is correct.

But maybe the function should return a new object in all cases? Well, the docstring says to return an aware datetime. So if the input is naive, the function returns a new aware datetime. If the input is already aware, it returns the same object. But since the function is called default_tzinfo, perhaps it's intended to return a new object even if the input is aware? Or maybe not. The examples show that when the input is aware, it's returned as is.

But the function's return type is described as returning an aware datetime. So the code is correct.

So the code is as written above. Now, I need to make sure that the code is written in Python markdown format, which is just the code block with triple backticks. Also, the user said not to include any explanation, just the code. So the final answer is the code as written, with the docstring included.
