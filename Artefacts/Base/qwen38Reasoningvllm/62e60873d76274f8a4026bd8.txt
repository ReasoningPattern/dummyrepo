Okay, I need to generate Python code for the protocol_handlers function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is part of a class, as indicated by the 'cls' parameter. It returns a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers, keyed by version tuples. If a specific protocol version is provided, it checks if that version is supported and returns either zero or one item. If not provided, it returns all available versions.

First, the function should handle the protocol_version parameter. If it's None, return all handlers. Otherwise, check if the version is in the available ones. But how do I get the available handlers? Since it's a class method, maybe the class has some attribute or method that lists the supported versions.

Wait, the docstring mentions that the dictionary is keyed by version tuples. So the function needs to return a dictionary where each key is a tuple like (3,5) and the value is the corresponding handler class.

I should think about how to structure this. Maybe the class has a list of supported protocol versions, and each version has a handler class. For example, perhaps there's a dictionary within the class that maps version tuples to handler classes. Let's assume that the class has an attribute called _protocol_handlers which is a dictionary of version tuples to classes.

So, the function would check if protocol_version is provided. If it's not, return the entire _protocol_handlers dictionary. If it is provided, check if it's a tuple. If not, raise a TypeError. Then, check if the version exists in the dictionary and return that entry, or an empty dict if not.

Wait, the docstring says if an explicit protocol version is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items. So, if the version is supported, return a dict with that single entry. If not, return an empty dict. So, the function should return a dict with the specified version as the key if it's present, else empty.

So, the steps are:

1. Check if protocol_version is None. If so, return all handlers.
2. If protocol_version is not None, verify it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError.
3. Check if the protocol_version exists in the class's _protocol_handlers.
4. Return a dict with that version if present, else empty.

But how to implement this? Let's think about the code structure.

Inside the function, first, handle the case where protocol_version is None. Then, if it's provided, check if it's a tuple. Then, check if it's in the class's handlers.

Wait, the function is a class method, so 'cls' refers to the class. So, perhaps the class has a class-level dictionary, like a static variable, that holds the protocol handlers.

So, the code might look like this:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is None:
        return cls._protocol_handlers
    else:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
        return {protocol_version: cls._protocol_handlers.get(protocol_version, None)} if protocol_version in cls._protocol_handlers else {}

Wait, but the return should be a dictionary. If the version is present, return a dict with that key-value pair. If not, return an empty dict.

But maybe the class has a list of supported versions, and for each version, there's a corresponding handler. So, the function would check if the given version is in the supported list and return the appropriate handler.

Alternatively, perhaps the class has a method or attribute that provides the handlers. But the docstring says the function returns a dictionary keyed by version tuples, so the class likely has a dictionary that maps versions to handler classes.

So, the code would need to access that dictionary. Let's assume that the class has a class variable called _protocol_handlers which is a dictionary.

So, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        return cls._protocol_handlers
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    handlers = {}
    if protocol_version in cls._protocol_handlers:
        handlers[protocol_version] = cls._protocol_handlers[protocol_version]
    return handlers

But wait, the docstring says that if the protocol version is provided, the dictionary will contain zero or one items. So, if the version is not supported, return an empty dict. That's what the code above does.

But the function is supposed to return a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. So, the class must have a _protocol_handlers attribute that is a dictionary. So, the code would need to have that in the class.

But the user hasn't provided that, so the code here is just the function. So, the function uses cls._protocol_handlers, which is presumably defined in the class.

But the user wants the code for the function. So, the code should include the logic to check the protocol version and return the appropriate dict.

Another thing: the function is a class method, but in Python, if it's a static method, it would be decorated with @staticmethod. However, the function signature shows 'cls' as the first parameter, which suggests it's a class method. But the user hasn't specified that. Wait, the function is defined as def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), which is a class method. So, the code should be a class method.

Wait, but in the code, the user hasn't mentioned decorators. So, perhaps the function is intended to be a class method. However, the code as written would be a regular function. But the first parameter is 'cls', which is typical for a class method. So, maybe the function is supposed to be a class method. But the user hasn't specified that. Hmm.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature. So, the code should have 'cls' as the first parameter. So, the code would be a class method, but perhaps the user expects it to be a static method or a regular function. However, given the function signature, it's better to assume that it's a class method, but maybe the user just wants the function as is, without the decorator.

But the user hasn't mentioned any decorators, so perhaps the function is just a regular function, but the first parameter is 'cls' as part of the signature. So, the code would be written as a regular function, but the 'cls' is part of the parameters. However, in Python, if it's a class method, it would be decorated with @classmethod. But the user hasn't specified that. So, maybe the function is intended to be a class method, but the code should not include the decorator. Or maybe it's a static method. But the user's code example shows the function as a regular function with 'cls' as the first parameter. So, perhaps the function is part of a class and is a class method, but the user hasn't included the decorator. However, the code as written would need to be a class method, but the user might not have specified that. But the function signature is given as def protocol_handlers(cls, ...), so the code should be written as a class method. Wait, but in Python, if you have a function with 'cls' as the first parameter, it's typically a class method. However, the user's code may not have the @classmethod decorator. But the function is part of a class, so perhaps it's a static method or a regular method. But the user's docstring says 'Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers', which suggests that the function is part of a class and uses the class's attributes.

But regardless, the code should be written as per the function signature. So, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is None:
        return cls._protocol_handlers
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    handlers = {}
    if protocol_version in cls._protocol_handlers:
        handlers[protocol_version] = cls._protocol_handlers[protocol_version]
    return handlers

But wait, the docstring says that if the protocol version is provided, the dictionary will contain zero or one items. So, if the version is not supported, return an empty dict. That's what the code does.

But what if the class doesn't have the _protocol_handlers attribute? Well, that's an assumption we have to make. The function is supposed to return that dictionary, so the class must have it.

So, the code would look like that. Also, the function raises a TypeError if the protocol_version is not a tuple. So, in the code, we check if it's not a tuple, and raise the exception.

So, the code is as above. Let me make sure that the code matches the docstring. The parameters are handled correctly. The return is a dictionary. The error is raised when protocol_version is not a tuple.

Yes, that seems right. So, the generated code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is None:
        return cls._protocol_handlers
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    handlers = {}
    if protocol_version in cls._protocol_handlers:
        handlers[protocol_version] = cls._protocol_handlers[protocol_version]
    return handlers

But wait, the docstring says 'the dictionary will contain either zero or one items'. So, if the version is not supported, return an empty dict. That's handled by the code.

But maybe the class has a list of supported versions, and the function checks if the given version is in that list. However, the code uses a dictionary, so perhaps the class has a _protocol_handlers dictionary. So, the code is correct.

Another thing: the function is supposed to return a dictionary of version tuples to handler classes. So, the code returns a dict with the key as the protocol_version if present, else empty.

Yes, that's correct. So, this code should meet the requirements.
