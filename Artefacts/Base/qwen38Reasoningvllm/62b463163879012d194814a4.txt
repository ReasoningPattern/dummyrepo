Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _explore_zipfile based on the given signature and docstring. The docstring says it groups the given zip path using _group_files_by_xml_filename. 

First, I should figure out what the function is supposed to do. The name suggests that it's supposed to explore a zip file and group its contents. The helper function mentioned is _group_files_by_xml_filename, which probably groups files based on their XML filenames. 

But wait, the user hasn't provided the definition of _group_files_by_xml_filename. So I need to assume that this function exists elsewhere and is used to group the files. The main function's job is to process the zip file and pass the necessary data to that helper function.

So, the steps would be: open the zip file, extract its contents, maybe get the list of files, then pass them to the helper function. But how exactly? The helper function's parameters aren't given. Let me think. The helper function's name implies it groups files by their XML filenames, perhaps extracting the base name without the extension or something similar. 

Maybe the _explore_zipfile function needs to read all the files from the zip, then group them using the helper. So the code would involve using the zipfile module to open the zip file, iterate through the files, and then call the helper function with the list of files or some processed data.

Wait, the helper function's name is _group_files_by_xml_filename. So perhaps the helper takes a list of file names and groups them based on some XML-related criteria. For example, maybe it splits them into different groups based on the XML file names, like extracting the main XML file and others.

But without knowing the exact parameters of the helper function, I have to make some assumptions. Let me think: the helper might take a list of file names and return grouped data. So the _explore_zipfile function would need to extract the files from the zip, get their names, and then pass them to the helper.

So the code would start by importing zipfile. Then, open the zip file, read the file names, maybe filter them if necessary, and then call the helper function with those names. The function would return the grouped data, which is then returned by _explore_zipfile.

Wait, but the helper function's parameters aren't specified. The user might have intended that the helper function is called with the zip file's contents. Let me think of possible parameters. Maybe the helper takes a list of file names and groups them, perhaps by extracting the XML filename part. For example, if the files are named like 'data.xml', 'report.xml', etc., the helper could group them by their base names.

Alternatively, maybe the helper function is supposed to process each file in the zip, and the _explore_zipfile function is responsible for extracting them. But the docstring says "groups the given zip path by using _group_files_by_xml_filename," which suggests that the helper is doing the grouping, and the main function is just passing the data.

So, the code would be something like:

import zipfile

def _explore_zipfile(zip_path):
    """
    Groups the given zip path by using _group_files_by_xml_filename.
    """
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
        file_list = zip_ref.namelist()
    return _group_files_by_xml_filename(file_list)

But wait, maybe the helper function requires more parameters. For example, perhaps it needs the zip file object or something else. However, since the user hasn't provided that, I'll assume that the helper takes a list of file names.

Another thing to consider: the function might need to extract the files, but the docstring doesn't mention that. It just says to group them. So maybe the function is just processing the list of files in the zip without extracting them. So the code would be as above.

I should also check if the helper function is supposed to be part of the same module. Since it's called with an underscore, it's likely a private function, so the code would reference it as such.

So the final code would import zipfile, open the zip file, get the list of names, and call the helper function with that list. Then return the result.

But the user said to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is given, and the docstring mentions using the helper. So the code should include the necessary steps to get the files from the zip and pass them to the helper.

I think that's the correct approach. Let me write that code.
