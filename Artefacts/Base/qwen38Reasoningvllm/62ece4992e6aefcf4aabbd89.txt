Okay, the user wants me to generate Python code for a Gaussian function with specific parameters. Let me see. The function signature is def gaussian(x): and the docstring says it's centered at u=0.2 and sigma=0.1. 

Wait, the Gaussian formula is usually (1/(sigma*sqrt(2π))) * e^(-(x-u)^2/(2sigma²)). So I need to implement that. Let me check the parameters again. The mean (u) is 0.2 and standard deviation (sigma) is 0.1. 

So in the code, I'll calculate the exponent part first. The exponent is -(x - 0.2)**2 divided by (2*(0.1)**2). Then multiply by the coefficient 1/(0.1 * sqrt(2 * pi)). 

I should import math for the exp and sqrt functions. Oh, and the formula uses e, so math.exp is needed. Let me make sure the order of operations is correct. The exponent is (x - u) squared, then divided by (2*sigma squared). 

Wait, the sigma is 0.1, so sigma squared is 0.01. The denominator in the exponent is 2*0.01 which is 0.02. Then the coefficient is 1/(0.1 * sqrt(2 * math.pi)). Let me compute that coefficient numerically. 

Calculating the coefficient: 2 * math.pi is about 6.2832, sqrt of that is approximately 2.5066. Then 0.1 * 2.5066 is 0.25066. So the coefficient is 1/0.25066 ≈ 3.9894. But maybe I should compute it exactly using math constants. 

So the code would be something like:

import math

def gaussian(x):
    """
    Calculate Gaussian centered with u is 0.2 and sigma is 0.1.
    """
    u = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    coefficient = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    exponent = - (x - u)**2 / (2 * sigma**2)
    return coefficient * math.exp(exponent)

Wait, but the user said to output only the code in python markdown format. So I need to make sure I don't include any explanations. Also, check if the function is supposed to be normalized. The standard Gaussian is normalized, so this should be correct. 

I think that's all. Let me write the code without any extra text.
