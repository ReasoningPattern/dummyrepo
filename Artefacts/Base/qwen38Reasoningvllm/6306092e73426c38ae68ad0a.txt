Okay, I need to generate Python code for the validate_choices_args method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it checks if the value of the given args is one of the available choices. So, the function's purpose is to validate that the arguments provided are within a predefined set of options. 

First, I should consider how the choices are determined. Since the function is part of a class (the first parameter is self), maybe the choices are defined as a class attribute. Let me check the function signature again. The function is called validate_choices_args and takes self and args. The args parameter is the received arguments, which I assume is a list or a single value. Wait, the parameter name is 'args', plural, so maybe it's expecting multiple arguments. But the function is named validate_choices_args, which might imply that it's checking each argument against a set of choices.

Wait, but the docstring says "the given args" which could be a single argument or multiple. However, the function is part of a class, so perhaps the class has a predefined list of choices. For example, maybe there's an attribute like self.choices that contains the valid options. The function would then check each argument in args against this list.

So the steps would be: iterate over each argument in args, check if it's in self.choices. If any argument is not in the choices, raise an error. Otherwise, return True or something.

But wait, the function's name is validate_choices_args. Maybe it's supposed to validate that the arguments are choices for a particular parameter. For instance, if the method is part of a class that has certain allowed choices, like in a command-line argument parser where certain options are allowed.

But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the actual choices. So the code needs to refer to self.choices, which must be defined elsewhere in the class. So the function will check each argument in args against self.choices.

Let me think about possible exceptions. The docstring doesn't specify, but typically, such functions might raise a ValueError or a custom exception if the arguments are invalid.

So the code would look something like:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}. Choices are {self.choices}")
    return True

But wait, what if args is a single value instead of a list? The function's parameter is named 'args', which might suggest it's expecting multiple arguments. However, in Python, the *args syntax allows for variable number of arguments. But in this case, the function is taking a single 'args' parameter, which is a list or similar iterable. So the code should handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the arguments are valid choices for a specific parameter. For example, if the method is part of a class that has a parameter with allowed choices, and the args are the values passed to that parameter.

But without more context, I'll assume that self.choices is a list of allowed values, and the function checks each argument in the args list against this. If any argument is not in the choices, it raises an error.

So the code would loop through each argument in args, check membership in self.choices, and raise an exception if not. Then return True if all are valid.

But maybe the function is supposed to validate a single argument. Wait, the parameter is called 'args' which is plural. So perhaps it's expecting multiple arguments. But the function's name is singular. Hmm, maybe it's a typo. Or maybe the function is designed to check all arguments passed to it. For example, if the method is part of a class that processes multiple arguments, each of which must be a choice.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to validate that the arguments are choices for a specific parameter, and the 'args' here refers to the arguments for that parameter. For example, if the method is part of a class that has a parameter with choices, and the args are the values provided for that parameter.

In any case, the code needs to check each argument in args against the available choices. So I'll proceed with that assumption.

Another thing to consider: what if the choices are not defined? But the function is part of a class, so perhaps it's expected that self.choices is already set up.

So the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}. Valid choices are {self.choices}")
    return True

But maybe the function is supposed to check if the args are a subset of the choices. Or perhaps it's checking if the args is a single value. Wait, the docstring says "the given args is one of the available choices" — but 'args' is plural. That might be a mistake. Maybe it's supposed to be 'arg' instead of 'args'? But the user provided the function signature as 'args', so I have to follow that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the args (as a single argument) is a list of choices. But that's unclear. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the assumption that 'args' is an iterable of values to check, each of which must be in self.choices.

So the code would loop through each element in args and check if it's in self.choices. If any is not, raise an error. Then return True if all are valid.

Another possibility: maybe the function is part of a class that has a method or attribute that defines the choices. For example, maybe the class has a 'choices' attribute, or perhaps it's a method that returns the choices. But without more info, I'll assume self.choices is a list or set of allowed values.

So the code would be as above. Let me make sure there are no typos. Also, the user said to output only the code, no explanations. So I need to make sure the code is correct and follows the function signature and docstring.

Wait, the docstring says "Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices." So maybe it's checking if the entire args is a single value that's a choice. But that would be conflicting with the parameter name 'args' (plural). Maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring. But I have to follow the given function signature and docstring.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check if the args (as a single argument) is a valid choice. For example, if the method is part of a class that has a parameter with choices, and args is the value of that parameter.

In that case, the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    if args not in self.choices:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {args}. Valid choices are {self.choices}")
    return True

But then the parameter is named 'args' which is singular. Wait, the function signature is def validate_choices_args(self, args): — the parameter is named 'args' (plural), but the docstring says "the given args is one of the available choices" (singular). That's conflicting. Maybe the docstring has a typo. But since the user provided that, I have to go with it.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check if the arguments (plural) are all valid choices. So the parameter is a list of arguments, and each must be a valid choice.

So the code would loop through each argument in the list and check. So the first code example is correct.

But the user might have intended that the function checks if the args (as a single argument) is a valid choice. But given the parameter name is 'args', plural, I think the first approach is better.

So I'll proceed with the code that checks each element in args against self.choices. Also, the docstring mentions "available choices" which implies that the choices are predefined, so self.choices is the right place to look.

Another thing: what if self.choices is not defined? Well, that's an assumption the code makes. The function is part of a class, so it's expected that self.choices is an attribute of the class.

So the code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}. Valid choices are {self.choices}")
    return True

But maybe the function is supposed to check if the args is a single value. For example, if the method is called with a single argument, and the docstring says 'args' but it's actually a single argument. But the parameter name is 'args', so perhaps it's expecting a list. However, in Python, the function could be called with a single argument, and the code would need to handle that. Wait, no. If the function is defined to take 'args' as a parameter, then the caller is expected to pass an iterable. But if the function is part of a class that uses *args, then maybe the function is supposed to validate each individual argument.

But given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the code that checks each element in args (assuming it's an iterable) against self.choices. So the code above.

But perhaps the function is supposed to check if the args is a single value, and the docstring has a typo. Let me check again. The function is named validate_choices_args, which might suggest that it's checking the arguments (plural) for validity. So the code should check all arguments.

So the code would be as written. Now, the user said to output only the code, in Python markdown format. So I need to make sure that the code is properly formatted and that the docstring is included.

Wait, the user provided the docstring with a newline using \n. So in the code, the docstring will have a line break. But in Python, triple quotes can include newlines. So the docstring is okay.

So the final code would be:

def validate_choices_args(self, args):
    """
    Check if value of the given args is one of the available choices. \n:param args: The received arguments.
    """
    for arg in args:
        if arg not in self.choices:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid choice: {arg}. Valid choices are {self.choices}")
    return True

But maybe the function is supposed to check if the args is a single argument, and the docstring's 'args' is a typo. However, the user provided the function signature with 'args' as the parameter, so I should stick to that.

Another consideration: what if args is not iterable? For example, if it's a single value. Then the code would fail. But perhaps the function is designed to accept either a single argument or multiple, so maybe we should check if args is a list or a single value. But the function's parameter is named 'args', which suggests it's expecting an iterable. So the code is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a command-line argument parser, and 'args' is the list of arguments passed to the method. For example, in a class that processes command-line options, and each option must be a valid choice.

In any case, the code as written would check each argument in the args list against self.choices. So I think that's the right approach.
