Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called directlyProvidedBy that returns the interfaces directly provided by a given object. The docstring mentions that the return value is an IDeclaration from zope.interface.

First, I need to recall how interfaces work in Zope. In Zope's interface system, an object can provide multiple interfaces. The directlyProvidedBy method should retrieve those interfaces directly, not through inheritance. So, the function needs to check the object's provided interfaces and return them as an IDeclaration.

Wait, but how do you get the interfaces an object provides? In Zope, objects have a __providedBy__ attribute which is a list of interfaces they provide. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe I should check the actual Zope code or documentation. Oh right, in Zope 3, the __providedBy__ attribute is used, but in later versions, maybe it's handled differently. However, the user's docstring refers to IDeclaration, which is part of the zope.interface module. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object directly implements, not considering any adapters or utilities. So, maybe using the providedBy method from the interfaces module. Wait, the zope.interface module has a providedBy function that returns the interfaces an object provides. But the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration, which is a class that represents a declaration of interfaces. 

Wait, the IDeclaration is a class that allows you to check if an object provides a particular interface. So, the function might need to return the interfaces that the object directly provides, wrapped in an IDeclaration. Or maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces themselves, not the declaration. Hmm, the docstring says "the value returned is an IDeclaration", so perhaps the function is supposed to return an instance of IDeclaration that contains the interfaces.

Wait, looking at the Zope interface documentation, the providedBy function returns a list of interfaces. But the IDeclaration is a class that can be used to check if an object provides an interface. Maybe the user is referring to the IDeclaration as a collection of interfaces. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object directly provides, not through any adapters. So, for example, if an object is an instance of a class that implements an interface, then that interface is directly provided. But how to get that in Zope?

Wait, perhaps the function is using the zope.interface's providedBy method. Let me think. The providedBy function returns a list of interfaces that the object provides. But the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. Maybe the user is mistaken, or perhaps they meant that the return value is a declaration, which is a list of interfaces. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides. For example, if the object is an instance of a class that implements certain interfaces, then those are the ones to return. But how to get that?

In Zope, the interfaces provided by an object can be obtained by checking the class's __implemented__ attribute. Wait, no, that's for the class itself. For an instance, the provided interfaces are determined by the adapters registered for it. But if the user is referring to the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, then perhaps we need to look at the class's __implemented__ attribute.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, not considering any adapters. So, for example, if the object is an instance of a class that implements InterfaceA and InterfaceB, then directlyProvidedBy would return those two interfaces.

But how to get that in code? In Zope, the interfaces provided by a class are stored in the __implemented__ attribute. So, for the object's class, we can check that. However, if the object is an instance, then the __providedBy__ attribute might be a list of interfaces that are provided by the object itself, not necessarily the class. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, not through any inheritance. So, for example, if the class implements an interface, that's directly provided. But if the class inherits from another class that implements an interface, then that's not considered directly provided.

Wait, but in Zope, interfaces are implemented by classes. So, the directlyProvidedBy function would need to look at the class's implemented interfaces. However, the function is given an object, not a class. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, not considering any adapters or other registrations.

But the docstring says "directly provided by the given object", which might imply that the object itself provides those interfaces, not just its class. So maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that are directly provided by the object, which could be through adapters or via the class's implemented interfaces.

This is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The providedBy function in zope.interface returns the interfaces that the object provides. But how does that work? For example, if an object is an instance of a class that implements an interface, then providedBy would return that interface. But if there's an adapter registered for the object's class, then providedBy would also include those adapters.

But the user's function is called directlyProvidedBy, which suggests that it should return only the interfaces that are directly provided by the object, not through any adapters. So perhaps the function needs to get the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, not considering any adapters.

Wait, but how to distinguish between interfaces provided by the class and those provided by adapters? Maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, which can be obtained by checking the class's __implemented__ attribute. However, in Zope, the __implemented__ attribute is part of the class's interface declarations. So, for an instance, the interfaces it provides are determined by the adapters registered for it. But if the user wants the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, then perhaps we need to look at the class's __implemented__ attribute.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, regardless of adapters. But I'm not sure. The docstring says "the value returned is an IDeclaration", which is a class that allows checking if an object provides an interface. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object provides, and wrap them in an IDeclaration.

Wait, the IDeclaration is a class that represents a declaration of interfaces. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return an instance of IDeclaration that contains the interfaces provided by the object. But how is that done? Maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces provided by the object, and then create an IDeclaration from them.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the IDeclaration as a list of interfaces. Maybe there's a confusion in the terminology. Let me check the Zope documentation.

Looking up zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration: it's a class that is used to check if an object provides a particular interface. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return an IDeclaration instance that contains the interfaces provided by the object. But how?

Wait, the providedBy function returns a list of interfaces. So maybe the function is supposed to return that list as an IDeclaration. But IDeclaration is a class, not a list. Maybe the user made a mistake in the docstring, and it's supposed to return a list of interfaces. Or perhaps the function is supposed to return an instance of IDeclaration that includes those interfaces.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, and the IDeclaration is a way to represent that. For example, if the object's class implements InterfaceA and InterfaceB, then directlyProvidedBy would return those two interfaces as an IDeclaration.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the possible code. The function is given an object, and needs to return the interfaces it directly provides. In Zope, the way to get the interfaces an object provides is through the providedBy function. However, that function returns a list of interfaces. So perhaps the user's docstring is incorrect, and the function should return a list. But the user says to return an IDeclaration.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, not through any inheritance. For example, if the class implements InterfaceA, then that's directly provided. But if the class inherits from another class that implements InterfaceB, then InterfaceB is not directly provided by the class.

Wait, in Zope, interfaces are implemented by classes. So, the class's __implemented__ attribute contains the interfaces it directly implements. So, for an object, the directly provided interfaces would be the ones from its class's __implemented__ attribute. But how to get that?

So, perhaps the code would be something like:

from zope.interface import Interface, providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return providedBy(object)

But wait, providedBy returns a list of interfaces. However, the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. Maybe the user is mistaken, or perhaps they meant that the return value is a declaration, which is a list. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces as an IDeclaration instance.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements. So, for example, if the object is an instance of a class that implements InterfaceA, then InterfaceA is directly provided. But if the class is a subclass of another class that implements InterfaceB, then InterfaceB is not directly provided by the class.

Wait, but in Zope, interfaces are implemented by classes, and the providedBy function returns all interfaces that the object provides, including those from its class and any adapters. So, if the user wants only the interfaces directly provided by the class, not through adapters, then providedBy might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, which can be obtained by checking the class's __implemented__ attribute. So, for example:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    interfaces = []
    for interface in object.__class__.__implemented__:
        interfaces.append(interface)
    return interfaces

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Also, the __implemented__ attribute might not be directly accessible. Maybe the correct way is to use the providedBy function, but then wrap the result in an IDeclaration.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, and the IDeclaration is a way to represent that. But I'm not sure how to create an IDeclaration instance.

Wait, the IDeclaration is a class that is used to check if an object provides an interface. So, perhaps the function is supposed to return an instance of IDeclaration that contains the interfaces provided by the object. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the IDeclaration as a list of interfaces. Maybe there's a confusion between the providedBy function and the IDeclaration. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to use the providedBy function, which returns the interfaces that the object provides. However, the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. Maybe the user intended to return a list, but the docstring is incorrect. Or perhaps they want to return the interfaces as an IDeclaration instance.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, not considering any adapters. In that case, the code would be:

from zope.interface import Interface, providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return providedBy(object)

But then, providedBy returns a list of interfaces. However, the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. Maybe the user is mistaken, and the correct return type is a list. But since the user specified the return type as IDeclaration, perhaps there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, and the IDeclaration is a way to represent that. For example, if the class implements InterfaceA, then the IDeclaration would be InterfaceA. But I'm not sure how to create that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly provides, which can be obtained via the class's __implemented__ attribute. So, for example:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    interfaces = object.__class__.__implemented__
    return interfaces

But I'm not sure if that's the correct way. Also, the __implemented__ attribute might not be available in all cases. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which could be obtained by checking the interfaces that are declared on the class, not through any inheritance. So, perhaps using the Interface class's providedBy method, but that's not clear.

Given that the user's docstring mentions IDeclaration, perhaps the correct approach is to use the providedBy function and return that as an IDeclaration. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, and the IDeclaration is a way to represent that. But I'm not certain.

In any case, the user wants the code to return the interfaces directly provided by the object. Given that, the most straightforward approach would be to use the providedBy function from zope.interface, which returns the interfaces that the object provides. However, the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration, which is a class. So maybe the user is referring to the IDeclaration as a list of interfaces. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return an instance of IDeclaration, which is a class that can be used to check if an object provides an interface. But I'm not sure how to create that. 

Perhaps the correct code is to use the providedBy function, which returns the interfaces, and then return that as an IDeclaration. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, not through any inheritance. So, for example, if the class implements InterfaceA, then that's directly provided. But how to get that?

In Zope, the interfaces provided by a class are stored in the __implemented__ attribute. So, for an instance, the directly provided interfaces would be the ones from its class's __implemented__ attribute. But I'm not sure if that's the case. 

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to use the providedBy function, which returns the interfaces that the object provides, and return that. However, the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. Maybe the user intended to return a list, but the docstring is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, and the IDeclaration is a way to represent that. For example, if the class implements InterfaceA, then the IDeclaration would be InterfaceA. 

But without more context, it's hard to tell. Given that, I'll proceed with the assumption that the function should return the interfaces that the object provides directly, which can be obtained via the providedBy function. However, since the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration, perhaps the user wants to return the interfaces as an IDeclaration instance. 

Wait, the IDeclaration is a class that is used to check if an object provides an interface. So, maybe the function is supposed to return an instance of IDeclaration that contains the interfaces provided by the object. But how to create that?

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring, and the return value is a list of interfaces. 

In any case, the code would need to import the necessary modules and use providedBy. So, the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return providedBy(object)

But then, providedBy returns a list of interfaces. However, the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration. Maybe the user intended to return a list, but the docstring is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, not through any adapters. In that case, the code would be:

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    from zope.interface import Interface
    interfaces = []
    for interface in object.__class__.__implemented__:
        interfaces.append(interface)
    return interfaces

But again, I'm not sure. 

Given that the user says to return an IDeclaration, perhaps the correct approach is to return the providedBy result as an IDeclaration. But I'm not sure how that works. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces that the object's class directly implements, and the IDeclaration is a way to represent that. 

But I think the most likely correct answer is to use the providedBy function, which returns the interfaces that the object provides. So, the code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return providedBy(object)

But the docstring says it returns an IDeclaration, which is a class. However, providedBy returns a list of interfaces. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the docstring. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the interfaces as an IDeclaration instance. But I'm not sure how to do that. 

In the absence of more information, I'll proceed with the providedBy function, as that's the standard way to get the interfaces an object provides. So the code would be as above. 

But the user's docstring says the return is an IDeclaration. Maybe the user is referring to the IDeclaration as a list. So perhaps the code is correct as is. 

Therefore, the final code would be:

from zope.interface import providedBy

def directlyProvidedBy(object):
    """
    Return the interfaces directly provided by the given object

    The value returned is an `~zope.interface.interfaces.IDeclaration`.
    """
    return providedBy(object)

But I'm not sure if that's what the user wants. However, given the information, this seems like the most plausible approach.
