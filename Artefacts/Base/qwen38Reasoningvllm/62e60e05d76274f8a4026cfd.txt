Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code for a function called index, which takes a key parameter and returns it as an integer. The function is part of a class, since it's using 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it returns the key in int form.

Hmm, so the task is straightforward. The function needs to convert the input key to an integer. But wait, what if the key isn't a valid integer? The docstring doesn't mention handling exceptions, so maybe I don't need to worry about that. Just convert the key to int and return it.

Wait, the key could be a string, like '123', or maybe another type. The function's purpose is to return the key as an integer. So the code would be something like returning int(key). But I should check if the key is provided correctly. However, the problem says not to include any explanations, just the code. So maybe the function is supposed to cast the key to an integer regardless of its original type.

So the code would be:

def index(self, key):
    """
    Returns the key in the form of int.
    """
    return int(key)

That's it? Let me think again. Are there any edge cases? Like if the key is a float, like 123.45, converting to int would truncate it. But the docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps that's intended. The user didn't mention any error handling, so the function just converts the key to int and returns it. Yeah, that's the simplest implementation that matches the docstring.
