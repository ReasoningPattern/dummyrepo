Okay, I need to write a Python function called was_processed based on the given docstring and function signature. Let me read the docstring carefully to understand what the function should do.

The docstring says that the function checks if a file or directory has already been processed. It mentions two main purposes: preventing recursion by expanding the path name to an absolute path and allowing the function to be called with a set of processed entries. If the entry is already in the set, it should report the issue and return True; otherwise, it adds the entry to the set and returns False.

The function arguments are processed (a set), path_name (the path to check), and verbose (a boolean for verbose output). The return type is a boolean indicating whether the entry is already processed.

First, I'll need to import the os module to handle file paths. The function should expand the given path_name to an absolute path. Using os.path.abspath() seems appropriate here.

Next, I'll convert path_name into an absolute path. Then, I'll check if this absolute path is already in the processed set. If it is, I'll return True and, if verbose is True, print a message indicating that the file was already processed.

If the path isn't in the processed set, I'll add it to the set. Then, return False to indicate it's not already processed.

Wait, but what if the path is a directory? The function should handle both files and directories, so the check should work regardless of whether path_name is a file or directory.

I should also make sure that the function doesn't modify the processed set unless it's already present. So, the order is: check, if present, add to output, else add to the set.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Take the path_name and convert it to an absolute path.
2. Check if this path is in processed.
3. If yes, return True and print a message if verbose.
4. If no, add the path to processed, print a message if verbose, and return False.

I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to handle the verbose output properly. Also, I'll ensure that the function returns the correct boolean value based on whether the path was already processed.

Let me write the code step by step. First, import os. Then, define the function. Inside, compute abspath, check if in processed, handle accordingly.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code as per the requirements.
