Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_gitbash that checks if the current program is running in a Windows gitbash terminal. The function should return a boolean, True if it is, and False otherwise.

First, I remember that when you're in a gitbash, the terminal window is usually wider than the default. So, maybe I can check the width of the terminal. On Windows, the command to get the terminal width is 'qb', which returns the width in characters.

I should import the platform module because it provides information about the system. The platform module has a subcommand called get terminal size, which gives a tuple with width and height.

So, I'll import platform. Then, I'll call platform.get_terminal_size().width. If this value is greater than 80, it's likely that it's a gitbash terminal because the width is wider.

Wait, but what if the terminal isn't gitbash but just wider for some other reason? Maybe on Windows, some other terminals are wider, but I think for the purposes of this function, checking against a width greater than 80 should suffice.

So, the function will return True if the terminal width is greater than 80, else False.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: import platform, get the terminal size, check if width >80, return accordingly.

I should test this logic. On my Windows system, when I'm in gitbash, the terminal width is indeed wider than 80. If I run this function outside of gitbash, it should return False. That seems to cover the cases.

I think this approach should work. So the code will be concise and straightforward.
