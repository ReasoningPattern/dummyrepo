Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring. The function is called _create_in_regex and it returns a Pattern, which is a type from the re module, so it's a regular expression pattern.

Looking at the docstring, it says the function creates the in-style parameter regular expression and returns it. So I need to define a regular expression that matches the 'in' keyword as a parameter.

I remember that in Python, when using regex for parameter validation, the 'in' keyword is often matched with the syntax 'in\s*=\s*(?:\w+|\*\*)' or something similar. Let me think about the components:

- The 'in' keyword is literal, so it starts with 'in'.
- Then there's an optional whitespace, which is \s*.
- Followed by an equals sign, which is =\s*.
- Then the parameter name, which can be a word character or '**' for unpacking, so (?:\w+|\*\*).

Putting it together, the regex pattern should be r'in\s*=\s*(?:\w+|\*\*)'.

So the function should compile this pattern. The function returns a re.Pattern object, so I'll import re and return re.compile(pattern).

Wait, should I include the flags? The docstring doesn't mention any, so I'll assume the default flags are fine.

So the code will import re, define the pattern as a raw string, compile it, and return it.

Putting it all together, the function will be:

import re

def _create_in_regex(self) -> re.Pattern:
    pattern = r'in\s*=\s*(?:\w+|\*\*)'
    return re.compile(pattern)

I think that's it. I should make sure the code is concise and matches the function signature exactly.
