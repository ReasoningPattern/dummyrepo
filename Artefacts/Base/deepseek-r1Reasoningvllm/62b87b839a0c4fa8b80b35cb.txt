Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _get_err_indices and it takes self and coord_name as parameters. The docstring says it finds all error indexes corresponding to a given coordinate name.

First, I should think about what this function needs to do. It probably looks through some data, maybe an errors dictionary, to find all keys that end with coord_name. For example, if coord_name is 'x', it should find 'x0', 'x1', etc.

I'll start by initializing an empty list to collect the error indices. Then, I'll loop through each key in self.errors. For each key, I'll check if it ends with coord_name by using the endswith() method. If it does, I'll append the index to the list.

Wait, but in Python, the endswith() method is string-specific. So if self.errors contains tuples or other objects, this might not work. But given the context, it's likely that self.errors is a dictionary where keys are strings like 'x0', 'y1', etc. So using endswith() should be fine.

After collecting all matching keys, I'll return the list. I should also make sure to handle cases where no errors are found by returning an empty list.

Putting it all together, the function will loop through each key in self.errors, check if the key ends with coord_name, and collect those indices. Then, return the list.

I should write the code without any explanations, just the function body. So, the code will be:

Initialize err_indices as an empty list.
Loop through each key in self.errors:
    if key.endswith(coord_name):
        append the key to err_indices
Return err_indices.

I think that's it. The code should be concise and straightforward.
