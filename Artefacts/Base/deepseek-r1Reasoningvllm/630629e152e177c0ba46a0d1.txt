Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called try_retrieve_webfinger_document and takes a handle as a string, returning an Optional[str]. The docstring says it tries to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document and doesn't raise an exception if it fails.

First, I'll start by importing the necessary modules. Since the function deals with HTTP requests, I'll need requests. So I'll import requests and logging modules. The logging module is probably for handling any errors, so I'll set up a basic configuration to log exceptions with a default level of WARNING.

Next, I'll define the function. Inside the function, I'll create a session using requests.Session() to handle the HTTP request. I'll set the timeout to 10 seconds, which is a common choice, but I can adjust it if needed.

Then, I'll use the session to make a GET request to the URL specified by the handle. I'll add a try-except block to catch exceptions. If an HTTPError occurs, I'll log it as a warning. For other exceptions, like general exceptions, I'll also log them as warnings and then return None.

If the request is successful, I'll check the status code. If it's 200, I'll return the content as a string. Otherwise, I'll log an error and return None.

I should also make sure that the function returns None if the request fails, as per the docstring. The function should handle both HTTP errors and nonHTTP exceptions gracefully by logging and returning None.

I think that covers all the necessary parts. Now, I'll structure the code accordingly, making sure to include the imports and the function with proper error handling and logging.
