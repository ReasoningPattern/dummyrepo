Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _explore_folder and it takes a folder as an argument. The docstring says it groups files in the given group by using _group_files_by_xml_filename. 

Hmm, so the function is likely part of a larger script, maybe dealing with file management or data processing. The name suggests that it's exploring a folder, probably searching for files within that folder. The docstring mentions grouping files, so I should think about how to structure this.

First, I'll need to import necessary modules. Since it's dealing with file paths, os is essential. Also, if it's handling Excel files or something similar, pandas might be useful, but the function signature doesn't show that. Maybe it's just for file listing.

So, the function will start by getting the list of files in the given folder. Using os.listdir(folder) should give all the entries, but I need to filter only the files, not directories. So I'll loop through each item, check if it's a file using os.path.isfile(), and collect those.

Once I have the list of files, I need to process each one. The docstring says to use _group_files_by_xml_filename, which I assume is another function that takes a filename and returns some grouped data. So for each file, I'll call this function and append the result to a list called grouped_files.

Putting it all together, I'll import os, define the function, list the files, process each with the helper function, and collect the results. I'll make sure the code is clean and follows standard practices, without any unnecessary comments since the user specified not to include explanations.

I should also handle exceptions, but since the function signature doesn't include error handling, I'll assume it's beyond the current scope. So the code will be straightforward: import, list files, process each, collect results.

Wait, should I sort the files before processing? The example code doesn't show it, so maybe it's not necessary unless specified. The example just appends in the order they're found, so I'll stick with that.

So the final code will import os, define _explore_folder, loop through each file in the folder, filter out non-files, process each with the helper function, and return the list of grouped results.
