Okay, I need to write a Python function called replace_dots that replaces all occurrences of '.' in a given string with a specified argument. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function signature is given: def replace_dots(value, arg):. So I have two parameters, value (the string to process) and arg (the replacement string).

The goal is to replace every '.' in value with arg. That sounds straightforward. In Python, strings have a replace method. So maybe I can use that.

Wait, the replace method replaces all occurrences, right? So value.replace('.', arg) should do the trick. But wait, what if the value is None or not a string? Oh, but according to the problem statement, value is the given string, so maybe I don't need to handle that. The function expects value to be a string, so I can proceed.

So putting it all together, the function can be a single line returning value.replace('.', arg). Let me test this logic. If value is "hello.world", replacing '.' with 'x' would give "helloxworld". That works.

I should also consider edge cases. What if value is an empty string? Then it just returns an empty string, which is correct. What if arg is an empty string? Replacing '.' with '' would remove all dots, which is intended.

I think this should cover all cases. So the code is simple: return value.replace('.', arg).
