Okay, I need to generate Python code for a function called _reset_logging that resets the logging system. The function should be a method of a class, as indicated by the docstring. 

First, I remember that in Python, the logging module has a root logger that can be configured. To reset the logging, I should probably reset both the root logger and any handlers it might have. 

I think using logging.root is a good approach because it affects all loggers. I'll need to import logging. Then, I'll set logging.root.handlers to an empty list to remove all handlers. 

Also, resetting the root logger's level might be necessary. By default, it's DEBUG, but setting it to WARNING or another level could be useful. I'll use logging.root.setLevel(logging.WARNING) for that.

Additionally, to ensure that all loggers are reset, I should iterate over all the loggers in the module using logging.getLoggers(). For each logger, I'll reset its handlers and level. 

Wait, but if the class has its own custom loggers, I should reset those too. So, I'll loop through all loggers and apply the same reset steps. 

Putting it all together, the function will import logging, reset the root's handlers and level, then iterate through all loggers and reset each one. 

I should make sure the code is properly indented and that all necessary imports are included. Since the function is a method, I'll add it to the class with self as the first parameter. 

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
