Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called base_config, and it takes a user parameter and has default values for etcd_host and etcd_port. The docstring mentions that the configuration should have key parameters: "tls", "authentication", "authorization", "etcd", "docs", and "log".

First, I'll start by defining the function. It should return a dictionary containing these keys with appropriate default values. Since the user is a required parameter, I'll include it in the configuration, maybe with a default value like an empty string if not provided.

Looking at the keys, "tls" is often related to SSL/TLS settings. A common default might be 'on' or True. For "authentication" and "authorization", using empty strings as defaults makes sense since they might not be configured initially.

The "etcd" key should point to the etcd_host and port, so I'll format it as f"{etcd_host}:{etcd_port}". The "docs" key can default to an empty string, and "log" should probably default to 'error' for logging purposes.

Putting it all together, I'll create a configuration dictionary inside the function and return it. I'll make sure all the keys are included with their respective defaults. That should cover the requirements based on the provided function signature and docstring.
