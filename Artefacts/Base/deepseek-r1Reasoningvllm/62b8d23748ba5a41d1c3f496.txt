Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring for an LRU cache decorator. Let me break this down.

First, the function is called lfu_cache and takes two parameters: maxsize with a default of 128, and typed as False. The docstring explains it's a decorator that wraps a function with a memoizing callable using LFU algorithm, saving up to maxsize results.

I remember that Python's built-in functools module has a decorator called lru_cache which uses an LRU strategy. But here, the requirement is for LFU, which is the opposite of LRU. So I'll need to implement a cache that evicts the least recently used item when the maxsize is reached.

So, I'll start by importing functools and the LRU_cache as a base. Then, I'll define the lfu_cache decorator. Inside, I'll create a wrapper function that holds the cache data. The cache should track the usage order, maybe using a dictionary where keys are the arguments and values are the results. Additionally, a separate structure, like a deque or list, can keep track of the order of least recently used items.

I'll need to manage the cache size, ensuring it doesn't exceed maxsize. When adding a new item, if the cache is full, I'll remove the least recently used item. For eviction, I'll check which item hasn't been accessed for the longest time.

I should also handle the typed=False case, which means the decorator can memoize based on the function's arguments, not just their types. Wait, actually, in Python, when typed=False, the decorator uses the arguments' hashability to memoize, but for LFU, I need to track the usage correctly.

I'll structure the wrapper to update the usage order each time the function is called. Every time the function is called, the wrapper will record the arguments as recently used. When the cache reaches maxsize, the least recently used item is popped from the cache.

I should also include the necessary imports, like collections.deque for efficient popping from the front. But wait, deque is part of the collections module, so I need to import that.

Putting it all together, the code will have a wrapper that maintains a cache dictionary and a deque for tracking usage order. Each time the function is called, it updates the usage order, and if the cache exceeds maxsize, it evicts the oldest entry.

I should also make sure that the decorator works with any function, regardless of its arguments, as long as the arguments can be used to update the cache correctly.

Testing the code with various functions to ensure it behaves correctly under different conditions would be good, but since the user didn't ask for testing, I'll focus on the code structure.

So, the final code will import functools and collections, define the lfu_cache decorator with the necessary logic to manage the cache using LFU strategy.
