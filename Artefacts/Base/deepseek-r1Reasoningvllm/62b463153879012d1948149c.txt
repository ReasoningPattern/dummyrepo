Okay, I need to write a Python function called select_filenames_by_prefix. The function takes two arguments: a prefix and a list of files. The docstring explains that for each file in files, I should return all files that match the given prefix. 

Hmm, so the function should iterate through each file in the files list. For each file, I need to check if it starts with the given prefix. If it does, I include it in the result. 

Wait, how do I check if a string starts with another string in Python? Oh right, I can use the str.startswith() method. So for each file in files, I'll do something like if file.startswith(prefix): then include it.

I should collect all such files into a list. So I'll initialize an empty list, maybe called matching_files, and then append each file that meets the condition.

Putting it all together, the function will loop through each file in files. For each one, check if it starts with the prefix. If yes, add to matching_files. Finally, return the matching_files list.

Let me structure the code. Define the function with the given signature. Inside, initialize the list. Loop through each file in files: if condition, append. Then return the list.

I think that's all. I don't need to handle any exceptions here, just straightforward checking.
