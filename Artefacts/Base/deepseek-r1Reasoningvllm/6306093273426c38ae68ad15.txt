Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _run_playbook and it's supposed to run an Ansible CLI with a vars dictionary. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the function takes four parameters: cli_args, vars_dict, ir_workspace, and ir_plugin. The docstring explains each parameter and the return value. So, the code should include these parameters in the function definition.

I remember that in Ansible, the extra_vars parameter is used to pass variables to the playbook. So, I'll need to create an ExtraVars object from the vars_dict. That means importing AnsibleV2Module from the modules module.

Next, I'll import Playbook from playbooks to create the playbook instance. Then, I'll initialize the playbook with the module_name, extra_vars, and workspace. The module_name can be set to something like "ir_plugin_module" since ir_plugin is an instance of InfraredPlugin, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe it's better to get the module name from the plugin, but without more info, I'll proceed with a placeholder.

After initializing the playbook, I need to run it with the CLI arguments. The run played_outcome method of the playbook will execute the playbook using cli_args. Then, I'll capture the result and return it.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code with the necessary imports, function definition, and return the result. I should make sure to handle any exceptions, but the example provided doesn't include that, so maybe it's beyond the current scope.

Wait, in the example code, the return is just 'return played_outcome', but in Ansible, the result is usually an AnsibleResult object. So, perhaps I should return a dictionary or handle it differently. But the example shows returning 'played_outcome', which might be an AnsibleResult instance. I'll follow that structure.

I should also ensure that the code is properly indented and that all necessary modules are imported at the top. So, I'll import the required modules before the function.

Let me write the code step by step. First, import AnsibleV2Module and Playbook. Then, define the function with the given parameters. Inside the function, create the ExtraVars instance, initialize the playbook, run it, and return the outcome.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
