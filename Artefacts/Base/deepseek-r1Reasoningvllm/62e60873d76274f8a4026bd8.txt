Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called protocol_handlers and takes two parameters: cls and protocol_version, which is optional and defaults to None. The docstring says it returns a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers, keyed by version tuples. If protocol_version is provided, it returns either zero or one item depending on whether that version is supported. If not provided, it returns all supported versions.

So, the function needs to check which versions are supported by the cls. I'll assume that each class in cls has a method like supported_versions or something similar, but since the example code uses cls.version, maybe each class has a version attribute or a method that returns its supported versions.

Wait, looking at the example code, it uses cls.version, so perhaps each class in cls has a version attribute that's a tuple. So, the function will collect all unique versions from all classes in cls.

If protocol_version is None, the function returns all versions. If it's a tuple, it checks if that version exists in the supported versions and returns a dictionary with that version as the key and the handler class as the value. If the version isn't supported, it returns an empty dict.

I'll need to loop through each class in cls, collect their versions, and then process based on protocol_version.

Wait, but in the example code, it's using a dictionary comprehension. So, for each class in cls, it's checking if the version is in the supported versions. But how do we get the supported versions for each class?

In the example, it's using cls.version, which suggests that each class has a version attribute. So, perhaps each class in cls has a version attribute that's a tuple indicating the supported versions.

Wait, no, that might not make sense because a class can support multiple versions. So, perhaps each class has a method like get_supported_versions() that returns a set of versions.

Alternatively, maybe each class has a version attribute that's a tuple, and the function uses that. But the example code seems to collect all versions from all classes and then check against the protocol_version.

Wait, looking at the example code again:

versions = {v for c in cls for v in (getattr(c, "version", () for _ in range(1)))}

Wait, that doesn't look right. The line is versions = {v for c in cls for v in (getattr(c, "version", () for _ in range(1)))}

Wait, getattr(c, "version", () for _ in range(1)) â€” that's not correct syntax. The default argument is a generator expression, which would be evaluated each time getattr is called, leading to an infinite loop. So, that's a mistake.

I think the correct way is to get the version attribute for each class. So, perhaps it's something like:

versions = {v for c in cls for v in getattr(c, "version", None)}

But wait, that would flatten all versions into a single list, and then take the unique ones. But if a class has multiple versions, like (3,5) and (3,6), it would include both. But in the example code, the versions are being collected into a set, so duplicates are removed.

Wait, but in the example, the code is using a list comprehension inside the set, so it's collecting all versions from all classes. But if a class doesn't have a version attribute, it would default to None, which when unpacked would cause an error. So, perhaps the code should handle that.

Alternatively, maybe each class has a method called supported_versions that returns a tuple of versions. So, perhaps the code should loop through each class and collect their supported_versions.

But since the example code uses getattr(c, "version", None), perhaps that's the intended approach. But that's problematic because if a class doesn't have a version attribute, it would default to None, and trying to iterate over None would cause a TypeError.

So, perhaps the code should check if the attribute exists before iterating. Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to collect all versions from all classes, treating each class's version as a single version.

Wait, perhaps each class in cls has a version attribute that is a tuple, and the function is supposed to collect all unique versions across all classes. Then, if protocol_version is provided, it checks if that version is in the collected versions and returns the corresponding handler.

But in the example code, the line is versions = {v for c in cls for v in (getattr(c, "version", None))}, which is incorrect because it's trying to iterate over None. So, that's a mistake. The correct way would be to handle cases where the version attribute might not exist.

So, perhaps the code should be:

versions = set()
for c in cls:
    version = getattr(c, 'version', None)
    if version is not None:
        versions.update(version)

Wait, but that would collect all versions from all classes into a set, which is what we want.

Then, if protocol_version is None, return all versions as keys with their handler classes. But how to map each version to the handler class.

Wait, perhaps for each version in versions, we need to find all classes that support that version and collect their handler classes. But the example code seems to return a dictionary where each version maps to a single handler class.

Wait, looking at the example code, it's using a dictionary comprehension that for each version in versions, it returns the handler class. But how to determine which handler class corresponds to which version.

Wait, perhaps each handler class is associated with a specific version. So, for each class in cls, if it has a version attribute, that version is added to the versions set, and the handler is the class itself.

So, the code would collect all unique versions from all classes, and then for each version, the handler is the class that has that version.

But the example code is using a dictionary where the keys are versions and the values are the handler classes. So, the code would be something like:

versions = set()
for c in cls:
    version = getattr(c, 'version', None)
    if version is not None:
        versions.add(version)

if protocol_version is None:
    handlers = {v: v for v in versions}  # assuming each version maps to itself as handler
else:
    handlers = {protocol_version: None}  # or maybe an empty dict if not found

Wait, but in the example code, it's using a dictionary comprehension that for each class, if the version is in the supported versions, it adds the handler. So, perhaps the code is supposed to collect all versions and then for each version in the supported versions, include the handler.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to return a dictionary where each version is a key, and the value is the handler class. So, for each class, if its version is in the supported versions, it's included.

Wait, but the example code is using a dictionary comprehension that for each version in the supported versions, if it's present in the versions set, it includes the handler. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Collect all versions from all classes in cls. Each class contributes its version, which is a tuple. If a class doesn't have a version attribute, it's ignored.

2. If protocol_version is None, return a dictionary where each key is a version from the collected versions, and the value is the handler class (which could be the class itself or another handler).

3. If protocol_version is provided, check if it's a tuple. If it's not, raise a TypeError. Then, check if that version is in the collected versions. If it is, return a dictionary with that version as the key and the handler class as the value. If not, return an empty dictionary.

So, the code would look something like this:

versions = set()
for c in cls:
    version = getattr(c, 'version', None)
    if version is not None:
        versions.add(version)

if protocol_version is None:
    handlers = {v: c for c in cls for v in (c.version for v in (getattr(c, 'version', None) for _ in ...))}  # Not sure about this part
Wait, no, that's not right. The example code is using a dictionary comprehension that for each version in the supported versions, if it's in the collected versions, it includes the handler.

Wait, perhaps the example code is incorrect, but the intended functionality is to collect all versions from all classes, then if a specific version is requested, return the handler for that version, else return all.

So, the code should:

- Collect all versions from all classes into a set.

- If protocol_version is None, return a dictionary where each key is a version and the value is the handler class (which could be the class itself or another handler).

- If protocol_version is provided, check if it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError. Then, if it's in the versions set, return a dictionary with that version as key and the handler class as value. Otherwise, return empty dict.

But in the example code, the line is:

versions = {v for c in cls for v in (getattr(c, "version", () for _ in range(1)))}

Which is incorrect because getattr(c, "version", () for _ in range(1)) is a generator expression that's passed as the iterable to the set comprehension. So, for each class, it's trying to get the version, defaulting to an empty tuple generator, which is incorrect.

So, the correct way is to handle cases where the version attribute may not exist, and collect each version correctly.

So, the code should be:

versions = set()
for c in cls:
    version = getattr(c, 'version', None)
    if version is not None:
        versions.add(version)

Then, proceed to check protocol_version.

But the example code uses a dictionary comprehension, so perhaps it's intended to be a simplified version, but it's incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,

    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    versions = set()
    for c in cls:
        version = getattr(c, 'version', None)
        if version is not None:
            versions.add(version)
    
    if protocol_version is None:
        return {v: v for v in versions}
    else:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol version must be a tuple or None")
        if protocol_version in versions:
            return {protocol_version: None}  # Assuming None as default handler
        else:
            return {}

Wait, but in the example code, the line is versions = {v for c in cls for v in (getattr(c, "version", () for _ in range(1)))}, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the example code is wrong, but the intended functionality is clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should be written as:

versions = {v for c in cls for v in getattr(c, 'version', [])}

But that would flatten all versions into a single list, but if a class has multiple versions, they would all be included. Wait, no, because it's a set, so duplicates are removed.

Wait, no, because for each class, it's getting the version (which could be a tuple) and adding each element of that tuple to the set. So, if a class has version (3,5), it would add 3 and 5 to the set, which is incorrect because a class can support multiple versions, but the function is supposed to collect all versions from all classes.

Wait, but the function is supposed to return handlers for each version, so perhaps each version is a separate handler. But that might not make sense because a handler is specific to a version.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The function is supposed to collect all versions from all classes, and then if a specific version is requested, return the handler for that version, else return all handlers.

So, the code should collect all versions from all classes, then build a dictionary mapping each version to its handler class.

But how to get the handler class for each version. Perhaps each class's version is the key, and the value is the class itself.

So, the code would be:

versions = set()
for c in cls:
    version = getattr(c, 'version', None)
    if version is not None:
        versions.add(version)

if protocol_version is None:
    handlers = {v: c for c in cls for v in (c.version for _ in range(1))}
else:
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("protocol version must be a tuple or None")
    if protocol_version not in versions:
        return {}
    handlers = {protocol_version: None}  # or the actual handler class

Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Maybe the example code is trying to collect all versions, but the way it's done is incorrect. So, perhaps the correct code is:

versions = {v for c in cls for v in getattr(c, 'version', [])}

But again, this is problematic because if a class doesn't have a version attribute, it would default to an empty list, and the set would be empty.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should collect all versions correctly by checking if the version attribute exists.

So, the correct code would be:

versions = set()
for c in cls:
    version = getattr(c, 'version', None)
    if version is not None:
        versions.add(version)

Then, if protocol_version is None, return a dictionary with each version mapped to the handler class (which could be the class itself).

But in the example code, the line is using a dictionary comprehension that's incorrect. So, perhaps the correct code is:

Wait, but in the example code, the line is versions = {v for c in cls for v in (getattr(c, "version", () for _ in range(1)))}, which is wrong. So, perhaps the correct code is to collect versions correctly.

But the example code is wrong, so perhaps the user wants the correct code, not the example.

So, putting it all together, the correct code would be:

Wait, but in the example code, the line is versions = {v for c in cls for v in (getattr(c, "version", () for _ in range(1)))}, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the example code is wrong, and the correct code is as I wrote above.

Alternatively, perhaps the example code is trying to collect all versions from all classes, but it's doing it incorrectly. So, the correct code would collect versions correctly and handle the protocol_version parameter properly.

So, the final code would be as I wrote above, with the correct version collection and handling of protocol_version.
