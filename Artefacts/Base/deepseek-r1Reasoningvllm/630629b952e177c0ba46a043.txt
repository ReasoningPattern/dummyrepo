Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_nodeinfo_well_known_document and it takes two parameters: url and document_path, which has a default value of None. The docstring says it returns a formatted dictionary including information like url and document_path.

First, I'll start by writing the function definition. It should be in Python, so the syntax is straightforward. I'll make sure to set document_path to None by default.

Next, the function needs to return a dictionary. The docstring mentions including url and document_path, so I'll add those as keys. Since the function is supposed to return a formatted dictionary, I might assume that it should return something like {'url': ..., 'document_path': ...}.

I don't see any other parameters or return values mentioned, so the function is pretty simple. It doesn't need any processing or error handling unless specified, which it isn't. So I'll just return a dictionary with the two keys and the provided values.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this: it takes the url and document_path, and returns a dictionary with those two keys and their respective values. Since document_path is optional, if it's not provided, it will default to None.

I think that's all. The code should be concise and match the function signature exactly.
