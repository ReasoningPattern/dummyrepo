Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called names, with self as the first parameter, and a keyword argument all=False. The docstring says it returns the attribute names of the current class.

Hmm, so in Python, to get the attribute names of a class, I can use the __dict__ attribute, which returns a dictionary of the class's attributes. The keys of this dictionary are the attribute names. So, I should probably access self.__dict__.keys().

Wait, but if all is False, does that mean I should return something specific? Or maybe if all is True, it returns all attributes, including inherited ones? No, the default is all=False, so perhaps when all is False, it's returning only the current class's attributes, and when all is True, it includes everything from the hierarchy.

But looking at the function signature, the docstring only says it returns the attribute names of the current class. So maybe regardless of the all parameter, it's just getting the current class's attributes. Or perhaps the all parameter is for whether to include inherited attributes or not. But the problem statement doesn't specify that, so maybe the function is supposed to return the names of the attributes of the current class, and the all parameter is a placeholder.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a way to collect all attribute names, including those from superclasses when all=True. But without more context, I'll assume that when all=False, it returns the current class's attributes, and when all=True, it returns all attributes from the entire hierarchy.

But the docstring doesn't mention that, so maybe the all parameter is there for a different purpose. Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a metaclass or a class that tracks its own attributes.

But the simplest approach is to return self.__dict__.keys() when all is False, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to return all attributes, including those from the class's bases. So maybe using type(self).__dict__.keys() would include inherited attributes, but that's just a guess.

Wait, the function is named names, and the docstring says it returns the attribute names of the current class. So maybe regardless of the all parameter, it's just returning the current class's attributes. But the all parameter is present, so perhaps when all is True, it returns all attributes, including those from the bases, and when all is False, it returns only the current class's attributes.

But without more context, I'll proceed with the simplest approach. The function should return the attribute names of the current class. So, in the function, if all is True, perhaps we should collect attributes from all superclasses, but that might be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class that's designed to track its own attributes, and the all parameter is whether to include all attributes, including those inherited. But the docstring doesn't clarify that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the names of the attributes of the class itself, excluding inherited ones, which would be self.__dict__.keys(). So, perhaps the code is as simple as returning self.__dict__.keys() when all is False, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the function is intended to return the names of the attributes of the class, and if all=True, it includes all attributes, including those from the bases. So, maybe we need to check if all is True, and then collect all attributes from the class and its bases.

But that's more complex. Let me think: if all is True, then we need to get all the attributes from the class and all its parent classes. So, perhaps we can loop through the class hierarchy and collect all the attributes.

But that might be overcomplicating it. The problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is simply supposed to return the attribute names of the current class, and the all parameter is not used in the implementation. Or maybe the function is supposed to return the attribute names when all is True, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the function is part of a class that's supposed to track its own attributes, and the all parameter is whether to include all attributes, including those from the bases. So, the code would need to handle both cases.

But without more information, I'll proceed with the simplest approach. The function will return the attribute names of the current class. So, in the code, if all is False, return self.__dict__.keys(). If all is True, perhaps include all attributes from the class and its bases. But that's more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that's a dictionary itself, and self.__dict__ returns the attribute names. So, perhaps the code is straightforward.

Wait, looking back, the function is called names, so perhaps it's intended to return a list of the names of the attributes. So, the code would be something like:

if all:
    # collect attributes from all bases
else:
    # collect attributes from self

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the attribute names of the class, and when all is True, it returns all attributes, including those from the bases.

But perhaps the simplest code is to return self.__dict__.keys() when all is False, and if all is True, include attributes from all bases.

But that's getting complicated. Maybe the function is supposed to return the attribute names of the current class, regardless of all. So, perhaps the code is just:

return self.__dict__.keys()

But the function signature has all=False, so perhaps the code should handle that. Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a metaclass or a descriptor that collects attributes in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that's a container, and the names() method returns the names of its own attributes. So, in that case, the code would be:

return self.__dict__.keys()

But the problem is that the function is named names, and the docstring says it returns the attribute names of the current class. So, perhaps the code is simply:

return self.__dict__.keys()

But since the function has an all parameter, perhaps when all is True, it returns all attributes, including those from the bases. So, perhaps the code should check if all is True, and if so, collect all attributes from the class and its bases.

But that's more complex. Let's think: if all is True, we need to get all the attributes from the class and all its parent classes. So, perhaps we can loop through each class in the MRO and collect their __dict__ items.

But that could be time-consuming, but for the sake of completeness, perhaps it's better to include that.

So, the code would be:

if all:
    attributes = set()
    for cls in type(self).__mro__:
        attributes.update(cls.__dict__.keys())
    return list(attributes)
else:
    return list(self.__dict__.keys())

But that's a bit more involved. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is simply supposed to return self.__dict__.keys() regardless of the all parameter.

But given that the function is named names and the docstring says it returns the attribute names of the current class, I think the intended behavior is to return the current class's attribute names when all is False, and when all is True, return all attributes from the entire hierarchy.

So, putting it all together, the code would check if all is True, and if so, collect attributes from all bases, otherwise just from the current class.

So, the code would be:

def names(self, all=False):
    if all:
        attributes = set()
        for cls in type(self).__mro__:
            attributes.update(cls.__dict__.keys())
        return list(attributes)
    else:
        return list(self.__dict__.keys())

Wait, but in Python, __mro__ includes the class itself and its bases. So, for example, if the class inherits from Base, which in turn inherits from another class, __mro__ will include all of them.

So, this code should correctly collect all attribute names when all=True.

But perhaps the function is intended to return the attribute names of the current class, and when all=False, it's just the current class's attributes. So, the code would be as above.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that's a container, and self is an instance, but the function is supposed to return the attribute names of the class where the instance is defined. So, in that case, self.__class__.__dict__.keys() would be used.

But the code I wrote earlier should handle that.

So, putting it all together, the code is as follows.
