Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called check_digests_present_and_used, and it takes two parameters: manifest_files and digests_used. The docstring says it should check that all necessary digests are present and used, returning error() in the class.

First, I'll start by defining the function with the correct parameters. The function is instance method, so it should have 'self' as the first parameter.

Next, I need to import any necessary modules. Since the function deals with files and exceptions, I'll import os and unittest.mock for mocking file operations.

In the function, I'll open each file in manifest_files. For each file, I'll read its contents and extract digest information. I'll use a regex to find all occurrences of 'Digest:' followed by a number. For each match, I'll check if the corresponding digest is in digests_used. If any digest is missing, I'll raise an error.

I'll loop through all files and their digests. If all are found, I'll proceed without errors.

I should also handle cases where a file might not exist or raise an error if any unexpected content is found.

Finally, I'll add a docstring to the function that explains its purpose, arguments, and possible exceptions.
