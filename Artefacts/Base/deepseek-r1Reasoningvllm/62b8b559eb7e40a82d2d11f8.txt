Okay, I need to write a Python function called minimalBases that takes a parameter classes. The docstring says it returns all classes without subclasses as a list. So, I need to figure out what that means.

Hmm, classes without subclasses are base classes or interfaces that don't extend any other classes. So, I guess I need to traverse the class hierarchy for each class and check if they have any subclasses.

Wait, but how do I get the hierarchy? I remember that in Python, each class has a __mro__ attribute which is the Method Resolution Order. That includes all the classes that a class inherits from, including base classes and interfaces.

So, for each class in the input, I should look at its __mro__ and see if it has any subclasses. If a class doesn't have any subclasses in its MRO, except itself, then it's a base class without any subclasses.

Wait, but if a class has a subclass, then in its MRO, the next class after itself would be the subclass. So, for each class, I can check if the next class in the MRO after itself is None. If it's None, then it has no subclasses.

Alternatively, maybe I can check if the class's __mro__ has only itself and no other classes after it. So, for a given class, if len(class.__mro__) == 1, then it's a base class without any subclasses.

Wait, but the __mro__ includes all the bases, so if a class has no bases except itself, then the MRO length is 1. That would mean it's a base class with no subclasses.

So, the plan is: iterate over each class in the input classes. For each class, check if its __mro__ has a length of 1. If yes, then it's a base class without any subclasses, so include it in the result list.

But wait, what if the classes parameter is not a list? Oh, the function is defined to take 'classes' as a parameter, but it's not specified whether it's a list or not. So, perhaps the function should handle cases where 'classes' is not iterable. But the docstring says it returns a list, so maybe 'classes' is expected to be a list of classes.

So, in the code, I'll loop through each class in the 'classes' argument. For each class, get its __mro__, and if the length is 1, add it to the result list.

Wait, but if a class is a subclass of another class, then the MRO will have more than one element. So, checking if len(mro) == 1 correctly identifies classes that don't have any superclass except themselves.

So, the code would be something like:

result = []
for cls in classes:
    if len(cls.__mro__) == 1:
        result.append(cls)
return result

But wait, what about built-in types? For example, int's __mro__ includes int, int, ...? No, int is a built-in type and its __mro__ is just [int]. So, it should be included if it's in the classes.

But the function is designed to return all classes without subclasses, so built-in types would be included if they are in the input.

Wait, but what if the classes include instances? Because in Python, instances are not classes. So, perhaps the function expects that 'classes' is a list of class objects. So, perhaps the function should handle cases where 'classes' is not a list, but I think the function signature will enforce that since the parameter is named 'classes' and the function is supposed to return a list.

So, putting it all together, the function would loop through each class, check if its MRO has length 1, and collect those.

Another thing to consider: if the classes parameter is empty, it should return an empty list. That's handled automatically.

So, the code would be:

def minimalBases(classes):
    result = []
    for cls in classes:
        if len(cls.__mro__) == 1:
            result.append(cls)
    return result

Wait, but what if a class has a subclass but the subclass is also in the list? For example, if classes includes both a base class A and its subclass B. Then, A's MRO has B, so len is 2, so A is not added. But if B is in the list, its MRO includes B and its superclass A, so len is 2, so B is not added. That's correct because we only want classes without any subclasses, so only A would be added if it's in the list.

Wait, but if B is in the list, but B's MRO is [B, A], so len is 2, so B is not added. So, the function correctly excludes subclasses.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the code should be as written.
