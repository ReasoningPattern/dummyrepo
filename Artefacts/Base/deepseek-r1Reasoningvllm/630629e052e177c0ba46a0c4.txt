Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called parse_diaspora_webfinger and takes a document string as input, returning a dictionary. The docstring explains that the webfinger is obtained by reading the document in JSON format. Specifically, the value of hcard_url in the webfinger is the value of the href in the links of the document.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Parse the input document string as JSON. I'll use the json module for this.
2. Access the links dictionary from the parsed JSON.
3. For each link in the links dictionary, check if it has a 'href' attribute.
4. Collect all href values and assign them to the 'hcard_url' key in the resulting dictionary.

I should make sure to handle cases where links might not have a 'href' key, but according to the problem, each link should have a href. So, I can safely iterate through each link and get the href.

Putting it all together, I'll write a function that parses the JSON, extracts the hrefs from each link, and returns a dictionary with 'hcard_url' as the key and a list of hrefs as the value.

I should also make sure that the function returns a dictionary, even if there are no links. So, initializing 'hcard_url' with an empty list is a good idea.

Now, I'll write the code step by step, making sure to import json and define the function correctly.
