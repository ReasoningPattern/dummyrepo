Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me read the problem carefully.

The function is called status_str and it's an instance method because it has 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring says it should return a string by visiting the sorted self.messages list. For each element, it adds the prefix and the element.

So, first, I need to sort self.messages. That's straightforward using the sorted() function. But wait, do I need to modify the original list? Probably not, since the function just needs to iterate over it. So I'll create a sorted copy.

Next, I have to build a string by concatenating each message with the prefix. The prefix defaults to an empty string, so I should set it with a default value in the function parameters. That way, if no prefix is provided, it doesn't add anything extra.

I'll initialize an empty string, let's call it result. Then, I'll loop through each message in the sorted list. For each message, I'll add the prefix and the message to the result. But wait, how do I handle multiple messages? If there are multiple, I should separate them with commas. So after each concatenation, except the last one, I'll add a comma and a space.

Wait, but what if the sorted list is empty? Then the result would be an empty string. That's fine.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this. I'll sort self.messages, initialize the result, loop through each message, append to result with prefix, and add commas appropriately.

Let me write the code step by step. First, check if prefix is provided. Then sort the messages. Then build the string.

Wait, in the code, the sorted list is created each time, which is fine. Then, for each msg in sorted_messages, I add prefix and msg. If it's not the first iteration, I add a comma and a space.

Yes, that should work. So the code will be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    sorted_messages = sorted(self.messages)
    result = []
    for msg in sorted_messages:
        result.append(f"{prefix}{msg}")
    return ', '.join(result)

Wait, but using a list and then joining is more efficient than string concatenation in a loop. So that's better.

Alternatively, I could use a list comprehension with a generator expression inside join. Like this:

return ', '.join(f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted(self.messages))

That's concise and efficient. So the function can be written in a single line after sorting.

Putting it all together, the function becomes:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    return ', '.join(f"{prefix}{msg}" for msg in sorted(self.messages))

Wait, but what if the messages are empty? Then it returns an empty string, which is correct.

Yes, that should satisfy the requirements. The function sorts the messages, adds the prefix to each, and joins them with ', '.
