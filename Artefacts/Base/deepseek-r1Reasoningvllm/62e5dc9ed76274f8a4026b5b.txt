Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called deprecated and it's supposed to return a decorator function for deprecating functions and methods. 

Hmm, I remember that in Python, decorators are functions that take another function as an argument and return a new function. So, the deprecated function should return such a decorator.

Wait, the deprecated function's docstring says it's for deprecating functions and methods. So, the decorator it returns should add a deprecation warning when the decorated function is called.

I think the standard way to do this is to create a decorator inside the deprecated function. The decorator will wrap the actual function and check if it's already been wrapped. If not, it adds a deprecation warning and marks it as deprecated.

So, the structure would be:

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        # code here
        return wrapped_func
    return decorator

Inside the decorator, I need to check if func is already wrapped. If not, I add the deprecation message and set a wrapper function. The wrapper function will print the message when called and then call the original func.

Wait, but in the code I remember, sometimes people use a wrapper variable inside the decorator. So, the decorator function inside deprecated will define this wrapper and set it as a default argument. That way, each time the decorator is called, it checks if the wrapper exists. If it doesn't, it creates a new wrapper function that adds the deprecation message.

Putting it all together, the code should look like this:

def deprecated(message):
    def decorator(func):
        if not hasattr(func, 'deprecated'):
            func.deprecated = True
            wrapped_func = None
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                func.deprecated = True
                message = f"Deprecation warning: {func.__class__.__name__} is deprecated"
                raise DeprecationWarning(message)
            wrapped_func = wrapper
        return wrapped_func
    return decorator

Wait, but in the code I recall, the message is inserted into the exception. So, when the function is called, it raises a DeprecationWarning with the message. So, the wrapper function should raise this warning before calling the original function.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the decorator will add the warning and then call the original function. But in the code above, the wrapper function sets func.deprecated to True, which is a way to track if the function has been wrapped already. 

Alternatively, another approach is to have the wrapper function check if it's the first time and then add the warning. But the approach I have seems correct.

I think that's the correct code. It defines the deprecated function, which returns a decorator. The decorator checks if the function has been wrapped before, adds the deprecation message, and returns the wrapped function. When the function is called, it raises a DeprecationWarning with the message.
