Okay, so I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function is called add_rendition, and it takes two parameters: self and lang, and file_path. The docstring says that this function assigns the filepath from filepath() in the class to the "lang" key in _renditions.

Hmm, so I'm guessing that there's an instance variable _renditions which is probably a dictionary. The filepath() method probably returns a filepath string, and this function is setting that filepath under the key specified by lang in _renditions.

So, the function should probably access the filepath via the filepath() method of the instance. Then, it should update _renditions with lang as the key and the filepath as the value.

Wait, but in Python, to access an instance's method, I need to call it on the instance. So self.filepath() would give me the filepath string.

Then, I can assign this to _renditions by doing something like self._renditions[lang] = self.filepath().

Putting it all together, the function would look like this: inside the function, retrieve the filepath using self.filepath(), then assign it to the corresponding key in _renditions.

I should make sure that the code is properly indented and that all variables are correctly referenced. Also, I don't need to include any explanations or markdown, just the code.

So, the final code should be a single line inside the function that does this assignment.
