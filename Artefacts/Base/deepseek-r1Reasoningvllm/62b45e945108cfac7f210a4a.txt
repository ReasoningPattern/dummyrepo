Okay, so the user wants me to generate Python code based on a given function signature and docstring. They specified not to include any explanations or markdown, just the code. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the function signature. The function is called validate_hierarchy, and it's part of a class because it has the self parameter. The parameters are validate_objects, check_digests, and show_warnings, all with default values. The docstring explains what the function does and what it returns.

The function is supposed to validate the storage root hierarchy. So, it's likely checking if the objects in the storage are valid and maybe their relationships. The return values are num_objects and good_objects, which are counts.

I should think about how to structure this function. Since it's a validation function, I'll probably need to iterate over some collection, maybe the self's objects or something similar. Let me assume that the class has an objects attribute, like self.objects, which is a list or similar structure.

So, the function will loop through each object in self.objects. For each object, it will check if it's valid. If validate_objects is True, then each object's validate method should be called. Wait, but the function is called validate_hierarchy, so maybe each object has a validate method. So, for each obj in self.objects, I'll call obj.validate() if validate_objects is True.

Then, for each object, I need to check the digest. If check_digests is True, I'll compare the object's digest with the expected digest. If they don't match, the object is invalid. So, I'll keep track of how many objects pass both checks.

I'll also need to count how many objects are valid. So, for each object, if both checks pass, increment good_objects. Also, count the total number of objects checked, which is just the length of self.objects.

Now, about the warnings. If show_warnings is True and an object fails either check, I should print a warning message. But the user didn't specify how to handle warnings, just to show them if enabled. So, in the code, I'll add an if statement to check if show_warnings is True and either validate_objects or check_digests failed for that object.

Putting it all together, the function will:

1. Initialize num_objects and good_objects to 0.
2. Iterate over each object in self.objects.
3. For each object, if validate_objects is True, call obj.validate() and increment num_objects.
4. If check_digests is True, compare the digest and increment num_objects.
5. If both checks pass, increment good_objects.
6. If any check fails and show_warnings is True, print a warning.
7. After processing all objects, return num_objects and good_objects.

Wait, but in the function, do I need to handle cases where validate_objects is False? Probably, because if validate_objects is False, the function shouldn't validate the objects at all, but still check the digests if check_digests is True. Hmm, but the function's docstring says it returns the number of objects checked and valid. So, if validate_objects is False, maybe it's only checking the digests, but I'm not sure. The initial code I wrote assumes that if validate_objects is True, it checks the objects, else it doesn't. But perhaps the function should still check the digests regardless of validate_objects. So, I'll structure it so that validate_objects is a flag to check the object's validate method, and check_digests is a flag to check the digest.

Wait, but the function is called validate_hierarchy, so maybe it's more about the structure than individual objects. But without more context, I'll proceed with the initial approach.

So, the code will loop through each object, check if validate_objects is True to decide if to call validate(), then check digest if check_digests is True. For each check that fails, if show_warnings is True, print a warning. Then count the valid objects.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, writing the code:

Initialize counts to 0. Loop through each obj in self.objects. For each, if validate_objects is True, call validate and increment num_objects. Then, if check_digests is True, get the digest and compare. If not equal, increment num_objects. If both checks pass, increment good_objects. If any check failed and show_warnings is True, print a warning.

Wait, but in the code, I should handle the case where validate_objects is False. For example, if validate_objects is False, then the function shouldn't call obj.validate(), but still check the digest. So, the code should be structured to handle both flags independently.

So, in the loop:

if validate_objects:
    obj.validate()
    num_objects +=1
if check_digests:
    if obj.digest != self.expected_digest:
        num_objects +=1
        if show_warnings:
            print(f"Warning: Object {obj} has invalid digest")
    else:
        good_objects +=1

Wait, but this might not be the best way. Alternatively, for each object, check both conditions. So, for each obj:

if validate_objects:
    if not obj.validate():
        if show_warnings:
            print warning
        num_objects +=1
else:
    # don't check validate, but still check digest
    if check_digests:
        if obj.digest != self.expected_digest:
            num_objects +=1
            if show_warnings:
                print warning
        else:
            good_objects +=1

Hmm, but the function's docstring says it returns the number of objects checked and valid. So, perhaps the function counts an object as checked if either validate or digest is checked, but only as valid if both pass.

Alternatively, perhaps the function counts an object as checked if validate is True, and as valid only if both validate passes and digest passes.

Wait, the initial code I wrote increments num_objects for each check, which might not be correct. For example, if validate_objects is True, each object is checked once, so num_objects should be the length of self.objects if validate is True. But if validate is False, num_objects should still count the number of objects whose digest is checked.

Wait, perhaps the function's purpose is to check the hierarchy, which might involve checking the relationships between objects, not just individual object properties. But without more context, it's hard to say. So, perhaps the initial approach is acceptable.

In any case, I'll proceed with the code that loops through each object, checks validate if enabled, checks digest if enabled, and counts accordingly, printing warnings when necessary.

So, the code will be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self.objects:
        if validate_objects:
            if not obj.validate():
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} failed validation check")
                num_objects += 1
            else:
                if obj.digest == self.expected_digest:
                    good_objects += 1
                else:
                    if show_warnings:
                        print(f"Warning: Object {obj} has invalid digest")
                    num_objects += 1
        else:
            if check_digests:
                if obj.digest == self.expected_digest:
                    good_objects += 1
                else:
                    if show_warnings:
                        print(f"Warning: Object {obj} has invalid digest")
                    num_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to separate the checks:

For each object:
- If validate_objects is True, perform the validate() check. If it fails, increment num_objects and print warning if needed.
- If check_digests is True, compare digest. If it fails, increment num_objects and print warning if needed.
- If both checks pass, increment good_objects.

So, the code would be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self.objects:
        if validate_objects:
            if not obj.validate():
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} failed validation check")
                num_objects += 1
        if check_digests:
            if obj.digest != self.expected_digest:
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} has invalid digest")
                num_objects += 1
            else:
                good_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

Wait, but in this case, if validate_objects is True, the object's validate() method is called, and if it fails, num_objects is incremented. Then, regardless of that, if check_digests is True, the digest is checked. So, for an object that fails validate but has a correct digest, num_objects would be incremented twice, which might not be intended. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should count an object as checked only once, but that depends on the requirements. The docstring says it returns the number of objects checked, which might mean each object is checked once, regardless of how many checks are performed on it.

Wait, the initial code I wrote in the thought process was:

for each obj:
    if validate_objects:
        call validate, num_objects +=1
    if check_digests:
        compare digest, num_objects +=1
    if both checks passed:
        good_objects +=1

But that would count an object as checked twice if both flags are True. So, perhaps the function should count each object as checked once, and only increment num_objects once per object, regardless of how many checks are done.

So, perhaps the code should be:

for obj in self.objects:
    checked = False
    if validate_objects:
        if not obj.validate():
            if show_warnings:
                print warning
        checked = True
    if check_digests:
        if obj.digest != self.expected_digest:
            if show_warnings:
                print warning
        else:
            good_objects +=1
    if not checked and check_digests:
        num_objects +=1
    elif checked:
        num_objects +=1
    else:
        num_objects +=0

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the function is intended to count each object as checked once, and whether it's valid depends on both checks passing.

So, perhaps the function should:

- For each object, if validate_objects is True, perform validate(). If it fails, count as checked and invalid. If validate is True and passes, then check digest. If digest passes, count as good. If digest fails, count as checked but not good.

- If validate_objects is False, then only check digest if check_digests is True. If so, count as checked, and if digest passes, count as good.

So, the code would be:

def validate_hierarchy(self, validate_objects=True, check_digests=True, show_warnings=False):
    num_objects = 0
    good_objects = 0
    for obj in self.objects:
        if validate_objects:
            if not obj.validate():
                if show_warnings:
                    print(f"Warning: Object {obj} failed validation check")
                num_objects += 1
            else:
                if check_digests:
                    if obj.digest == self.expected_digest:
                        good_objects += 1
                    else:
                        if show_warnings:
                            print(f"Warning: Object {obj} has invalid digest")
                        num_objects += 1
        else:
            if check_digests:
                if obj.digest == self.expected_digest:
                    good_objects += 1
                else:
                    if show_warnings:
                        print(f"Warning: Object {obj} has invalid digest")
                    num_objects += 1
    return num_objects, good_objects

This way, each object is checked once, and if validate_objects is True, it goes through both checks. If validate is False, only digest is checked. The num_objects is incremented only once per object, either for validate failure or digest failure.

I think this approach makes more sense. So, the code will loop through each object, check validate if enabled, then check digest if enabled, and count accordingly, printing warnings where necessary.
