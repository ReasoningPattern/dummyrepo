Okay, I need to write a Python function called difference that takes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, and an optional level parameter. The function should return a new dictionary containing items from d1 that are not present in d2. 

First, I'll look at the parameters. The function signature is given as def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):, so I don't need to change that. The docstring explains that it returns items from d1 not in d2, so I need to ensure the function behaves that way.

I should consider what "not contained in" means. Does it mean the key is not present, or the key-value pair is not present? The docstring isn't clear, but the example given in the previous response suggests it's about keys. So, I'll proceed under the assumption that we're comparing keys, not the entire key-value pairs.

The level parameter is set to -1 by default. I'm not sure what level does, but since it's not used in the initial implementation, maybe it's for nested structures or something else. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll ignore it for now and just return the keys from d1 that aren't in d2.

So, the steps are:
1. Iterate over each key in d1.
2. Check if the key is not present in d2.
3. If the key isn't in d2, include it in the result.

I can create an empty dictionary, result. Then loop through d1's keys. For each key, if key not in d2, add it to result.

Putting it together, the code would look like:

def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
    result = {}
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            result[key] = d1[key]
    return result

I think that's straightforward. I should test it with some examples to make sure. For instance, if d1 is {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, d2 is {'b': 2, 'c':3}, the result should be {'a':1}. That should work with the code above.

I don't see any issues with this approach. The level parameter isn't used, but since it's optional, the function still works as intended without it. So, this should be the correct implementation.
