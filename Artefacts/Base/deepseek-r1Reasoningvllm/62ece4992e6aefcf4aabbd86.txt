Okay, I need to write a Python function called _dump_string that takes an object and a dumper, and returns a YAML stream. The user provided a function signature and a docstring, so I should base my code on that.

First, I'll look at the parameters. The function has 'obj' and 'dumper' as arguments. The docstring says 'obj' is a Python object and 'dumper' is optional, defaulting to None. So I'll make sure the function definition matches that.

Next, the function is supposed to serialize the object into a YAML stream. I know that the yaml module in Python is used for YAML serialization. So I'll probably need to import yaml.

Wait, the function returns a YAML stream. In Python, a stream is usually a file-like object. But the function doesn't take any file descriptors, so maybe it's intended to return a string instead. Or perhaps the user expects it to be used in a context where a stream is expected, like a file object.

Looking at the example code the user provided, the function uses yaml.safe_dump. That's a good approach because it's safe and handles various data types. So I'll use yaml.safe_dump.

The function should yield the YAML representation. Using a generator with yield makes sense here. So I'll have a generator that yields each line of the serialized YAML.

Putting it all together, I'll import yaml, define the function, and use a generator expression that yields each line from yaml.safe_dump.

I should also handle cases where the dumper is None. If dumper is None, I'll default to using yaml.safe_dump. Otherwise, I'll pass the dumper to it.

Wait, the function signature the user provided has 'dumper=None', so in the code, I can check if dumper is None. If it is, use yaml.safe_dump(obj, stream, dumper=yaml.Dumper). Hmm, no, wait. The 'dumper' parameter in yaml.safe_dump is actually theumperizer, not the dumper. So if the user provides a dumper, I should pass it to yaml.safe_dump.

Alternatively, if dumper is None, I'll use the default dumper, which is yaml.Dumper. So the code inside the generator would be: for line in yaml.safe_dump(obj, dumper=dumper) if dumper is not None else yaml.safe_dump(obj).

Wait, no. The 'dumper' parameter in yaml.safe_dump is theumperizer, which is different from the Dumper class. So if the user provides a dumper, I should pass it to yaml.safe_dump. Otherwise, use the default.

So the code inside the generator should be: for line in yaml.safe_dump(obj, dumper=dumper) if dumper is not None else yaml.safe_dump(obj).

But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I can set the dumper to yaml.Dumper if it's None. So something like: dumper = dumper or yaml.Dumper.

Wait, but the 'dumper' parameter is supposed to be a function, right? Because in yaml.safe_dump, you can pass a function as the dumper. So if the user passes a dumper function, we should use it; otherwise, use the default.

So in the code, I can set dumper = dumper if dumper is not None else yaml.Dumper.

Then, for each line in yaml.safe_dump(obj, dumper=dumper), I yield it.

Putting it all together, the function will look like this:

Import yaml.

Define the function with the given signature.

Inside, set dumper to the provided dumper if not None, else use yaml.Dumper.

Then, yield each line from yaml.safe_dump(obj, dumper=dumper).

So the code is:

import yaml

def _dump_string(obj, dumper=None):
    dumper = dumper if dumper is not None else yaml.Dumper
    for line in yaml.safe_dump(obj, dumper=dumper):
        yield line

Wait, but in the example code, the function uses a generator that yields each line. So this should work.

I think that's the correct approach. So the final code is as written.
