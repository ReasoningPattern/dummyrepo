Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called get_parser_option_specs and it takes a command_name as a parameter. The docstring says it returns a list of all the command options.

First, I remember that in Python, to get command line options, we can use the sys module, specifically sys.argv. But for parsing options, the getopt module is more useful. Alternatively, the inspect module can be used to get arguments from functions.

Since the function is part of a class, perhaps it's dealing with command-line arguments defined in the same class. So using inspect makes sense because it can introspect the method and extract its arguments.

I should import inspect at the top. Then, inside the function, I'll use inspect.signature to get the signature of the method. The parameters will be in sig.parameters.

Next, I'll loop through each parameter. If the parameter kind is inspect.Parameter.VAR_POSITIONAL, it's a *args parameter. If it's inspect.Parameter.VAR_KEYWORD, it's **kwargs. I should skip these as they aren't options.

For other parameters, I'll check if they start with a flag character like '-', which indicates they are options. I'll collect these option names into a list.

Finally, I'll return the sorted list of these option names to ensure consistency.

Putting it all together, I'll write the code with the necessary imports and structure. I'll make sure to handle all the cases correctly and return the list as required.
