Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _inline_r_setup, takes a code string as input, and returns a string. The docstring explains that some R behaviors can't be configured via environment variables but only via R options once R is started, and this function sets those configurations.

Hmm, I remember that in R, you can use the options() function to set parameters. But how do I call R's options from Python? Oh right, the rpy2 library has a module called rpy2.robjects, and there's an options function there. So I'll need to import that.

Wait, the function is supposed to take code as a string. So I should parse that string into R code. Maybe using eval to execute the code in the R environment. But I need to make sure that the R session is active. I think rpy2's require() function can be used for that.

Putting it together, the steps are: import rpy2.robjects(options), then evaluate the code string within the R context. So the code inside the function would be something like rpy2.robjects(options).eval(code). Then, I need to return that as a string. Since eval returns an R object, converting it to a string using str() should work.

So the function will import the necessary module, evaluate the code, and return the string representation of the result. I should make sure to handle any potential errors, but since the user didn't specify error handling, I'll assume it's not required here.

Wait, should I include any setup for the R session? Like initializing it? The require() function should handle that when evaluating the code. So I don't need to do anything else besides evaluating the code and converting it to a string.

So the final code will import rpy2.robjects(options), then return the evaluated code as a string. I'll structure it as a function that takes code and returns the string.
