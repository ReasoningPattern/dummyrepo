Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called status_str and it's an instance method because it has 'self' as the first parameter. The docstring explains that it should return a string representation using self.log.status_str with an optional prefix. 

First, I should think about how to structure the function. The function takes 'self' and an optional parameter 'prefix' which defaults to an empty string. So the function definition will be def status_str(self, prefix=''):

Now, inside the function, I need to concatenate the prefix with the result of self.log.status_str. Since both are strings, I can just add them together. So the return statement would be return prefix + self.log.status_str().

Wait, but what if self.log.status_str() returns something that's not a string? Well, the function is supposed to return a string representation, so I assume self.log.status_str() returns a string. So concatenating with the prefix should work fine.

I should make sure that the function is properly indented. Since it's a method, it should be indented under the class definition. But since the code template isn't provided, I'll just include the function as is.

Putting it all together, the function will take the optional prefix, add it to the result of self.log.status_str, and return the combined string.
