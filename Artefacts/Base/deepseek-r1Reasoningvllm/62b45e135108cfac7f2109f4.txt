Okay, so the user wants me to generate some Python code based on a given function signature and docstring. They specifically mentioned that I shouldn't include any explanations or markdown, just the code. Let me break this down.

First, looking at the function signature: it's a method called is_valid, taking an identifier as an argument. The docstring says it returns True if the identifier is valid, but in the base implementation, it always returns True. So the task is straightforwardâ€”implement this method.

I need to make sure the code is in Python and follows the correct syntax. Since it's a method, it should be indented under a class. The function body is simple: just return True.

Wait, the user also mentioned using Python markdown format. Hmm, but the output should be the code itself, not markdown. So I'll write the code as a function inside a class, using proper indentation with four spaces or a tab, but in Python, indentation is usually four spaces.

Putting it all together, the code will define a class with a method is_valid that takes self and identifier, then returns True. I should make sure there are no typos and that the syntax is correct. Also, since the user emphasized not to include any extra explanations, I'll just output the code as is.
