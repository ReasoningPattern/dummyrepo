Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called gaussian and takes a parameter x. The docstring says it calculates a Gaussian centered with u=0.2 and sigma=0.1. 

First, I remember that the formula for a Gaussian function is (1/(sigma*sqrt(2*pi))) * exp(-(x-u)^2 / (2*sigma^2)). So I'll need to compute this.

I should import math to use sqrt and pi. Wait, does the function need to import anything else? Maybe just math.

So the function will calculate the exponent part first. The exponent is -(x - u)^2 divided by (2 * sigma squared). Then multiply by the normalization factor.

Putting it all together, the code inside the function will be:

return (1/(sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp(-(x - u)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))

Wait, but in the function, u and sigma are given as 0.2 and 0.1. So I can assign those values at the beginning of the function.

So, inside the function, first set u=0.2 and sigma=0.1. Then compute the exponent and the normalization.

Putting it all together, the function becomes:

import math

def gaussian(x):
    u = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    exponent = -(x - u)**2 / (2 * sigma**2)
    return (1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp(exponent)

Alternatively, I can compute it in one line, but it's clearer to break it down.

Wait, do I need to handle any edge cases? Probably not, as the function is straightforward.

So the final code includes the import, the function with u and sigma set, computes the exponent, and returns the result.
