Okay, I need to write a Python function called get_repo_archive based on the given docstring and function signature. The function takes a URL and a destination path, and it's supposed to download the .tar.gz archive, extract it, and return the path where it's extracted. 

First, I'll start by importing necessary modules. I'll definitely need requests to download the file and tarfile to decompress the archive. So I'll import requests and tarfile.

Next, I'll define the function with the given parameters: url as a string and destination_path as a Path. The function returns a Path object, which is the extracted directory.

I should handle the HTTP request first. Using requests.get, I'll download the file from the given URL. I'll set the stream parameter to True so that the file is downloaded in chunks, which is efficient for large files. I'll also catch any HTTP errors by wrapping the request in a try-except block, specifically catching exceptions that aren't okay responses.

Once the file is downloaded, I need to write it to the destination_path. But I have to make sure to handle the file opening correctly. Using with open ensures that the file is properly closed after writing. I'll open the destination in binary mode, probably using 'wb' since the file is likely in bytes.

Then, I need to extract the contents of the .tar.gz archive. I'll use tarfile.open to do this. Since the archive is a .tar.gz file, the mode should be 'gzipped' to handle the .gz extension properly. I'll pass the file object to tarfile.open and then extract all the members into the destination_path. Using 'dest_dir' ensures that the extraction happens in the specified directory.

I should also make sure that the destination_path exists. If it doesn't, creating it might be necessary, but the function doesn't specify that, so perhaps it's the caller's responsibility. Alternatively, I could create it here, but the docstring doesn't mention it, so I'll skip that unless required.

Finally, the function returns the Path object representing the extracted directory, which is destination_path in this case.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the code step by step, making sure each part is handled properly. I'll test each part in my mind: downloading, writing, extracting, and returning. I think that's all the necessary steps. I should also ensure that the code is clean and follows best practices, like using context managers for file operations.
