Okay, I need to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called _get_resource_name_regex and it's supposed to return regular expressions used to validate resource names for Krake.

First, I should think about what kind of resources Krake might have. Common resources could be things like "node", "edge", "graph", "schema", "db", etc. So the regex needs to match these possible resource names.

I should create a list of valid resource names. Let's list some possibilities: 'node', 'edge', 'graph', 'schema', 'db', 'project', ' dataset', 'db', 'graph', 'edge', 'node', 'schema'. Wait, maybe I can make it more general. For example, resource names might start with a lowercase letter, followed by letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens. But I also need to exclude reserved words or make sure they don't match unintended terms.

But since the function is meant to validate resource names, perhaps it's better to create a regex that matches exact predefined resource names. So I'll compile a list of these names.

Let me list them out: 'node', 'edge', 'graph', 'schema', 'db', 'project', 'dataset', 'db', 'graph', 'edge', 'node', 'schema'. Wait, I see some duplicates there, but I can just have each unique name once.

So I'll create a regex pattern that matches any of these exact strings. The pattern should be case-sensitive since resource names are typically lowercase in many frameworks.

Putting it all together, the regex pattern would be r'\b(node|edge|graph|schema|db|project|dataset)\b'. The word boundaries ensure that we don't match parts of longer words, like 'graphic' or 'database'.

I'll compile this pattern into a regular expression object and return it as a list containing a single regex.

So the function will import re, create the pattern, compile it, and return the compiled regex as a list. The return value is a list with one regex object.

I think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
