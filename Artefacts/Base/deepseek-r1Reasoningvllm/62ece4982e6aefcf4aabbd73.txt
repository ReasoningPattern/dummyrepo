Okay, I need to write a Python function called split that takes a string s and a platform argument with a default value of 'this'. The function should split the string based on the platform specified. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, the split function can take a separator, but here it's more about the end-of-line characters. The platform determines whether to use Windows-style splitting (CRLF) or Unix-style (LF) or to auto-detect.

So, if platform is 'this', I need to detect the current operating system. On Windows, the line endings are CRLF, and on Unix-like systems, they're LF. So, I can check the system's platform using sys.platform. But wait, sys.platform gives 'win32' for Windows, 'darwin' for macOS, and ' unix' for Linux. Hmm, maybe using os.name would be better because os.name returns 'nt' for Windows, 'posix' for Unix, and 'unknown' for others. That might be more reliable.

Next, if the platform is 1, I should split on LF characters. If it's 0, I should split on CRLF. Otherwise, for 'this', I'll auto-detect based on the OS.

Wait, but the default is 'this', so in that case, the function should split using the appropriate line endings based on the current platform. So, I can set a default behavior when platform is 'this' to split using the OS's line endings.

So, the steps are:

1. Import necessary modules: sys and os.
2. Check the platform. If platform is 1, split on '\n'. If 0, split on '\r\n'. If 'this', determine the OS and split accordingly.
3. Use s.split(separator) to get the list of lines.

Let me structure the code. I'll start by importing os and sys. Then, in the function, determine the separator based on the platform.

Wait, but the function is called split, and the default is 'this', so the code should handle all cases.

Putting it all together, the code will:

- Check if platform is 1: split on '\n'.
- Else if platform is 0: split on '\r\n'.
- Else (platform is 'this'): check os.name and split accordingly.

I think that's the plan. Now, write the code accordingly.
