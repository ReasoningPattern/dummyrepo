Okay, I need to write a Python function called find_path_type that takes a path as an argument and returns a string indicating the type of thing at that path. Let's think about what the function should do.

First, the function's purpose is to determine the type of the object at the given path. But wait, what's a path here? In Python, a path could be a string, a list, a dictionary, or maybe an object. But the function needs to handle different types of paths.

Wait, the function's docstring says "the given path" but doesn't specify what kind of path. So maybe the path is a string that represents a path in a data structure, like a directory or a file, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary or a list index.

But the function's purpose is to return the type of the thing at the path. So perhaps the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary, and the function needs to check the type of the value at that key. Or maybe the path is a list index, and the function needs to return the type of the element at that index.

Wait, but the function's name is find_path_type. So maybe the path is a string that represents a path in a data structure, like a list or a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", it might refer to the first element of a list. But how does the function know which data structure to look into?

Hmm, this is a bit unclear. The problem statement isn't very specific. Let me think again.

The function's docstring says "the type of thing at the given path". So the function is supposed to determine the type of the object at the path. But without knowing what the path refers to, how can the function know?

Wait, maybe the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", it might be the first element of a list, but if it's a key in a dictionary, then the function would look up the value at that key.

But the function's parameters are just a single argument, the path. So perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary, and the function is supposed to look up the value at that key and return its type.

Alternatively, maybe the path is a list index, and the function is supposed to return the type of the element at that index.

But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the function's name suggests that it's about determining the type of the thing at a path, which could be a string, a list, a dictionary, or an object.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", it's the first element of a list, but if it's a key in a dictionary, then the function would look up the value at that key and return its type.

But how does the function know which data structure to look into? The problem statement doesn't specify. So perhaps the function is supposed to assume that the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary, and the function is supposed to return the type of the value at that key.

Alternatively, maybe the path is a list index, and the function returns the type of the element at that index.

But without knowing the actual data structure, it's impossible to know. However, the function's name suggests that it's about determining the type of the object at the path, which could be any data structure.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", it's the first element of a list, but if it's a key in a dictionary, then the function would look up the value at that key and return its type.

But how does the function know which data structure to look into? The problem statement doesn't specify. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a path in a file system, like a directory or a file. But that's not Python-specific.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", it's the first element of a list, but if it's a key in a dictionary, then the function would look up the value at that key and return its type.

But again, without knowing the data structure, it's impossible to know. However, the function's name suggests that it's about determining the type of the object at the path, which could be any data structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a list index. For example, if the path is "0", it's the first element of a list, and the function returns the type of that element.

But how does the function know which list to look at? The problem statement doesn't specify.

This is a bit of a puzzle. Since the problem statement is not very clear, perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, assuming that the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", it's the first element of a list, but if it's a key in a dictionary, then the function would look up the value at that key and return its type.

But without knowing the data structure, it's impossible to proceed. However, perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, regardless of the data structure. For example, if the path is a string, return str, if it's a list, return list, etc.

But that's not possible because the path could be any object. So maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", it's the first element of a list, but if it's a key in a dictionary, then the function would look up the value at that key and return its type.

But again, without knowing the data structure, it's impossible to know. However, perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, assuming that the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. So the function would look up the value at that key and return its type.

But how to implement that? Let's assume that the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", then the function would look up the value at key "0" in a dictionary. But the problem is that the function doesn't have access to the dictionary. So maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary, and the function is supposed to return the type of the value at that key.

But how to implement that? The function would need to have access to the dictionary. However, the function is supposed to be a standalone function, so perhaps the dictionary is passed as an argument. But the function's signature is given as def find_path_type(path):, so the function is supposed to take the path as an argument.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", then the function would look up the value at key "0" in a dictionary and return its type.

But without knowing the dictionary, how can the function do that? This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the path itself. For example, if the path is a string, return str, if it's a list, return list, etc.

But that's not possible because the path could be any object. For example, if the path is a list, then the function would return list, but if the path is a string, it would return str. However, the function's name suggests that it's about the type of the thing at the path, not the path itself.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", then the function would look up the value at key "0" in a dictionary and return its type. But again, without knowing the dictionary, this is impossible.

This is a bit of a dead end. Maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the path itself. For example, if the path is a string, return str, if it's a list, return list, etc. But that's not possible because the path could be any object.

Wait, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", then the function would look up the value at key "0" in a dictionary and return its type. But how to implement that?

Perhaps the function is supposed to assume that the path is a key in a dictionary, and the function is supposed to return the type of the value at that key. But since the function doesn't have access to the dictionary, this is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the path itself. For example, if the path is a string, return str, if it's a list, return list, etc. But that's not possible because the path could be any object.

This is really confusing. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the path itself. For example, if the path is a string, return str, if it's a list, return list, etc. But how to determine the type of the path?

Wait, in Python, the type of a variable can be determined using the type() function. So, for example, type("hello") is str, type([1,2,3]) is list, etc. So maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the path itself.

But the function's name is find_path_type, which suggests that it's about the type of the thing at the path. So if the path is a string, the function returns str. If the path is a list, returns list. If the path is a dictionary, returns dict. If the path is an integer, returns int, etc.

But how to determine the type of the path? Well, in Python, the type of the path can be determined using type(path). So perhaps the function is supposed to return type(path).

But that's too simple. The function's docstring says "the type of thing at the given path", which could imply that the path is a key in a dictionary, and the function is supposed to return the type of the value at that key. But without knowing the dictionary, this is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the path itself. For example, if the path is a string, return str, if it's a list, return list, etc. But that's just returning the type of the path.

But then, the function's name would be misleading. The function would return the type of the path, not the type of the thing at the path.

This is really confusing. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the path itself. So, the code would be:

def find_path_type(path):
    return type(path)

But that seems too simple. However, given the lack of information, that's the only possible way.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the object at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", then the function would look up the value at key "0" in a dictionary and return its type. But without knowing the dictionary, this is impossible.

But perhaps the function is supposed to assume that the path is a key in a dictionary, and the function is supposed to return the type of the value at that key. However, since the function doesn't have access to the dictionary, this is impossible.

Therefore, given the ambiguity, the most straightforward answer is to return the type of the path itself. So the code would be:

def find_path_type(path):
    return type(path)

But maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the thing at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", then the function would look up the value at key "0" in a dictionary and return its type. But without knowing the dictionary, this is impossible.

In that case, perhaps the function is supposed to return the type of the path, which is the same as the type of the object at the path. So, the code would be as above.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the path, but the path is a string that represents a list index. For example, if the path is "0", then the function returns the type of the element at index 0. But again, without knowing the list, this is impossible.

Given all this, the most reasonable answer is to return the type of the path itself. So the code is:

def find_path_type(path):
    return type(path)

But maybe the function is supposed to return the type of the thing at the path, but the path is a string that represents a key in a dictionary. For example, if the path is "0", then the function would look up the value at key "0" in a dictionary and return its type. But since the function doesn't have access to the dictionary, this is impossible.

Therefore, the answer must be the simplest possible, which is to return the type of the path itself.
