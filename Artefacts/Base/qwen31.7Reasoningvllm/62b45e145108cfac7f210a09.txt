Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function check_digests_present_and_used. Let's see what the docstring says. The function takes two arguments: manifest_files and digests_used. The goal is to check that all digests in the manifest that are needed are present and used. If any are missing or not used, it should return an error() in the class.

First, I need to figure out how to approach this. The function is part of a class, so I assume it's a method. The parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. The digest_used is probably a set or a list of digests that have been used. The manifest_files might be a list of files or some kind of manifest data.

Wait, the docstring says "all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So, the function needs to check that for each digest in the manifest, it's present and used. But how are the manifests structured? Maybe the manifest_files is a list of manifests, each containing digests. Or maybe the manifest_files is a single manifest, and digests_used is the set of digests that have been used.

Hmm. The function's purpose is to check that all required digests are present and used. So, perhaps the manifest_files contains the required digests, and digests_used is the set of digests that have been used. The function needs to verify that every digest in the manifest is present in digests_used.

Wait, but the function's parameters are named manifest_files and digests_used. Maybe manifest_files is a list of manifests, each of which has digests. The function needs to check that all digests in all manifest_files are present in digests_used. Or maybe the manifest_files is a single manifest, and digests_used is the set of used digests. But the docstring isn't clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to check that all digests in the digests_used set are present in the manifest_files. But that's not clear. The docstring says "all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So, the manifest contains some digests that are needed, and the function checks that those digests are present and used.

But without knowing the exact structure of the manifest_files, it's a bit tricky. Maybe the manifest_files is a list of digests, and digests_used is the set of used digests. The function needs to check that all digests in manifest_files are present in digests_used.

Wait, but the function's name is check_digests_present_and_used. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that all digests in the digests_used set are present in the manifest_files. But that's the opposite of what the docstring says. The docstring says that the digests in the manifest (needed) are present and used. So maybe the manifest_files contains the required digests, and digests_used is the set of used ones. The function needs to check that all digests in manifest_files are in digests_used.

But how to implement this. Let's think. The function should check that every digest in manifest_files is present in digests_used. If any is missing, return an error. So, the code would be something like:

for digest in manifest_files:
    if digest not in digests_used:
        return error()

But wait, the function is supposed to return error() in the class. So perhaps the function is supposed to raise an error, or return an instance of error. But since the user hasn't provided the error class, maybe we can assume that the function returns a specific error object, but the code needs to be written in Python.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, without any explanation. So the code should be written as per the function's parameters and docstring.

So, the code would be:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    """
    Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class.
    """
    # Check that all digests in manifest_files are present in digests_used
    for digest in manifest_files:
        if digest not in digests_used:
            # Raise an error, but since the user says to return error(), maybe raise an error object
            # Assuming error is a class with a method or something
            # But since the user didn't provide the error class, perhaps we can just raise an exception
            # But the docstring says return error(), so maybe return an error object
            # However, without knowing the exact error class, perhaps we can just raise an exception
            # But the user says to return error(), so maybe the function is supposed to return an error object
            # For the purpose of this code, let's assume that the function raises an error
            raise ValueError(f"Digest {digest} is not present in digests_used")

But the docstring says "return error() in the class." So perhaps the function is supposed to return an error object, but since the error class isn't provided, maybe the code just raises an exception. However, the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code should raise an error.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to check that all digests in digests_used are present in the manifest_files. But that's the opposite of what the docstring says. The docstring says "all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used." So the manifest contains the needed digests, and the function checks that they are present and used.

But without knowing the exact structure of manifest_files, it's hard to say. However, the function's parameters are manifest_files and digests_used. So, perhaps the manifest_files is a list of digests that are needed, and digests_used is the set of digests that have been used. The function needs to check that all digests in manifest_files are present in digests_used.

So, the code would be:

for digest in manifest_files:
    if digest not in digests_used:
        raise ValueError(f"Digest {digest} is not present in digests_used")

But the docstring says to return error(), so maybe the function is supposed to return an error object. However, since the error class isn't provided, perhaps the code just raises an exception. But the user's instruction says to generate code that returns error(), so maybe the code should return an error object. However, without knowing the exact error class, perhaps the code can just raise an exception.

But the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So, the code would be:

def check_digests_present_and_used(self, manifest_files, digests_used):
    """
    Check all digests in manifest that are needed are present and used. Return error() in the class.
    """
    for digest in manifest_files:
        if digest not in digests_used:
            raise ValueError(f"Digest {digest} is not present in digests_used")

But the docstring says "return error()", so perhaps the function is supposed to return an error object. However, since the error class isn't provided, maybe the code just raises an exception. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a specific error object, but without knowing that, the code can't be written. Therefore, the code would raise an exception.

So, the final code would be as above.
