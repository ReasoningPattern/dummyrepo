Okay, I need to generate the Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The function is called popitem and is part of a class. The docstring says it removes the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value as a tuple. So, the method should remove the first key-value pair and return them.

Wait, but in Python, dictionaries have a popitem() method which removes and returns the last inserted key-value pair. However, the docstring here says it should return the first inserted. So maybe the user expects a custom implementation, not using the built-in dict's popitem.

But the question says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So I need to implement popitem as per the docstring's description, not using the built-in dict's popitem.

So, the method should remove the first inserted key. But how does the dictionary store keys? If the dictionary is implemented with a list of keys, then the first inserted key would be at index 0. But if the dictionary is a regular dict, then popitem() removes the last inserted. So the user probably wants a custom implementation.

But the problem is, the user hasn't specified the data structure. The function is part of a class, so maybe the class has a specific data structure. But since the docstring doesn't mention it, perhaps the class has a list of key-value pairs, and popitem removes the first one.

But without knowing the exact implementation, I need to make an assumption. Let's assume that the class has a dictionary-like structure where the first inserted key is at the beginning of the dictionary. But that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the class has a list of items, and popitem removes the first item.

Alternatively, maybe the class is a custom dictionary where the keys are stored in a list, and the first inserted key is at index 0. So, when popitem is called, it removes the first key and returns it.

But how to implement that. Let's think.

Suppose the class has a __dict__ attribute that's a dictionary, and the keys are stored in a list. For example, the class might have a list of keys, and the first inserted key is at index 0. So, when popitem is called, it removes the first key from the list and returns it.

But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the class structure. So, perhaps the class has a __dict__ attribute that's a dictionary, and the popitem method is supposed to remove the first inserted key.

Wait, but in Python, the default dict's popitem removes the last inserted. So, if the user wants to remove the first inserted, they need to implement it manually.

So, the code would need to track the order of insertion. For example, the class could have a list of keys, and when a new key is added, it's appended to the list. Then, popitem would remove the first element (index 0) and return it.

But how to implement that. Let's think.

Assuming the class has a __dict__ attribute that's a dictionary, and the keys are stored in a list. For example:

class MyDict:
    def __init__(self):
        self._keys = []
        self._dict = {}

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if key not in self._dict:
            self._keys.append(key)
        self._dict[key] = value

    def popitem(self):
        if not self._keys:
            raise KeyError("Dictionary is empty")
        key = self._keys.pop(0)
        value = self._dict.pop(key)
        return (key, value)

But this is just an example. The actual implementation would depend on the class's structure. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is def popitem(self):, and the docstring says it removes the first inserted key and returns the key and value as a tuple.

So, the code would need to track the order of insertion. Since the user hasn't provided the class structure, I need to make an assumption. The most straightforward way is to use a list to track the keys in insertion order, and when popitem is called, remove the first element (index 0) and return it.

But in Python, the standard way to track insertion order is to use a OrderedDict. However, the problem might expect a simple implementation.

So, the code would look like:

def popitem(self):
    if not self._keys:
        raise KeyError("Dictionary is empty")
    key = self._keys.pop(0)
    value = self._dict.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But since the user hasn't provided the class structure, I need to assume that the class has a _keys list and a _dict dictionary. However, the function signature is def popitem(self):, so the code would be written as such.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    """
    Remove the value corresponding to the first inserted key and returns the key and value in tuple format.
    """
    if not self._keys:
        raise KeyError("Dictionary is empty")
    key = self._keys.pop(0)
    value = self._dict.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But the actual implementation would depend on the class's internal data structures. However, since the user hasn't provided that, this is the best assumption.

So, the code would be as above. But the user might expect that the class has a specific data structure. However, without more info, this is the best possible answer.
