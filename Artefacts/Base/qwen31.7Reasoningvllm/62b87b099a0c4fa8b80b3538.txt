Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_fill_request_el that checks if an object has the fill and request attributes. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is supposed to return True if the object has both 'fill' and 'request' attributes. So, I should check if both exist. In Python, I can use the hasattr() function for each attribute.

So the function would check if hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request'). If both are true, return True; else, False.

Wait, but what if the attributes are not present? The function just needs to check their presence. So the code would be straightforward.

Putting it all together: the function defines two checks using hasattr, and returns the logical AND of both.

So the code would be:

def is_fill_request_el(obj):
    return hasattr(obj, 'fill') and hasattr(obj, 'request')

That's it. No explanations, just the code.
