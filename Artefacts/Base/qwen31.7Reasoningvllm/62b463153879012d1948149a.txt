Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _group_files_by_xml_filename based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The docstring says it groups files by xmls and returns data in a dict format. Hmm, the parameters are source, xmls, and files. Wait, the function is named _group_files_by_xml_filename, which suggests it's a private method, maybe in a class. But the parameters are source, xmls, and files. 

So, the function needs to take these three parameters. The goal is to group the files based on the xmls. But what does "xmls" mean here? Maybe it's a list of XML filenames, and the function is supposed to group the files (probably the files parameter) by those XML filenames. 

Wait, the function is called _group_files_by_xml_filename. Maybe the 'xmls' parameter is a list of XML filenames, and the 'files' parameter is a list of file names. The function should group the files into groups where each group is associated with an XML filename from the xmls list. 

So, for example, if xmls is ['file1.xml', 'file2.xml'], and files is a list of files, the function would group files by their names matching the XML filenames. But how exactly? Maybe the files are being processed, and each file is checked against the XMLs. 

But the function's docstring isn't very clear. Let me think. The function returns a dict. So, perhaps the keys are the XML filenames, and the values are lists of files that match them. 

But how to implement this? Let's think about the steps. 

First, we need to iterate over each file in the 'files' parameter. For each file, check if it's in the 'xmls' list. But wait, maybe the 'xmls' is a list of filenames, and the 'files' is a list of filenames. The function should group files by their names matching the XMLs. 

Wait, maybe the 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and the 'files' is a list of files to be grouped. The function would group files where their name matches any of the XMLs. But how? For example, if a file's name is 'data.xml', and 'data.xml' is in xmls, then it's grouped under that XML. 

So, the approach would be to create a dictionary where each key is an XML filename from xmls, and the value is a list of files in files that have that name. 

But wait, the function's parameters are source, xmls, and files. The 'source' parameter is probably the directory or path where the files are located. But the function's docstring doesn't mention it. Maybe the 'source' is used to get the files? But the function's parameters are source, xmls, files. 

Wait, the function is called _group_files_by_xml_filename, which suggests it's part of a class. Maybe the 'source' is the directory path, and 'files' is a list of filenames in that directory. But the function's parameters are given as source, xmls, files. 

But the problem is that the function's docstring is not very clear. The user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So, I need to write the code that matches the parameters and the docstring.

So, the function's parameters are source, xmls, and files. The docstring says it groups files by xmls and returns a dict. 

Assuming that 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and 'files' is a list of filenames. The function needs to group the files into groups where each group is associated with an XML filename from xmls. 

So, the code would create a dictionary. For each file in files, check if it's in xmls. If yes, add it to the corresponding key in the dictionary. 

But wait, maybe the 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and the 'files' is a list of files to be grouped. The function would group files by their names matching the XMLs. 

But how to handle cases where a file is in multiple XMLs? For example, if a file is named 'data.xml' and 'data.xml' is in xmls, then it's added to the key 'data.xml'. 

So, the code would be something like:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    groups = {}
    for file in files:
        if file in xmls:
            groups[file] = groups.get(file, [])
            groups[file].append(file)
    return groups

But wait, the 'source' parameter is part of the function signature. But the docstring doesn't mention it. However, the function is called with these parameters. So, perhaps the 'source' is used to get the files? But the function's parameters are source, xmls, files. 

But the problem is that the function's parameters are given as source, xmls, files. The code needs to be written with those parameters. 

But the function's docstring says it groups files by xmls. So, perhaps the 'files' parameter is the list of files to be grouped, and 'xmls' is the list of XML filenames. The 'source' might be used to get the files, but since the function is called with 'files' as a parameter, maybe the 'source' is not used here. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is the directory path, and the 'files' are the files in that directory. But the function is supposed to group them by XMLs. 

But the code as written above would group files by their names matching the xmls list. However, if a file is in multiple xmls, it would be added to all of them. But the docstring says "groups files by xmls", which might imply that each file is grouped under the XMLs it matches. 

But the code as written would create a dictionary where each key is a file name in xmls, and the value is a list of files that match. 

But the problem is that the function's parameters are source, xmls, files. The code needs to be written with those parameters. 

So, the code would be:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    groups = {}
    for file in files:
        if file in xmls:
            groups[file] = groups.get(file, [])
            groups[file].append(file)
    return groups

But wait, the 'source' parameter is not used in this code. However, the function's parameters include it. So, perhaps the 'source' is not used here, but the function is called with it. 

But the docstring doesn't mention the 'source' parameter. So, maybe the 'source' is not used in the code. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'source' is the directory path, and the 'files' are the files in that directory. But the function is supposed to group them by XMLs. 

But without more information, the code can't know. However, the function's parameters are given, so the code must include them. 

So, the code would be as above. 

But perhaps the 'xmls' is a list of XML filenames, and the 'files' are the files to be grouped. The function groups the files into the XMLs. 

So, the code would create a dictionary where each key is an XML filename from xmls, and the value is a list of files in files that match that XML. 

Thus, the code is as written. 

But maybe the 'source' is used to get the files. For example, if the 'files' parameter is a list of files in the source directory. But since the function is called with 'files' as a parameter, perhaps the 'source' is not used here. 

In any case, the code must include the parameters as given. So, the code is as above. 

Therefore, the generated code is:

def _group_files_by_xml_filename(source, xmls, files):
    groups = {}
    for file in files:
        if file in xmls:
            groups[file] = groups.get(file, [])
            groups[file].append(file)
    return groups

But wait, the function is supposed to return a dict. The code returns groups, which is a dictionary. 

Yes, that's correct. 

So, that's the code.
