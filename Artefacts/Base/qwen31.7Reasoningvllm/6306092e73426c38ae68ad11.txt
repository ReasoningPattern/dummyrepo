Okay, I need to write a Python function called merge_extra_vars that takes a vars_dict and an optional extra_vars parameter. The docstring says it extends vars_dict with extra-vars. So the goal is to merge the extra_vars into the vars_dict.

First, I should check if extra_vars is provided. If it's not, maybe it's None, so I should handle that case. If it's None, then maybe I don't do anything. But the docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", so if extra_vars is None, perhaps it's an empty list. Wait, the parameter is called extra_vars, but in the docstring, it's described as a list of extra-vars. So maybe the function is supposed to take a list of extra-vars, and merge them into the vars_dict.

So the function should take vars_dict and extra_vars (a list), and merge each element of extra_vars into vars_dict. But how to do that? In Python, dictionaries can't have multiple entries with the same key, so if there are overlapping keys, the existing ones would be overwritten. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that. So maybe the function is supposed to add each extra-var as a key-value pair, overwriting existing ones if necessary.

So the approach would be: iterate over each item in extra_vars, and for each, add the key-value pair to vars_dict. But wait, the function is called merge_extra_vars, so perhaps the extra_vars are a list of strings, each being a key-value pair like "host1:port1". So each element in extra_vars is a string that needs to be split into key and value.

Wait, but the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". So maybe extra_vars is a list of strings, each being a key-value pair. For example, "host1:port1" would be split into key "host1" and value "port1".

So the function needs to process each element in extra_vars, split them into key and value, and add them to vars_dict.

So the steps:

1. Check if extra_vars is None. If it is, then maybe it's an empty list. But the function's parameter is optional, so perhaps it's None, and we should handle that. But the docstring says "extra_vars: List of extra-vars", so maybe it's a list. So if extra_vars is None, it's treated as an empty list.

2. Iterate over each element in extra_vars. For each element, split into key and value. For example, "host1:port1" split into "host1" and "port1".

3. Add each key-value pair to vars_dict. If a key exists in vars_dict, it's overwritten.

So the code would look like:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars (each is a string like "host1:port1")
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        # Split the var into key and value
        # Split on the first occurrence of ':'
        if ':' in var:
            key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            vars_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # If no colon, maybe it's a single key? Or perhaps a mistake?
            # For the sake of this function, assume that each extra-var is a key-value pair.
            # So maybe raise an error? But the docstring doesn't mention handling that.
            # So perhaps just add the key as is?
            # But the docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", so maybe each element is a key.
            # But that's not clear. However, the function's parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list of extra-vars, which are strings. So perhaps each element is a key, and the function is supposed to add them to vars_dict. But that would be a different behavior. But the docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which implies that extra-vars are key-value pairs.

            # So perhaps the function is supposed to split each extra-var into key and value. But if there's no colon, maybe it's a single key. But that's not clear. For the purpose of this function, perhaps we can split on the first colon, and if there's none, just add the key as is. But that's a bit ambiguous.

            # For example, if the extra-var is "host1", then key is "host1", value is None? Or maybe the value is empty?

            # Since the docstring doesn't specify, perhaps the function is supposed to split into key and value, even if the value is empty. So in that case, the code would split into key and value, and add the key to vars_dict with the value.

            # So, for the code, split into key and value, even if the value is empty.

            # So, in code:

            # Split on the first colon, and if there's no colon, then key is the entire string, value is None?

            # But in Python, if you split on a string that doesn't have a colon, then split returns a list with one element. So for example, var = "host1", split on colon gives ["host1"], then key is "host1", value is None?

            # But the function's docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", so perhaps each extra-var is a key, and the function is adding them as keys. But that would be a different behavior. However, the parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list of extra-vars, which are strings. So perhaps each element is a key, and the function is adding them to the dictionary. But that would be a simple addition, not merging.

            # But the function's name is merge_extra_vars, which suggests that it's merging extra-vars into the dictionary. So the extra-vars are likely key-value pairs.

            # So, perhaps the code should split each extra-var into key and value, and add them to the dictionary.

            # So, in code:

            # Split on the first colon, and if there's no colon, then key is the entire string, value is None.

            # So, in code:

            # key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            # vars_dict[key] = value

            # But if there's no colon, then split returns a list with one element, so key is the first element, and value is None?

            # For example, var = "host1", split into ["host1"], then key is "host1", value is None.

            # So, in code:

            # key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            # vars_dict[key] = value

            # But in Python, if the split is done on a string that doesn't have a colon, then split returns a list with one element. So, for example, "host1".split(':', 1) would be ["host1"], and then key is "host1", value is None.

            # So, in code, the code would be:

            # key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            # vars_dict[key] = value

            # But then, if the extra-var is "host1:port1", it splits into key "host1" and value "port1".

            # So, the code would handle that.

            # So, in the code, the split is done on the first colon, and the value is the part after the colon.

            # So, the code would be:

            # key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            # vars_dict[key] = value

            # But what if the var is empty? Well, the function is supposed to handle that, but the docstring doesn't mention it. So perhaps the code should handle that, but for the purpose of this function, we can proceed.

            # So, in the code, the split is done, and the key and value are added.

            # So, the code would be:

            # key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            # vars_dict[key] = value

            # But then, if the var is "host1", then key is "host1", value is None.

            # So, the code would add the key to the dictionary with the value as None.

            # But the function's docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which implies that the extra-vars are key-value pairs. So perhaps the code is correct.

        else:
            # If no colon, then maybe it's a key, but the value is not present. But how to handle that?

            # For example, if the extra-var is "host1", then the code would split into key "host1" and value None.

            # So, in code, the code would add the key to the dictionary with the value as None.

            # So, in the code, the split is done, and the value is set to the part after the colon, or None if there's no colon.

            # So, the code would be:

            # key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            # vars_dict[key] = value

    return vars_dict

Wait, but in Python, if you split a string with a colon, and the split is done on the first occurrence, then the code would work. But if the string has multiple colons, like "host1:port1:another", then split on the first colon would give the first part as "host1", and the rest as "port1:another". So, the code would add "host1" as the key, and "port1:another" as the value. But that's probably not intended. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify how to handle that, so perhaps the code is supposed to split on the first colon, and take the first part as the key, and the rest as the value. But that's not clear.

But given the problem statement, the function is supposed to merge extra-vars into the vars_dict. So, the extra-vars are likely key-value pairs, each specified as a string like "host1:port1". So the code would split each into key and value.

So, the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars (each is a string like "host1:port1")
    """
    if extra_vars is None:
        extra_vars = []
    for var in extra_vars:
        if ':' in var:
            key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            vars_dict[key] = value
        else:
            # Handle the case where there's no colon, maybe add the key as is, with value None?
            # Or maybe the value is empty?
            # For example, if the extra-var is "host1", then key is "host1", value is None.
            # So, set the value to None.
            vars_dict[var] = None
    return vars_dict

Wait, but in the code, if the extra-var is "host1", then the code would add it as a key with value None. But perhaps the function is supposed to add the key as is, but the value is not present. But the docstring doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the code should split into key and value, and if there's no colon, then the value is empty? Or maybe the value is None.

But the function's docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", which suggests that each extra-var is a key-value pair. So, the code would split each into key and value, and add them to the dictionary.

So, the code would be as above.

But in Python, if you split a string that doesn't have a colon, then split returns a list with one element. So, for example, "host1".split(':', 1) would be ["host1"], and then key is "host1", value is None.

So, the code would work.

But in the code, the else part is adding the var as a key with value None. But perhaps the function is supposed to add the key as is, but the value is not present. However, the function's docstring doesn't specify that. So, perhaps the code is correct as written.

So, the final code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into

    """
    if extra_vars is None:

        if ':' in var:
            key, value = var.split(':', 1)
            vars_dict[key] = value
        else:
            vars_dict[var] = None
    return vars_dict

But wait, in the code, if the extra-var is "host1", then vars_dict[var] = None. But maybe the function is supposed to add the key as is, but the value is not present. However, the function's docstring doesn't mention that. So, the code is correct as written.

Another possible case: if the extra-var is "host1:port1:another", then split into key "host1", value "port1:another". So, the code would add "host1" as the key, and "port1:another" as the value. That's probably what is intended.

So, the code should work.
