Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function process_text_links as described. Let me look at the docstring again. The function is supposed to process links in text, adding some attributes and linkifying them. 

First, I need to figure out how to identify links in the text. Links usually have a certain pattern, like http:// or https:// followed by a domain. But maybe the function is supposed to handle more general cases, like URLs with different protocols.

Wait, the docstring says "adding some attributes and linkifying textual links." So the goal is to detect links in the text and convert them into hyperlinks. But what attributes? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the function is supposed to add some common attributes like 'href' and 'target="_blank"'. Also, linkifying would mean converting the text to a hyperlink.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Detect links in the text. This could be done using regular expressions. For example, matching URLs that start with http:// or https://, followed by some characters.

2. Replace each detected link with a hyperlink in the text. For example, replace "http://example.com" with "<a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">http://example.com</a>".

But how to implement this in Python? The function is called process_text_links, and it takes a text string as input. So the code would need to process the text and replace links with hyperlinks.

Let me think about the regular expression. Maybe using re.findall to find all URLs. The pattern could be something like r'https?://\S+'. But that might capture too many things, like 'http://example.com/path?query=123'. However, the problem says "textual links", so maybe the function is supposed to handle URLs that are considered as links, not necessarily all possible URLs.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to replace URLs that start with http:// or https://. So the regex would be r'https?://\S+'. But I need to make sure that the regex is accurate.

Once the links are found, I need to replace them with the hyperlink tags. So for each match, replace the string with the HTML anchor tag.

But how to handle the replacement? Using the re.sub function. So the code would be something like:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    # Find all URLs using regex
    urls = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    # Replace each URL with a hyperlink
    for url in urls:
        text = text.replace(url, f'<a href="{url}" target="_blank">{url}</a>')
    return text

Wait, but this approach would replace all occurrences of the URL in the text. However, if there are multiple URLs in the same place, it would replace them all. But the problem says "process links in text", so maybe the function is supposed to replace each link once. But the code above would replace all occurrences. However, if the text has multiple links, like "http://example.com http://example.org", it would replace both. But perhaps the function is supposed to replace each link once, but the code as written would do that.

But maybe the function is supposed to replace each link with a hyperlink, and the code above does that. However, the problem is that the regex might capture more than just the links. For example, if the text is "http://example.com/path?query=123", the regex would capture the entire URL, including the path and query parameters. But the code would replace that entire string with the hyperlink. But that's probably what the user wants.

But the problem says "textual links", so maybe the function is supposed to handle URLs that are considered as links, not necessarily all possible URLs. However, the code as written would handle that.

But there's a problem: if the text has multiple links, the code would replace each one. But the code as written would replace all occurrences. For example, if the text is "http://example.com http://example.org", the code would replace both with hyperlinks.

But perhaps the function is supposed to replace each link once, but the code as written does that. So that's acceptable.

But wait, the code as written would replace all occurrences of the URL in the text. However, if the text has multiple URLs, it would replace them all. But the function's purpose is to process links, so that's probably okay.

Another thing to consider: the function may need to handle URLs that are not starting with http:// or https://. But the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps the function is supposed to handle only those.

So the code would be:

Import re, then use re.findall to find all URLs, then replace each with the hyperlink.

But the code needs to be in the function. So the code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    urls = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    for url in urls:
        text = text.replace(url, f'<a href="{url}" target="_blank">{url}</a>')
    return text

But wait, the code as written would replace all occurrences of the URL in the text. For example, if the text is "http://example.com http://example.org", it would replace both. But if the text is "http://example.com http://example.com", it would replace both. But that's probably what the user wants.

However, there's a problem with this approach. If the text has multiple links, the code would replace each one. But if the text is "http://example.com http://example.com", the code would replace both. But maybe the user wants to replace each link once. But the code as written does that.

Another thing: the function is supposed to "add some attributes and linkify textual links". So the code adds the href attribute and the target="_blank" attribute. But the code as written does that.

But perhaps the function is supposed to add more attributes, but the docstring doesn't specify. So the code as written is sufficient.

But there's another problem: the regex might not capture all possible URLs. For example, if the text has "http://example.com/path?query=123", the regex would capture that as a URL. But the code would replace it with the hyperlink. But that's probably what the user wants.

So the code seems correct. However, the function is supposed to process the text and return the modified text. So the code would be as written.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me test with some examples.

Test case 1: text = "This is a link http://example.com."
Expected output: "This is a link <a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">http://example.com</a>."

The code would replace the URL with the hyperlink. So that's correct.

Test case 2: text = "http://example.com and http://example.org."
Expected output: "<a href="http://example.com" target="_blank">http://example.com</a> and <a href="http://example.org" target="_blank">http://example.org</a>."

The code would replace both URLs.

Another test case: text = "http://example.com/path?query=123"
Expected output: "<a href="http://example.com/path?query=123" target="_blank">http://example.com/path?query=123</a>."

The code would replace the entire URL.

So the code seems to handle that.

But there's a problem with the regex. The regex r'https?://\S+' matches any sequence of characters that starts with http:// or https:// and then any number of non-whitespace characters. But this could include things like "http://example.com/path?query=123", which is a valid URL. So the code would replace that.

But perhaps the function is supposed to handle only the URLs that are considered as links, but the code as written does that.

So the code is correct.

Therefore, the final code would be:

import re

def process_text_links(text):
    urls = re.findall(r'https?://\S+', text)
    for url in urls:
        text = text.replace(url, f'<a href="{url}" target="_blank">{url}</a>')
    return text

But wait, the code uses re.findall, which returns a list of all matches. Then, for each URL in that list, it replaces the original text. However, if the same URL appears multiple times in the text, it would be replaced each time. But that's correct.

But there's a problem: if the text has multiple URLs, the code would replace each one. For example, if the text is "http://a.com http://b.com", the code would replace both.

But the function's purpose is to process links in the text, so that's acceptable.

Another thing: the code uses the replace method, which replaces all occurrences of the URL in the text. So if the text has multiple URLs, they are all replaced.

So the code is correct.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
