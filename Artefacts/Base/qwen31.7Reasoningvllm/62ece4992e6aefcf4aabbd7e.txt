Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _resolve_string based on the given docstring. Let me read the docstring again to make sure I understand the requirements.

The function takes a matcher as an argument. The matcher is supposed to have a name and an optional default value in its group dict. The goal is to get the value from the environment based on this matcher. If the variable isn't in the environment and there's no default, an error is raised.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Check if the matcher has a 'name' key. If not, maybe raise an error? But the doc says the matcher contains a name and an optional default. So perhaps the matcher is expected to have a 'name' and possibly a 'default' in the group dict. Wait, the doc says "a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict." So the group dict might have the name as a key, and the default as another key? Or maybe the group dict has the name and the default is in the group?

Wait, the doc says "a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict." So the group dict probably has the name as a key, and the default is another key. But maybe the default is provided as a value in the group. Hmm, maybe the group dict is a dictionary where the keys are the group names, and the values are the defaults. But the doc is a bit ambiguous.

But the function's purpose is to get the value from the environment. So, the matcher's group dict probably has the name as a key, and the default is the value. So, for example, if the matcher's group has 'name' as a key, then the value is the default. But maybe the default is provided as a separate key in the group dict. Wait, the doc says "an optional default value in its group dict." So perhaps the group dict has the name as a key, and the default is the value. So, for example, if the matcher's group has 'name' as a key, then the value is the default. But maybe the default is provided as a separate key. Hmm, this is a bit unclear.

But the function's purpose is to get the value from the environment. So, the steps would be:

- Check if the name exists in the environment. If not, check if there's a default in the group dict. If there's no default, raise an error.

So, the code would need to:

1. Check if the matcher's group dict has a 'name' key. If not, maybe raise an error? But the doc says the matcher contains a name and an optional default. So perhaps the matcher's group dict has the name as a key, and the default is another key. But maybe the default is in the group dict as a value. Wait, maybe the group dict is a dictionary where the keys are the group names, and the values are the defaults. So, for example, if the matcher's group has 'name' as a key, then the value is the default. So, the code would need to look up the name in the environment, and if not present, check if the group has a default.

But the doc says "an optional default value in its group dict." So perhaps the group dict has the name as a key, and the default is the value. So, the code would:

- Get the name from the matcher's group dict.
- Check if the name is in the environment.
- If not, check if the group dict has a default value. If not, raise an error.

But how to structure this?

Let me think of the code structure.

First, the function is called _resolve_string, which is a private method. So, the code would need to access the environment. But the environment is not defined here. Wait, the function is supposed to get the value from the environment. So, the environment is probably a dictionary that's passed into the function, but the function's signature doesn't mention it. Wait, the function's parameters are just 'matcher'. So, the environment is probably a variable that's accessible in the scope where this function is called. But since the function is written in a way that it's part of a larger codebase, perhaps the environment is a global variable or a module-level variable. But the function's code would need to access it.

But the problem is that the function's code is to be generated, and the environment is not part of the function's parameters. So, perhaps the function is part of a class, and the environment is a member variable of the class. But since the function's signature is given as def _resolve_string(matcher), the code would need to assume that the environment is available in the scope.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to get the value from the environment. So, the code would need to look up the name in the environment. So, the code would be something like:

env = ...  # some environment variable

value = env.get(name, default)

But the function's code is to be generated, and the environment is not part of the parameters. So, perhaps the function is part of a class, and the environment is a member variable.

But since the function's parameters are just 'matcher', the code would need to assume that the environment is available. However, the problem is that the function is supposed to be written in a way that it can be used in a larger context. But since the user hasn't provided that context, perhaps the code is to be written with the assumption that the environment is available.

So, the code would:

- Check if the matcher's group dict has a 'name' key. If not, raise an error? Or maybe the matcher is expected to have a name in its group dict.

But the doc says "a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict." So, the matcher's group dict must have the name as a key, and possibly a default value. So, the code would need to check that the name is present in the group dict. But the doc says "an optional default value in its group dict." So, the group dict may or may not have a default.

So, the code steps:

1. Get the name from the matcher's group dict. Let's say the group dict is called 'groups'.

2. Check if the name is in the environment. If not, check if there's a default in the group dict. If there's no default, raise an error.

But how to structure this.

So, the code would be:

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    # Assume environment is a dictionary
    env = ...  # but how is it passed? Maybe it's a global variable or part of the class.
    # But since the function is written in a way that the environment is available, we proceed.

    groups = matcher['groups']  # assuming matcher is a dictionary with 'groups' key
    name = groups.get('name')  # assuming 'name' is in the group dict
    default = groups.get('default')  # if present, else None

    if name not in env:
        if default is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Variable {name} not found in environment")
        else:
            return default
    else:
        return env[name]

Wait, but the doc says "an optional default value in its group dict." So, the group dict may have the name as a key, and the default is another key. But the code above assumes that the group dict has 'name' and 'default' as keys. But the doc says "a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict." So, perhaps the group dict has the name as a key, and the default is another key. But the code would need to check if the default is present.

Alternatively, maybe the group dict has the name as a key, and the default is the value. So, the code would look up the name in the environment, and if not present, check if the group dict has a default value. But how?

Wait, the doc says "an optional default value in its group dict." So, the group dict may have the name as a key, and the default is the value. So, for example, if the group dict has 'name' as a key, then the value is the default. So, the code would:

name = groups['name']
default = groups.get('default')  # if present, else None

But then, if the group dict has 'name' but no 'default', then default is None. So, in that case, the code would check if default is None, and raise an error.

But the doc says "If the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised."

So, the code would:

if name not in env:
    if default is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Variable {name} not found in environment")
    else:
        return default

But how to get the name from the matcher's group dict. The function's parameter is 'matcher', which is supposed to be a dictionary with a 'groups' key. So, the code would assume that the matcher is a dictionary with a 'groups' key.

But the function's parameters are just 'matcher', so the code would need to access the 'groups' key.

So, putting it all together:

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    env = ...  # assuming environment is available
    groups = matcher.get('groups', {})
    name = groups.get('name')
    default = groups.get('default')
    
    if name not in env:
        if default is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Variable {name} not found in environment")
        else:
            return default
    else:
        return env[name]

But the problem is that the environment is not part of the function's parameters. So, in the code, the environment is assumed to be available. However, in a real scenario, the environment would be passed as a parameter, but the function's signature doesn't include it. So, the code would have to assume that the environment is available.

But the user hasn't provided any information about the environment. So, the code would proceed under the assumption that the environment is a dictionary that's accessible in the scope.

But the function is supposed to be written in a way that it can be used in a larger context. So, the code would need to have the environment as a variable.

But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps the code is to be written with the environment as a variable, and the function is part of a class.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, without any explanation. So, the code would be as written above.

But the function's parameters are just 'matcher', and the code is to be written in Python. So, the code would be:

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    """
    Get the value from environment given a matcher containing a name and an optional default value in its group dict.
    If the variable is not defined in environment and no default value is provided, an Error is raised.
    """
    env = ...  # Assuming environment is available
    groups = matcher.get('groups', {})
    name = groups.get('name')
    default = groups.get('default')
    
    if name not in env:
        if default is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Variable {name} not found in environment")
        else:
            return default
    else:
        return env[name]

But the problem is that the environment is not part of the function's parameters. So, in the code, the environment is assumed to be available. However, in a real scenario, the environment would be passed as a parameter, but the function's signature doesn't include it. So, the code is written with the environment as a variable.

But the user hasn't provided any information about the environment, so the code is written with the assumption that it's available.

So, the final code would be as above.
