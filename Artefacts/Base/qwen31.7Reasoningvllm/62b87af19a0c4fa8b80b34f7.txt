Okay, I need to write a Python function called difference that takes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, and a level parameter. The goal is to return a dictionary with items from d1 that are not contained in d2. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function's docstring says it returns a dictionary with items from d1 not in d2. So, the main idea is to find the keys in d1 that are not present in d2, but also considering the nested structures if the level is specified.

Wait, the level parameter is mentioned. So, maybe the function needs to handle nested dictionaries. For example, if d1 has a nested dictionary and d2 has a nested one, and the level is set, then we need to check at that level.

But how to handle the level? Let me think. The level parameter is probably the depth at which we check for containment. So, for example, if level is -1, it might mean all levels, but maybe the default is 0. Wait, the docstring says level=-1, but maybe that's just a placeholder. Hmm.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Return a dictionary with items from d1 not contained in d2." So, the function is supposed to return d1 minus d2, but considering the nested structures. But how to handle the level?

Wait, maybe the level parameter is the depth at which we check for containment. For example, if a key in d1 is a dictionary, and the same key exists in d2, then we need to check if the nested structures are different. But how to implement that.

So, the approach would be to recursively check each level. For example, if the level is 0, we check the top-level keys. If the level is higher, we check deeper.

But how to implement this. Let's think of a recursive function.

The function difference(d1, d2, level=-1) needs to return a dictionary where keys from d1 are not present in d2, considering the level.

Wait, but the problem is that if a key in d1 is a dictionary, and the same key exists in d2, then we need to check if the nested structures are different. So, for example, if d1 has {'a': {'b': 1}}, and d2 has {'a': {'b': 2}}, then the key 'a' is present in both, but the nested structure is different. So, in this case, the key 'a' should be excluded from the result.

But how to handle this. So, the function needs to compare the nested structures at the given level.

So, the plan is:

- For each key in d1, check if it's present in d2. If not, add it to the result.
- If it is present, then check if the nested structures at the given level are different. If they are, then the key is excluded from the result.

But how to handle the level. Let's think of the level as the depth of the nested dictionaries. So, for example, if level is 0, we check the top-level keys. If level is 1, we check the values of the keys in d1 and d2, but only if those values are dictionaries.

Wait, but the level parameter is passed as an argument. So, the function needs to recursively check at the given level.

So, perhaps the function can be implemented with a helper function that checks if two dictionaries are equal at a certain level.

But how to implement that. Let's think of a helper function that takes two dictionaries and a level, and returns True if they are equal at that level.

But wait, the level is the depth. So, for example, if the level is 0, we check the top-level keys. If the level is 1, we check the values of the keys in d1 and d2, but only if those values are dictionaries.

Wait, but the level parameter is passed as an argument. So, the helper function would need to check if the current level is within the depth.

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter is the depth at which we compare the dictionaries. So, for example, if the level is 0, we compare the top-level keys. If the level is 1, we compare the values of the keys in d1 and d2, but only if those values are dictionaries.

But how to handle this. Let me think of an example.

Suppose d1 is {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}, and d2 is {'a': {'b': 2}, 'c': 2}. Then, the keys 'a' and 'c' are present in both. For level 0, the keys 'a' and 'c' are present. But since the values are dictionaries (for 'a'), we need to check if the nested structures are equal. In this case, the nested structures are different (1 vs 2), so the key 'a' should be excluded. So, the result would be {'c': 2}.

But if the level is 1, then we check the values of the keys. So, for 'a' in d1, the value is a dictionary. So, we check if the value in d1 (the nested dict) is equal to the value in d2 (the nested dict). If they are not equal, then the key 'a' is excluded. So, in this case, the key 'a' is excluded, and 'c' is included.

So, the helper function would need to compare two dictionaries at a certain level. But how to implement that.

Alternatively, maybe the level parameter is the depth of the nested dictionaries. So, for example, if the level is 0, we check the top-level. If the level is 1, we check the values of the keys in d1 and d2, but only if they are dictionaries. If the level is 2, we check the values of the values, etc.

But how to implement this. Let's think of a helper function that compares two dictionaries at a certain level. Let's call it compare_dicts(d1, d2, level). The function would return True if the dictionaries are equal at the given level, otherwise False.

But how to implement this. Let's think recursively. For each level, we check if the current dictionaries are equal. For example, if level is 0, we check if the keys are the same and the values are equal. If the level is 1, we check if the values are dictionaries and then compare them at level 0.

Wait, but the level parameter is the depth. So, for example, if the level is 0, we compare the top-level. If the level is 1, we compare the values of the keys, but only if they are dictionaries. If the level is 2, we compare the values of the values, etc.

So, the helper function could be:

def compare_dicts(d1, d2, level):
    if level == 0:
        return d1 == d2
    else:
        # Check if the current level is a dictionary
        if not isinstance(d1, dict) or not isinstance(d2, dict):
            return False
        # Check if the keys are the same and the values are equal at the next level
        # But wait, the level is the depth. So, for level 1, we check the values of the keys, but only if they are dictionaries.
        # So, for level 1, we check if the values are dictionaries, and then compare them at level 0.
        # But how to handle this recursively.
        # For example, for level 1, we check if the values are dictionaries, and then compare them at level 0.
        # So, for each key in d1 and d2, check if the values are equal at level 0.
        # But how to handle this in code.

        # So, for level 1, we check if the values are dictionaries. If not, return False.
        # Then, for each key in d1 and d2, compare the values at level 0.

        # But how to do this in code.

        # Maybe the helper function can be written as:

        # For level 0, check if d1 and d2 are equal.
        # For level > 0, check if the current dictionaries are equal at level.

        # So, the helper function would need to check if the current dictionaries are equal at the given level.

        # So, for level 0, return d1 == d2.

        # For level > 0, check if the current dictionaries are equal at level.

        # But how to implement this.

        # Maybe the helper function can be written recursively. For example:

        # For level 0, return d1 == d2.

        # For level > 0, check if the current dictionaries are equal at level.

        # But how to do this.

        # Let's think of the level as the depth. So, for level 1, we check the values of the keys in d1 and d2, but only if they are dictionaries.

        # So, for each key in d1 and d2, if the value is a dictionary, then compare them at level 0. Otherwise, return False.

        # So, the helper function would be:

        # if level == 0:
        #     return d1 == d2
        # else:
        #     if not (isinstance(d1, dict) and isinstance(d2, dict)):
        #         return False
        #     for key in d1:
        #         if key not in d2:
        #             return False
        #         if not compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level - 1):
        #             return False
        #     return True

        # Wait, but this is for level 1. But the level is passed as an argument. So, the helper function would need to check if the current level is the same as the level passed.

        # Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

        # Alternatively, the helper function could be written as a recursive function that checks if two dictionaries are equal at the given level.

        # So, for example, the helper function would take d1, d2, and level, and return True if they are equal at that level.

        # But how to implement this.

        # Let's think of the base case: if level is 0, return d1 == d2.

        # For level > 0, check if the current dictionaries are equal at level. For that, we need to check if the keys are the same, and the values are equal at level-1.

        # But how to handle this. For example, if the level is 1, then we check if the values are dictionaries and then compare them at level 0.

        # So, the helper function could be:

        # def compare_dicts(d1, d2, level):
        #     if level == 0:
        #         return d1 == d2
        #     if not (isinstance(d1, dict) and isinstance(d2, dict)):
        #         return False
        #     for key in d1:
        #         if key not in d2:
        #             return False
        #         if not compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level - 1):
        #             return False
        #     return True

        # But this would only check if the keys are present in both and the values are equal at level-1. However, this would not account for the case where the key is present in d1 but not in d2. So, in that case, the function would return False, which is correct.

        # But this is for level 1. So, the helper function would need to be called with the correct level.

        # So, the main function would need to check for each key in d1 whether it is present in d2, and if so, compare the values at the given level.

        # So, putting this all together.

        # Now, the main function difference(d1, d2, level=-1) would:

        # - Iterate over each key in d1.

        # - For each key, check if it is present in d2. If not, add it to the result.

        # - If it is present, check if the values are equal at the given level. If they are not, then the key is excluded from the result.

        # So, the code would be something like:

        # def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
        #     result = {}
        #     for key in d1:
        #         if key not in d2:
        #             result[key] = d1[key]
        #         else:
        #             if compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level):
        #                 result[key] = d1[key]
        #             else:
        #                 # do nothing
        #                 pass
        #     return result

        # But wait, the compare_dicts function would need to be defined. So, the helper function would be inside the difference function.

        # But how to implement compare_dicts.

        # So, the helper function compare_dicts(d1, d2, level) would check if the dictionaries are equal at the given level.

        # But how to handle the level. For example, if level is 0, then check if d1 and d2 are equal. If level is 1, check if the values are equal at level 0, etc.

        # So, the helper function would be:

        # def compare_dicts(d1, d2, level):
        #     if level == 0:
        #         return d1 == d2
        #     if not (isinstance(d1, dict) and isinstance(d2, dict)):
        #         return False
        #     for key in d1:
        #         if key not in d2:
        #             return False
        #         if not compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level - 1):
        #             return False
        #     return True

        # Wait, but this would check for all keys in d1 and d2. However, this is not correct. Because if d1 has a key that is not in d2, then the function returns False. But in the main function, we need to check if the key is present in d2. So, in the main function, for each key in d1, if it's not in d2, add it. Else, check if the values are equal at the given level.

        # So, the helper function compare_dicts would need to check if the dictionaries are equal at the given level. But how to handle the level.

        # Let's think again. The helper function compare_dicts(d1, d2, level) returns True if d1 and d2 are equal at the given level. So, for level 0, it's d1 == d2. For level 1, it's that the values are equal at level 0. For level 2, the values of the values are equal at level 1, etc.

        # So, the helper function would be:

        # def compare_dicts(d1, d2, level):
        #     if level == 0:
        #         return d1 == d2
        #     if not (isinstance(d1, dict) and isinstance(d2, dict)):
        #         return False
        #     for key in d1:
        #         if key not in d2:
        #             return False
        #         if not compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level - 1):
        #             return False
        #     return True

        # But this would check for all keys in d1 and d2. However, this is not correct because if d1 has a key that is not in d2, then the function returns False. But in the main function, we need to check if the key is present in d2.

        # So, in the main function, for each key in d1:

        # if key not in d2: add to result.

        # else: check if compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level) is True. If yes, then the key is in d2, but the values are equal at the given level. So, the key is not excluded. If not, then the key is excluded.

        # So, the code for the main function would be:

        # def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
        #     result = {}
        #     for key in d1:
        #         if key not in d2:
        #             result[key] = d1[key]
        #         else:
        #             if compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level):
        #                 result[key] = d1[key]
        #             else:
        #                 # do nothing
        #                 pass
        #     return result

        # But what about the case where the level is -1? The docstring says level=-1, but maybe that's just a placeholder. The function's default is level=-1. So, perhaps the helper function is called with level=-1, but in that case, the compare_dicts function would check level 0, which is d1 == d2.

        # However, the problem is that the level parameter is passed as an argument. So, the helper function would need to handle different levels.

        # Now, putting all this together, the code would be:

        # But I need to write the code in Python, with the helper function inside the difference function.

        # Also, the helper function compare_dicts would need to be defined inside the difference function.

        # But in Python, functions can be defined inside other functions. So, the code would be:

        # def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
        #     def compare_dicts(d1, d2, level):
        #         if level == 0:
        #             return d1 == d2
        #         if not (isinstance(d1, dict) and isinstance(d2, dict)):
        #             return False
        #         for key in d1:
        #             if key not in d2:
        #                 return False
        #             if not compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level - 1):
        #                 return False
        #         return True
        #     result = {}
        #     for key in d1:
        #         if key not in d2:
        #             result[key] = d1[key]
        #         else:
        #             if compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level):
        #                 result[key] = d1[key]
        #     return result

        # But wait, the compare_dicts function is called with level=-1. Let's see. For example, if level is -1, then the helper function would check level 0, which is d1 == d2. But what if d1 and d2 are not equal? Then, the compare_dicts would return False, and the key would be excluded.

        # However, the problem is that the helper function is called with level=-1, but the level is passed as an argument. So, the code is correct.

        # But there's a problem with the compare_dicts function. For example, if the level is 0, then it checks if d1 and d2 are equal. But if the level is 1, then it checks if the values are equal at level 0.

        # However, the code as written would check for all keys in d1 and d2. But in the case where d1 has a key that is not in d2, the compare_dicts function would return False, but in the main function, we check if the key is not in d2, and add it to the result.

        # So, the code seems correct.

        # But there's another issue. What if the level is 0, but d1 and d2 are not equal? Then, the key is excluded from the result. Which is correct.

        # Now, let's test some examples.

        # Example 1:

        # d1 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}
        # d2 = {'a': {'b': 2}, 'c': 2}
        # level = 0
        # The compare_dicts would check if d1 and d2 are equal. They are not, so the key 'a' is excluded. The result is {'c': 2}.

        # Example 2:

        # d1 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}
        # d2 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 3}
        # level = 0
        # compare_dicts returns False for 'a' and 'c', so the result is {'c': 2}.

        # Example 3:

        # d1 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}
        # d2 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}
        # level = 0
        # compare_dicts returns True, so the result is empty.

        # Now, what if the level is 1?

        # d1 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}
        # d2 = {'a': {'b': 1}, 'c': 2}
        # level = 1
        # compare_dicts would check if the values are equal at level 0. Since they are equal, the key is included. So, the result is empty.

        # Another example:

        # d1 = {'a': {'b': {'c': 1}}}
        # d2 = {'a': {'b': {'c': 2}}}
        # level = 1
        # compare_dicts would check if the values are equal at level 0. The values are dictionaries, so compare_dicts is called with level 0. The d1's value is {'b': {'c': 1}}, d2's value is {'b': {'c': 2}}. They are not equal, so compare_dicts returns False. So, the key 'a' is excluded from the result.

        # So, the code seems to handle that.

        # Now, the code needs to be written in Python. The helper function compare_dicts is inside the difference function.

        # Also, the level parameter is passed as an argument. So, the code should handle that.

        # So, the final code would be:

        # def difference(d1, d2, level=-1):
        #     def compare_dicts(d1, d2, level):
        #         if level == 0:
        #             return d1 == d2
        #         if not (isinstance(d1, dict) and isinstance(d2, dict)):
        #             return False
        #         for key in d1:
        #             if key not in d2:
        #                 return False
        #             if not compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level - 1):
        #                 return False
        #         return True
        #     result = {}
        #     for key in d1:
        #         if key not in d2:
        #             result[key] = d1[key]
        #         else:
        #             if compare_dicts(d1[key], d2[key], level):
        #                 result[key] = d1[key]
        #     return result

        # But wait, the compare_dicts function is called with level=-1. Let's see. For example, if level is -1, then the code would call compare_dicts with level=-1. But in the helper function, level is checked against 0. So, the code would return d1 == d2. But if d1 and d2 are not equal, then compare_dicts returns False, and the key is excluded.

        # However, the problem is that the level parameter is passed as an argument. So, the code is correct.

        # But there's a possible error in the helper function. For example, if the level is 0, but d1 and d2 are not equal, then compare_dicts returns False, and the key is excluded. Which is correct.

        # So, this code should work.

        # Now, I need to write this code in Python, making sure that the helper function is inside the difference function.

        # Also, the level parameter is set to -1 by default. So, the code is correct.

        # So, the final code is as above.
