Okay, I need to write a Python function called select_filenames_by_prefix. The docstring says it takes a prefix and a list of files, and returns all files that match the prefix. 

First, I should think about how to check if a file matches a prefix. In Python, strings have a startswith method. So for each file in the files list, I can check if the file's string starts with the given prefix.

Wait, but what if the prefix is empty? Well, the docstring doesn't mention handling that, so maybe I should assume that the prefix is a valid string. But maybe I should handle the case where the prefix is empty. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is expected to handle it as per normal.

So the approach is: iterate over each file in the files list, and check if the file's name starts with the prefix. If yes, add it to the result list.

So the code would be something like:

def select_filenames_by_prefix(prefix, files):
    """
    For each file in files, return all files that match the given prefix
    """
    return [f for f in files if f.startswith(prefix)]

Wait, but wait. The function is supposed to return all files that match the prefix. So the list comprehension checks each file's name (assuming that files are filenames, but maybe they are paths? But the function's parameters are prefix and files. The docstring says "files" but doesn't specify if they are filenames or paths. However, the function is likely intended to take filenames as strings, and check if they start with the prefix.

So the code is straightforward. The list comprehension checks each file in files, and if it starts with the prefix, includes it in the result.

So the code is as written. I need to make sure that the function is properly formatted with the docstring as given. The user said not to include any explanation, so just the code.
