Okay, I need to write a Python function called _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element that takes an issue as input and returns the possible values of number and sup from its contents. Let me think about what this function should do.

First, the docstring says it returns the possible values of number and sup. So maybe the issue is some kind of data structure, perhaps a dictionary or a string? The function is probably parsing the contents of the issue to extract these values.

Wait, the function is named _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element. The underscore suggests it's a private method, maybe part of a class. But the problem doesn't mention a class, so maybe it's standalone. But the function is supposed to be generated based on the given signature and docstring. So I need to implement this function.

The docstring says "return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue." So the issue is likely some data structure, maybe a dictionary with keys like 'number' and 'sup', or maybe a string that contains these values. But without more context, I need to make assumptions.

Assuming that the issue is a dictionary, perhaps containing 'number' and 'sup' keys. But maybe the issue is a string, and we need to extract numbers and sup from it. Alternatively, maybe the issue is a list or another structure.

But since the function is named with 'issue', maybe the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and the function is supposed to return those values. However, the docstring says "possible values", which might imply that there could be multiple values, perhaps a list or a tuple.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a string, and we need to extract numbers and sup from it. For example, if the issue is a string like "Number: 123, Sup: ABC", then extract 123 and ABC.

But the function's name suggests that it's extracting number and sup, which are possibly parts of the issue's content. So maybe the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and the function returns those values. But the docstring says "possible values", which might mean that there could be multiple values, perhaps a list.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a string, and the function is supposed to parse it to find numbers and sup. For example, if the issue is a string like "The number is 42, sup is ABC", then extract 42 and ABC.

But without more information, I need to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and the function returns those values. However, the docstring says "possible values", which might mean that there could be multiple values, perhaps a list.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a string, and the function is supposed to extract numbers and sup from it. For example, if the issue is a string like "Issue number: 123, Sup: ABC", then extract 123 and ABC.

But how to parse that? Maybe split the string into parts and extract the numbers and sup.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and the function returns those values. But the function's name suggests that it's extracting values from the issue's contents, which could be a string or a dictionary.

Since the function is part of a class, perhaps the issue is an instance of a class that has these attributes. But the function is standalone, so perhaps the issue is a dictionary.

Another approach: the function is supposed to return the possible values of number and sup. So perhaps the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and the function returns those values. But if the issue is a string, then the function would need to parse it.

But since the function is named _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element, maybe the 'sup' is a typo, and it's supposed to be 'supplement'? But the user wrote 'supplment' in the docstring. Hmm, maybe that's a typo. But the function is supposed to be generated as per the given signature and docstring.

So, assuming that the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and the function returns those values. But the docstring says "possible values", which might mean that there could be multiple values, perhaps a list.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a string, and the function is supposed to extract numbers and sup from it. For example, if the issue is a string like "Number: 123, Sup: ABC", then the function would return ['123', 'ABC'].

But how to parse that? Maybe split the string into parts and extract the numbers and sup.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a list of strings, and the function is supposed to extract numbers and sup from each element.

But without more context, it's challenging. However, the function's name suggests that it's extracting number and sup from the issue's contents. So perhaps the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and the function returns those values.

So, the function could be written as:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    if isinstance(issue, dict):
        return [issue.get('number'), issue.get('sup')]
    elif isinstance(issue, str):
        # parse the string to extract number and sup
        # for example, split on commas and extract numbers and sup
        # but this is just a guess
        parts = issue.split(',')
        numbers = [part.strip() for part in parts if part.strip().isdigit()]
        sup = [part.strip() for part in parts if part.strip().isalpha()]
        return numbers + sup
    else:
        return []

But this is just a possible implementation. However, the function's name includes 'supplment' which might be a typo, but the user provided that.

Alternatively, maybe the 'sup' is a typo for 'supplement', but the function is supposed to return the possible values of number and supplement.

But given the ambiguity, the best approach is to assume that the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and return those values. However, the docstring says "possible values", which might mean that there could be multiple values, so perhaps return a list.

But the function's return type is not specified. The user didn't mention it, so perhaps the function returns a list of the values.

So the code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    # Assume issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup'
    # Return the values as a list
    return [issue.get('number'), issue.get('sup')]

But maybe the issue is a string, and the function is supposed to parse it. For example, if the issue is a string like "Number: 123, Sup: ABC", then extract 123 and ABC.

But without knowing the exact structure of the issue, it's hard to say. However, since the function is part of a class, perhaps the issue is an instance of a class that has these attributes.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a list of strings, and the function is supposed to extract numbers and sup from each string.

But given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to assume that the issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup', and return those values. So the code would be as above.

But the user's docstring says "possible values", which might imply that there could be multiple values, so perhaps return a list.

So the code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    # Assume issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup'
    # Return the values as a list
    return [issue.get('number'), issue.get('sup')]

But maybe the issue is a string, and the function is supposed to parse it. For example, if the issue is a string like "Number: 123, Sup: ABC", then extract 123 and ABC.

But how to parse that? Maybe split on commas and extract the parts.

But since the function is part of a class, perhaps the issue is a dictionary. However, the user hasn't provided that context.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is a string, and the function is supposed to extract numbers and sup from it. For example, if the issue is a string like "Issue number: 123, supplement: ABC", then extract 123 and ABC.

But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to code. However, the function's name suggests that it's extracting number and sup from the issue's contents, so perhaps the issue is a dictionary.

Therefore, the code would be as above.

But the user's docstring says "possible values", which might mean that there could be multiple values, so perhaps return a list.

So the final code would be:

def _extract_number_and_supplment_from_issue_element(issue):
    """
    Return the possible values of number and sup from the contents of issue.
    """
    # Assume issue is a dictionary with keys 'number' and 'sup'
    # Return the values as a list
    return [issue.get('number'), issue.get('sup')]

But maybe the issue is a string, and the function is supposed to parse it. For example, if the issue is a string like "Number: 123, Sup: ABC", then extract 123 and ABC.

But how to parse that? Maybe split on commas and extract the parts.

But since the function is part of a class, perhaps the issue is a dictionary. So the code remains as above.

Another possibility: the issue is a list of strings, and the function is supposed to extract numbers and sup from each string. For example, if the issue is ["Number: 123", "Sup: ABC"], then extract 123 and ABC.

But again, without knowing the structure, it's hard to code. However, the function's name suggests that it's extracting from the issue's contents, which could be a string or a dictionary.

So the code would be as above.
