Okay, I need to generate Python code for the inject_config method based on the given function signature and docstring. Let me look at the docstring again.

The docstring says that if the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable doesn't exist, it should be set to self.ansible_config_path. So the method needs to check if the environment variable is present. If not, set it to the path stored in self.ansible_config_path.

First, I'll import the necessary modules. Since we're dealing with environment variables, I'll need os. So I'll start with importing os.

Then, the method inject_config will check if os.environ.get('ANSIBLE_CONFIG') is None. If it is, then set it to self.ansible_config_path. But wait, what if self.ansible_config_path is None? Well, the docstring doesn't mention handling that case, so maybe it's assumed that self.ansible_config_path is a valid path.

So the code would be something like:

def inject_config(self):
    if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' not in os.environ:
        os.environ['ANSIBLE_CONFIG'] = self.ansible_config_path

But wait, the docstring says "set it to self.ansible_config_path". So the code should set the environment variable to that path. The 'os.environ' is a dictionary, so assigning a value to it would set it. But what if the variable already exists? The docstring doesn't mention handling that, so the code just checks if it's not present and sets it.

So the code is straightforward. Import os, check if the variable is present, and set it if not.

I need to make sure that the code is correctly formatted. The function is part of a class, so the code should be within the class. But since the user hasn't provided the class definition, I'll assume that the method is part of a class and that self.ansible_config_path is an attribute.

So the final code would be:

import os

def inject_config(self):
    if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' not in os.environ:
        os.environ['ANSIBLE_CONFIG'] = self.ansible_config_path

But wait, the user said not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown. So the code should be just the Python code, no comments or explanations. Also, the code should be in Python markdown format, which I think refers to using triple backticks. But the user said output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format. So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks.

Wait, the user's instruction says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be written in Python, enclosed in triple backticks. But the code I wrote is already in Python. So the final answer is the code with the import statement and the function.

But wait, the import statement is needed. So the code would be:

import os

def inject_config(self):
    if 'ANSIBLE_CONFIG' not in os.environ:
        os.environ['ANSIBLE_CONFIG'] = self.ansible_config_path

But I need to make sure that the import is at the top. So the code would start with import os, then the function.

Yes, that's correct. So the final code is as above.
