Okay, I need to write a Python function called round_half_to_even that rounds a floating-point number to the nearest even number. Let me think about how to do this.

Hmm, the standard way to round to even is using the built-in round function, but I remember that round(2.5) gives 2, and round(3.5) gives 4. Wait, but the round function in Python rounds to the nearest even number when the number is exactly halfway between two integers. So for example, 2.5 would round to 2 (since 2 is even), and 3.5 would round to 4 (since 4 is even). But wait, what about numbers like 2.6? That would round to 3, and 2.4 would round to 2. So the round function already does this, but maybe the problem wants a different approach?

Wait, the problem says "round_half_to_even", which might imply that the function should handle cases where the number is exactly halfway between two integers. But the standard round function does that. However, maybe there's a case where the round function doesn't behave as expected. For example, round(2.5) is 2, which is even. Round(3.5) is 4, which is even. So maybe the built-in round function already does this. But perhaps the problem expects a different approach, like using the decimal module or some other method.

Wait, but the problem says "generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". The docstring says "Round a floating-point number". So maybe the intended solution is to use the built-in round function. But I need to make sure that it's correctly handling the even rounding.

Wait, let me check. For example, if the number is 2.5, round(2.5) is 2.0, which is even. If the number is 3.5, round(3.5) is 4.0, which is even. So the built-in round function already does this. So perhaps the function can just be a wrapper around the built-in round function.

But maybe there's a case where the round function doesn't behave as expected. For example, what about numbers like 1.5? Round(1.5) is 2.0, which is even. So that's correct. So perhaps the function can just be:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But wait, maybe the problem expects a different approach. For example, using the decimal module to handle the rounding. But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. Since the docstring says "Round a floating-point number", and the round function already does that, perhaps the simplest solution is to use the built-in round function.

But wait, maybe there's a case where the round function doesn't round to the nearest even number. For example, in Python 3, round(2.5) is 2, which is even. Round(3.5) is 4, which is even. So the built-in round function does the correct thing. So perhaps the function can just be:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But maybe the problem expects a different approach. For example, using the decimal module with the ROUND_HALF_UP mode. Let me think. If I use the decimal module, I can set the rounding mode to ROUND_HALF_UP, and then round the number. But how to do that?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a function that rounds to the nearest even number, but the built-in round function already does that. So perhaps the answer is just to use the built-in round function.

But let me check some examples. Let's take n = 2.5. round(2.5) is 2.0, which is even. For n = 3.5, round(3.5) is 4.0, which is even. For n = 2.6, round(2.6) is 3.0, which is even. For n = 2.4, round(2.4) is 2.0, which is even. So the built-in round function does the correct thing. Therefore, the function can be written as:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But maybe the problem expects a different approach. For example, using the decimal module. Let me think. Suppose I want to round to the nearest even number. The decimal module allows setting the rounding mode. For example, using ROUND_HALF_UP. But how to do that?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a function that rounds to the nearest even number, but the built-in round function already does that. So the code is as simple as returning round(n).

But maybe there's a case where the round function doesn't work as expected. For example, in Python 3, round(2.5) is 2, which is even. So the function is correct. Therefore, the code is as simple as returning round(n).

So the final code is:

def round_half_to_even(n):
    return round(n)

But wait, the docstring says "Round a floating-point number". So the function is correct. Therefore, the code is as above.
