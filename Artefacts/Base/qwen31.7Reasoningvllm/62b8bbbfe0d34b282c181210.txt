Okay, I need to write a Python function called append_text_to_file that takes file_name, text_buffer, encoding, and overwrite as parameters. The docstring says it writes the data in the text buffer to a file. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function needs to open the file. If overwrite is False, it should append the text instead of overwriting. So, the mode would be 'a' for append. But if overwrite is True, then mode 'w' would be used. Wait, but if overwrite is True, maybe the function should overwrite the file regardless of existing content. But the docstring says "writes the data in the text buffer to a file", so maybe overwrite is a flag to decide whether to overwrite or append.

So, the steps are: open the file with the appropriate mode based on overwrite. Then write the text_buffer to the file. Then close the file.

But wait, how to handle the encoding? The encoding parameter is passed, so we need to use that. So, when opening the file, we'll specify the encoding.

So, the code would be something like:

with open(file_name, 'w' if overwrite else 'a', encoding=encoding) as file:
    file.write(text_buffer)

But wait, what if the text_buffer is not a string? Well, the function's parameters are file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite. Assuming text_buffer is a string, but maybe it's better to check. But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature, so we'll proceed under the assumption that text_buffer is a string.

Wait, but the function is supposed to write the data in the text buffer to the file. So, the text_buffer is the data to write. So, the code would be:

open the file with the correct mode, write the text_buffer, then close.

So, the code would be:

def append_text_to_file(file_name, text_buffer, encoding, overwrite=False):
    """Writes the data in the text buffer to a file."""
    with open(file_name, 'w' if overwrite else 'a', encoding=encoding) as file:
        file.write(text_buffer)

Wait, but what if the file already exists? If overwrite is True, then 'w' mode will overwrite, which is correct. If overwrite is False, 'a' mode will append. So that's correct.

But what about if the file doesn't exist? The function will create it if it doesn't exist when using 'w' mode. But the docstring doesn't mention handling that, so perhaps that's beyond the scope here.

So, the code seems correct. Let me check the parameters again. The parameters are file_name (string), text_buffer (string), encoding (string), overwrite (boolean). The function returns nothing.

Yes, that's the code. So the generated Python code is as above.
