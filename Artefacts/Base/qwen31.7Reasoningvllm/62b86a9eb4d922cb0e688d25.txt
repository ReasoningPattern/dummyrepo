Okay, I need to generate a Python function called _get_resource_name_regex that returns the regular expressions for validating Krake resource names. The docstring says it returns the regexes used to validate the name.

First, I should think about what a valid Krake resource name might look like. Krake resources are probably something like project names, maybe with certain characters. Common regex patterns for resource names might include letters, numbers, underscores, and maybe some special characters.

But since the user didn't specify the exact requirements, I need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the resource names can contain letters (both cases), numbers, underscores, and maybe hyphens or spaces? Or maybe only letters and numbers?

Wait, the function is supposed to return the regexes. So I need to create a regex that matches valid Krake resource names. Let me think of possible characters. Typically, in resource names, you might have letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores. Maybe hyphens or spaces are allowed? Or maybe not. Since the problem is generic, perhaps the regex should allow letters, numbers, and underscores.

So the regex could be something like^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$. But that's too simple. Maybe more characters are allowed. For example, maybe the name can have underscores and letters, but not certain symbols. Or maybe it's allowed to have hyphens.

Alternatively, maybe the Krake resource names are case-insensitive, so the regex should handle both uppercase and lowercase. Also, the regex should allow for optional leading or trailing underscores? Or not?

Wait, the function is supposed to return the regexes. So perhaps the regex is for validating the name, which could be any string that follows certain rules. Let me think of common regex patterns for resource names.

For example, a common pattern is [a-zA-Z0-9_]+, which allows letters, numbers, and underscores. But maybe the Krake resource names can have more characters. For instance, maybe they can have hyphens or spaces. But without specific info, I have to make assumptions.

Assuming that the resource name can have letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. So the regex would be something like^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$. But maybe the hyphen is allowed. Alternatively, maybe the regex is more restrictive.

Alternatively, maybe the Krake resource names are case-sensitive, but the regex should handle both cases. So the regex would be [a-zA-Z0-9_]+.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided specific requirements. So I need to make a reasonable assumption here.

Another approach is to look for similar regex patterns in existing Krake documentation. But since I don't have that, I have to proceed with what's logical.

So, the function returns a list of regex patterns. For example, maybe there are multiple regexes for different parts of the name. But the docstring says "the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources". So perhaps the function returns a single regex pattern.

But the function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which suggests that it returns a list of regexes. However, the docstring says "return the regular expressions", so maybe it's a list.

But the user's example shows that the function is supposed to return the regexes. So perhaps the function returns a list of regex patterns.

So, the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return [
        r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$',  # Basic regex for resource names
        r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+$',  # Including hyphens
        r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+$',  # Including dots
    ]

But maybe the exact requirements are different. However, without more information, this is the best I can do.

Alternatively, maybe the regex is more complex. For example, allowing certain characters like spaces or underscores. But again, without knowing, I have to proceed with the most common cases.

So the code would return a list of regex patterns. The first one is the basic one, the second includes hyphens, and the third includes dots. But perhaps the dots are not allowed. Alternatively, maybe the dots are allowed for domain names, but not for resource names.

But again, without specific info, I have to make assumptions. So the code would be as above.
