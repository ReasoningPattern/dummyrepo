Okay, I need to write a Python function called try_retrieve_webfinger_document that takes a handle as a string and returns an Optional[str]. The docstring says it tries to retrieve an RFC7033 webfinger document and doesn't raise if it fails. So, the function should handle the retrieval, possibly with some error handling, but not raise exceptions.

First, I need to figure out how to retrieve the webfinger document. RFC7033 is the webfinger protocol, which is used to find contact information for a given handle. The standard way to do this is to make a GET request to the URL http://www.example.com/contacts/{handle} or similar, but I need to check the exact URL structure.

Wait, the RFC7033 specifies that the webfinger endpoint is at http://www.example.com/contacts/{handle}, but maybe the actual implementation uses a different base URL. However, the function's purpose is to retrieve the document, so perhaps the function is supposed to make a request to that URL.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to return an Optional[str], which means it can return None if the request fails. So, the function should attempt to make a request, handle any errors, and return the response content if successful, or None otherwise.

So, the steps are:

1. Construct the URL for the webfinger endpoint. Assuming the base URL is http://www.example.com/contacts/ and the handle is provided, the URL would be http://www.example.com/contacts/{handle}.

Wait, but maybe the actual URL is different. For example, some implementations use http://localhost:8080/contacts/{handle}, but the function's docstring doesn't specify. Since the problem doesn't provide specific details, I should use the standard RFC7033 URL structure.

So, the URL would be http://www.example.com/contacts/{handle}.

But perhaps the function is supposed to use a different base URL. However, without more information, I'll proceed with the standard example.

So, the code would involve making a GET request to that URL. Then, check the response status code. If it's 200, return the content. Otherwise, return None.

But how to handle the request in Python? Using requests library. But the problem says not to include any explanation, so I need to write the code that uses requests, but the function is supposed to be self-contained.

Wait, the function is part of a module, and the code should include the necessary imports. But the user hasn't specified any imports, so I need to include them.

So, the code would import requests, and then make a request.

But the function is supposed to return Optional[str], so if the request is successful, return the content, else None.

But what if the request fails? The function does not raise an error, so it just returns None.

So, the code would be:

import requests

def try_retrieve_webfinger_document(handle: str) -> Optional[str]:
    url = f"http://www.example.com/contacts/{handle}"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an exception for HTTP errors
        return response.text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # Handle any exceptions here, but the docstring says not to raise, so just return None
        return None

Wait, but the docstring says "does not raise if it fails". So, if the request fails (like network error, invalid URL, etc.), the function should return None, not raise an error.

But in the code above, if the request fails, the except block catches the exception and returns None. That's correct.

But what if the URL is invalid? For example, if the handle is not valid, the server might return 404. In that case, the code would return None.

So, the code seems correct.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to be called with a handle, and the URL is constructed with that handle. However, the actual implementation might need to handle different base URLs. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed with the standard example.

Another thing: the function is supposed to return Optional[str], so the code returns response.text if successful, else None.

So, the code should be as written above.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Also, the function is supposed to not raise any exceptions, so the try-except block is necessary.

So, the final code would include the imports, the function with the try-except block, and return the appropriate value.
