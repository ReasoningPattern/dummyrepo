Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called formatmany, and it's part of a class. The docstring says that it converts SQL using self._converter.convert_many.

First, I need to look at the parameters. The first parameter is sql, which is AnyStr. The second is many_params, which is a Union of Iterable of Dict[Union[str, int], Any] or Iterable of Sequence[Any]. The return type is a Tuple of AnyStr and either a List of Dict or a List of Sequence.

So the function is supposed to take the SQL string and a list of parameters, and return the formatted SQL and the parameters. But how does the conversion happen? The docstring mentions using self._converter.convert_many. So the function is likely just a wrapper that calls that method.

Wait, the function's return type is a tuple of the SQL and the parameters. But the parameters are either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. So the function needs to return the converted SQL and the same parameters, but maybe in a different format?

Wait, the docstring says "Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many". So maybe the function is supposed to take the SQL and the parameters, convert them using the converter, and return the converted SQL and the parameters. But the parameters are passed as many_params, which could be a list of dicts or sequences. So the function would call convert_many on the converter, passing the sql and many_params, and return the result.

But the return type is a tuple of the SQL and the parameters. Wait, the first element is the SQL, and the second is either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. So the function is supposed to return the converted SQL and the same parameters, but maybe in a different format? Or maybe the parameters are transformed by the converter?

Hmm, maybe the converter is supposed to process the parameters and return them in a certain format. But the function's return type is a tuple of the SQL and the parameters. So the function is just a wrapper that calls the converter's convert_many method, and returns the result.

So the code would be:

def formatmany(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:
		"""
		Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many
		"""
		return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But wait, the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. So the function returns the converted SQL (which is the result of convert_many) and the same parameters. But the parameters are passed as many_params, which could be a list of dicts or sequences. So the function is just calling the converter's method and returning the result.

But the problem is that the return type is a tuple of the SQL and the parameters. However, the converter's convert_many might return a different type. For example, if the converter's method returns a list of dicts or a list of sequences, then the function would return that. But the function's return type is a tuple of AnyStr and either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. So the function is supposed to return the converted SQL (which is the first element of the tuple) and the parameters (the second element). But the parameters are passed as many_params, which is the same as the one passed to convert_many.

Wait, but the function's parameters are sql and many_params. The return is the converted SQL and the same many_params. So the code would be:

return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. So the function is supposed to return the converted SQL (which is the result of convert_many) and the same parameters. But the parameters are passed as many_params, which is an iterable. So the function is just calling the converter's method and returning the result.

Therefore, the code is straightforward. The function just calls the converter's convert_many method and returns the result as a tuple. But the return type is a tuple of the SQL and the parameters. However, the parameters are passed as many_params, which is an iterable. So the function returns the converted SQL (which is the first element of the tuple) and the same parameters (the second element). But the parameters are passed as many_params, which is an iterable. So the function is just returning the converted SQL and the same parameters.

So the code would be:

def formatmany(
		self,
		sql: AnyStr,
		many_params: Union[Iterable[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], Iterable[Sequence[Any]]],
	) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[List[Dict[Union[str, int], Any]], List[Sequence[Any]]]]:
		"""
		Convert sql using self._converter.convert_many
		"""
		return self._converter.convert_many(sql, many_params)

But wait, the return type is a tuple of AnyStr and either a list of dicts or a list of sequences. So the function returns the converted SQL (which is the result of convert_many) and the same parameters. But the parameters are passed as many_params, which is an iterable. So the function is just returning the converted SQL and the same parameters. Therefore, the code is as above.

I think that's it. The function is a simple wrapper that calls the converter's method and returns the result as a tuple.
