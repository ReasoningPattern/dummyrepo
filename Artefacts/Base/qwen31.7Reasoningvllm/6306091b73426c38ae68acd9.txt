Okay, let's see. The user wants me to generate Python code based on the given function signature and docstring. The function is called workspace_manager and it's a class method. The docstring says it gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service().

First, I need to understand what the function is supposed to do. The docstring mentions that it's a class method, so it's likely part of a class. The function is supposed to retrieve the workspace manager service by calling cls._get_service() and then using the ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER.

Wait, the ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER is probably a constant or a class variable in the same namespace. So, the function would likely be something like:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    return cls._get_service().WORKSPACE_MANAGER

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check the syntax. Since it's a class method, the syntax would be def workspace_manager(cls): ... and then inside, it's using cls._get_service() which would return an instance, and then accessing the SERVICE_NAME constant.

But the problem is that the user hasn't provided the actual ServiceName class or the _get_service method. However, the function is supposed to be generated based on the given signature and docstring. So, the code should be written in a way that follows the docstring's description.

So, the code would be:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    return cls._get_service().WORKSPACE_MANAGER

But wait, the docstring is part of the function, so the code should include the docstring. However, the user's instruction says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. But the user also said not to include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. So, the code should be just the function definition with the docstring.

Wait, the user's example shows that the code is to be output in Python markdown format. But Python markdown is not a standard format. Maybe they mean that the code should be written in Python, using proper syntax.

So, the correct code would be the function definition with the docstring. But the user's example shows that the function is defined as:

def workspace_manager(cls):
    """
    Gets the workspace manager via ServiceName.WORKSPACE_MANAGER in cls._get_service()
    """
    ...

But the user wants the code generated based on the function signature and docstring. So, the code should be exactly that.

Therefore, the generated code is the function definition with the docstring as specified.
