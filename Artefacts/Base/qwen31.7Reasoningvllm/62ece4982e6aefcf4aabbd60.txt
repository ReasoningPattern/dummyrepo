Okay, I need to write a Python function called size_to_bytes that converts a human-readable file size string into bytes. The function takes a parameter 'size' which is a string like '500K'. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that common units like K, M, G are used for file sizes. So the input string will have a unit like K, M, G. The function needs to parse the numeric part and the unit, then convert it to bytes.

So the steps would be: parse the string to get the number and the unit. Then convert the number to bytes based on the unit.

Let me think about the possible units. The units can be 'K', 'M', 'G', 'T', etc. But the problem says the input is a string like '500K', so maybe the unit is one of these. So the function needs to check the unit and multiply by the appropriate factor.

For example, '500K' is 500 * 1024 bytes. '500M' is 500 * 1024^2 bytes, and so on.

So the plan is:

1. Split the input string into the numeric part and the unit.
2. Convert the numeric part to an integer.
3. Multiply by the appropriate factor based on the unit.
4. Return the result as an integer.

But how to split the string? For example, if the input is '500K', the numeric part is '500', the unit is 'K'. So maybe split on the last character that is a letter. But how to handle different units?

Alternatively, maybe use a dictionary to map units to their factors. Like, 'K' is 1024, 'M' is 1024^2, etc. Then, the numeric part is divided by the appropriate factor.

Wait, but the input could have multiple units? Like '500KMB'? But the problem says the input is a string like '500K', so probably the input is a single unit. So we can assume that the input is a single unit.

So the steps:

- Check if the string ends with 'K', 'M', 'G', etc. If it does, extract the number and the unit.

But how to handle cases where the unit is not present? Well, the function is supposed to handle the input as per the docstring, so perhaps the input is always valid.

So, for example, for '500K', split into '500' and 'K'. Then, the value is 500 * 1024.

But how to split the string? Maybe split the string into parts. For example, split on the last occurrence of a letter that is not a digit. Wait, but the unit is always a single letter. So perhaps the string can be split into two parts: the number part and the unit.

Another approach: the string can be split into the numeric part and the unit. For example, '500K' can be split into '500' and 'K'. So, maybe split the string into two parts, the first part is the number, the second is the unit.

But how to do that in Python? Maybe using string slicing. For example, find the index of the last character that is a letter. Then take the part before that as the number, and the rest as the unit.

Alternatively, use a regular expression to match the pattern. For example, a regex that matches the number and the unit.

Like, using re.match to find the number and the unit. For example, the pattern could be something like ^(\d+)([KMGTP])$.

Wait, but the problem says the input is a string like '500K', so the unit is one of K, M, G, T, P, etc. But the function is supposed to handle any valid unit. However, the problem's example uses K, M, G. But the function's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the code should handle the common units.

But the problem says the input is a string representing a human readable file size, so the unit is one of K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y. But the code needs to handle those.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the code can assume that the input is a single unit, and the unit is one of K, M, G, T, P, etc. So the code can check the unit and multiply by the appropriate factor.

So, the code can be structured as follows:

- Check if the input string is empty or not. If it's empty, return 0? Or maybe the function is supposed to handle only valid inputs.

But according to the problem, the function is supposed to take a string representing a human-readable size. So perhaps the input is always valid.

So, the steps:

1. Split the input string into the numeric part and the unit.

For example, for '500K', the numeric part is '500', the unit is 'K'.

How to split? Maybe find the index of the last character that is a letter. Then take the part before that as the number, and the rest as the unit.

But how to do that in Python?

Alternatively, use a regular expression to find the number and the unit.

For example, using re.match to find the pattern.

The pattern could be something like ^(\d+)([KMGTP])$.

So, using re.match with this pattern.

But the problem is that the input could have multiple units, but the docstring says it's a single unit. So the code can assume that.

So, the code can be:

import re

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    # Check if the input is empty
    if not size:
        return 0
    # Use regex to find the number and the unit
    match = re.match(r'^(\d+)([KMGTP])$', size)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid size format")
    number = int(match.group(1))
    unit = match.group(2)
    # Convert to bytes
    factors = {
        'K': 1024,
        'M': 1024**2,
        'G': 1024**3,
        'T': 1024**4,
        'P': 1024**5,
        'E': 1024**6,
        'Z': 1024**7,
        'Y': 1024**8,
    }
    # Get the factor
    factor = factors[unit]
    return number * factor

Wait, but what if the unit is not in the factors? Well, the code would raise a ValueError. But the problem says the input is a valid string, so perhaps the code can assume that.

But the problem's docstring says the input is a string like '500K', so the unit is one of K, M, G, etc. So the code can proceed.

But what if the input is '500' without a unit? Then the code would raise an error. But according to the problem, the input is a valid string, so perhaps the code can assume that.

But the function's docstring says that the input is a string representing a human-readable file size. So the code can assume that the input is properly formatted.

So, the code would work.

But wait, the regex is ^(\d+)([KMGTP])$ which requires that the input has a number and a unit. So if the input is '500', then the regex would not match, and the code would raise ValueError. But the problem says the input is a valid string, so perhaps the code can handle that.

But the function is supposed to handle the input as per the docstring. So the code would need to handle cases where the input is missing the unit. But the problem says the input is a valid string, so perhaps the code can assume that.

But in practice, the code would need to handle that. However, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, so perhaps the code can proceed as written.

Another thing to consider: the input could have leading or trailing whitespace. For example, ' 500 K ' would be parsed as '500' and 'K'. So the code should strip whitespace?

Wait, the problem says the input is a string representing a human-readable file size. So perhaps the input is properly formatted, but the code should process it as is. For example, if the input is ' 500K ', the code would split into '500' and 'K', which is correct.

But the code as written would not handle that. So perhaps the code should strip leading and trailing whitespace.

So, in the code, the input is stripped before processing.

So, modifying the code:

def size_to_bytes(size: str) -> int:
    size = size.strip()
    if not size:
        return 0
    match = re.match(r'^(\d+)([KMGTP])$', size)
    if not match:
        raise ValueError("Invalid size format")
    number = int(match.group(1))
    unit = match.group(2)
    factors = {
        'K': 1024,
        'M': 1024**2,
        'G': 1024**3,
        'T': 1024**4,
        'P': 1024**5,
        'E': 1024**6,
        'Z': 1024**7,
        'Y': 1024**8,
    }
    factor = factors[unit]
    return number * factor

But what if the unit is not in the factors? Well, the code would raise ValueError. But the problem says the input is valid.

So this should handle the cases.

But perhaps the code can use a more flexible approach. For example, the unit can be any of K, M, G, T, P, etc. But the code as written would handle the common ones.

So the code should be as above.

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function's docstring says that the input is a string like '500K', so the code should handle that.

So the final code would be as written.
