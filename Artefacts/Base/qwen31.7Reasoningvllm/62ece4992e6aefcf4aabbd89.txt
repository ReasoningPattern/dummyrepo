Okay, I need to write a Python function called gaussian that calculates a Gaussian function centered at u=0.2 with sigma=0.1. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the Gaussian function is usually defined as (1/(sigma * sqrt(2π))) * e^(-((x - u)^2)/(2*sigma^2)). So the parameters here are u=0.2 and sigma=0.1.

The function takes x as input. So I need to compute the value of the Gaussian at each x.

Let me break it down. The formula requires calculating (x - u), then squaring it, dividing by 2*sigma², then exponentiating, and then multiplying by the normalization factor.

Wait, the normalization factor is 1/(sigma * sqrt(2π)). So in code, that would be 1/(sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi)).

So the steps are:

1. Compute the numerator part: (x - u)
2. Square it: (x - u)^2
3. Divide by (2 * sigma²)
4. Exponentiate that value.
5. Multiply by the normalization factor.

But wait, in Python, I need to import math for the sqrt and exp functions.

So the code would look something like:

import math

def gaussian(x):
    u = 0.2
    sigma = 0.1
    term = (x - u) ** 2
    exponent = -term / (2 * sigma**2)
    norm = 1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))
    return norm * math.exp(exponent)

Wait, but what about the order of operations? Let me check.

Yes, the exponent is calculated first, then multiplied by the normalization factor.

Testing with x=0.2, the term would be 0, exponent is 0, so the result is norm * 1, which is correct.

I think that's all. So the code should import math, define the function with u and sigma as constants, compute the terms as described, and return the result.
