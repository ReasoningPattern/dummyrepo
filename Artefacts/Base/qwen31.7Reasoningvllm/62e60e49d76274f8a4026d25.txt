Okay, I need to generate a Python function called unit_of_work that serves as a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the function is supposed to return a decorator. So the unit_of_work function should take metadata and timeout as parameters, but since it's a decorator, it's usually applied to a function. Wait, but the docstring says it returns a decorator with metadata and timeout attributes. So maybe the decorator is a function that can be applied to other functions, and when applied, it adds metadata and timeout to the decorated function.

But the function signature is def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):. So the decorator is created by this function. So the decorator will have attributes metadata and timeout, which can be set when the decorator is used.

Wait, but how does the decorator work? Let me think. When you use a decorator, it's usually applied to a function. So the unit_of_work function would be a decorator that takes metadata and timeout, and then when you apply it to another function, it adds those attributes to the decorated function.

But the problem is that the unit_of_work function is supposed to return the decorator. So the decorator would need to have the metadata and timeout attributes. But how?

Wait, maybe the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that, when applied to a function, adds the metadata and timeout to that function. So the decorator would have attributes metadata and timeout, which are set when the decorator is used.

But how to structure that. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have a function f that I want to decorate. When I use @unit_of_work(metadata='some_metadata', timeout=10), then f will have metadata and timeout as attributes.

So the unit_of_work function needs to return a decorator that, when applied to a function, adds those attributes.

But how to implement that in Python. The decorator is a function that takes the function to decorate and returns a new function. So the unit_of_work function would return a decorator that, when applied, adds the metadata and timeout to the decorated function.

So the unit_of_work function would need to take metadata and timeout as parameters, and then return a decorator that, when applied, sets those attributes.

Wait, but the parameters metadata and timeout are passed to the unit_of_work function. So the decorator is created with those parameters. So the decorator would have the metadata and timeout attributes.

But how to make sure that when the decorator is applied, those attributes are set on the decorated function.

So the unit_of_work function would return a decorator that, when applied to a function, adds the metadata and timeout to the function.

So the code would look something like this:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        # Set the metadata and timeout attributes on the decorated function
        # But how to do that? Because the decorator is a function that returns a function.
        # So the decorator would need to have the metadata and timeout as attributes.
        # Wait, but the decorator is a function that is returned by unit_of_work. So when you apply the decorator, it's applied to the function, and the metadata and timeout are set on the function.

        # So the decorator function would need to have the metadata and timeout as attributes.
        # But how to do that. Maybe the decorator is a function that, when called, returns a new function with the attributes.

        # Wait, perhaps the unit_of_work function returns a decorator that, when applied, adds the metadata and timeout to the decorated function.

        # So the decorator would be a function that takes the function to decorate and returns a new function with the attributes.

        # So the decorator would have to set the metadata and timeout on the decorated function.

        # So, in the decorator function, we can set the attributes.

        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # The wrapper is the decorated function.
            # So, we can set the metadata and timeout on the wrapper.
            # But wait, the wrapper is the decorated function. So when the decorator is applied, the wrapper is the function that's being decorated.

            # So, the metadata and timeout are attributes of the wrapper.

            # So, in the wrapper, we can set them.

            # But how to do that. Let's see.

            # For example, when you apply @decorator, the decorated function is wrapper.

            # So, the decorator would need to set the metadata and timeout on the wrapper.

            # So, in the decorator, we can do:

            wrapper.metadata = metadata
            wrapper.timeout = timeout

            return wrapper

        # But then, the decorator would need to return the wrapper.

        # But wait, the unit_of_work function is supposed to return the decorator. So the decorator is the function that is returned by unit_of_work.

        # So, the unit_of_work function would return the decorator, which is the wrapper function.

        # So, the code would be:

        return decorator

    return decorator

Wait, but that would mean that the decorator is a function that returns a function, which is then applied to the original function. But in this case, the decorator is a function that, when applied, sets the metadata and timeout on the decorated function.

But how does that work? Let's think of an example.

Suppose I have:

@unit_of_work(metadata='test', timeout=10)
def my_func():
    pass

Then, my_func would have metadata='test' and timeout=10.

But in the code above, the decorator is a function that, when applied, sets the metadata and timeout on the wrapper (the decorated function). So the wrapper is the function that's being decorated.

So, the code for the unit_of_work function would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            wrapper.metadata = metadata
            wrapper.timeout = timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

Wait, but then the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper. But the wrapper is the decorated function. So when you apply @unit_of_work, the decorator is applied to the function, and the wrapper is the decorated function.

But in this case, the wrapper is the decorated function, and the metadata and timeout are set on the wrapper.

But then, when you call the wrapper, it would have the metadata and timeout attributes.

But the problem is that the wrapper is a function, and the metadata and timeout are attributes of the wrapper. So when you apply the decorator, the wrapper (the decorated function) has those attributes.

So, the code for the unit_of_work function would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            wrapper.metadata = metadata
            wrapper.timeout = timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper. So when you apply @unit_of_work, the decorator is applied to the function, and the wrapper is the decorated function.

But in this code, the wrapper is the decorated function, and the metadata and timeout are set on the wrapper.

But then, when you call the wrapper, it would have those attributes. So, for example, if you have:

@unit_of_work(metadata='test', timeout=10)
def my_func():
    pass

Then, my_func would have metadata='test' and timeout=10.

But in the code above, the wrapper is the decorated function, and the metadata and timeout are set on the wrapper.

But in the code, the wrapper is a function that is returned by the decorator. So when you apply the decorator, the wrapper is the function that's being decorated.

So, the code seems correct.

But wait, the unit_of_work function is supposed to return a decorator. So the code above would return the decorator, which is the wrapper function.

But then, when you apply the decorator, the wrapper is the decorated function, and the metadata and timeout are set on the wrapper.

So, the code would work.

But then, the unit_of_work function is a decorator that takes metadata and timeout as parameters, and returns a decorator that, when applied to a function, sets those attributes on the function.

But the problem is that the unit_of_work function is supposed to return the decorator, which is a function that takes the function to decorate and returns a wrapper.

But in the code above, the unit_of_work function returns the decorator, which is the wrapper function.

So, the code seems correct.

But perhaps there's a better way to do this. For example, the decorator could be a function that, when applied, adds the metadata and timeout to the decorated function.

But in Python, when you use a decorator, the decorator is a function that returns a new function. So the unit_of_work function is a decorator that returns a function that, when applied to another function, adds the metadata and timeout.

So the code as written should work.

But wait, the parameters metadata and timeout are passed to the unit_of_work function. So when you call unit_of_work(metadata='test'), the decorator is created with metadata='test' and timeout=None.

But in the code above, the decorator is created with metadata and timeout as parameters, but in the code, the decorator is a function that takes func as an argument, and then sets the metadata and timeout on the wrapper.

Wait, no. The code as written has the unit_of_work function returning a decorator that, when applied, sets the metadata and timeout on the wrapper.

But in the code, the decorator is a function that takes func as an argument, and then returns a wrapper that sets the metadata and timeout on the wrapper.

So, the unit_of_work function is a decorator that takes metadata and timeout, and returns a decorator that, when applied to a function, sets those attributes on the function.

So, the code should be correct.

But perhaps there's a mistake here. Because the metadata and timeout are passed to the unit_of_work function, but in the code, they are set on the wrapper. So, for example, if you have:

@unit_of_work(metadata='test', timeout=10)
def my_func():
    pass

Then, the wrapper (my_func) has metadata='test' and timeout=10.

But in the code, the wrapper is created as follows:

def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    wrapper.metadata = metadata
    wrapper.timeout = timeout
    return func(*args, **kwargs)

So, the metadata and timeout are set on the wrapper, which is the decorated function.

Yes, that's correct.

So the code should be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            wrapper.metadata = metadata
            wrapper.timeout = timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper. So when you apply @unit_of_work, the decorator is applied to the function, and the wrapper is the decorated function.

But in this code, the wrapper is a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes. So when you call the wrapper, it would have those attributes.

But the problem is that the wrapper is a function, and the metadata and timeout are attributes of the function. So, for example, if you have:

@unit_of_work(metadata='test', timeout=10)
def my_func():
    pass

Then, my_func has metadata and timeout as attributes.

But in Python, when you assign attributes to a function, they are stored as part of the function's __dict__.

So, this code should work.

But perhaps there's a better way to do this. For example, the unit_of_work function could return a decorator that, when applied, adds the metadata and timeout to the decorated function.

But the code as written should work.

So, the final code would be:

def unit_of_work(metadata=None, timeout=None):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            wrapper.metadata = metadata
            wrapper.timeout = timeout
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

But wait, the decorator is a function that returns a wrapper. So when you apply @unit_of_work, the decorator is applied to the function, and the wrapper is the decorated function.

But in the code, the wrapper is a function that has metadata and timeout as attributes. So when you call the wrapper, it would have those attributes.

But in the code, the wrapper is created as part of the decorator. So, the code should work.

Therefore, the generated code is as above.
