Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function list_of_file_names based on the given docstring. The docstring says it creates and returns a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames(). Hmm, so first I should figure out what cli.ListOfFileNames does. Probably, it's a class or a function from some module that handles file names in an INI context. 

The function takes two parameters: settings_dirs and spec_option. The name suggests that settings_dirs is a list of directories where settings are stored, and spec_option is some kind of specification option. 

Wait, the function's purpose is to create an IniType using cli.ListOfFileNames. So maybe cli.ListOfFileNames is a factory function that takes these parameters to construct the type. The IniType is a complex type that can be used in some configuration or CLI setup. 

I should think about how the parameters are used here. The settings_dirs might be passed as a list to the constructor, and spec_option could be part of the specification. Maybe the IniType needs to know the directories to look for files and some specific option from spec_option. 

The code probably imports some module, like cli, which has ListOfFileNames. Then, the function calls cli.ListOfFileNames with the given arguments. But the exact parameters might vary. Let me see. The docstring mentions "new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()", so the return is an instance of that type. 

Wait, maybe the function is part of a larger framework, like Azure CLI extensions? Because sometimes those use cli classes for parameter types. The IniType might be a custom type that validates file names against the directories in settings_dirs. 

So the code would be something like:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return cli.ListOfFileNames()(settings_dirs, spec_option)

Wait, but maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a class that needs to be instantiated, and then called? Or perhaps the function is a factory. Alternatively, maybe the parameters are passed directly to the constructor. Like:

return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But the docstring says "via cli.ListOfFileNames()", which might mean that IniType is created by calling that function. So perhaps the correct code is to just call cli.ListOfFileNames with the arguments and return it. 

Wait, but the user's function is supposed to create an IniType. Maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames returns the type when called with those parameters. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to initialize the IniType with those settings. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that uses cli, so the function is defining a parameter type. Like, in Azure CLI, you might have a custom type that's created by calling cli.generic_type or something similar. 

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to import the necessary module and then use the cli.ListOfFileNames to create the complex type. The function's job is to generate this type based on the input parameters. 

Looking at the docstring's first line: "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So the return is the result of calling cli.ListOfFileNames(), but maybe the parameters settings_dirs and spec_option are passed into that call. 

Wait, maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that takes those parameters. So the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But that's assuming that cli.ListOfFileNames is the constructor for IniType. Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that uses a decorator or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the IniType is created by passing the settings_dirs and spec_option as arguments. So the code would just be returning that. 

Alternatively, maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a class, and the function creates an instance by initializing it with the parameters. 

Wait, the problem is that the user provided a docstring that's a bit vague. Since the function's name is list_of_file_names, and the parameters are settings_dirs and spec_option, the code must pass these parameters to the cli.ListOfFileNames() call. 

The function's return is the IniType, which is created via the cli function. So the code would be as simple as importing the cli module and returning the result of cli.ListOfFileNames with the given arguments. 

Wait, but the docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So the actual creation is done by cli.ListOfFileNames, which probably takes those two parameters. 

Therefore, the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

But maybe the parameters are passed in a different way. Like, perhaps settings_dirs is a list of directories, and spec_option is an option that specifies something like the file extension or a pattern. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to construct a list of file names from the directories and then pass that to IniType. But the docstring mentions using cli.ListOfFileNames, so I think the code is straightforward. 

Wait, the problem says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So I have to make sure that the code is correctly structured. Since the user provided the function signature, I just need to write the function body. 

Wait, but the function's docstring says "Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()". So perhaps the code is:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    """
    Create and return a new IniType complex type via cli.ListOfFileNames()
    """
    return cli.ListOfFileNames()(settings_dirs, spec_option)

Wait, maybe the cli.ListOfFileNames is a factory that returns a callable which then takes the parameters. Like, if ListOfFileNames() returns a class, then instantiating it with the parameters would create the IniType. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to call cli.ListOfFileNames with the parameters. Let me think of possible scenarios. 

In Azure CLI, for example, there's a approach where parameter types are created using decorators or factories. So maybe cli.ListOfFileNames is a function that returns a type, and the parameters are passed to it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the IniType is created by passing the spec_option into the cli.ListOfFileNames, but I'm not sure. 

The problem is that without knowing the exact structure of the cli module, it's a bit ambiguous. But given the minimal information, the most logical code is to return the result of cli.ListOfFileNames called with the two arguments. 

Wait, but the function is called list_of_file_names and the return is an IniType. Maybe the function is supposed to pass the settings_dirs and spec_option to the cli.ListOfFileNames. 

So the code would be:

def list_of_file_names(settings_dirs, spec_option):
    return cli.ListOfFileNames(settings_dirs, spec_option)

Alternatively, maybe the parameters are passed as separate arguments. Let me check the parameters again. The function has two parameters, so the cli function probably takes both. 

I think that's the way to go. The code should be straightforward, just returning the cli call with the given parameters. 

Wait, but maybe the spec_option is an argument that's part of the specification for the IniType, like a validation function or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to create an instance of IniType by passing those parameters. 

Well, given the information provided, the best guess is to return the cli.ListOfFileNames function with the two parameters. 

So the code would be as above. Also, need to make sure that the code is in the correct format, with the function definition and the return statement. 

Another possibility is that cli.ListOfFileNames is a class, and the function returns an instance of it initialized with the parameters. 

In that case, the code is the same. 

So I think that's the correct approach. Let me write that.
