Okay, so I need to write the Python code for the popitem method based on the given docstring. The function is supposed to find, remove, and return a random (key, value) pair using __choice in the class. Hmm, wait, the method is part of a class, right? Since it's using self, probably a dictionary subclass or something similar.

The popitem method typically removes and returns an arbitrary item from a dictionary. But the doc mentions using __choice. Oh, maybe __choice is a method that selects a random key from the dictionary? Like, perhaps the class has a __choice function that picks a random key. But how does that work?

Let me think. In Python, the standard dict.popitem() doesn't use a random key; it's LIFO usually. But here the requirement is for a random pair. So maybe this class has a way to choose a random key. The method should first select a random key using __choice, then remove that key and return the (key, value) pair.

Wait, but __choice is probably a method of the class. So the code would be something like this: get a random key by calling self.__choice(), then pop that key and return it along with its value. But how to implement __choice?

Alternatively, maybe __choice is a function that the class has, which returns a random key from the instance's keys. So in the popitem method, first select the key via that function, then pop it. So the steps are:

1. Check if the dictionary is empty. Because if it is, popping would raise KeyError. But the standard popitem does that, so maybe here too. The doc doesn't mention handling empty, so perhaps assume there's at least one item.

2. Use self.__choice() to get a random key. Wait, but how does __choice work? Since it's part of the class, maybe it's using random.choice on the keys. But in a dictionary, the keys are accessible via self.keys() or something. But in a regular dict, you can do list(self.keys()) to get a list, then pick a random one.

Wait, but the method is part of a class, so maybe the __choice method is already implemented to return a random key. So the popitem method's code would be straightforward. Let me see:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

But that's assuming that __choice exists and returns a key. But what if __choice is a class-level function? Or maybe it's a method that takes the keys? Wait, the problem says "via __choice in the class". So perhaps the __choice is a method that the class has, which selects a random key from the instance's keys.

Wait, but the __choice method would need to have access to the keys. So maybe in the class, there's a way to get the keys. For example, if this is a subclass of dict, then self has the keys. So __choice might be something like using random.choice(list(self.keys())). But the user's code is supposed to use __choice, not implement it here. Because the function signature is just popitem, so the __choice is already part of the class. So the code for popitem is as I thought before: get the key via __choice, then pop it.

Wait, but in that case, the __choice method might not exist. The problem says to generate the code based on the docstring, so maybe the __choice is a method that the class has. So the code is correct as above. However, in Python, if you have a method with __choice, it's a private method, but the user's code can call it via self.__choice().

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a class attribute, like a function. But the code should just use it. So the popitem method would first choose a random key using self.__choice(), then pop that key.

Another possible issue: the __choice might return a list or something, but I think the idea is that it returns a single key. So the code should work.

Wait, but maybe the __choice is supposed to be a way to pick the key, like a helper function. Let me think of possible edge cases. What if the dictionary is empty? Then __choice might raise an error, but the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps the code can just proceed, but the __choice method would handle that. Alternatively, maybe we need to check first. But the problem says to generate code based on the docstring, so maybe the code doesn't have to handle that. The standard popitem raises KeyError when empty, so perhaps we should do the same here. But how? If __choice returns a key when the dict is not empty, then the code is okay. Otherwise, when the dict is empty, __choice might return None, but then we would have a KeyError when popping. Or perhaps the __choice method already checks that and raises KeyError. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the code is as simple as above.

Wait, but in Python, the standard popitem for a dict doesn't use random. So this must be a custom class, maybe a subclass of dict. So the __choice method is part of that class. So the code for popitem is as I thought. Let me write that.

Wait, but maybe the __choice is a class-level method? Or maybe an instance method. The code uses self, so the __choice is an instance method. So the code is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice is a class attribute, like a function. But the way to call it would still be self.__choice(). Hmm, but that's a method. Wait, perhaps the __choice is a dunder method, like __choice__? No, the doc says __choice in the class. So the code should call self.__choice().

Wait, but maybe the __choice is a function that's part of the class, so the code can do key = random.choice(self). Not sure, but the doc specifically says to use __choice. So the code must use that method.

Another point: the popitem method is supposed to return a tuple of (key, value). So after getting the key via __choice, we pop it and return the key and value. So the code should be something like:

key = self.__choice()
value = self.pop(key)
return (key, value)

But is that correct? Let me see: when you call pop on the key, it removes it and returns the value. So the pair is (key, value). So yes, that's right.

Wait, but what if __choice returns a key that's not present? Then pop would raise KeyError. But assuming that the __choice method returns a valid key, since it's supposed to choose from the existing keys.

So the code would be as above. Let me check again. The function's docstring says "Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So the __choice is used to find the key. So the code first finds the key via __choice, then removes it (using pop) and returns the pair.

Wait, but the __choice might not return the key. Maybe it's a helper function to select the pair? Or perhaps the __choice is a way to get a random item. Maybe the __choice is a method that returns a random key, and then the value is obtained via self.pop.

Yes, that's probably the case. So the code is as written. Let me make sure there's no other steps. The method must be part of a class that has __choice implemented. So the code is correct.

Another possible approach: if the __choice is a function that returns a tuple, but the doc says to return a (key, value) pair. So maybe the __choice is supposed to return a key, then pop it, or maybe it returns the pair directly? Let me re-read the docstring. The first sentence says "Find, remove and return a random (key, value) pair via __choice in the class". So maybe the __choice method is responsible for both finding and removing? But that's unlikely. Probably, the __choice finds a random key, then we remove it and return the pair.

Alternatively, maybe __choice is a method that returns a random key, and then we get the value, remove it, and return. The code as before.

Wait, but in that case, the code would have to get the value first, then delete the key. Because if you call self.pop(key), you get the value. So the code would be:

key = self.__choice()
value = self[key]
del self[key]
return (key, value)

But that's two steps. Which is better? The first approach uses pop which does both. So that's better. So the first code is better. So the code is as I thought.

Wait, but in the first code, the pop returns the value, so the pair is (key, value). So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, but what if __choice returns None or a key that's not in the dictionary? Then the pop would fail. But the doc says the __choice is in the class, so it's expected that it returns a valid key. So the code should be okay.

So putting that into code. The method is part of a class, so the code would be inside a class, perhaps a subclass of dict. But the user's code only needs to implement the popitem method, so the __choice is already there. So the code is:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return self.pop(key), key

Wait, no. Wait, the pop returns the value. So the order would be (key, value). So the code would have to return (key, value). But in the code above, if you do self.pop(key), that returns the value, so the tuple would be (value, key). Wait, no, that's the reverse. So that code would be incorrect.

Wait, right! So the code as I first wrote would have:

value = self.pop(key)
return (key, value)

Yes, that's correct. So the code should be structured that way. So the first approach is right.

Alternatively, maybe the __choice method can return the key and value? But the doc says to use __choice in the class. The code is supposed to use that method to find the key, then remove and return it.

Therefore, the correct code is:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

Wait, but how does __choice work? Let's think. Suppose the class has a __choice method that uses random.choice on the keys. For example, if the class is a dictionary-like structure, then __choice might be something like:

def __choice(self):
    return random.choice(list(self.keys()))

But that's part of the class's implementation, not the popitem's. Since the user's code is only for popitem, that's okay. So the code above should work.

Wait, but in Python, when you call a method named __choice, you have to make sure it's actually defined. But the problem states that the code should use __choice in the class, so the method is there. So the code is correct.

Another thing: the method should return a tuple. So using return (key, value) is okay, but even return self.pop(key), key would work, but the first way is more explicit.

Hmm, perhaps the __choice could return a key, but maybe in some cases, like if the dictionary is empty, but the pop would raise KeyError, so that's okay.

Therefore, the code should be as written. I think that's the way to go. Let me make sure there's no other way. For example, maybe using popitem() from the parent class, but the doc says to use __choice. So no. The code must use __choice.

Yes, so the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    return (key, self.pop(key))

Wait, but in that case, the order is (key, value), which is correct. So either way is fine. But the first version stores the value first. Wait, no, in the first version, the code first calls self.pop(key) and returns the value, so the key is stored, then the value is obtained from popping. So the order is correct. Alternatively, in the second version, the key is stored first, then the value is popped. Either way, the code is okay.

Wait, but in the first version:

value = self.pop(key)
return (key, value)

Yes, that's correct. So the code is as such.

Therefore, the code should be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.__choice()
    value = self.pop(key)
    return (key, value)

I think that's the correct approach. Let me see if I can think of any other possible issues. For instance, the __choice method might return a tuple, but the doc says to return a key and value pair. The doc says "via __choice in the class" so the __choice is used to find the key, not the pair. Therefore, the code is correct.

Another possible way: maybe __choice is a static method or something, but the code would still call self.__choice(). So that's okay. Alright, I think that's the right code.
