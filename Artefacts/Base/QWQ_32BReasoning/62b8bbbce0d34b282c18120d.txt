Okay, I need to write a Python function called is_file_exist that checks if a given file name exists. Let's see, the function should take a string file_name as input. The docstring says to check whether it's an existing file. 

Hmm, how do I check if a file exists in Python? Oh right, the os module has a function for that. Or maybe os.path.exists? Wait, but that can return True for directories too. The user wants to check specifically for a file, not a directory. So maybe I should use os.path.isfile along with os.path.exists.

Wait, the correct approach would be to check if the path exists and is a regular file. So combining both: first check if exists with os.path.exists(file_name), then make sure it's a file with os.path.isfile. So the function would return the result of os.path.isfile(file_name) and os.path.exists(file_name) together? Actually, because os.path.isfile already checks that the path exists and is a file, maybe just using os.path.isfile is sufficient. Let me think. 

Yes, because according to the documentation, os.path.isfile returns True if the path is an existing regular file. So if I just use that, it should work. So the function can be as simple as importing os.path and returning os.path.isfile(file_name). 

Wait, but what about different operating systems? Oh, the os.path module is cross-platform, so that's okay. I should import os.path. 

Wait, the function's name is is_file_exist, but the correct spelling might be 'exists' instead of 'exist'? The function's name uses 'exist' but the docstring says 'existing'. Probably a typo, but the function name is given as is_file_exist, so I should follow that. 

So putting it all together: 

First, import the necessary module. The code would be:

import os.path

def is_file_exist(file_name):
    """
    Check whether file_name is an existing file.
    """
    return os.path.isfile(file_name)

That should do it. Let me test this logic. Suppose the file exists, then isfile returns True. If it's a directory, returns False. If it doesn't exist at all, also False. Exactly what the function needs. So this code should work. I don't need to check existence separately because isfile does that. 

I think that's all. The function is straightforward. Just return the result of os.path.isfile on the provided filename. The docstring is already given, so I just have to make sure the code is correct. Oh right, and the user wants the code without any explanations, just the code in markdown. So I'll write the code as specified.
