Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called load_configurations based on the given docstring. The function takes config_filenames as a sequence of filenames, overrides which is optional, and resolve_env which defaults to True. 

The goal is to load each configuration file, validate them, handle any errors like permission issues or parsing errors, record those errors as LogRecords, and return a tuple with the parsed configs and the log records.

Hmm, first, I should think about how to read the files. Maybe using a try-except block for each file. The exceptions I need to catch would be things like FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and maybe JSONDecodeError if they're JSON files? Wait, the problem says "error parsing configuration file", but the format isn't specified. Oh right, maybe the function is supposed to handle any parsing errors, but since the user didn't specify the format, perhaps I can assume that each file is in a format that can be parsed into a dictionary, like JSON or YAML. But since the function's parameters don't mention the format, maybe the actual parsing is left to some other method, or perhaps it's just a generic parsing approach. Wait, maybe I should just read the files as some kind of config, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to parse them as JSON? Because that's a common config format. Alternatively, maybe the user expects using a configparser for INI files. But the problem's docstring doesn't specify, so maybe I can use a generic approach. Wait, but the function's return is a dict of filename to parsed config. So the parsed config is a dictionary. So maybe the files are in a format that can be read into a dictionary, like JSON. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is using some existing library, but since the problem doesn't mention any dependencies, I should stick to standard libraries. Let's think: in the standard library, maybe using json.load? So the function would read each file as JSON. 

Wait, but the problem says "error parsing configuration file", so when the file can't be parsed, we need to log that. So first, for each filename in config_filenames, we need to open the file. Let's start with that loop. 

The steps would be: for each filename in config_filenames, try to open and read it. If there's a permission error, log that. If there's a parsing error (like invalid JSON), log that too. 

Then, after reading all the files, collect the parsed configs into a dictionary (filename to config) and all the error records into a list. 

Also, the overrides parameter is a dict. I suppose that after parsing the config from the file, we can apply the overrides to it. Like merging the overrides into the parsed config. So for each config, after parsing, check if overrides is provided, and then update the config with the overrides. Wait, but how exactly? Maybe the overrides are key-value pairs that replace the existing ones in the config. So the function would take the parsed config, then apply the overrides by updating the dict with the overrides. 

But the problem says "overrides=None" so if it's not None, we need to apply them. Also, resolve_env=True: perhaps that means to resolve environment variables in the config? Like if the config has a value like ${VAR}, then replace that with the actual environment variable. But how to implement that? Maybe using os.environ to get variables, and some string replacement. 

Wait, the function's parameters are a bit ambiguous. Let me read the docstring again. 

The function should return a tuple of two elements: the first is a dict mapping each config filename to its parsed configuration, and the second is a list of LogRecord instances for any parse errors. 

So first, I need to process each config file. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize a dictionary for the configurations and a list for the log records.

2. Iterate over each filename in config_filenames.

3. For each filename:
   a. Try to open the file. If there's a permission error, log it and skip this file.
   b. Read the file's contents. Then parse it into a dictionary. If parsing fails (like JSON syntax error), log the error and skip.
   c. If overrides are provided, apply them to the parsed config. How exactly? Maybe the overrides are a dictionary where each key is a setting to override. So after parsing the config, we do config.update(overrides) or something like that. But maybe the overrides should be applied on top of the parsed data, so that any key in overrides replaces the corresponding key in the config.
   d. If resolve_env is True, substitute environment variables in the config. That part is a bit trickier. For example, if the config has a string value like "value: ${HOME}", then we need to replace ${HOME} with the actual environment variable. How to do that recursively? Maybe using a function that walks through the config's dictionary and replaces any strings that match the pattern. Or perhaps using the os.path.expandvars function? Wait, expandvars is for expanding variables in paths, but maybe that can be used here. For instance, if a value is a string, we can check for ${VAR} patterns and replace them with the environment variable's value. 

   So for resolve_env, we can loop through the config's keys and values, and if any value is a string, expand it using os.path.expandvars. But maybe this needs to be done recursively for nested dictionaries? That complicates things. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe just do a top-level expansion? Or perhaps the function is designed to handle that. Since the problem says "resolve_env=True", maybe we should at least try to substitute environment variables in the config values. 

4. Once a config is parsed, overrides applied, and environment variables resolved (if needed), add it to the configurations dict.

Now, for the logging part. The function should record errors (like permission issues or parsing errors) as LogRecords. Wait, the problem says "sequence of logging.LogRecord instances". So I can't just use the logging module's functions like logger.error, because that would log messages to the log handlers, but the function needs to collect LogRecord objects. 

Hmm, how to create LogRecord instances. The logging module has a LogRecord class, but constructing instances directly might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe use a logger and capture the emitted records. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can create the LogRecords manually. For example, when an error occurs, create a LogRecord with the appropriate message, level (ERROR), etc. But that requires knowing the parameters needed to construct a LogRecord. Let me check the LogRecord constructor. 

Looking at the documentation, LogRecord is initialized with: 

LogRecord(name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, sinfo=None, created=None)

Hmm, that's a bit complex. Alternatively, maybe use the logging.makeLogRecord function, but that requires a dictionary with specific fields. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function should have its own logger, and then capture the logs by setting up a memory handler or something. Wait, but the problem states that the error log will be recorded, and the function should return the LogRecord instances. 

Wait, maybe the function is using a custom list to collect LogRecords, and whenever an error happens, it appends a LogRecord to that list. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is using the logging module's functions, but we can capture all the logs emitted during the process. To do that, maybe set up a temporary handler that collects LogRecords. But that might complicate things. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the function to create LogRecord objects directly when errors occur, and append them to the list. 

Let me think. For each error, we can create a LogRecord. For example, when there's a permission error:

record = logging.LogRecord(...)

But I need to figure out the parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function will use a logger and then the LogRecords are created through that. To collect them, maybe we can have a list that is populated whenever an error is logged. 

Wait, but how to do that without a handler. Maybe we can create a logger, and then have a handler that appends to a list. 

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to create a list to collect all the error records. Each time an error occurs, we create a LogRecord and add it to the list. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the LogRecords that were created via the logging module's functions. So, for example, when an error occurs, the function calls logging.error or something, but then the LogRecords are collected into a list. To do that, we might need to set up a handler that stores the records. 

But the problem says the function should return the LogRecord instances. So perhaps the function is not using the standard logging system, but instead creating LogRecord objects directly. 

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the logging module's functions, and the LogRecords are created automatically, but the user wants to collect them. To do that, I can create a list and use a handler that adds each record to the list. 

Let me think of the steps again. 

First, the function must process each config file. For each file:

- Try to open and read the file. If there's an IOError (like PermissionError, or file not found), create a LogRecord with the error message and add to the list. 

Wait, but FileNotFoundError is a subclass of OSError. So catching PermissionError and OSError (or more specifically, FileNotFoundError) would cover those cases. 

Then, after reading the file, parse it. Let's assume JSON for now, unless the problem says otherwise. So using json.load. 

If there's a JSONDecodeError, that's a parsing error. So again, log that as an error. 

Then, apply overrides. So if overrides is not None, then for each key in overrides, set config[key] = overrides[key]. 

Then, if resolve_env is True, substitute environment variables in the config's values. 

Wait, how exactly? Let's say the config has a value like "some string with ${VAR}". The function would need to replace that with the actual environment variable's value. 

So perhaps using os.path.expandvars on the string. For example, if the value is a string, then we can do:

value = os.path.expandvars(value)

That would replace $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE} with their environment variable values. 

But this would only work for top-level strings, not nested ones. But the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe it's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the function should handle all string values recursively. That would require a helper function to walk through the dictionary and replace all variables. But that's more involved. 

The problem's docstring mentions "resolve_env=True", so perhaps the function should do that substitution, but only at the top level. Hmm, maybe the user expects that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to use the standard environment variable resolution, so expandvars is the way to go. 

So, putting this together. 

The code structure:

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):

    configs = {}
    errors = []

    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                config_data = f.read()
        except PermissionError as e:
            # create a LogRecord for this error
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord(...))
            continue
        except FileNotFoundError as e:
            errors.append(...)
            continue
        except OSError as e:  # maybe other OS errors?
            errors.append(...)
            continue

        # Now parse the config_data. Let's assume JSON
        try:
            config = json.loads(config_data)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            errors.append(...)
            continue

        # Apply overrides
        if overrides is not None:
            config.update(overrides)

        # Resolve environment variables if needed
        if resolve_env:
            for key, value in config.items():
                if isinstance(value, str):
                    # expand the string
                    config[key] = os.path.expandvars(value)

        # Now add to configs
        configs[filename] = config

    return (configs, errors)

Wait, but how to create the LogRecord objects properly. 

The LogRecord requires several parameters. Let me think: 

The first argument is 'name', which is the name of the logger. Maybe set to 'config_loader' or something. 

Level would be logging.ERROR. 

Pathname is the path of the source file, but here the filename is the config file. So perhaps set that to the filename. 

Linenumber: maybe the line where the error occurred? Not sure, but perhaps set to 1, or leave as 0? 

Msg would be the error message, like "Permission denied when reading config file: {filename}" or "Error parsing config file: {filename}, {e}". 

The exc_info can be the exception instance. 

Wait, but how to get that. 

Alternatively, for each error, we can construct the LogRecord with the necessary parameters. 

Wait, let me look at the parameters again. 

The LogRecord's parameters are:

name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, sinfo=None, created=None.

Hmm, so for the message, perhaps we need to format it. Let's see.

For a permission error, the message might be f"Insufficient permissions to read {filename}". 

The level is logging.ERROR (which is 40). 

pathname could be the filename. 

lineno: maybe 0 or 1, since it's a file read error, not a line in the code. 

msg is the error message. 

args would be the arguments to format the message. 

Wait, perhaps the message is the msg string, and args are the parameters to format it. 

Alternatively, maybe the msg is a format string, and args are the values. 

Wait, the standard way when using logging.error(msg, *args) would format the message with the args. So for the LogRecord, we can set msg as the format string and args as the parameters. 

So, for example, when handling a permission error:

error_msg = "Insufficient permissions to read configuration file: %s"
error_args = (filename,)
record = logging.LogRecord(name='config_loader', level=logging.ERROR, pathname=filename, lineno=0, msg=error_msg, args=error_args, exc_info=e if resolve_env else None)

Wait, but exc_info is supposed to be a tuple (type, value, traceback), or None. So perhaps when catching the exception, we can pass the exception's info. 

Alternatively, in the except blocks, we can capture the exception and then create the record with exc_info = sys.exc_info() ?

Wait, when you're in an except block, you can call sys.exc_info() to get the exception details. 

Wait, but if I'm in the except clause, like except PermissionError as exc, then exc_info can be (type(exc), exc, exc.__traceback__), but perhaps it's better to use the sys module. 

Hmm, but perhaps for the purpose of this function, the exc_info can be None, because the problem's docstring doesn't require including the traceback. Or maybe it should be included. The problem says "error log will be recorded", so maybe the exception info is part of the LogRecord. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem just wants the error messages. 

Well, to create a LogRecord, the parameters must be filled. Let's see:

name: perhaps 'load_configurations' as the logger name.

pathname: the filename causing the error.

lineno: perhaps the line number where the error occurred. For file open errors, maybe it's 0. 

msg: the error message. 

args: the arguments to the message, but perhaps in this case, we can just have the message as a string, so args can be empty or None? 

Wait, maybe the msg is the formatted string, so the args would be used to format it. 

Alternatively, maybe the message can be the full error string. 

This is a bit tricky. Let me think of an example. 

Suppose the filename is 'config.json' and there's a permission error. The error message should be something like "Could not read configuration file 'config.json' due to insufficient permissions." 

So, for the LogRecord, the msg could be the full string, and args would be empty. 

Alternatively, perhaps the msg is a format string like "Could not read %s due to insufficient permissions", and the args would be (filename,). 

But I need to see what the LogRecord expects. 

Alternatively, maybe the msg is the formatted string, so when creating the record, we can format the message first. 

So, for a PermissionError:

message = f"Permission denied when reading {filename}"
record = logging.LogRecord(
    name='config_loader',
    level=logging.ERROR,
    pathname=filename,
    lineno=0,
    msg=message,
    args=None,
    exc_info=None,
)

Wait, but the exc_info might be useful. So perhaps in the except block, when catching the exception, we can pass exc_info as the exception's type, instance, and traceback. 

Wait, the LogRecord's exc_info can be a tuple, or None. 

Alternatively, perhaps the exc_info can be set to (type(exc), exc, exc.__traceback__) if we want to include exception info. 

But maybe the problem just wants the error messages, not the tracebacks. 

The docstring says "recorded. Otherwise, return the results...", so the errors are logged only when the file can't be read or parsed. 

So, in code:

For the file opening:

try:
    with open(filename) as f:
        config_data = f.read()
except (PermissionError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
    # create error record
    msg = f"Error reading {filename}: {str(e)}"
    record = logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None)
    errors.append(record)
    continue

Wait, but how to distinguish between permission errors and other file errors (like not found). The problem says "insufficient permissions or error parsing", so for the error log, the message should indicate which one it is. 

So in the except clause for PermissionError:

except PermissionError as e:
    msg = f"Insufficient permissions to read {filename}"
    record = ... 
    errors.append(record)
    continue

except FileNotFoundError as e:
    msg = f"Configuration file {filename} not found"
    record = ... 
    errors.append(record)
    continue

But perhaps the user wants all file reading errors (like any OSError except PermissionError and FileNotFoundError?) to be considered as well. Wait, the problem says "insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file". So maybe the first part is about permissions (PermissionError), and the second part is parsing errors. So any other OSError (like file not found) is also an error in reading, so we should log that. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem includes all file reading errors (like FileNotFoundError is part of insufficient permissions, but maybe not. So better to split between the two. 

Wait, the problem says "cannot be read due to insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file". So the first part is about permissions (like the file exists but can't be opened due to permissions), and the second is about parsing errors (like file is read but the contents are invalid). 

So, for the first case (IO errors), we can catch PermissionError and log that as the first category. For other file-related errors (like not found, or other OS errors), they would also be logged as read errors, perhaps with a different message. 

Hmm, maybe the first except block should catch PermissionError, and the second block should catch other exceptions derived from OSError (excluding PermissionError?), but perhaps it's easier to have a general except block for IOError or OSError, but then check if it's a permission error or not. 

Alternatively, structure the exceptions as follows:

First, handle PermissionError specifically, then other OSError (like FileNotFoundError is an OSError). 

Wait, FileNotFoundError is a subclass of OSError, so:

try:
    # open the file
except PermissionError as e:
    # log permission error
except OSError as e:
    # log other file read errors, like not found
    msg = f"Error reading {filename}: {str(e)}"
    # but maybe the problem wants to log only the permissions and parsing errors. Wait, the problem says "due to insufficient permissions or error parsing", so the other file errors (like not found) are also part of the first category? Or maybe not. The wording is a bit ambiguous. 

Hmm, perhaps the first part is any error in reading the file (including not existing), but the problem says "insufficient permissions" specifically, so maybe the other cases (like file not found) are also considered as read errors, but the message should indicate the actual error. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants to group all read errors (whether they are permission or file not found) under the first category, and the second part is parsing errors. 

So, in the first try block (opening the file), any exception raised when opening is an error in reading, so we can catch all exceptions derived from OSError. 

Wait, but in Python, the open can raise various exceptions, like PermissionError, which is a subclass of OSError. So perhaps the first except clause can be for PermissionError, and then another except clause for other OSError instances (like FileNotFoundError, which is an OSError). 

Alternatively, maybe just catch OSError in general, but then check the specific error. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first try block is to handle all exceptions related to opening the file, and in the except block, we can check the type. 

Alternatively, let's proceed as follows: 

First, catch PermissionError, then catch other exceptions that are derived from OSError (like FileNotFoundError, or maybe others like IsADirectoryError, etc.), then log accordingly. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just catch any exception related to opening the file, and then check if it's a permission error. 

Wait, maybe:

try:
    with open(filename) as f:
        config_data = f.read()
except OSError as e:
    if e.errno == errno.EACCES or e.errno == errno.EPERM:
        # permission denied
        msg = f"Insufficient permissions to read {filename}"
    else:
        # other error (like file not found)
        msg = f"Error reading {filename}: {e.strerror}"
    record = logging.LogRecord(...)
    errors.append(record)
    continue

But this requires importing errno. Alternatively, perhaps the user just wants to log any OSError, but with a message indicating the error. 

Alternatively, the first part of the docstring says "insufficient permissions or error parsing configuration file", so perhaps the first part (file read error) includes both permission issues and other file read errors (like not found), but the message needs to be specific. 

Hmm, but how to know whether it's a permission error or another error? 

Well, the exception's errno can tell us. For example, on Unix-like systems, EACCES is 13 (permission denied), ENOENT is 2 (file not found). 

So maybe in the except block for OSError, check the errno. 

But to do that, I need to import errno. 

Alternatively, perhaps just use the exception type. But PermissionError is a separate exception in Python 3. 

So, in code:

try:
    with open(filename) as f:
        config_data = f.read()
except PermissionError as e:
    msg = f"Insufficient permissions to read configuration file: {filename}"
    record = logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None)
    errors.append(record)
    continue
except OSError as e:
    msg = f"Error reading configuration file {filename}: {str(e)}"
    record = logging.LogRecord(...)
    errors.append(record)
    continue

Wait, but maybe the user wants to log all file read errors (including not found) as part of the first category, but the message can include the specific error. 

Okay, moving forward. 

Once the file is read, then parse it. Let's assume JSON parsing. 

So after reading config_data, we try to parse it into a dictionary. 

try:
    config = json.loads(config_data)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    msg = f"Error parsing configuration file {filename}: {str(e)}"
    record = logging.LogRecord(...)
    errors.append(record)
    continue

But what if the config is in another format, like YAML? The problem's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is designed to work with JSON files. 

Alternatively, maybe the function uses a generic config parser, but since the problem doesn't specify, I have to make an assumption. Let's proceed with JSON, since that's a common case and the standard library has json. 

So, the code so far is:

import json
import logging
import os

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    configs = {}
    errors = []
    
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                config_data = f.read()
        except PermissionError as e:
            msg = f"Insufficient permissions to read {filename}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        except OSError as e:
            msg = f"Error reading configuration file {filename}: {str(e)}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        
        try:
            config = json.loads(config_data)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            msg = f"Error parsing configuration file {filename}: {str(e)}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        
        if overrides:
            config.update(overrides)
        
        if resolve_env:
            # Need to substitute env vars in the config's string values
            for key, value in config.items():
                if isinstance(value, str):
                    config[key] = os.path.expandvars(value)
        
        configs[filename] = config
    
    return (configs, errors)

Wait, but the overrides are a dict. So when applying them, it's config.update(overrides), but what if the overrides have nested keys? Probably not, since the problem says "overrides" as a parameter, so it's likely that it's a flat dictionary. 

Also, for resolve_env, using os.path.expandvars on each string value. 

But expandvars expects variables in the form $VAR or ${VAR}, and replaces them with the environment variable's value. So that's correct. 

Wait, but what about if a value is a list or another structure? The problem's docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps the function only substitutes in strings. 

So the code is okay. 

Wait, but the function should return a tuple of (dict, list). The first part is the dictionary mapping each filename to its config (if successfully loaded). 

Now, what about the LogRecord's parameters? Let me check again:

The LogRecord's arguments are:

name (str) – The name of the logger used to log the event.

level (int) – The severity level for the event (e.g., logging.INFO, logging.ERROR, etc.)

pathname (str) – The filename where the logged event occurred.

lineno (int) – The line number in the file where the event was generated.

msg (str) – The event description message.

args (tuple) – The arguments to the msg. 

exc_info (Exception) – An exception instance or a traceback, or None.

Wait, but in the code above, I'm setting exc_info to None, but perhaps it's better to include the exception's info. 

Wait, the problem says "recorded" but doesn't specify including the exception. So maybe it's okay to not include it. 

Alternatively, maybe the exc_info should be passed as the exception instance. 

Hmm, but the LogRecord's exc_info is supposed to be a tuple (type, value, traceback). 

In the except block, the current exception can be obtained via sys.exc_info(), but if you're in the except clause, you can capture it. 

Wait, in the case of PermissionError, the e is the exception. So perhaps exc_info can be (type(e), e, e.__traceback__) ?

Alternatively, just pass None, since maybe the problem doesn't require that. 

The problem's docstring says "record the error log", so perhaps just the message is sufficient. 

So the code as written is okay. 

Wait, but the problem says "the error log will be recorded". So maybe each error message is captured as a LogRecord. 

Another thing: the function is supposed to "validate each configuration file". What does validation mean here? The docstring doesn't specify further validation steps beyond parsing. So perhaps validation here just means that the parsing is successful. 

Alternatively, maybe there's some other validation, but since it's not specified, the code can proceed with just parsing. 

So that's covered by the JSON parsing. 

Now, the overrides are applied after parsing, so they can override any keys in the config. 

Then, resolve_env: substitute environment variables in the config's string values. 

Wait, but maybe the config is a nested structure, and we need to resolve variables in all strings. 

The current code only does it for top-level keys. So if the config has a nested dictionary, like {"database": {"host": "localhost"}}, then the host value won't be substituted. 

But the problem says "resolve_env=True", so maybe the function is supposed to do a recursive substitution. 

Hmm, the problem's docstring doesn't specify that, so perhaps it's okay to just do top-level. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to handle all strings in the config, even in nested structures. 

To do that, I need a helper function to walk through the config and replace all strings. 

Let me think of that. 

A helper function like this:

def resolve_env_vars(config):
    if isinstance(config, dict):
        for k, v in config.items():
            if isinstance(v, str):
                config[k] = os.path.expandvars(v)
            elif isinstance(v, dict) or isinstance(v, list):
                resolve_env_vars(v)
    elif isinstance(config, list):
        for i, item in enumerate(config):
            if isinstance(item, str):
                config[i] = os.path.expandvars(item)
            elif isinstance(item, dict) or isinstance(item, list):
                resolve_env_vars(item)
    return config

Wait, but modifying the list in place might be better. 

Alternatively, this function would recursively process the config. 

But in the current code, the config is a dict, so applying this function would be necessary. 

However, adding such a helper function would make the code more complex, but perhaps required. 

Wait, the problem's docstring says "resolve_env=True" so maybe the function is supposed to expand environment variables in the config's values. 

The current code only does that for top-level strings. So the helper function is needed. 

Hmm, but maybe the user expects that. Let's see. 

The problem says "if resolve_env is True, substitute environment variables in the configuration". 

So, to do that properly, the code should traverse the entire config structure and substitute variables in any string, not just top-level. 

Therefore, I need to implement a recursive function. 

Let me adjust the code. 

So in the resolve_env block, instead of looping through top-level keys, we call a function that recursively walks the config and replaces variables. 

So, adding a helper function inside the load_configurations function, or outside? 

Probably inside, as a nested function. 

Let me try:

def load_configurations(...):

    ...

    if resolve_env:

        def expand_vars(obj):
            if isinstance(obj, dict):
                for k, v in obj.items():
                    if isinstance(v, str):
                        obj[k] = os.path.expandvars(v)
                    else:
                        expand_vars(v)
            elif isinstance(obj, list):
                for i, item in enumerate(obj):
                    if isinstance(item, str):
                        obj[i] = os.path.expandvars(item)
                    else:
                        expand_vars(item)
            return obj

        config = expand_vars(config)

    configs[filename] = config

Wait, but modifying the original config's structure in place. Because for dictionaries and lists, the function would modify their contents. 

Alternatively, perhaps we should create a deep copy and process that, to avoid modifying the original data. But the problem doesn't mention that, so maybe it's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the expand_vars function should return a new object. 

Hmm, perhaps better to make it a deep copy. 

Alternatively, perhaps using a recursive approach that creates new structures. 

Wait, here's a better way. 

def resolve_env_vars(config):
    if isinstance(config, str):
        return os.path.expandvars(config)
    elif isinstance(config, dict):
        return {k: resolve_env_vars(v) for k, v in config.items()}
    elif isinstance(config, list):
        return [resolve_env_vars(item) for item in config]
    else:
        return config

Then, in the code:

if resolve_env:
    config = resolve_env_vars(config)

But this creates a new config, which is okay. 

Wait, but in this case, the original config is modified? Or replaced with a new one. 

Yes, this approach would create a new config structure. 

So, the function would need to use this helper. 

Therefore, the code would have to include this helper function. 

Hmm, but that's a bit more involved. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that resolve_env just substitutes variables in the top-level strings. 

Well, the problem's description is a bit ambiguous. But given that the parameter is called resolve_env, and that's a common requirement, perhaps the helper function is needed. 

So, let me adjust the code to include that. 

So the code would look like this:

import json
import logging
import os

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    configs = {}
    errors = []
    
    def resolve_environment_variables(data):
        if isinstance(data, str):
            return os.path.expandvars(data)
        elif isinstance(data, dict):
            return {k: resolve_environment_variables(v) for k, v in data.items()}
        elif isinstance(data, list):
            return [resolve_environment_variables(item) for item in data]
        else:
            return data
    
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                config_data = f.read()
        except PermissionError as e:
            msg = f"Insufficient permissions to read configuration file: {filename}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        except OSError as e:
            msg = f"Error reading configuration file {filename}: {e.strerror}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        
        try:
            config = json.loads(config_data)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            msg = f"Error parsing configuration file {filename}: {e}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        
        if overrides is not None:
            config.update(overrides)
        
        if resolve_env:
            config = resolve_environment_variables(config)
        
        configs[filename] = config
    
    return (configs, errors)

Wait, but the resolve_environment_variables function is defined inside the load_configurations function. That's okay. 

Now, the function returns a tuple with the configs and errors. 

Testing this code, if a file is read and parsed, overrides are applied, and environment variables are substituted if resolve_env is True. 

Wait, but in the case of applying overrides after resolving env variables, or before? 

The problem says "overrides" are applied, but the order might matter. 

Suppose the config has a variable that's supposed to be overridden. For instance, the config has a value that uses an environment variable, and the override is to set that value to something else. 

The code applies overrides first, then resolves env variables. 

Wait, no. Let's see:

After parsing, the config is a dict from the JSON. 

Then, if there are overrides, we do config.update(overrides). 

Then, if resolve_env is True, we process the config (including any overrides) to expand variables. 

Wait, that's not right. Because if the overrides have values with environment variables, then those would also be substituted. 

But the problem says "resolve environment variables in the configuration", so perhaps that's intended. 

Alternatively, maybe the overrides should be applied after resolving env variables. 

Hmm, the order depends on the requirements. The problem's description doesn't specify, so perhaps the current order is okay, but maybe the user expects that the overrides can also include environment variables. 

Alternatively, the overrides are applied first, then variables are resolved. 

Alternatively, maybe the overrides should be applied after resolving. 

Hmm, the problem says "overrides" are optional, so the order might need to be considered. 

Suppose the config has a variable like "host": "${DB_HOST}". The user wants to override that with "host": "localhost" via overrides. 

If we apply overrides first, then the "host" would be set to "localhost", and then resolve_env would not affect it. 

Alternatively, if the overrides are applied after resolving, then the user could override the resolved value. 

But the problem says "overrides" so it's likely that the overrides are applied after parsing, so they can override any existing values, including those with environment variables. 

Therefore, the current code's order is correct: parse, then apply overrides, then resolve env variables. Wait, no. Wait, in the code above, after applying overrides, the config is passed to resolve_environment_variables. 

Wait, in that case, the overrides could have variables that need to be resolved. 

Suppose the config has a value "host": "db_${ENV}". The user doesn't provide overrides, but when resolve_env is True, the function would substitute the environment variable. 

If the user provides an override like "host": "override_${VAR}", then the override's value would also have the variables substituted. 

That might be the desired behavior. 

Alternatively, maybe the overrides should be applied after resolving. But since the overrides can themselves contain variables, perhaps it's better to resolve them as well. 

Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify that. Maybe it's acceptable. 

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides are not part of the environment variables. But the problem says "resolve_env=True" so that the configuration's values are processed. 

Therefore, the code's order is okay. 

Another thing: the function should return the parsed configuration, even after overrides and environment variables are applied. 

Now, let's think about possible exceptions in the environment variable substitution. For example, if a variable like ${VAR} is not set, then expandvars would leave it as is, but that's not an error. Because the function's docstring mentions "parse errors" (like invalid JSON) and not environment variables. 

So in that case, no error is logged for unresolved variables, just substituted as best as possible. 

Okay, that's acceptable. 

Now, what about the LogRecord parameters? The pathname should be the filename, and the lineno could be set to 0. 

Also, the msg is the formatted error message, and the args can be None because the message is already formatted. 

Wait, in the LogRecord, the msg can be a format string, and args are the parameters to plug into it. 

Alternatively, if I format the message first, then the args can be None. 

Like in the first error case:

msg = f"Insufficient permissions to read configuration file: {filename}"
record = logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None)

Yes, that's better. 

Another possible error is if the config file is not in JSON format. But the problem says "error parsing configuration file", so perhaps the function is only handling JSON. 

Alternatively, maybe the function should support other formats, but without more info, we have to assume JSON. 

So the code uses json. 

Now, what about the case where the config is loaded successfully? Then it's added to the configs dict. 

Now, testing for the overrides: 

If overrides is None, then no update is done. 

The code checks if overrides is not None, then does config.update(overrides). 

But in Python, if overrides is a dictionary, even if it's empty, the check would pass. 

Wait, the parameter says overrides=None, so if the user passes an empty dict, that's valid and should apply the empty overrides (so no change). 

Therefore, the code's if overrides is not None is okay. 

Now, the function should return a tuple (configs, errors). 

Wait, in the code, after processing all files, return (configs, errors). 

But in Python, the order is important. The first element is the dict, the second is the list. 

Yes. 

Now, possible edge cases: 

- A config file that exists but is unreadable (like a directory). 

But that's already covered by OSError. 

- A config file that's read but has invalid JSON. 

That's caught by the second try-except block. 

- Overrides is a non-dictionary type? Like if someone passes a list. But the function's parameter says overrides is a dict, so that's a problem. But the function should probably just proceed as if overrides is not present. 

Wait, the function's signature says overrides is a sequence? No, the first line says "Given a sequence of configuration filenames", so the first parameter is a sequence (like list) of filenames. The overrides parameter is "None" or presumably a dictionary. 

So the code should expect that overrides is a dict. 

Another thing: the function's parameters mention "overrides" as a parameter, but in the code, it's passed as a dict, so the code is okay. 

Now, the code uses json, but what if the config files are in a different format? Like YAML? 

The problem's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the function is intended to use JSON. 

Alternatively, maybe the function should use a generic parser, but without knowing the format, it's hard. 

Well, given the problem's description, I think using JSON is acceptable. 

Now, the code may need to import the required modules. 

At the top, we need to import json, logging, and os. 

Wait, the code already has those imports. 

Wait, the user's code must not have any markdown formatting. So the code must be written with the necessary imports. 

Wait, the function's code must include the imports? 

Yes, because the code has to be self-contained. 

Wait, in the problem's instructions, the user says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." 

Wait, the output should be in Python code, but formatted as markdown. Like putting it in a code block. 

Wait, the user wants the code in Python markdown format, which probably means putting it inside triple backticks. 

Wait, the user's example shows the thinking in a code block. So the final answer should be the code wrapped in ```python ... ``` 

But the code must include the necessary imports. 

Wait, the function uses json, so the code must have import json. 

Same for os and logging. 

Therefore, the code should start with those imports. 

Now, let me check the code again. 

Wait, the resolve_environment_variables function is inside the load_configurations function, so that's okay. 

Now, the LogRecord's parameters: the name is 'config_loader' as the logger's name. 

The pathname is the filename (the path to the config file), and the lineno is 0. 

The message is the formatted string. 

The exc_info is set to None. 

That's acceptable. 

Another point: the problem says "sequence of configuration filenames", so the input can be a list, tuple, etc. 

The code loops over each in config_filenames, which is correct. 

Now, the function returns the configs as a dictionary of filename to config. 

Wait, but in the code, the filename is a key, so even if multiple files are processed, each one's config is stored. 

So if a file is successfully loaded, its config is added. 

Now, possible errors when expanding environment variables? Like if the variable is not found. 

But according to the problem's docstring, that's not considered an error to log. The error is only when the file can't be read or parsed. 

So unresolved variables are okay, and they just remain as is. 

So the code is okay. 

Wait, but in the resolve_environment_variables function, when we call os.path.expandvars, if the variable is not set, it leaves it as is. 

So that's correct. 

Therefore, the code should be as above. 

Wait, but let me see if the code is correct. 

Wait, the first try block is opening the file. 

The second try block parses the JSON. 

Then, applying overrides, then resolve_env. 

Wait, but in the code, the order is: parse, apply overrides, then resolve env. 

Wait, suppose the config has a value that uses an environment variable, and the override replaces it with a different value that also uses an environment variable. 

Then, when resolve_env is True, both would be substituted. 

Alternatively, if the user wants to override the resolved value, then the order would be resolve first, then override. 

Hmm, that's a possible issue. 

Suppose the original config has "host": "db_${ENV}". The user's override is "host": "override_${VAR}". 

If we first apply overrides, then the host becomes "override_${VAR}", then resolve_env substitutes VAR if possible. 

Alternatively, if the user wants to first resolve the original config's variables, then apply the override's variables. 

Wait, but the problem says "resolve environment variables in the configuration", so the configuration includes the overrides. 

Hmm, perhaps the order is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the overrides should be applied after resolving. 

But the problem's description doesn't specify, so perhaps the current code is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the overrides to be applied after resolving, so that the overrides can have their own variables. 

In that case, the code should process the config with resolve_env first, then apply overrides (which may also have variables that need to be resolved). 

Wait, but in that case, the overrides would also need to be resolved. 

Wait, the problem's description says "resolve_env=True" which may only apply to the configuration files, not the overrides. 

Hmm, that's a possible ambiguity. 

The function's parameters are overrides=None, so the overrides are probably a dictionary of values to set, which may or may not contain env vars. 

But the problem's description says "resolve environment variables in the configuration", so perhaps the configuration (the file's data) is processed, but the overrides are not. 

Therefore, the current code's order is okay. 

Now, I think the code is correct. 

Wait, but in the code for the LogRecord, when catching OSError, I used e.strerror. 

Wait, in the case of a FileNotFoundError, e.strerror would give the system error message, like "No such file or directory". 

But in the first except block (PermissionError), we have e.errno == EACCES, but the message is just formatted with the filename. 

Alternatively, for the PermissionError, the message could include e.strerror as well. 

Like msg = f"Insufficient permissions to read {filename}: {e.strerror}". 

Hmm, but maybe that's redundant. The first part already states insufficient permissions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the first part's message is sufficient. 

Alternatively, to be consistent, maybe all messages include the error message. 

Well, the problem's docstring mentions "insufficient permissions or error parsing", so the message should at least indicate the type. 

The code as written does that. 

Okay, I think that's the code. Let me write it out properly. 

Wait, the code must be in Python markdown format. So enclosed in triple backticks. 

Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be in a code block with ```python ... ``` 

So the final answer would be:

```python
import json
import logging
import os

def load_configurations(config_filenames, overrides=None, resolve_env=True):
    configs = {}
    errors = []
    
    def resolve_environment_variables(data):
        if isinstance(data, str):
            return os.path.expandvars(data)
        elif isinstance(data, dict):
            return {k: resolve_environment_variables(v) for k, v in data.items()}
        elif isinstance(data, list):
            return [resolve_environment_variables(item) for item in data]
        else:
            return data
    
    for filename in config_filenames:
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                config_data = f.read()
        except PermissionError as e:
            msg = f"Insufficient permissions to read configuration file: {filename}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        except OSError as e:
            msg = f"Error reading configuration file {filename}: {e.strerror}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        
        try:
            config = json.loads(config_data)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            msg = f"Error parsing configuration file {filename}: {str(e)}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        
        if overrides is not None:
            config.update(overrides)
        
        if resolve_env:
            config = resolve_environment_variables(config)
        
        configs[filename] = config
    
    return (configs, errors)
```

Wait, but in the LogRecord for parsing errors, the message uses str(e). Because e is the JSONDecodeError instance. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Also, in the OSError except block, using e.strerror is better, as it gives the system error message. 

Another thing: in the case of a JSONDecodeError, the error message would include the specific error (like "Expecting value: line 3 column 5 (char 6)"). 

Yes, so that's good. 

Now, I think this code meets the requirements. 

Wait, but the function is supposed to validate each configuration file. What if the parsed JSON is not a dictionary? Like if it's a list. 

The problem's docstring says "return the results as a tuple of: dict of configuration filename to corresponding parsed configuration". So the parsed configuration must be a dictionary. 

If the JSON is parsed into a list, then that would be an error. But the current code does not check that. 

Hmm, that's a problem. 

Because the function's return requires that the config is a dictionary. 

Wait, the problem says "parsed configuration", which could be any data structure, but the first element of the tuple is a dict mapping filenames to the parsed configs. So the parsed config can be any structure, but the function's return requires that the config is stored as the value. 

But the function's docstring mentions "validate each configuration file". So perhaps validation includes that the parsed data is a dictionary. 

Ah, right! The problem says "load and validate each configuration file". So the validation step is required. 

So, the code above only parses the JSON, but doesn't check if it's a dictionary. 

So, for example, if the JSON is a list, then the validation would fail, and that's an error. 

So, in the code, after parsing the JSON, we need to check if it's a dictionary. 

Therefore, adding:

if not isinstance(config, dict):
    msg = f"Parsed configuration for {filename} is not a dictionary"
    errors.append(...)
    continue

Hmm, that's another validation step. 

The problem's docstring says "validate each configuration file". So perhaps the function is supposed to ensure that the configuration is a valid structure (like a dict). 

Therefore, the code should include that check. 

So modifying the code:

after the config = json.loads(config_data) line, check if it's a dict. 

Like:

        try:
            config = json.loads(config_data)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            ... 
        else:
            if not isinstance(config, dict):
                msg = f"Configuration file {filename} must be a dictionary, got {type(config)}"
                errors.append(logging.LogRecord(...))
                continue

Wait, but the try/except block only catches JSONDecodeError. The else clause runs if the parsing was successful. 

So after parsing, we need to check if config is a dict. 

Yes. 

So adding that code. 

Let me adjust the code accordingly. 

Inside the else block (after parsing successfully):

        else:
            if not isinstance(config, dict):
                msg = f"Parsed configuration for {filename} is not a dictionary"
                errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
                continue
            # proceed with overrides and resolve env

Wait, no. The try block is around the parsing, so the else is for when there was no exception. But then we still need to check the type. 

So:

        try:
            config = json.loads(config_data)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            msg = f"Error parsing configuration file {filename}: {str(e)}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        else:
            if not isinstance(config, dict):
                msg = f"Configuration file {filename} must be a dictionary, got {type(config)}"
                errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
                continue

            # proceed with overrides and resolve_env

Ah right, that's important. 

So the code must add this check. 

Therefore, adding that part. 

So now, the code will also check that the parsed data is a dict, otherwise it's an error. 

Another possible validation: maybe the config must have certain keys, but the problem's docstring doesn't specify any further validation beyond parsing and being a dict. 

Thus, this is the necessary validation. 

So, that's an addition needed in the code. 

Let me update the code:

In the parsing try block:

        try:
            config = json.loads(config_data)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            msg = f"Error parsing configuration file {filename}: {str(e)}"
            errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
            continue
        else:
            if not isinstance(config, dict):
                msg = f"Parsed configuration for {filename} is not a dictionary"
                errors.append(logging.LogRecord('config_loader', logging.ERROR, filename, 0, msg, None, None))
                continue

            # proceed with overrides and resolve_env

So the code now includes that check. 

This is a crucial part because the problem mentions validation. 

Okay, now the code is better. 

Another thing: the overrides could be a non-dictionary, but the function's parameters say overrides is a sequence? No, the function's signature says overrides is a dict (since it's a parameter with default None and used in config.update(overrides)). 

Wait, the parameter's name is overrides, and in the code, we do config.update(overrides). So overrides must be a dictionary. 

Therefore, the code is okay. 

Now, let me check the code again. 

Wait, in the resolve_environment_variables function, when it returns a new dict or list, but the original config is modified. 

Wait, in the code, after the function returns the resolved data, we do config = resolve_environment_variables(config). 

Wait, in the helper function, it returns a new structure. 

Wait, let's see:

The helper function is called when resolve_env is True. 

Suppose the config is a dictionary. 

The function returns a new dict with each value processed recursively. 

Therefore, the original config is replaced with the new one. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Therefore, the code should work. 

Another possible edge case: if a config file is empty, then json.loads would throw an error. 

But that's already handled by the JSONDecodeError. 

Okay. 

Now, the code seems to handle all the cases mentioned in the docstring. 

So that's the code I'll write.
