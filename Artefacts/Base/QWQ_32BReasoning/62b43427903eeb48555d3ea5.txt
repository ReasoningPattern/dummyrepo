Okay, I need to generate Python code for the given function signature and docstring. The function is called 'format', part of a class, and it takes 'sql' and 'params' as arguments. The goal is to convert the SQL using self._converter.convert. 

First, I should recall what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says to convert the sql using the converter's convert method. So the main task here is to process the sql string through that method. But I also have to consider the parameters. The function returns a tuple of the formatted sql and the params, possibly modified?

Wait, the parameters can be a sequence or a dictionary. The converter might need to handle both types of param styles, like question marks or named parameters. So maybe the _converter.convert method takes the sql and the params and returns the converted sql along with the adjusted parameters?

Hmm, the function's return type is Tuple[AnyStr, the same type as params]. So I need to call self._converter.convert, passing sql and params, and return whatever it returns. But I have to make sure that the code is correctly structured. 

Wait, maybe the converter's convert method is responsible for both formatting the SQL and adjusting the parameters if necessary. So in the format method, the code would just be something like:

return self._converter.convert(sql, params)

But that's probably too simple. Let me check the parameters again. The function's parameters are 'sql' of type AnyStr (so either str or bytes) and 'params' which can be a dict or a sequence. The return is the same types. 

Alternatively, maybe the converter's method requires the sql and the params, and returns the new sql and the new params. So the format function just passes them along and returns the result. 

Yes, the docstring is brief, so the code might indeed be straightforward. Since the function is part of a class, the method would have 'self' as the first parameter. 

Wait, but maybe there's some setup needed. Like, the converter must be an instance variable of the class. So as long as self._converter exists and has a convert method, this should work. 

The user didn't mention any other steps, so I think the code is just returning the result of calling self._converter.convert with sql and params. 

So the code would look like this:

def format(self, sql: AnyStr, params: Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]) -> Tuple[AnyStr, Union[Dict[Union[str, int], Any], Sequence[Any]]]:
    """
    Convert sql using self._converter.convert
    """
    return self._converter.convert(sql, params)

Wait, but maybe the function is supposed to do some formatting on its own? The name is 'format', but the docstring says to use the converter. So I think that's all. The code just delegates to the converter's method. 

I should make sure that the parameters are passed correctly. The 'params' can be a dictionary or a sequence, which the converter's method should handle. The return types must match, so the converter's method must return a tuple of the same types. 

Yes, this seems right. So the generated code is as above. I'll just write that. No other steps needed since the problem states to only use the docstring and signature. I think that's all.
