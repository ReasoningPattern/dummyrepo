Okay, I need to write a Python function called split that takes a string and a platform parameter. The platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. The docstring says that if platform is 'this', it should auto-detect the current platform. Then, based on the platform, split the string using either POSIX or Windows/CMD style.

Hmm, first I should figure out how splitting works on each platform. Let me remember. On POSIX systems, like Linux or macOS, the split is done using whitespace characters, but backslashes can be used to escape the whitespace. So if a line ends with a backslash, the next part is considered part of the same token. Wait, actually, in POSIX shells, when splitting arguments, consecutive whitespace might be treated as a single delimiter. But the exact rules?

For Windows/CMD, I think the splitting is different. In CMD, the default tokenization uses spaces as delimiters, but you can use quotes to include spaces in arguments. Also, caret (^) is used as an escape character. So if a line ends with a caret, the next line's characters are considered part of the same argument. But maybe the function here is to split the string according to those rules.

Wait, the function's parameters are a bit confusing. The platform is given as a string 'this', or the integers 0 or 1. So first, I need to determine the platform. Let me see: when platform is 'this', we have to check the current system. So perhaps using sys.platform? Like, if sys.platform starts with 'win', then it's Windows, else it's POSIX. So then, when platform is 'this', auto-detect by checking sys.platform.

Then, depending on the platform (POSIX or Windows), split the string accordingly. Let me think about how to implement the splitting for each case.

For the Windows/CMD style splitting: The rules are a bit more involved. The standard way in CMD is that arguments are split by spaces, but quotes can group spaces. Also, the caret (^) is used to escape some characters, but perhaps in this context, escaping the space? Or maybe the caret is used to escape the quote? Or perhaps the split is done by spaces, but if there's a quote, then the spaces inside quotes are kept as part of the token, and the quotes themselves are stripped. Also, the caret might be used to escape the quote so that it's part of the token. Alternatively, maybe in CMD, the escape is done with caret, so when a line ends with a caret, it's a way to continue to the next line. Wait, but the function's input is a single string s, so maybe the caret is used to escape a space, allowing it to be part of an argument.

Alternatively, perhaps the Windows splitting is similar to how shlex works with quotes. For example, in Windows, the splitting is done by spaces but arguments can be enclosed in quotes to include spaces. The caret might be used to escape the quote. Wait, but maybe the standard way is to use quotes to group arguments and then handle escapes. Let me think of an example. Suppose the string is "a b c" then it would split into ['a', 'b', 'c']. If it's "a" "b" "c" then the same. But if there's quotes like "a b c" then it becomes one element. Also, if the quotes are escaped, like ^"a b^ c" then maybe the quotes are kept. Hmm, maybe it's better to use the shlex module in Python for parsing, but with different options based on the platform.

Wait, the shlex module can handle splitting strings according to shell-like rules. Let me recall the parameters. The shlex.split function uses POSIX rules by default, but if you set posix=False, it uses the Windows rules. So for example, in Windows style, quotes can be used to group, and the escape character is caret. But in that case, maybe we can use shlex.split with the appropriate posix setting.

Wait, let's check. For POSIX style, shlex.split(s) would split on whitespace, but backslash can escape the next character, including a newline. So if the string has a backslash followed by a space, like 'a\ b c', it would split into ['a b', 'c']? Not sure. Wait, actually, in POSIX, backslash escaping allows you to include spaces within a token. So 'a\ b c' would split into 'a b' and 'c'. Also, if a line ends with a backslash, then the next line's contents are part of the same token.

For Windows style, when using shlex.split with posix=False, the escape character is caret (^), and quotes are used to group. So "a b c" would be split into ["a b c"], but with spaces outside of quotes, it would split on them. Also, escaped quotes inside the string would be treated as part of the token. 

So maybe the function can use shlex.split with the appropriate parameters, depending on the platform. Let me see.

The problem is the parameters for the split function. The platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So when platform is 1, use POSIX style. When 0, use Windows style. When 'this', auto-detect.

So, the plan is:

1. Determine which platform to use. If platform is 'this', check the current OS. Use sys.platform to do that. For example, if sys.platform starts with 'win', then set the platform to 0 (Windows), else 1 (POSIX).

Wait, but the function's parameters are a bit different. The platform argument is given as a string 'this', or the integers 0 or 1. So, in code, first handle the platform parameter:

if platform == 'this':
    current_platform = sys.platform
    if current_platform.startswith('win'):
        platform = 0
    else:
        platform = 1
else:
    # platform is 0 or 1, so just use as is

Then, based on the platform (now 0 or 1), choose whether to use POSIX or Windows splitting via shlex.

Wait, but the function's parameters are s and platform. So the code would be:

import shlex
import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            platform = 0
        else:
            platform = 1
    # Now platform is 0 or 1
    if platform == 1:  # POSIX
        return shlex.split(s, posix=True)
    else:  # Windows
        return shlex.split(s, posix=False)

Wait, but does that handle all the cases? Let me think of some test cases.

Suppose on Windows, and platform is 'this', then it would use posix=False. So for a string like 'a\ b c', shlex.split with posix=False would split into ['a\ b', 'c']? Wait no, because in Windows style, the backslash is not the escape character. The escape character is caret. So in Windows style, if you have 'a\ b c', that's treated as two arguments: 'a\ b' and 'c'? Because the backslash is just a regular character. Whereas in POSIX style, the backslash would escape the space, so that becomes part of the same token. 

Another example: on Windows, using quotes. Like 'a "b c" d' would split into ['a', 'b c', 'd'] when using posix=False. 

But what about escaping quotes in Windows? For instance, 'a ^"b c^" d' would split into ['a', '"b c"', 'd']? Because the caret escapes the quote, so the quotes are part of the token. Hmm, not sure. Need to check how shlex.split with posix=False works. 

Alternatively, maybe the caret is used to escape a space? I'm not entirely sure. But perhaps relying on shlex is the right approach here, since it's built-in and handles these cases.

Wait, the problem states that for platform 0 (Windows/CMD), the splitting should use Windows/CMD style. So using shlex with posix=False would do that. Because shlex's windows style uses spaces as delimiters, but with quotes to group and caret as escape. 

So the code would look like that. But the function's name is split, which might conflict with the built-in string split, but since it's part of the problem's requirement, that's okay.

Wait, but the function's parameters are s and platform. So the code should work as follows:

Wait, the user wants to return a list of splitting strings according to the platform's rules. So using shlex.split is probably the correct approach here.

But I need to make sure that when platform is 0, we set posix=False, and when it's 1, posix=True. So the code above would do that.

Wait, but what about the case when the platform is 'this', but the user is on a non-Windows system? Then it uses POSIX. 

Yes. So the code should first check platform, set it to 0 or 1 if needed, then call shlex.split with the appropriate posix flag.

Wait, but what about the default behavior of shlex.split? Let me confirm:

In shlex.split, the default is posix=True. So when using posix=False, it uses the Windows style. So that's exactly what we need here.

Therefore, the code is as above. But I need to make sure that the platform is converted correctly. 

Wait, the code for the function: when the platform is given as 'this', we check the current platform. But maybe there are other platforms besides Windows and others. But in most cases, that's sufficient. So the code should first check if platform is 'this' and then set to 0 or 1 accordingly. 

So putting that into code:

First, import shlex and sys.

Wait, but the function might be in a module where sys is not imported. So need to include the imports inside the function? Or at the top? The user probably expects the code to have the necessary imports at the top.

So the code would start with:

import shlex
import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    ...
    return shlex.split(s, posix= (platform == 1))

Wait, but the code needs to handle the platform parameter correctly. Let me structure the code step by step.

The first step is to handle the platform parameter. So, the code:

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            platform = 0
        else:
            platform = 1
    # Now platform is 0 or 1
    posix = (platform == 1)
    return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

That should work. 

Wait, but the platform argument can be 0 or 1. So when the user passes platform=0, it uses Windows style (posix=False). 

Yes. Let me test some scenarios:

Case 1: platform is 'this' and the current system is Windows. Then platform becomes 0, so posix=False.

Case 2: platform is 'this' and the system is Linux, so platform becomes 1, using POSIX.

Case 3: platform is 0, so Windows style.

Case 4: platform is 1, so POSIX.

What about if the user passes a different value for platform? Like, platform=2? But according to the problem statement, the platform is only 'this', 0, or 1. So perhaps we can add a check for invalid inputs, but the problem doesn't mention handling errors. So maybe just proceed as per the given parameters.

Wait, the problem says the platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So if it's anything else, maybe the function should raise an error. But the docstring doesn't specify that. So perhaps the code can just proceed, but in the problem's context, we can assume that platform is only one of those three options. So the code is okay.

Wait, but the function's parameters have platform as a default of 'this', so if someone passes, say, 2, then the code would set platform to 2, then in the next lines, when checking platform ==1 or 0, which would not be the case, so the code would return shlex.split(s, posix= (2 ==1)), which is False, so posix=False. But that's not correct. So perhaps the code should have an assertion or check for valid platform values.

The problem's docstring says that platform can be 'this', 1, or 0. So if it's something else, maybe the function should raise an error. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the code can just proceed, but according to the instructions, we should only generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So if the user passes an invalid platform (like 2), the function's behavior is undefined. But the problem's description only mentions 0,1, or 'this', so maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should handle that by raising an exception. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention it, so maybe it's better to just proceed as per the parameters. Let's see the problem's docstring again: the platform is either 'this', 1, or 0. So maybe the code can just assume that platform is one of those three. But in the code above, if platform is not 'this', it could be 0 or 1. So the code is okay.

Wait, but in the code above, after the 'this' check, the code sets platform to 0 or 1. So even if the user passes a string like '1', but the parameter is an integer. Wait, the function signature says platform is a string 'this' or the integers 0 or 1. Wait, looking at the function signature:

def split(s, platform='this'):

Wait, the platform's default is 'this', which is a string. But the parameters can also be 0 or 1 as integers. So the code must accept platform being either a string or an integer? Wait, no, the function's parameters specify that platform is given as a string 'this', or the integers 0 or 1. So the user can pass platform as a string, but according to the docstring, platform is either 'this', or 0 or 1 (as integers). Wait, the docstring says:

Args:
    s: input str
    platform: 'this' = auto from current platform; 1 = POSIX; 0 = Windows/CMD

Wait, so the platform is a string 'this', or the integer 0 or 1. So when the user passes platform='1', that's invalid. But the function signature lists platform as a string. Wait, the function signature says platform is a string, but the docstring says that platform can also be 0 or 1 (integers). Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the function signature again.

The user's function signature is written as:

def split(s, platform='this'):

So the default is 'this', which is a string. But the parameters can be passed as integers 0 or 1. Because the docstring says "If platform equals 1, use POSIX..." etc. So the function's platform argument is of type str or int? Because the default is a string, but the user can pass 0 or 1 as integers. So in Python, the parameters can be of any type, but the code must handle that.

Wait, in the code, if someone passes platform as a string like '0', then the code would not work. Because in the first if statement, platform == 'this' is checked. If it's '0', then that would be false, and then platform is set to 0 (integer?), but then comparing platform (as a string) to 0 (integer) would be False. Wait, but the code has:

if platform == 'this':

then, if it is, it sets platform to 0 or 1 (integer). But if the user passed, say, platform as a string like '0', then the code would proceed to the else part, but since the original platform is a string, the code would check if platform is 0 (integer) or 1 (integer). Which would be false, so then the code would have to proceed to the return statement where it checks platform ==1. So in that case, if the user passes platform='0' as a string, it would not be handled correctly. 

Wait, this is a problem. The function's platform parameter is supposed to accept 'this' (as a string) and 0 or 1 as integers. So the code must check that. Wait, the function's parameters are written as platform='this', so the default is a string, but when the user passes 0 or 1 (integers), then the code will work. But if they pass a string like '0', then the code will not detect it. 

Hmm, but the problem's docstring says "platform equals 1, use POSIX...", which implies that the platform is an integer. So the user's intended use is that platform is either 'this' (string) or 0/1 (integers). So the code should only handle those cases, and if someone passes a string like '0', that's invalid and perhaps should be rejected, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the code should be written with the assumption that platform is either 'this', 0, or 1. So perhaps the code is okay as written.

Wait, but in the code above, after the 'this' check, if the platform is not 'this', it can be either 0 or 1 (the integers). So the code proceeds correctly. 

Therefore, the code should first check if platform is 'this', and then set it to 0 or 1. Then, the code uses the integer value to decide the POSIX flag.

Another thing: the shlex.split function may not exactly match the Windows/CMD style. Let me confirm.

In CMD, the escape character is ^, and quotes can be used to include spaces. Also, the caret can be used to escape quotes. So, for example, "a^ b" would become "a b" with the caret removed? Or how does that work?

Alternatively, maybe the shlex module's Windows style handling is sufficient here. 

I think using shlex is the right approach here, given that the problem is about splitting according to platform styles. 

So the code is:

import shlex
import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            platform = 0
        else:
            platform = 1
    posix = (platform == 1)
    return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

Wait, but the problem says "If platform equals 1, use POSIX style. If platform equals 0, use Windows/CMD style." So when platform is 0, we use posix=False. That's exactly what the code is doing.

Wait, let me test a few examples. 

Test 1: Windows style (platform 0). 

Input s = 'a b c'
split(s, 0) should split into ['a', 'b', 'c'].

Yes, because shlex with posix=False uses space as delimiter. 

Another test: 

s = 'a"b c d' 

Wait, in Windows style, that would be problematic. Without quotes, perhaps it's split into ['a"b', 'c', 'd']? Or maybe the quotes need to be properly enclosed. 

Wait, maybe a better example: 

s = 'a "b c" d' → should split into ['a', 'b c', 'd'] when using Windows style. 

shlex.split with posix=False would do exactly that. 

Another example with escaping in Windows style: 

s = 'a^b c' → would become 'ab c', so split into ['ab', 'c']?

Wait, the caret is the escape character, so in Windows style, the escape would combine the 'a' and 'b', so yes. 

In POSIX style, using backslash: 

s = 'a\ b c' → split into ['a b', 'c'].

So the code should handle these cases correctly.

Wait, but what about when the string ends with a backslash? Like in a POSIX line continuation. 

s = 'a\ b \c d' → but in a single line. Wait, shlex.split would treat the backslash as escaping the space, so the entire string would be split into ['a b', '\c', 'd']?

Wait, maybe. Let me see. For example, in the string 'a\ b c', shlex.split(s, posix=True) would split into ['a b', 'c'].

Yes, that's correct. 

Similarly, in Windows style, if the string is 'a\ b c', then shlex.split with posix=False would treat the backslash as a normal character, so the tokens would be ['a\ b', 'c'].

So that's correct.

Another test case: 

Windows with quotes and caret escaping. 

s = 'a ^"bc def^" g' → should result in ['a', '"bc def"', 'g']?

Wait, let me see. Using shlex.split with posix=False, the caret is the escape. So the quotes are escaped, so the quotes are part of the token. 

Yes, that's right. 

Therefore, the code should work as intended. 

Wait, but I should also consider that the 'this' auto-detection may not cover all edge cases. Like some Unix-like systems that aren't Linux, but maybe that's okay. Since the problem states that 'this' auto-detects current platform. 

So the code uses sys.platform to check if it starts with 'win' to decide Windows. Otherwise, it's POSIX. That's a standard way. 

Thus, the code is as above. Let me write it properly, making sure to use the correct variable types and structure. 

Wait, the function's parameters have platform as a string with default 'this', so when the user passes an integer, like 0, that's okay. The code's first if statement checks for platform == 'this', and then proceeds. 

Yes, the code should work. 

So the final code would be:

import shlex
import sys

def split(s, platform='this'):
    if platform == 'this':
        if sys.platform.startswith('win'):
            platform = 0
        else:
            platform = 1
    posix = (platform == 1)
    return shlex.split(s, posix=posix)

Wait, but the return is shlex.split(s, posix=...). That's correct. 

Wait, but the problem's docstring says that the platform is given as 0, 1, or 'this', so the code is handling that. 

I think this should work. Let me see if there's any possible mistake here.

Wait, what if the user's platform is not Windows or anything else? Like, maybe some other system. But the problem says that 'this' is auto-detected. So perhaps the code is okay. 

Another possible issue: when platform is 'this', but the code converts it to 0 or 1 (integers). But the code then proceeds to check platform == 1, which works because after the first if, platform is an integer. 

Yes. 

Therefore, this should be the correct code.
