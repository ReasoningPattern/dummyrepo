Okay, I need to write a Python function called get_logical_path_map that takes an inventory and a version as parameters and returns a dictionary of file paths for the states in the inventory. Let me think about what the inventory might look like. 

Hmm, the docstring says it's returning the file paths in a dict. So maybe the inventory is a data structure that contains information about different states and their paths. Like, perhaps it's a list of dictionaries where each entry has a 'state' and 'path' key? Or maybe a dictionary where the keys are state names and the values are their paths?

Wait, the version parameter probably affects how the paths are structured. For example, different versions might have different directory structures. Like, maybe version 1 uses a path format like '/v1/state_files/{state}' and version 2 uses '/v2/data/states/{state}.dat'? So the function needs to map the state to the correct path based on the version provided.

So the function's logic would be to loop through the inventory, and for each state entry, construct the path using the version. But I need to know how the inventory is structured. Let's assume that the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with a 'state' key. Or maybe the inventory is a dictionary with state names as keys and some other data as values. Wait, the problem says "the states in the inventory", so perhaps the inventory is a collection of state names, and the path is generated based on the version. Alternatively, maybe each state has a specific path that's version-dependent, so the inventory holds the state names and the function uses a predefined mapping for versions.

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state abbreviation, and the value is another dictionary that includes the path for each version. Like, for example:

inventory = {
    'CA': {'v1': '/path/to/ca_v1', 'v2': '/path/to/ca_v2'},
    'TX': {'v1': '/another/path', ...}
}

Then, given a version, the function would return a dictionary where each state's path is selected based on the version. But the function's parameters are inventory and version, so perhaps the inventory is structured such that each state's entry has a path that depends on the version. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of states, and the path is constructed by combining the version with the state name. For instance, the path could be something like f'/states/{version}/{state}.json'. But without more details, I have to make some assumptions here.

Since the problem is a bit vague, I'll have to go with a common approach. Let's think that the inventory is a list of state names, and the function constructs the path using the version. For example, the path would be like '/version/{version}/states/{state}.txt' or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each state has a base path, and the version is part of the path. 

Wait, perhaps the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with a 'state' and 'version_path' or something, but the version parameter is used to select which version's path to use. Alternatively, the inventory might have entries for each state, and the path is determined by the version. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state entries, and each entry has a path that's version-agnostic, but the function needs to append the version to it. Like, if the inventory has a path for each state, but the version is part of the directory structure. 

Hmm, since the problem statement is minimal, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where each key is a state name and the value is a path derived from the version. For example, the states are in the inventory as keys, and the path is built using a template with the version. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each state has a list of paths for different versions, and the function picks the one corresponding to the given version. 

Wait, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state, and the value is a dictionary of versions to paths. So given a version, the function would return a dict mapping each state to its path for that version. 

That makes sense. Let's say the inventory is structured like this:

inventory = {
    'California': {
        'v1': '/v1/ca/state.txt',
        'v2': '/v2/ca/state_info.json'
    },
    'Texas': {
        'v1': '/v1/tx/data.txt',
        'v2': '/v2/tx/data.json'
    }
}

Then, if version is 'v1', the returned dict would be {'California': '/v1/ca/state.txt', 'Texas': '/v1/tx/data.txt'}, etc. 

In that case, the function would loop through each state in the inventory, and for each state, take the value of the version key in their respective sub-dictionary. 

Wait, but how is the inventory parameter structured? The problem doesn't specify, so I have to make a reasonable assumption. Since the function is called get_logical_path_map, perhaps the inventory is a list of state entries, each with a name and a path, and the version determines which part of the path to use. Or maybe the inventory has a structure that includes the version in the path. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of states, and the path is constructed by combining a base path with the version and the state. Like, the base path could be something, but perhaps the function is supposed to generate paths in a certain format. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state, and the value is a path that already includes the version. Then the function would just return the inventory as is, but that doesn't make sense with the version parameter. 

Hmm, the problem says "the file paths of the states in the inventory". So each state has a path, and the version is part of how that path is determined. 

Maybe the inventory is a list of state names, and the path is generated by a template. For example, the path could be something like f'/states/{version}/{state}.dat'. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where the keys are state names, and the values are their base path, and the version is used to append a version-specific part. 

Wait, perhaps the version is used to select between different path formats. Like, if the version is '1', then the path is '/states/v1/state_name', and if it's '2', then '/states/v2/state_name/data' or something. 

Without knowing the exact structure, maybe the function is supposed to take an inventory that's a list of state names and return a dictionary where each state's path is determined by a function of the version. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of tuples, each containing a state and its path for each version. But that's more complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each key is the state abbreviation, and the value is a dictionary with versions as keys and paths as values. Then, given a version, the function would create a new dictionary mapping state abbreviations to their paths for that version. 

Yes, that seems plausible. So the function would iterate over the inventory's keys (each state), and for each state, get the path associated with the given version. 

So the code might look like this:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: paths[version] for state, paths in inventory.items()}

Wait, that's a one-liner. But perhaps the inventory is structured differently. Let me think again. Suppose the inventory is a list of state names, and the path is built using a certain pattern. Like, for each state in the inventory, the path is '/version/' + version + '/state/' + state. 

Then the code would be something like:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        path = f'/version/{version}/state/{state}.txt'
        path_map[state] = path
    return path_map

But the problem says the inventory contains the states' paths. So maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each state's entry has a 'path' that's a string, but the version is part of that path. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a list of objects (like dictionaries) with a 'state' and 'path' field, and the version is used to filter which entries are included. 

Wait, maybe the inventory is a list of all possible state entries with different versions, and the function needs to pick the path for the given version. 

For example, the inventory might look like this:

inventory = [
    {'state': 'CA', 'version': 'v1', 'path': '/v1/ca_path'},
    {'state': 'CA', 'version': 'v2', 'path': '/v2/ca_path'},
    {'state': 'TX', 'version': 'v1', 'path': '/v1/tx_path'},
    ...
]

In that case, the function would loop through each entry in the inventory, and for each, if the version matches, add the state to the dictionary with its path. 

So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for entry in inventory:
        if entry['version'] == version:
            path_map[entry['state']] = entry['path']
    return path_map

But the problem says "the file paths of the states in the inventory", which could imply that each state in the inventory has exactly one path for each version, and the function selects the correct one. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each state's key points to a list of paths for different versions, but that's less likely. 

The function's name suggests that it's creating a logical path map, so maybe the paths are logical in the sense that they depend on the version. 

Another approach: perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each state's entry is a dictionary that has keys like 'v1', 'v2', etc. So the function would return a new dict where each state's value is the path from the given version. 

So, for example, if inventory is:

{
    'CA': {'v1': '/v1/ca', 'v2': '/v2/ca'},
    'TX': {'v1': '/v1/tx', ...}
}

Then, the code would loop through each state in inventory, get the path for that version, and build the dict. 

In that case, the code would be a dictionary comprehension:

return {state: inventory[state][version] for state in inventory}

But perhaps the inventory is a list of states, and the path is generated based on the version. For instance, each state in the list is a string, and the path is constructed as '/path/to/states/' + version + '/' + state + '.txt'. 

So, in that scenario, the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: f'/some/base/path/{version}/{state}.ext' for state in inventory}

But the problem mentions "the states in the inventory", so maybe the inventory already contains the paths but they need to be mapped in a way that depends on the version. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each state's key has a path that's a string, and the version is part of the path. Like, the paths are stored with a version in the name, and the function just returns the paths for that version. 

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the paths based on the version input. 

Hmm, given the ambiguity, the best approach is to make a reasonable assumption and write code that works under that assumption. Since the problem is a bit vague, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state, and the value is the path for that state in the given version. 

Wait, but then the version parameter would be redundant. Maybe the inventory has a list of states, and each state's path is determined by the version. Like, for each state in the inventory, the path is built with the version as a directory. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is structured as a dictionary where each key is a state, and the value is another dictionary mapping versions to paths. 

So the code would loop through each state in the inventory, and for each state, take the value of the version key. 

So, here's the code:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: inventory[state][version] for state in inventory}

Wait, but that would require that each state in the inventory's keys has a sub-dictionary with the version as a key. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a list of state names, and the function constructs the path by some predefined structure. 

But since the problem says "the states in the inventory", maybe the inventory is a list of states, and the path is generated using the version. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a list of state names, and the function returns a dictionary where each state is a key, and the value is the path, which is determined by the version. 

Assuming that the path is built using a certain pattern, perhaps the code would be like this:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for state in inventory:
        path = f'/states/{version}/{state}.state'
        path_map[state] = path
    return path_map

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of dictionaries where each has a 'state' and 'path', and the version determines which path to take. For example, each entry might have a 'v1_path' and 'v2_path', and the function selects between them. 

So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for item in inventory:
        state = item['state']
        if version == 'v1':
            path_map[state] = item['v1_path']
        else:
            path_map[state] = item['v2_path']
    return path_map

But without knowing the exact structure of inventory, it's hard to say. Since the problem gives a minimal docstring, perhaps the intended solution is to take the inventory as a list of state names and return a dictionary where each state is mapped to a path that includes the version. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary where each state's key has a path string, but the version is part of the path, so the function just returns the inventory. But that doesn't use the version parameter, so probably not. 

Hmm, given the problem's lack of specifics, the most neutral approach is to assume that the inventory is a dictionary where each key is the state name, and the value is the path for that state in the given version. So the function can just return a dictionary comprehension that selects the version's path from each state's entry. 

Wait, but perhaps each state's entry in the inventory is a list of paths for different versions, but that's another possibility. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of tuples like (state, path_v1, path_v2), and the function picks the correct one. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state names, and the version is used to format the path. 

The problem states that the function returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in a dict. The version probably determines the directory structure. 

Let me think of a common scenario. Suppose the inventory is a list of state abbreviations, and the function constructs paths based on the version. For example, the base path is something like '/data/states' and each version adds a subdirectory. 

So, for version 'v1', the path for CA would be '/data/v1/states/CA/state.txt', and for version 'v2' it's '/data/v2/states/CA/state_info.json'. 

In that case, the code would generate the path for each state in the inventory using a format that includes the version. 

Assuming that the inventory is a list of state abbreviations, the code could be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: f'/states/{version}/{state}.state' for state in inventory}

But this is very much a guess. Another possible structure is that the inventory is a dictionary where each key is the state, and the value is a dictionary of versions to paths, so the function needs to select the correct version's path. 

In that case, the code would loop through each state in inventory's keys and pick the path corresponding to the version. 

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: paths.get(version) for state, paths in inventory.items()}

But then the function would return None if the version isn't present. Maybe the inventory is structured so that each state's entry has a path that is version-dependent. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each state's key has a list of paths, and the version is the index. Like, for each state, inventory[state] is a list where index 0 is v1 and 1 is v2. Then, the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: inventory[state][version] for state in inventory}

But the version parameter is probably a string, not an integer. 

Hmm, given the problem's ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the inventory is a list of state names, and the function returns a dictionary with each state as the key and a path constructed using the version. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a dictionary of state to path, and the version is part of the path. So the function just returns the inventory, but that's not using the version parameter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the paths are stored in a way that requires the version to be appended. Like, each entry in inventory has a base path, and the version is a part of the full path. 

Wait, maybe the inventory is a list of state entries, each with a 'name' and a list of paths for each version. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each state's key has a path, and the version is part of the path. 

But the problem says the function takes version as an argument. So perhaps the paths are stored with the version in their structure, and the function selects the correct one. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of states, and the version is used to format the path. Like, the base path is fixed, and the version is part of it. 

In the absence of more details, I think the best assumption is that the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state name, and the value is another dictionary that maps versions to paths. The function needs to return a dictionary where each state points to its path for the given version. 

So, for example, if inventory is:

{
    'CA': {'v1': '/v1/path', 'v2': '/v2/path'},
    'TX': {'v1': '/v1/tx', 'v2': '/v2/tx'}
}

Then, get_logical_path_map(inventory, 'v1') would return {'CA': '/v1/path', 'TX': '/v1/tx'}, etc. 

The code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: paths[version] for state, paths in inventory.items()}

That's concise and fits the docstring. But maybe the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with 'state' and 'version' and 'path', and the function needs to collect all entries where the version matches and create a dict of state: path. 

In that case, the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for item in inventory:
        if item['version'] == version:
            path_map[item['state']] = item['path']
    return path_map

Hmm, this is a common scenario. For example, if the inventory is a list of entries like:

[
    {'state': 'CA', 'version': 'v1', 'path': '/some/path'},
    {'state': 'CA', 'version': 'v2', 'path': '/another/path'},
    {'state': 'TX', 'version': 'v1', 'path': '/tx/v1'},
    ...
]

Then the function would filter the entries with the matching version and collect the state to path mappings. 

This approach makes sense because it allows for multiple versions in the inventory, and the function picks the correct one. 

In that case, the code would look like this. 

Wait, but in that scenario, if there are multiple entries for the same state and version, which one should be taken? Probably, the last one or first, but the problem might assume that each state has exactly one entry per version. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list where each entry has a 'state' and a list of paths, and the version is used to index into that list. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state names, and the function uses a predefined path structure. 

Since I can't be sure, but the function's name and the parameters suggest that the version is a key to select the correct path from each state's entry in the inventory, which is a dictionary. 

So I think the first approach where inventory is a dictionary of states to their version-based paths (as another dict) is better. 

Alternatively, perhaps the paths are stored in a way that the version is part of the path string. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state names, and the function returns a dictionary where each key is the state and the value is a path constructed as a string with the version included. 

Assuming that, then the code would be a simple dictionary comprehension with a formatted string. 

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to choose. 

The problem's docstring says "the file paths of the states in the inventory". So maybe the inventory has the states along with their paths, and the version is used to pick between different versions of those paths. 

The most plausible code, given the minimal information, would be to loop through the inventory (assuming it's a list of entries with state and version/path info), and collect the paths for the given version. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state names, and the paths are structured in a way that the version is part of the path. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct code is the second approach, where each entry in the inventory has a 'state' and 'path' for a particular version, and the function loops through all entries to collect those with the correct version. 

Because that's a common way to structure such data. For example, the inventory could be a list of all paths for all versions, and the function selects the ones that match the given version. 

So let's go with that. 

The code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for entry in inventory:
        if entry['version'] == version:
            path_map[entry['state']] = entry['path']
    return path_map

This is a possible solution. Let me check if that makes sense. 

The function's parameters are inventory (a list or a dict?) and version (string). The code assumes inventory is a list of entries. Each entry has 'state' and 'version' keys, and a 'path' key. 

Yes, that's a common scenario. 

Alternatively, if the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state, and the value is a dictionary of versions to paths, then the code would be a one-liner. 

But without knowing, I think the first approach is safer. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of state names, and the path is built using a function that combines the version. 

But the problem says "the file paths of the states in the inventory", implying that the inventory already contains the paths. 

Hmm, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where the keys are the states, and the values are their paths, but the version is part of the path. So the function would just return the inventory, but that doesn't use the version parameter. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory has a list of paths for each version, so the function returns inventory[version], but that's not a dict unless the inventory is a dict of versions to state path dicts. 

Wait, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each key is the version, and the value is a dictionary of state to path. So the function would just return inventory[version]. But then the function's purpose is trivial, so that's probably not it. 

Alternatively, the function is supposed to generate the path based on the version and state name, using some standard format. 

Like, for version 'v1', the path is '/states/v1/{state}.txt', so the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: f'/states/{version}/{state}.state' for state in inventory}

Assuming that inventory is a list of state names. 

Alternatively, if the inventory is a list of state abbreviations, then the code would use those abbreviations. 

But the problem states "the states in the inventory", so the inventory must contain the states. 

Since I have to choose, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the inventory is a dictionary where each state's key has a path, but the version is part of the path. 

Alternatively, maybe the path is stored in the inventory for each state, but the version determines which part of the path to use. 

Alternatively, the inventory is a list of state names, and the function constructs the path using the version. 

In that case, the code is straightforward. 

Wait, but the docstring says "returns the file paths of the states in the inventory", so the inventory must have the paths already. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the version is used to select between different path mappings. Like, the inventory has all the possible paths for all versions, and the function picks the correct ones. 

Alternatively, the inventory is a list of states, and for each state, there's a predefined path structure that uses the version. 

Let me think of possible examples. 

Suppose the inventory is a list of state abbreviations like ['CA', 'TX', 'NY'].

Then the function would return a dictionary where each key is the state, and the path is something like '/data/' + version + '/' + state + '.json'.

So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: f'/data/{version}/{state}.json' for state in inventory}

But the problem's docstring says "in the inventory", so maybe the inventory has the paths. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a dictionary where each key is a state, and the value is a list of paths for each version. 

Then the code would do something like:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: paths[version] for state, paths in inventory.items()}

But that requires version to be an integer index. 

Alternatively, perhaps the path is stored as a string that includes the version, so the function just needs to replace a placeholder. 

Wait, maybe the inventory has a base path, and the version is used to format it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the inventory is a list of dictionaries, each with 'state' and 'path', and the 'path' includes the version. But then the version parameter would be redundant. 

Alternatively, the function is given an inventory where each state has multiple versions of paths, and the version parameter selects which one. 

In that case, the inventory might be a dictionary of states to their paths for each version. So, for each state in inventory, the value is a dictionary like {'v1': '/path1', 'v2': '/path2'}, and the function returns the paths for the given version. 

Thus, the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    return {state: paths[version] for state, paths in inventory.items()}

This seems plausible. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of entries where each entry has the state, version, and path. 

Then the code would loop through the list and collect all entries with that version, building a dictionary of state to path. 

Like:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for entry in inventory:
        if entry['version'] == version:
            path_map[entry['state']] = entry['path']
    return path_map

Yes, that's another possibility. 

Which one is more likely? The problem says the function returns the file paths of the states in the inventory. So the inventory must contain the paths, but perhaps each state has multiple versions. 

So, the first approach where each state's entry contains a dictionary of versions to paths would make sense. 

Alternatively, the second approach where the inventory is a list of entries with state, version, path. 

I think the second approach is more likely because in a list, you can have multiple entries for the same state but different versions, so the function can filter them. 

Therefore, the code would loop through each entry in the inventory (assuming it's a list of dictionaries), check if the entry's version matches, and collect the state and path. 

So that's the code I'll write. Let me structure it properly. 

The function starts by initializing an empty dict. Then loop over each item in inventory. Each item is a dict with 'state', 'version', and 'path'. 

For each item, if the version matches the given version, add the state as a key and the path as the value to the path_map. 

Finally, return the path_map. 

That should work. So the code would be:

def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    path_map = {}
    for item in inventory:
        if item['version'] == version:
            path_map[item['state']] = item['path']
    return path_map

Alternatively, maybe there's a case where the same state appears multiple times with the same version, but the problem probably expects that each state has a single entry per version. 

This code handles that. 

Alternatively, maybe the inventory is a list of tuples (state, path), and the version is used to format the path. But that's less likely. 

The problem's parameters are 'inventory' and 'version', so the first approach where inventory is a list of entries with version info seems better. 

Yes, I'll go with that.
