Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method that removes and returns the least recently used (LRU) item. Hmm, the function is part of a class, probably an LRU cache implementation. Let me think about how to structure this.

First, the method is called popitem, so it's likely part of a dictionary-like structure. The LRU means that I have to track the usage of each item. Oh right, maybe using a doubly linked list to keep track of the order. The nodes would have prev and next pointers, and a dictionary maps keys to these nodes. The least recently used would be at the head of the list, and the most recent at the tail.

Wait, but when you pop the LRU item, you have to remove it from both the linked list and the dictionary. Let me outline the steps:

The popitem method should:
1. Check if the structure is empty. If so, maybe raise an error? But the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps just return whatever, but the problem says to remove and return the pair. So maybe the class ensures there's always at least one item.

2. Access the head of the linked list (the LRU node), get its key and value.

3. Remove that node from the linked list by adjusting the head and the next/prev pointers of adjacent nodes. Also, remove the key from the dictionary.

4. Return the key-value pair as a tuple.

Wait, but how is the linked list implemented here? The class probably has a head and tail, and a dictionary (like self.cache) that maps keys to nodes. Each node has a key, value, prev, and next.

Alternatively, maybe using an OrderedDict from the collections module? Because OrderedDict can be used to implement LRU caches. Oh right, the popitem(last=False) method in OrderedDict removes the first item (the LRU). So maybe this class is using an OrderedDict, and the popitem method is just calling that with last=False?

But the user's function signature is for a class's own popitem method, not using the built-in. So perhaps the code is for a custom LRU Cache class. Let me think of the code structure.

Assuming the class has a __init__ with a dictionary and a linked list. The nodes are connected in order. The head is the LRU, and the tail is the most recent. So when you popitem, you take the head node, remove it, and return its key-value.

Wait, but in code, how do you track the LRU? Maybe each time an item is accessed or added, it's moved to the tail. So the head is the oldest.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

The class might have a dictionary and a linked list. The linked list nodes contain the key and value, along with pointers. The head is the LRU node. So when popitem is called, you take the head, then move the head to the next node. Then you return the key-value pair.

But to do that, the class needs to have a head and tail, and the nodes need to be linked. Let me sketch a possible Node class.

Wait, maybe the code is for an LRU Cache class. Let me think of the code structure. The popitem method would need to access the head node, then remove it from the list and the cache.

Wait, but the user hasn't provided the entire class structure, just the method. So perhaps I have to assume that the class uses an OrderedDict, and the popitem method is a wrapper for the popitem method of the OrderedDict with last=False.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to implement the LRU without using the built-in. Let me think of how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe the code is for a class that uses a regular dict and a linked list. Let's see:

The popitem method would check the head of the linked list. The head's key is the least recently used. So, first get the key from the head. Then, remove that key from the dictionary. Also, adjust the linked list pointers.

Wait, but in that case, the code would look something like this:

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.cache = {}

    def popitem(self):
        # assuming that the list is not empty
        key = self.head.key
        val = self.head.value
        # remove the head from the linked list
        self.head = self.head.next
        if self.head is not None:
            self.head.prev = None
        else:
            self.tail = None
        # remove from cache
        del self.cache[key]
        return (key, val)

But then, the nodes would need to have prev and next pointers. Also, the head might be a dummy node, but that's a detail.

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a linked list where each node has a key and value, and the head is the LRU. The popitem method just takes the head, then moves the head to the next node. But that requires the linked list to be properly maintained elsewhere in the class.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is using a list to track order, but that's less efficient.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of an OrderedDict-based LRU Cache, where popitem is implemented as:

def popitem(self):
    return self.ordered_dict.popitem(last=False)

But the user's code might need to handle it manually.

Wait, the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. So I have to write the code for the popitem method assuming that the class has the necessary data structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the class uses a dictionary and a linked list. The popitem method would have to access the head of the linked list. But without knowing the rest of the class structure, maybe the code is using an OrderedDict. Let me see.

The standard way to implement LRU cache in Python is with an OrderedDict. The popitem method for the LRU would then be popitem(last=False). So perhaps the code is:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        """Remove and return the (key, value) pair least recently used."""
        return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But the user's code may not want to use the built-in. Wait, the problem says "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring". So the code must be for the popitem method. The method is part of a class, so the code has to be inside the class.

Alternatively, maybe the class is using a linked list and a hash map. Let me think of the code in that scenario.

Assuming the class has a head and tail, and a dictionary called cache that maps keys to nodes. Each node has key, value, prev, next.

Then, the popitem would be:

def popitem(self):
    key = self.head.key
    val = self.head.value
    # Remove from linked list
    self.head = self.head.next
    if self.head is not None:
        self.head.prev = None
    else:
        self.tail = None
    # Remove from the cache
    del self.cache[key]
    return (key, val)

But this requires that the class has these attributes set up properly. Since the problem only gives the popitem method's signature and docstring, maybe I have to assume that the class is using an OrderedDict, so the code is straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is for a custom LRU structure where the popitem is O(1) time. Using the built-in's popitem is the easiest way.

So, the code would be using an OrderedDict, and the method is just a call to popitem with last=False. But in that case, the method would look like:

def popitem(self):
    return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But then, the user's method has to be part of a class that has an ordered dict called cache. Since I can't know the class's exact structure, perhaps the problem expects the use of the built-in's method.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to return the first item in the list, which would be the LRU. So if using a linked list, the code must handle that. But without the rest of the class, it's hard to write. Wait, perhaps the code is for a class that has a linked list and the head is the LRU. So the code would have to be as I thought before.

Alternatively, maybe the code is for the built-in dict's popitem, but the standard dict's popitem pops arbitrary items. So the user's code must be for a different class.

Hmm, given the ambiguity, maybe the problem expects the use of an OrderedDict. Since that's a common approach for LRU caches. Let me proceed with that.

Wait, the function's docstring says "least recently used", so the popitem here is specifically for that. The standard popitem in a regular dict is not LRU. So the code must be part of a class that uses an ordered structure. So, the code would be as follows:

The popitem method would need to access the ordered data structure. So the code would be using an ordered dictionary's popitem with last=False. So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    return self.order_dict.popitem(last=False)

But in the code, the user's function has to be part of the class. So the actual code inside would depend on how the class is structured. Since the problem only provides the popitem method's signature and doc, perhaps the code is supposed to use an ordered dict, and the method is part of a class that has such a structure. So the code would be as above.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that has a __root__ variable pointing to the linked list, but that's unclear. Since the problem states to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring, I have to assume that the class has the necessary attributes. The most straightforward way is to use the ordered dict's popitem.

Therefore, the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

Assuming that the class has a cache attribute which is an OrderedDict. But the problem's docstring says "remove and return the (key, value) pair least recently used", so that's exactly what popitem(last=False) does.

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to implement the LRU without using the ordered dict. Let me think of the Node approach.

Suppose the class has a head and tail node, and a dictionary called _cache. Each node has a key, value, prev, next.

The popitem method would first check if the list is empty. But the problem says to remove and return, so maybe it's assumed that there is at least one item. The code would:

key = self.head.key
value = self.head.value
self.head = self.head.next
if self.head is None:
    self.tail = None
else:
    self.head.prev = None
del self._cache[key]
return (key, value)

But in this case, the code has to reference the head and the _cache. So perhaps the code would look like this, but since the problem doesn't give the class's other methods, maybe I should go with the ordered dict approach.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that uses a deque, but that's not efficient. Probably ordered dict is better.

Therefore, I think the answer is to use an ordered dict and return the popitem with last=False. So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    return self.data.popitem(last=False)

Assuming the data is an ordered dict. But the variable name might vary. Alternatively, the code uses a helper function or the class has an __root__ attribute. Since the problem only requires the popitem method, perhaps the code is as simple as that.

Wait, the problem says "you are a Python software engineer" and to generate code based on the signature and docstring. The method is called popitem, so maybe the class is using a standard dict and the popitem is supposed to work as LRU. But that would require more code.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is for a class that inherits from collections.OrderedDict, so the method is overridden. But in that case, the popitem method would have to call the parent's popitem with last=False.

Wait, the function's first line is def popitem(self):, so the method is part of the class. So the code must use the internal data structures of the class. Since I don't have the rest of the class, the only way to proceed is to assume that the class uses an ordered dict. Therefore, the code would be:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But the problem only asks for the popitem method. Wait, the user provided the function signature and docstring, so they want the code for that method, not the entire class. But how can I write that method without knowing the rest of the class?

Hmm, perhaps the code is supposed to be part of a class that uses an ordered dictionary stored in a variable like self.data. So inside the method, you just call popitem on that data structure with last=False.

Alternatively, maybe the code is for a class that has a linked list and a dictionary, so the code would have to handle that. But without knowing the class's structure, I can't write that.

The problem must expect the most straightforward approach. Since the docstring mentions LRU, the standard approach is to use an ordered dict and call popitem with last=False. Therefore, the code for the method would be as follows, assuming the class has an ordered dict as self.cache or something similar.

Wait, the user's function is called popitem, so maybe the class's popitem is exactly that. So the code would be:

def popitem(self):
    return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me confirm: in an OrderedDict, the first item (when last is False) is the least recently used. So yes, that would work. So the code should be like that.

Alternatively, maybe the code is part of a class that uses a different structure, like a list to track order. But that would be O(n) for popitem, which is not efficient. The problem might expect the O(1) approach using an ordered dict.

Therefore, the code for the method is as above. So I'll write that. The user wants only the code in markdown, so I need to output just the code block.
