Okay, I need to generate Python code for the method add_asset based on the given function signature and docstring. Let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says, "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'basename' in _assets in the class." Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

Wait, maybe it means that when the class's filepath() method is called, it should return the assigned file path for the given basename. So the add_asset method should store the file_path under the key basename in the _assets dictionary of the class. 

So, the method is part of a class, and the class has an attribute _assets which is a dictionary. The task is to add an entry to this dictionary where the key is basename and the value is the provided file_path. But also, when someone calls the filepath() method, it should retrieve the stored path based on the basename. 

Wait, but how does the add_asset method relate to the filepath() method? Maybe the _assets is a dictionary that maps basenames to their file paths, and the filepath() method would look up the basename in this dictionary. So the add_asset method just needs to set _assets[basename] = file_path. 

The function's parameters are self, basename, and file_path. So inside the method, I should check if _assets exists. Maybe the class initializes it in __init__ as a dictionary. Since the problem doesn't mention that, I can assume that _assets is already present as an instance variable. 

Therefore, the code would be straightforward. The method adds the key-value pair to the _assets dictionary. 

Wait, the docstring says "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to basename in _assets". Maybe "invoke by" is a typo? Like "invoked by" or "invoked via"? Or perhaps it's supposed to mean that the file_path comes from the result of invoking the class's filepath() method? But that might not make sense here. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to set the _assets[basename] to the value returned by the class's own filepath() method. But then why pass the file_path as an argument? That seems conflicting. 

Wait, perhaps the wording is off. Maybe the correct intention is that when the add_asset is called, the given file_path is stored under the basename key in the _assets dictionary. Then, the existing method called 'filepath' (maybe a property or another method) would retrieve the path from there. 

The problem's exact wording is a bit unclear, but the key point is that add_asset is to store the file_path in _assets with the basename as the key. So the code should be:

def add_asset(self, basename, file_path):
    self._assets[basename] = file_path

But I need to make sure that the _assets is a dictionary. If the class doesn't have it initialized, this could cause an error. But since the function is part of the class's methods, perhaps the __init__ method has already initialized _assets as a dictionary. Since the problem doesn't mention that, I don't need to include it here.

Wait, the function's docstring says "Assign the filepath invoke by filepath() in the class to 'basename' in _assets". Maybe "invoke by" is a mistake, and it's supposed to say "to be invoked by"? So that when the filepath method is called, it can get the value from _assets. But the add_asset's purpose is to store the file_path under the basename in _assets. 

So the code is indeed as simple as adding the entry to the _assets dictionary. That's the most straightforward interpretation. I think that's what is required here. So the code would just have self._assets[basename] = file_path. 

The user also specified to output only the code in Python markdown format, which probably means just the code block without any explanations. So I'll write the function with the docstring and the single line of code.
