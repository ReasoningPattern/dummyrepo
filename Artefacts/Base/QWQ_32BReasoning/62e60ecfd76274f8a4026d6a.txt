Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function protocol_handlers based on the given docstring. The function is a class method since it has 'cls' as the first parameter. The goal is to return different Bolt protocol handlers depending on the protocol_version provided.

First, I should think about how the function will determine which handler to return. Maybe there's a dictionary that maps protocol versions to their corresponding handler classes or functions. The protocol_version could be None, which might mean returning all handlers or a default one. But the docstring isn't specific, so perhaps the function checks the version and returns the appropriate handler.

Wait, the function's description says "Different forms... based on the value of protocol_version." So if protocol_version is given, return the specific handler for that version. If not, maybe return a list of all possible handlers or a default? Hmm, the docstring isn't clear, but perhaps the standard approach is to return a handler for the specified version, or all if none is given. Or maybe when protocol_version is None, it returns a handler that can handle any version? Not sure. Let me think of typical scenarios.

In Bolt protocols, versions are often numbers like 1, 2, 3 etc. So maybe the function uses a case-like structure, like a dictionary where keys are versions (or tuples for ranges) and the values are the handler classes. For example, if protocol_version is 4, return HandlerV4. If it's 3, HandlerV3, etc. But how to structure this?

The function is a class method, so perhaps the handlers are subclasses of cls. So the code might look for a subclass of cls that corresponds to the given protocol_version. For instance, the handlers might have names like BoltProtocolV1, BoltProtocolV2, etc., and the function would select the appropriate one based on the version.

Alternatively, maybe the cls itself is a base class, and the method returns an instance or a class based on the version. Let me structure this with a dictionary mapping. Let's say the protocol versions are integers. The code could have a dictionary inside the method where each key is a version number, and the value is the handler class. Then, when a version is provided, it returns the corresponding class. If no version is given, maybe it returns all handlers or a default.

Wait, the docstring doesn't specify what to return when no version is given. But perhaps the function is supposed to return a handler for the latest version if none is provided. Or maybe it returns all possible handlers. The question isn't clear, so I need to make an assumption here. Since the function is called protocol_handlers, plural, maybe when protocol_version is None, it returns all handlers. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, the function could return a specific handler based on the version, and if no version is passed, it might return a default or raise an error. Hmm, but the problem says "based on the value of protocol_version," so perhaps if it's None, it's an error case or returns all possible handlers. Wait, the function is a class method, so perhaps the return is a list or a generator of the handler classes.

Alternatively, maybe each protocol version has a corresponding handler class, and the method returns that class when given a version. For example, if protocol_version is 4, return cls's V4 subclass. So the code would look something like:

handlers = {
    1: cls.HandlerV1,
    2: cls.HandlerV2,
    3: cls.HandlerV3,
    4: cls.HandlerV4,
    ...
}

Then, if protocol_version is provided, return handlers[protocol_version]. If not, perhaps return all handlers, but the parameters say protocol_version is optional, so maybe when it's None, the method returns a list of all available handlers, or a default one?

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a handler that can handle multiple versions, depending on the input. For instance, if the protocol_version is 3, return a handler for version 3. If it's not specified, maybe return a list of all possible handlers.

Hmm, the problem isn't very detailed, so I'll have to make a reasonable assumption. Let's go with the idea that each version has a specific handler, and when a version is given, return the corresponding handler class. If no version is given, perhaps return a list of all handler classes for the available versions.

Wait, the function's return is "Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers", so maybe when protocol_version is not given, it returns all of them, but the function's name is protocol_handlers, which is plural. But the docstring says "are returned", so perhaps it's expecting to return a single handler when a version is given, and multiple when not. But the parameters allow passing a version, so maybe the function can take a version and return the handler for that version, or return a collection when no version is passed. 

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a list of handlers up to that version, or something else. Let me think of a possible structure. Let's suppose that the cls has subclasses for each protocol version, named like BoltHandler1, BoltHandler2, etc. The protocol_version is an integer. The method would check the version and return the corresponding subclass. If protocol_version is None, maybe it returns a list of all subclasses, or perhaps the highest version. But the function's description says "based on the value of protocol_version", so perhaps the None case is handled by returning all possible handlers, or maybe just the latest. But the problem doesn't specify. Since the user hasn't provided more details, I'll proceed with the simplest approach: return the specific handler for the given version, and raise an error if not found. If protocol_version is None, perhaps return a default or all, but since the function's return is not specified, maybe the None case is for getting all handlers.

Wait, the function's name is protocol_handlers (plural) and the docstring says "Different forms...", so maybe when protocol_version is not provided, it returns all handlers. But how to structure that. Let's see.

Perhaps the code is structured as follows: the method uses a dictionary mapping versions to handler classes. If a version is given, return the corresponding class. If not, return the entire dictionary. Or maybe return a list of all handlers. Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a way to generate the correct handler based on the version, perhaps by checking the version and instantiating the correct subclass.

Alternatively, maybe the function is a factory method that returns the appropriate handler instance based on the protocol version. Let me think of a possible code structure.

Let me try to write a sample code. The function is a class method. Let's have a dictionary in the method that maps version numbers to handler classes. For example:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        1: cls.Bolt1Handler,
        2: cls.Bolt2Handler,
        3: cls.Bolt3Handler,
        4: cls.Bolt4Handler,
        # etc.
    }
    if protocol_version is None:
        return handlers.values()
    else:
        return handlers.get(protocol_version, None)

But maybe the protocol_version is a string like "4.3", so the keys would need to be tuples or ranges. Alternatively, perhaps the versions are handled as a major version. So, for example, protocol_version could be 4, and that would return the handler for version 4, regardless of minor versions. 

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a list of handlers that support up to that version, but that's more complex. Since the problem is vague, perhaps the simplest solution is to return a handler based on exact version numbers. So the code would have a dictionary mapping version numbers (like 1, 2, 3, etc.) to the corresponding handler classes. Then, if protocol_version is passed, return the handler for that version. If not, return all handlers or raise an error. But the problem's docstring isn't clear on what to return when no version is given. The function is named protocol_handlers (plural), so maybe when no version is provided, it returns all handlers. Let's proceed with that.

Wait, but the function's return type isn't specified. The user just wants code based on the signature and docstring. The code must return different handlers based on protocol_version. So the code should check the protocol_version and return the appropriate handler. Let's assume that the protocol_version is an integer, and each handler class is named like HandlerVx where x is the version. The code would have a dictionary mapping version numbers to those classes. If the version is None, perhaps return all handlers, but the function might be expecting a single handler. Hmm, perhaps the default case is to return a handler for the highest supported version. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe the None case is an error. But the function's parameters have protocol_version as optional, so perhaps when it's not given, it returns a list of all handlers. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of handlers for all versions up to and including the given one. But without more info, I'll go with the first idea: when protocol_version is given, return the corresponding handler class. When it's None, return all available handlers as a list or a generator.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a handler instance, but since it's a class method, perhaps it returns the class. Let me see. The function is called via the class, so returning the class makes sense. So, the code would be something like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handler_map = {
        1: cls.HandlerV1,
        2: cls.HandlerV2,
        3: cls.HandlerV3,
        4: cls.HandlerV4,
        # etc.
    }
    if protocol_version is None:
        return handler_map.values()
    return handler_map.get(protocol_version, None)

But perhaps the protocol versions are represented as tuples for major and minor versions. Like, 4.3 would be (4,3). So the keys in the map would be tuples, and the code would check for exact matches. But the problem's example doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the protocol_version is a string, like "Bolt_v4", so the code can map that directly. But since it's called protocol_version, likely it's a number. 

Wait, maybe the protocol versions are stored as attributes of the cls. Like, the class has a method or attribute that holds the available versions. For example, if the cls has a class attribute _HANDLERS which is a dictionary, then the function can access that. But the problem's code doesn't mention that, so perhaps the handlers are subclasses of cls. Like, each handler is a subclass with a version attribute. Then the function can loop through all subclasses and select the one with the matching version.

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a decorator or some other way to register handlers. But given the constraints, maybe a simple dictionary is best. Let me proceed with that. 

Wait, but the user wants the code generated, so I need to make sure that the code is valid. Since the function is a class method, the dictionary can be inside the method. So the code would look like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        1: cls.HandlerV1,
        2: cls.HandlerV2,
        3: cls.HandlerV3,
        4: cls.HandlerV4,
    }
    if protocol_version is None:
        return list(handlers.values())
    return handlers.get(protocol_version)

But maybe the versions can be ranges, like up to a certain version. For example, if protocol_version is 3.2, but the handlers have versions 1, 2, 3, etc., then the handler for 3 would be used. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the simplest is to return the exact version. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return a list of all handlers when no version is specified. So the code would check if the version is None, then return all, else return the specific one. 

Another possibility: the protocol_version is a tuple, so perhaps the code needs to handle that. But without more info, it's hard to know. Let's go with the first approach. 

Wait, but the function's return is "Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers". So if the protocol_version is not given, it might return all of them. The function is a class method, so maybe the cls has a list of all the handler subclasses. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should iterate through the subclasses of cls and filter those with a version attribute. But that's more complicated. 

Alternatively, the code could use a dictionary where the keys are the protocol versions and the values are the handler classes. The function would return the appropriate one. 

So putting it all together, here's the code:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        1: cls.HandlerV1,
        2: cls.HandlerV2,
        3: cls.HandlerV3,
        4: cls.HandlerV4,
    }
    if protocol_version is None:
        return handlers.values()
    return handlers.get(protocol_version)

Wait, but the return types: if protocol_version is None, it returns an iterator of the values, which can be converted to a list. Maybe better to return a list. So, list(handlers.values()).

Also, maybe the function should return a handler instance, but since it's a class method, perhaps it returns the class. Alternatively, maybe it returns an instance. But without more context, I'll proceed with returning the class.

Alternatively, maybe the handlers are stored in a class-level dictionary. For example:

class BoltHandler:
    _HANDLERS = {}

    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        if protocol_version is None:
            return cls._HANDLERS.values()
        return cls._HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)

But in the problem, the function is given as a class method, so the code inside the function must build the handlers dictionary. Maybe the handlers are attributes of the class, like cls.Bolt1, etc. But the exact names are unknown. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function uses a series of if-elif statements. Like:

if protocol_version == 1:
    return cls.HandlerV1
elif protocol_version == 2:
    return cls.HandlerV2
... etc.

But that's less scalable. The dictionary approach is better.

Hmm, the problem's docstring says "Different forms of Bolt protocol handlers are returned based on the value of protocol_version". So, if protocol_version is not given, perhaps it returns all handlers. That's why in the code, when protocol_version is None, return all. 

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a single handler when a version is given, and all when not. So the code would do that. 

I think that's a reasonable approach. So the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handler_map = {
        1: cls.HandlerV1,
        2: cls.HandlerV2,
        3: cls.HandlerV3,
        4: cls.HandlerV4,
    }
    if protocol_version is None:
        return list(handler_map.values())
    return handler_map.get(protocol_version)

Wait, but the user hasn't specified which versions are supported. The example may need to include some sample handlers. Since the problem says to generate code based on the signature and docstring, perhaps the code will have a placeholder for the handlers, but in the given function, it's just a class method. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to return a list of all available handlers when protocol_version is None, and a specific one when it's given. 

But in the code, how to get the available handlers? Maybe the handler_map includes all the versions the class knows about. So the code uses that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a list of supported versions, and the handlers are dynamically looked up. But again, without more info, I'll proceed with the dictionary approach.

Wait, but the user's function is a class method, so the code can be written as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """Docstring here"""
    handler_map = {
        1: cls.Handler1,
        2: cls.Handler2,
        3: cls.Handler3,
        4: cls.Handler4,
    }
    if protocol_version is None:
        return list(handler_map.values())
    return handler_map.get(protocol_version)

But the actual handler classes (Handler1, etc.) are part of the cls's subclasses. Alternatively, maybe the handler_map is built by checking the subclasses. But that would require more code, like looping through all subclasses of cls and checking their version attributes. However, that's more complex and might not be what the user expects. Since the problem doesn't specify, the simplest way is to have a static dictionary inside the method. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return an instance of the handler, but since it's a class method, perhaps the user wants to return the class. 

Alternatively, maybe the protocol_version is a string like "Bolt 4", and the code parses that. But again, without specifics, better to use integers. 

So, the code would look something like this. Let me check if I can make it more general. Maybe the handler_map can be a class attribute, but since the function is inside the class, perhaps the code uses a dictionary within the method. 

Wait, but if the function is part of a class, the handler_map could be stored as a class variable. But the problem's code only has the function signature and docstring. The user wants the code for the function itself, so the function must handle that. 

Alternatively, maybe the function uses a try-except to get the handler. Like, getattr(cls, f"Bolt{protocol_version}Handler"), but that's another approach. 

Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the exact handler class names. To make it generic, perhaps the code uses a different naming convention. Like, for version 4, the handler is cls.Bolt4. 

Alternatively, perhaps the protocol versions are stored in a list or something. 

Well, given the information, I think the best way is to create a dictionary mapping version numbers to their corresponding handler classes (as attributes of cls), and return accordingly. So the code would be as I wrote before. 

Wait, but maybe the function should return a list of handlers for all versions up to the given one. For example, protocol_version=3 would return handlers for 1,2,3. But the docstring isn't clear on that. 

Alternatively, the function might return a handler for the highest version less than or equal to the given one. That's common in protocol handling. For instance, if the client supports up to 4.3, the server uses the highest possible. But the problem's wording is "based on the value of protocol_version", so maybe it's exact. 

Given the ambiguity, I'll stick with the simple dictionary approach where each version maps directly, and if None, returns all. 

Wait, the function is called protocol_handlers. Maybe when a version is given, it returns the handler for that version, but when none is given, it returns all handlers. So in the code, the return is a list of all values when protocol_version is None. 

Another thought: perhaps the protocol_version can be a range. For example, the function could return all handlers up to that version. But without knowing, I can't implement that. 

So, the code I have is okay. Let me make sure it's correct. The function is a class method, so the first parameter is cls. The handler_map is a dictionary inside the method. The keys are the protocol versions. The values are the handler classes. 

Wait, but how do the handler classes exist? For example, the cls must have those attributes. Like, if the base class is cls, then the subclasses must be named HandlerV1, etc., or perhaps they are stored as class attributes. 

Alternatively, maybe the handler classes are in a module, and the code imports them. But since the function is a class method, perhaps the handlers are subclasses of the cls. So, the code can loop through all subclasses and check their version. But that requires each handler to have a version attribute. 

Hmm, that might be a better approach. Let me think:

Suppose each handler has a class attribute 'protocol_version', and the function loops through all subclasses of cls to find those that match the given protocol_version. Or if protocol_version is None, return all.

But how to get all subclasses? Using __subclasses__() might work, but that could include indirect subclasses. Alternatively, perhaps the base class has a register method, but again, this requires more setup. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function uses a dictionary that is built by checking the subclasses. 

Wait, maybe the code is supposed to be as simple as possible. Let me go back to the first idea. 

The code would look like this:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {
        1: cls.HandlerV1,
        2: cls.HandlerV2,
        3: cls.HandlerV3,
        4: cls.HandlerV4,
    }
    if protocol_version is None:
        return list(handlers.values())
    return handlers.get(protocol_version)

But this requires that the cls has those HandlerV1 etc. attributes. The user might expect that. Alternatively, maybe the handler classes are in a module and imported, but given the class method, probably the handlers are subclasses. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return an instance of the handler. But without parameters, perhaps it's just returning the class. 

Another possible approach is using a default. If the protocol_version is not found, return the highest available or None. But the problem's docstring doesn't specify error handling. 

In any case, the code I wrote seems to fit the given requirements. The docstring says different forms are returned based on the protocol_version, so when a version is provided, return the specific handler. When not, return all. 

Wait, but the function's return is in the singular or plural? The docstring says "Different forms...", which is plural, but the function could return a single handler when a version is given. So the code should return a list when protocol_version is None, and the specific handler class otherwise. 

Yes, that's what the code does. 

Alternatively, maybe the protocol_version is a string like 'Bolt 4.3', and the code needs to parse it. But without more info, better to use integers. 

So the final code would be as above. But I should make sure to use the correct way to return all values. The 'values()' method returns a dict_values object, so converting to a list is better. 

Wait, the function's return type is not specified, but the user wants code based on the signature. The function's return is not annotated, so the code can return either the specific handler or a list. 

Therefore, the code should be written as follows. The user may have to adjust the handler names and versions as needed, but the structure is correct.
