Okay, I need to generate a Python function called _get_resource_name_regex that returns regular expressions for validating Krake resource names. Let me start by recalling what Krake expects for resource names. 

From what I remember, Kubernetes and thus Krake likely follow the DNS subdomain naming rules. The standard Kubernetes naming convention requires that resource names must match the DNS subdomain label format, which is [a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*). So the regex should start with a lowercase letter or number, followed by any combination of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, but must end with a lowercase letter or number. Also, hyphens can't be at the start or end. 

Wait, maybe I should check the exact regex used by Kubernetes. Oh right, the regex pattern is ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ which ensures the name is between 1 and 63 characters. Krake might use the same or a similar pattern. 

So the function should return this regex. Let me think about how to structure the code. The function needs to return the regex, possibly as a compiled object or a string. Since the docstring mentions "regular expressions" plural, maybe there are multiple regexes? Or perhaps it's a single regex. Let me check the original problem again. The docstring says "the regular expressions that are used", but maybe it's just one. 

Alternatively, maybe Krake has different regex for different resources. Hmm, the function's name is _get_resource_name_regex, so probably it's for the general resource names. Let's stick with the standard Kubernetes pattern. 

Wait, another point: in Kubernetes, the max length is 63 characters. The regex should enforce that. The pattern I mentioned earlier does that. 

So the code would be something like:

import re

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    return re.compile(r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$')

But maybe the user wants it as a string instead of a compiled regex? The function's docstring says "return the regular expressions", so perhaps returning the string pattern. But in Python, returning a compiled regex is more efficient if used multiple times, so maybe they expect that. 

Alternatively, maybe they need both the regex pattern and a compiled version, but the function's name suggests returning the regex itself. Let me see. The function's docstring says "validate the name", so the regex is probably to be used in a match. 

Wait, perhaps the function should return the regex as a string. Let me think again. The standard Kubernetes name validation regex is as I mentioned. 

Wait, the function's name is _get_resource_name_regex. Since it's a helper function, maybe it's better to return the regex pattern as a string. Or perhaps return a compiled regex for easier use. 

The question says to return the regex used to validate. So the correct approach would be to return the compiled regex. Let me structure it properly. 

Wait, maybe the user expects a tuple of regex patterns if there are multiple, but I can't recall any others. Let me confirm. Krake's resources, like Kubernetes, require the name to be a valid DNS label. The DNS label regex is exactly that pattern. 

So the function should return the compiled regex. 

Wait, but the function is named with an underscore, which suggests it's a private function. So perhaps the code is part of a larger module. 

Putting it all together, the function will import re and compile the regex. 

Wait, but the problem says to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring. The function's return is the regex. The code must not include any explanations, just the code. 

Wait, the user specified to output only the code in Python markdown format. Oh right, that means putting it inside ```python delimiters. 

Wait, the function's docstring says "regular expressions" plural. Maybe there are multiple regexes for different cases, but I can't think of any. Maybe one for the entire name and another for parts? Or perhaps it's a single regex. 

Alternatively, maybe the regex is split into parts. Let me think again. The main regex for the name is the one I mentioned. Unless Krake has additional requirements, like starting with a specific prefix, but the problem doesn't mention that. 

Assuming the standard, I'll proceed with that regex. 

Wait, also, in Python, the function must return the regex. So the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    import re
    return re.compile(r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$')

Wait, but the function's body is supposed to be only the code. Wait, the user provided the function's first line and docstring. So the code should start from the next line. Wait, the function is already given, but I need to write the body. 

Wait the user's function signature is given, and the docstring. So the code must be the body inside the function. 

Wait, the function is defined, so I need to write the code inside it. The import statement can't be inside the function if the function is part of a class, but since the function is a standalone, it's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the import is outside. But the user's code may not have it, so putting the import inside the function is acceptable here. 

Wait, but in Python, it's more efficient to import re outside the function, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps just compiling it inside. 

Alternatively, the function could return the pattern as a string. Let me check the exact wording again. The docstring says "validate the name", so perhaps returning the regex pattern as a string. 

Hmm, but the function's name is _get_resource_name_regex, which could imply returning a regex object. 

Wait, the user might be expecting the regex as a string, perhaps to use in other contexts like error messages. 

Alternatively, maybe the function returns a dictionary with different regexes. But the problem doesn't mention that. 

I think the best approach is to return a compiled regex. Let me write that. 

Wait, also, the maximum length is 63 characters. The regex I have includes that because the middle part allows up to 61 characters between the first and last, making the total 63. 

Yes, so the regex is correct. 

So the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    import re
    return re.compile(r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$')

Wait, but in the problem statement, the user said to output only the code in Python markdown. So I have to put it inside triple backticks with the Python language tag. 

Wait the user's example shows putting the code in ```python, so I need to make sure the code is properly formatted. 

Wait, the function's docstring is already provided. So the code should just be the body of the function. But the function's body needs to return the regex. 

Wait, but the code must include the import statement inside the function? That's a bit unconventional, but possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the regex pattern as a string. Then the code would be:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$'

But the docstring says "regular expressions" plural. So maybe there are multiple patterns. Let me think again. 

Perhaps Krake has additional constraints, like allowing certain prefixes or suffixes. Or maybe there are multiple regex for different parts. 

Alternatively, maybe the regex is split into two parts: one for the start and end characters and another for the middle. But that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the regex is for the entire name, so just one. 

Hmm, perhaps the user made a plural mistake. Maybe it's just one regex. 

In that case, the function can return a single regex. 

So I think the correct approach is to return a compiled regex. 

Wait, but in the problem's function signature, the function is supposed to return the regex. So the code inside must do that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function returns the regex as a string. 

Well, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the Krake documentation. 

Wait, I can't actually browse, but from my knowledge, in Kubernetes, the name validation uses the regex as a string. Maybe Krake uses the same. 

Alternatively, the function might return a tuple of regex patterns. But without more info, I'll go with the standard one. 

So I'll proceed with returning the compiled regex. 

Wait, but the function's name is get_resource_name_regex, which could be returning the pattern string. 

Hmm. Let me see. The function is named _get_resource_name_regex, which is a helper function. The regex is probably to be used in validation, so returning the compiled regex makes sense. 

Therefore, the code should include the import inside the function (if necessary) and return the compiled regex. 

Wait, but in Python, you can't have an import inside a function unless it's inside the function's scope. Wait, no, that's allowed but might be inefficient if called many times. However, for the purposes of this problem, it's okay. 

Alternatively, the user expects the import to be outside. Maybe I should structure it as:

import re

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    ...
    return re.compile(...)

But the problem says to generate the code based on the given signature and docstring, so the function must be as written. 

Since the initial function doesn't have the import, perhaps the code should include the import inside the function. 

Wait, but that's not standard. Maybe the user expects the function to have the import statement outside, so perhaps the code should have the import at the top. 

Wait, the problem says to generate the code based on the signature and docstring. The given function's body is empty except for the docstring. So the code must start with the function's body. 

Wait, but the import has to be in the same file. So the code must include the import statement before the function. 

Wait, but in the problem's code, the user provided the function's first line and docstring. The code I need to generate should include the necessary imports. 

Wait, the user's instructions say to generate Python code based on the given signature and docstring. So the code should be the full code for the function, including any required imports. 

Therefore, the code would have to import re inside the function or outside. 

If I put the import inside the function, each call would re-import, but that's probably not an issue here. 

Alternatively, the better practice is to import re outside. 

So the code would start with:

import re

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    ...
    return re.compile(...)

But how to structure that. The user wants only the code generated, so the function must be written properly. 

Putting it all together, the code would be:

import re

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return re.compile(r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$')

Wait, but the problem says to output only the code generated. So I need to make sure that's the exact code. 

Alternatively, maybe the function should return the regex pattern as a string. Let me think again. 

The function's docstring says "regular expressions that are used to validate". The word "used" might imply that the regex is passed to a validation function, so maybe returning the string is acceptable. 

In that case, the code would be simpler:

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$'

But then why plural? Unless there are other regexes for other cases. 

Alternatively, perhaps Krake uses multiple regexes for different aspects of the name. Like one for the entire name, and another for parts. 

Hmm, but without more info, I'll assume it's a single regex. 

Wait, the problem might expect the regex to be in a specific format. Let me confirm the exact regex. 

The Kubernetes name validation regex is as follows: 

The name must be a DNS label, which is: 

- lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- must start and end with a lowercase letter or number
- max length 63 characters 

The regex for that is ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$ 

Yes, that's correct. 

So the code should return this. 

Now, the function's return type: if it's a regex object, then compile it. If it's a string, then just return the pattern. 

The docstring says "regular expressions" plural. So maybe there are multiple patterns. For example, maybe one for the full name and another for the case-insensitive check? Or perhaps split into different parts. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and it's singular. 

Alternatively, perhaps the regex is split into components, like the start, middle, and end parts. 

Alternatively, maybe the regex is stored as a string, and the function returns a list or tuple with one regex. 

Wait, the function's name is singular: regex. So maybe it's just one. 

Hmm. Well, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed to return the compiled regex. 

So the code would need to import re. 

Wait, but the problem says to generate the code based on the given signature. The user's code starts with the function definition. So the code I need to write must include the import statement before the function. 

Wait, no, the given function's signature is the starting point. The code must be the complete function. 

Wait, the user provided the function's first line and the docstring, so the code must be the function's body. 

Wait, the code must start with the function's definition, then the import? That's not possible. 

Therefore, the correct approach is to have the import statement before the function. 

So the code would be:

import re

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return re.compile(r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$')

Alternatively, if the function is part of a module where re is already imported, then no need. But since we can't assume that, including the import is necessary. 

Therefore, that's the code. 

Wait, but the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So I have to put it inside triple backticks with the language tag. 

Wait, the user's example shows that the code is enclosed in ```python. 

So the final answer is:

```python
import re

def _get_resource_name_regex():
    """
    Return the regular expressions that are used to validate the name of the Krake resources
    """
    return re.compile(r'^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$')
```

Wait, but the original function's docstring mentions "regular expressions" plural, so maybe there's more than one. Maybe another regex for other cases? 

Alternatively, perhaps the regex is split into two parts, like one for the start and one for the middle. But that's not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe Krake uses additional regex patterns. For example, checking the length, but the regex already includes that. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The standard regex for Kubernetes names is the one I have. Let's stick with that. 

Alternatively, maybe the regex is returned as a string. Let me see which is more common. 

In validation, you can either compile once and reuse, or return the string. 

Since the function is called get_resource_name_regex, returning the compiled regex makes sense. 

Therefore, the code I wrote is correct. 

Wait, but the function's name starts with an underscore, which is a convention for private functions. So the import is okay to be at the top. 

Yes, so the code is as above. 

I think that's the way to go. Let me make sure there are no typos. The regex starts with ^, then [a-z0-9], then a group that's hyphen followed by more characters, but the middle part allows 0 to 61 characters so that the total length is up to 63. 

Yes, the regex is correct. 

So that's the code to generate.
