Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function protocol_handlers based on the given docstring. Let's see. The function is a class method since it has 'cls' as the first parameter. The goal is to return a dictionary of Bolt protocol handlers, keyed by version tuples. 

First, the function should check if a protocol_version is provided. If it's None, then return all available versions. But if a version is given, it must be a tuple; otherwise, raise a TypeError. So the first thing is to handle the case where protocol_version is not None. Let me think about how to structure that.

The doc mentions that if an explicit version is provided, the dictionary has zero or one items. So I need to filter the handlers to see if the given version is supported. The handlers are probably stored in some class-level variable. Maybe the class has a _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS dictionary that maps version tuples to their respective handler classes. 

So the steps are: 

1. Check if protocol_version is not None. If so, verify that it's a tuple. If not, raise TypeError.
2. If a specific version is given, return a dictionary with only that version's handler if it exists, else empty dict.
3. If no version is given, return the entire dictionary of handlers.

Wait, how do I access the handlers? The function is a class method, so maybe the handlers are stored in cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS or something similar. The function's return is supposed to be a dictionary of version to handler classes for all supported versions. 

So the code structure would be something like:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
        return {protocol_version: cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)} if protocol_version in cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS else {}
    else:
        return cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.copy()  # Or maybe just return the dict directly?

Wait, but the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS would be a class-level attribute. So maybe the function is supposed to access that. 

Wait, the raise statement says if protocol_version is not passed as a tuple. So in the case where protocol_version is provided but it's not a tuple, we need to raise a TypeError. So first, check if protocol_version is not None. Then check if it's an instance of tuple. If not, raise the error. 

Then, when it is a tuple, check if that version exists in the handlers. If it does, return a dictionary with that version and handler. Otherwise, return an empty dict. 

So the code would start with:

if protocol_version is not None:
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Expected a tuple for protocol_version")
    # then filter the handlers
else:
    return the full dict.

Wait, but how to get all the handlers? The doc says to return a dict of version tuples to handler classes. So the cls must have a _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS attribute which is a dictionary. 

So perhaps inside the class, there's a dictionary like _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS = { (3,4): Handler34, (4,3): Handler43, ... } or something like that. 

The function's job is to return either the full dict or a subset. 

Wait, the problem is that the code has to be generated here. The user hasn't provided the actual handlers, so the code will probably assume that the class has such a dictionary. 

So in the code, first, if protocol_version is given, check it's a tuple. Then, create a new dictionary. For the case when protocol_version is given, the result is a dict containing that version's handler if present. 

Wait, the example in the docstring says (3,5). So the version tuples are like (major, minor). 

So the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    handlers = {}
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be passed as a tuple")
        handler = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)
        if handler:
            handlers = {protocol_version: handler}
    else:
        handlers = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.copy()
    return handlers

Wait, but maybe the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is a class attribute. So maybe we can just return a copy when no version is given. However, if the class uses a regular dict, then returning a copy is better so that the original isn't modified. 

Alternatively, maybe the function just returns a view or a new dict. 

Hmm. Also, the error message in the doc says the TypeError is raised if the protocol version is not passed in a tuple. So the check must be that if protocol_version is provided, it must be a tuple. So in the code, when protocol_version is not None, we check if it's a tuple. If not, raise the error. 

Wait, the code above first checks if protocol_version is not None, then checks if it's a tuple. So that's correct. 

Wait, but what about the case where protocol_version is something else, like a list? So the code would catch that. 

Wait, the code's raise statement should be exactly as per the doc: "if protocol version is not passed in a tuple". So, the error is when the parameter is not a tuple (but is not None). 

Therefore, in code:

if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
    raise TypeError("Protocol version must be passed as a tuple")

Wait, but the function's parameters may have other types, like a string. So the code needs to check that. 

Alternatively, the code can first check if protocol_version is not None, then check its type. 

So inside the function:

if protocol_version is not None:
    if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("protocol_version must be a tuple")
    # then proceed

Wait, the docstring says "If an explicit protocol version is provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items, depending on whether that version is supported." So when a version is given, the function returns a dict with that version as key, if it's present in the class's handlers. 

Therefore, the code can be written as:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("protocol version must be passed as a tuple")
        handler = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)
        return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}
    else:
        return cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.copy()

Wait, but the key point is that if the protocol_version is not supported, the returned dict is empty. So using get and then checking if handler is not None. 

Wait, the handler is the class, so if it's in the dictionary, get returns the handler, else None. So if handler is not None, then include it in the dict. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should return a dictionary with the version as key and the handler as value, but only if that version is present. So, in that case, the code can do something like a dictionary comprehension filtering on the version. 

Alternatively, just check if the version exists in the class's handlers. 

Wait, the code above seems okay. 

Wait, but in the code, when protocol_version is given, the function returns a dictionary with that version as key, but only if the handler exists. So if handler is found, the dict has one item, else zero. 

Wait, but in the code, {protocol_version: handler} will have the handler even if it's None? No, because get returns None if not present. Then, if handler is present, then return the dict with that version and handler. If not, return empty dict. 

So the code would be:

handler = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)
if handler is not None:
    return {protocol_version: handler}
else:
    return {}

Wait, but in the code above, the line "return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}" would do that, since handler is the class (which is truthy) if it exists, else None (which is falsy). 

Yes, that works. 

Now, when protocol_version is None, return all available versions. The code would return a copy of the class's _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS dictionary. 

But maybe the class's handlers are stored as a class variable, like cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS. 

So the code's structure would require that the class has this _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS attribute. 

Putting it all together, the code would look like this. 

Wait, but in Python, for a class method, the function is decorated with @classmethod, but the user's function signature doesn't mention that. But the first parameter is 'cls', so the function is a class method. 

The user's function signature is given as def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):, so that's correct. 

Now, the code. 

Wait, the function must return the dictionary. 

Wait, I think the code can be written as follows:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be passed as a tuple")
        handler = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)
        return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}
    return cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.copy()

Wait, but in the case when protocol_version is None, the code returns a copy of the entire dictionary. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should return a new dictionary. But using copy is better to prevent external modifications. 

Wait, but the doc says "return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all relevant and supported protocol versions". So returning the entire dict (but as a copy) is correct. 

Wait, but maybe the class's _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is a static dictionary. So returning a copy ensures that the original is not altered. 

Yes. 

Now, I need to make sure that the code is correct. Let me check the conditions again. 

If protocol_version is provided and it's a tuple, check if it's in the class's handlers. If yes, return a dict with that version and handler. Otherwise, return empty dict. 

If it's not a tuple, raise TypeError. 

If no protocol_version is given, return all supported versions. 

The code seems to handle that. 

Wait, but in the code above, the check for the existence of the handler is via handler's truthiness. Since the handler is a class, which is always truthy if present, that's okay. 

Wait, but what if the handler is a None value? Unlikely, since the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS would be a dictionary of version to handler class. So the handler should always be a class. 

Therefore, if the version is in the keys, then the handler is non-None, so the code works. 

Therefore, the code should be as written. 

Wait, but perhaps the class's _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is a class variable. 

So in the code, assuming that the class has this variable. 

The user's code is supposed to be generated here, so perhaps the actual handlers are not part of this code, but the function is supposed to refer to that. 

Therefore, the code is correct as above. 

Wait, but in the case when protocol_version is not a tuple, like a string, the code raises the error. 

Yes, the first check after protocol_version is not None is to see if it's a tuple. 

Wait, the error message in the doc says the TypeError is raised if the protocol version is not passed in a tuple. So the error message should probably be exactly as specified. 

Wait, the user's docstring says: 

:raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple

So the error message can be anything, but the code must raise a TypeError when the protocol_version is not a tuple (and is not None). 

Wait, no, the function's parameter can be None, but when it's not None, it must be a tuple. 

So the code's check is correct. 

Wait, but the code's error message in the example I wrote is "Protocol version must be passed as a tuple". That's acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe the error message should be exactly as per the doc's description. 

The doc says the error is raised when the protocol version is not passed in a tuple. 

So the code's error message should probably state that. 

The code I have so far does that. 

Therefore, the code should be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be passed as a tuple")
        handler = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)
        return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}
    return cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.copy()

Wait, but maybe the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is a class-level variable. So the code must refer to that. 

Alternatively, maybe the code uses a different structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should loop through all the versions and collect them, but that's unnecessary. 

Wait, the code is supposed to return a dictionary. 

Wait, when protocol_version is None, returning a copy of the entire dictionary is the way to go. 

Now, the function's return is a dictionary. 

Wait, but in the case when protocol_version is given, but not found, returns an empty dict. 

Yes, that's exactly what the doc says. 

So the code should work. 

Wait, but in Python, when you use get, and the key is not present, it returns None, so {protocol_version: None} would be the key-value pair, but the code checks if handler is truthy. Since None is falsy, so that's okay. 

Wait, but the code returns {protocol_version: handler} only if handler is not None. So the returned dict will have the version as key and handler as value. 

Wait, the code as written uses "if handler" which works. 

Hmm, that's correct. 

So the code is as above. 

Wait, but maybe the code should return an empty dictionary even when the handler is None? Because the get returns None, but in that case, the version is not supported, so return empty dict. 

Yes, exactly. 

Therefore, the code should be okay. 

Now, I need to make sure that the code is formatted correctly. The user wants the code in Python markdown format, but only the code, no explanations. 

Wait, the user says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Wait, perhaps they mean to put the code inside a code block with ```python? But the user's instruction says "in python markdown format" but the example given in the problem shows the function signature and docstring. So maybe just the function code. 

Wait, the user provided the function signature and docstring, so the code must include that. 

So the generated code will be the function as per the signature and docstring, with the body as we discussed. 

Wait, but the function must have the docstring as given. 

So the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is not None:
        if not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
            raise TypeError("Protocol version must be passed as a tuple")
        handler = cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)
        return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}
    return cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS.copy()

Wait, but maybe the class has the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS as a class variable. The code assumes that. 

The user didn't provide any other details, so this is the best I can do. 

Wait, but in some cases, maybe the code should return an empty dict when protocol_version is not None but not in the handlers. 

The code does that. 

Yes, so when handler is None, the return is {}.

Wait, the code's return statement in the first case is written as: 

return {protocol_version: handler} if handler else {}

Because handler is the result of get, which would be the class if present, else None. So if handler is not None (i.e., it exists in the dict), then return the dict with that version and handler. Otherwise, return empty dict. 

That's correct. 

So the code should be okay. 

Wait, but maybe the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is a list or another structure? Probably not, since the function is supposed to return a dictionary. 

Therefore, the code is correct. 

Wait, also, when protocol_version is given, but the user passes a tuple of the wrong length? Like (3,), but the versions are (3,4). 

Does the function need to handle that? Probably not, since the check is just whether it's a tuple. The version's validity (like length) is not part of the function's responsibility. The handler will just not be found, so return empty dict. 

Therefore, the code is okay. 

Hmm, I think that's the correct approach. Now, the code should be written exactly like that, without any explanations. 

Wait, the user says "do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in Python markdown format." Wait, perhaps they mean to put the code in a code block using triple backticks and specify the language? 

The example in the problem shows the user's input with the function signature and docstring, but the output should be the code as is. 

Wait, maybe the user is using a markdown code block. So the output should be the code wrapped in ```python ... ```? 

But the user says "output only the code generated, in python markdown format". Maybe they just mean the code as is, with the function definition. 

Alternatively, perhaps they want the code inside a code block. 

But given the instructions, I should output just the code, in Python. 

Wait, the initial problem says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So the code should be the function with the given signature and docstring, and the body as we've written. 

Therefore, the code is as written above. 

Wait, but in the code, the return for the general case is a copy. What if the _PROTOCOL_HANDLERS is a dictionary? 

Yes, the copy() method creates a shallow copy, which is okay here. 

Alternatively, maybe using dict(cls._PROTOCOL_HANDLERS) or something else. 

But the .copy() is the right approach. 

So the code should be correct.
