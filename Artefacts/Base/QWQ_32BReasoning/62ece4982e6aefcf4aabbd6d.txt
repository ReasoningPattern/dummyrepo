Okay, I need to write a Python function called string_to_int that converts a string into a number based on a given alphabet. Let's see what the parameters are. The function takes a string and an alphabet which is a list of strings. The return type is an integer. 

The docstring says the string consists of letters in the alphabet. So first, I should check if all the characters in the input string are present in the alphabet. Wait, but the problem might not require that—maybe it's implied that the input is valid. Hmm, maybe I can skip that check unless it's specified. 

The transition rule isn't detailed, so I have to figure out what it is. Oh right, probably similar to how numbers are represented in different bases. Like each character in the string represents a digit in a base equal to the length of the alphabet. 

So for example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 'a' would be 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2. But wait, sometimes bases start at 1 instead of 0? Like in some systems where you can't have a zero. Wait, the problem says "transition rule"—maybe the function treats each character as a position in the alphabet list, starting from 0. So the first character is the least significant digit or the most?

Wait, the way to convert a string to an integer in a custom base would be similar to how you convert a base-N number. Let's think of the alphabet as the digits. So each character in the string corresponds to a digit in the base equal to the size of the alphabet. 

Let me think of the steps. The function should iterate over each character in the string, find its index in the alphabet, and then compute the number by treating each position as a digit in that base. 

Wait, the order: for example, if the string is "abc" and the alphabet is ['a','b','c'], then each character's index is 0,1,2. So the number would be 0 * (3^2) + 1*(3^1) + 2*(3^0) = 0 +3 +2 =5? Or maybe the first character is the most significant digit. Wait, depends on whether we process from left to right or right to left. 

Wait, in typical base conversion, the rightmost character is the least significant. So for "abc", the rightmost is 'c' (index 2), then 'b' (1), then 'a' (0). So the value would be 0 * 3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*1 = 0 +3 +2 =5. So the code should process each character, multiplying the current total by the base (length of alphabet) and adding the current character's index. 

Wait, let's see. Let's take the example. Let's say the alphabet has 3 letters. The first character (leftmost) would be the highest place value. So for a string like "aba", with the alphabet of 3 letters, the calculation would be:

Each character's index: a is 0, b is1, a is0. 

So the string is "a","b","a". The leftmost 'a' is the first character. So the total would be 0 * 3^2 + 1*3^1 + 0*3^0. 

Wait, but maybe the string is treated as a number where each digit is the index, and the digits are in the order of the string from left to right as higher to lower place values. So like the first character is the most significant digit. 

So the process would be:

Initialize result to 0.

For each character in the string:

result = result * base + index_of_char.

Yes, that makes sense. So for "abc", the first character is 'a' (0), then 'b' (1), then 'c' (2). 

Wait, in that case, the calculation would be 0 * base + 1*base + 2? Wait no, let me walk through step by step. 

Suppose the string is "abc" and the alphabet has 3 letters. 

Start with result =0. 

First character is 'a', which is index 0. 

result = 0 *3 +0 =0.

Second character 'b' (1):

result = 0 *3 +1 =1.

Third character 'c' (2):

result =1 *3 +2 =5.

Which is the same as before. So the order is correct. 

So the plan is: 

- For each character in the input string, find its index in the alphabet. 

- The base is the length of the alphabet. 

- Iterate through each character, updating the result by multiplying by base and adding the current index. 

Now, how to implement this in Python. 

First, get the base as len(alphabet). 

Then, initialize the result to 0. 

Then loop over each character in the string. 

Wait, but the order of the loop matters. Because each new character is added by multiplying the existing result by base and adding the new index. So the first character in the string is the leftmost, which is the most significant digit, so the first iteration should be that. 

For example, if the string is "abc", the first character is 'a', so first step is result *3 (initially 0) +0. Then next character 'b' is result (0) *3 +1. Then 'c' gives 1*3 +2. 

Yes, that works. 

So steps in code:

- Check that all characters in the string are in the alphabet? Probably not necessary unless the problem requires it. Since the docstring says the string consists of letters in the alphabet, maybe we can assume that's true. 

But in code, perhaps we need to handle it. But since the problem says to just generate the code, maybe just proceed. 

Now code steps:

Initialize result =0.

For c in string:

   index = alphabet.index(c) 

   result = result * len(alphabet) + index

Return result. 

Wait, but what if the alphabet has duplicate characters? Oh, the problem says the string consists of letters in the alphabet. But the alphabet is a list, which can have duplicates. But that's probably not allowed. Because in a base system, each digit must be unique. So perhaps the alphabet is a list of unique characters, so each character in the string is present exactly once in the alphabet. 

So assuming that the alphabet is a list of distinct characters. 

So the code can proceed with that. 

Wait, but the alphabet is given as a list of strings. So each element is a single character? Or maybe not? Like maybe the alphabet could be something like ['ab', 'cd', 'ef'] but then the string would consist of those multi-character elements? That seems unlikely, but the problem's parameters say "string: a string consist of the letters in alphabet". So each character in the string is an element present in the alphabet list. 

Therefore, for each character in the string, we can find its index in the alphabet. 

So the code would be straightforward. 

Wait, but the function's parameters are (string: str, alphabet: List[str]). So the alphabet is a list of single-character strings? Or maybe the elements can be longer? Like, for example, if the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then each character in the input string is one of those. 

So the code is okay. 

So putting it all together:

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:

    result = 0

    for c in string:

        result = result * len(alphabet) + alphabet.index(c)

    return result

Wait, that's the core idea. 

Wait, let me test this with an example. 

Suppose alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], and the string is 'ba'. 

Then 'b' is index 1, 'a' is 0. 

First iteration (b):

result starts at 0, so 0 *3 +1 =1. 

Second iteration (a): 1*3 +0 =3. 

So the number is 3? But in base 3, 'ba' would be 1 followed by 0, which is 1*3 +0 =3. 

Hmm that seems right. 

Another test case: if the string is 'abc', then the result would be:

First 'a' (0) → 0 *3 +0 =0 → next 'b' → 0*3 +1 =1 → then 'c' →1*3 +2 =5. 

So the code returns 5, which is correct. 

Another case: alphabet is ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','9','A','B'], so base is 11. 

Wait, but the letters in the string have to be in the alphabet. 

So this code should work. 

Wait, but what about an empty string? Then it returns 0. 

But maybe the problem expects that the empty string is handled as 0. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed for non-empty strings, but the code would handle it. 

So I think that's the code. 

Wait, but what if the alphabet is not in order, or has different characters? Like, alphabet is ['c', 'a', 'b']. Then the string 'a' would be index 1. 

Wait, but the code uses the index of each character in the alphabet list. So yes, that's correct. 

Hmm, so the code seems okay. 

Wait, but the problem's transition rule is not exactly specified. Maybe the index starts at 1? Like in some systems where you don't have zero. 

Wait, the problem says "the corresponding number using the given transition rule". The given transition rule must be the one where each character is its position in the alphabet, starting from 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the position starts at 1. Let me read the problem again. 

The docstring says "the corresponding number of the given string using the given transition rule". The transition rule isn't detailed, but given the parameters, the most logical approach is to treat each character as a digit in a base equal to the length of the alphabet, with each character's value being its index in the alphabet. 

So the code should be correct. 

Wait, but in the example I thought of earlier, if the alphabet is of length 3, then each character is 0-based. 

Therefore, the code should be as above. 

Wait, but I need to import List from typing. Since the function signature uses List[str], the code should have that. 

But the user probably expects that the code includes the necessary imports. 

Wait, the function is defined with alphabet: List[str], so the code must have from typing import List. 

But in the output, the user wants the code in markdown format, but not any explanations. So I have to make sure that the code includes the import. 

Wait, the function's signature uses List[str], so the code must import List. 

Therefore, the code should start with from typing import List. 

Wait, but in some Python versions, maybe the code is written with just List without importing. Wait, no. In Python 3.9+, the generics like List require the import. 

So the code must import List from typing. 

So the code would be:

from typing import List

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    result = 0
    for c in string:
        result = result * len(alphabet) + alphabet.index(c)
    return result

Hmm, that should work. 

Wait, but what if a character in the string is not present in the alphabet? Then alphabet.index(c) would throw an error. But the problem states that the string is composed of letters in the alphabet, so maybe that's acceptable. 

Yes, the function's parameters say the string is made of letters in the alphabet, so we can proceed under that assumption. 

Therefore, the code is as above. 

Let me think of another test case. Suppose the alphabet is ['a','b'], and the string is 'ba'. 

Then 'b' is index 1, 'a' is 0. 

First iteration (b): 0 *2 +1 → 1. 

Second (a): 1 *2 +0 → 2. 

Which is 10 in binary, which is correct. 

So yes, the code works. 

Another example: alphabet is ['p','q','r','s','t'], so base 5. 

The string 'pt' would be 'p' is index 0, 't' is 4. 

So 0*5 +0 → 0 first, then 0 *5 +4 →4. So the total would be 4? Wait no, the string is 'p' followed by 't', so the first character is 'p', which gives 0. Then the next character 't' is index 4. So the result is 0 *5 +4 →4. Wait, but that would be the case if the string is 'pt' which would be like 0*5 +0 (for p) then the t would add 4. Wait, perhaps I should process each character in order, left to right. 

Wait, let's see. Let's take the string as "pqrs" with the same alphabet. The indexes are 0,1,2,3. 

The first character is p (0), then q (1), r (2), s (3). 

The code would process each character in sequence. 

Start with result=0. 

First character p: 0 *5 +0 →0. 

Second character q: 0*5 +1 →1. 

Third r: 1*5 +2 →7. 

Fourth s:7*5 +3 → 38. 

So the total would be 38. 

Which would be 0,1,2,3 in the digits. The leftmost is 0, so the number is 0*(5^3) +1*5^2 +2*5 +3 →0 +25 +10 +3 =38. 

Yes that's correct. 

So I think the code is correct. 

Wait, but the function's return is the number. So that's exactly what this code does. 

Therefore, the code should be as above. 

Now I need to make sure that the code is written properly. 

Wait, the parameters are given as a string and a list. 

Yes, the code loops through each character in the string, multiplies the current result by the base (length of alphabet) and adds the index. 

So I think that's the correct approach.
