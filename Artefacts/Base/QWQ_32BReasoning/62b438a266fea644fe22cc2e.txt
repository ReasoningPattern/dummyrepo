Okay, so I need to write a Python function called parse_arguments that takes in some unparsed command-line arguments and returns a dictionary mapping subparser names or "global" to an argparse.Namespace instance. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that argparse can handle subparsers using a subparsers action. The function should probably set up a parser with subcommands, each of which can have their own arguments. The key is to use the parse_known_args or parse_args method, but I need to make sure that the subparsers are properly handled.

Wait, the function is supposed to return a dict where the keys are the subparser names or "global". So maybe the main parser has some global arguments, and each subparser is for different commands. The user might be passing in multiple subcommands? Or is it a standard setup where you have one subparser?

I think the standard way is to have a single subparser that can be used. So the structure would be: create a main parser, add some global arguments, then a subparsers object. Each subparser (for different commands) would add their own arguments.

The challenge here is that when using subparsers, the namespace usually includes the subcommand's name and the arguments for that subcommand. To collect all the parsed arguments into a dictionary, perhaps I need to process each subparser's results. Wait, the function is supposed to return a dict where each key is the subparser name or "global". So maybe the main parser's arguments are under "global", and the subparsers' arguments are under their respective names.

Wait, how does the subparser work in argparse? The subparsers are added with add_subparsers(), and each subparser has a name. When you parse the args, the resulting namespace will have an attribute corresponding to the subparser's dest, which is usually the command name. So maybe the dest is set to something like 'command' or the subparser name.

So the steps would be:

1. Create the main parser. Maybe add some global arguments first.
2. Add a subparsers container using add_subparsers(). The dest might be 'command' so that we can know which subparser was used.
3. Each subparser (for different commands) would be added to this container. But since the function is given unparsed arguments, maybe the subparsers are predefined? Wait, the function's docstring says it's given command-line arguments and needs to parse them. But how do the subparsers know what their arguments are?

Oh wait, the function has to parse the arguments, but the code must set up the parser structure. Wait, the problem is to generate code based on the signature and docstring provided. The user probably expects that the function creates an argument parser with subparsers, parses the arguments, and returns a dictionary mapping each subparser's name to its namespace. But maybe the "global" part refers to the main parser's arguments?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to handle a situation where there are multiple subparsers, and the arguments are split between them. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The function is supposed to take the unparsed arguments (like sys.argv[1:]) and parse them. The return is a dict where keys are subparser names (like 'command1', 'command2') and the 'global' key for the main parser's arguments. Or maybe "global" is a separate part?

Wait, perhaps the main parser has some arguments that are global (not part of any subparser), and the subparsers each have their own. So when you parse the args, the main parser's arguments are in the namespace, and the subparser's arguments are under the subparser's dest variable. So the dictionary would have "global" as the main parser's arguments, and each subparser's name as a key with their own namespace.

But how do you get all the subparser namespaces? Because typically, only the subparser that was used will have its arguments parsed. The other subparsers aren't called. So maybe the idea is to first parse the global arguments, then determine which subparser was used, parse that, and combine them?

Alternatively, maybe the function is structured to have a parent parser with common arguments, and the subparsers inherit from it. But the question isn't about that. Let me focus.

The function needs to return a dict with two keys: the subparser name (like 'command') and 'global' for the main parser's arguments. Wait, perhaps the main parser's arguments are considered "global" and the subparser's arguments are under their own key. So when the user runs the script with a subcommand, the subcommand's parser is used, and the dictionary would have both the global and the subcommand's namespaces.

Hmm, how to structure this. Let me think of an example.

Suppose the main parser has a --verbose flag. Then there are subparsers for 'add' and 'delete'. So when the user runs the script with 'add --some-arg', the parsed arguments would have verbose from the main parser, and the add's arguments in the subparser's namespace. The returned dict would have 'global' with the main namespace (including verbose), and 'add' with the subparser's namespace (including --some-arg).

Wait, but in the standard argparse setup, the subparser's arguments are added to the main namespace. So how to separate them? Maybe each subparser's arguments are stored in their own namespace, but that's not the usual way. The usual way is that the subparser's arguments are part of the same namespace. So perhaps the function is expecting that each subparser's arguments are stored under their own key in the dictionary, along with the global ones. But how to do that?

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the parents argument so that the main parser's arguments are part of each subparser, but then the subparser's arguments are stored in their own namespace. Wait, no, that's not how it works. The parent parsers add their arguments to the subparsers, but when parsed, they are part of the same namespace.

Hmm, perhaps the function is designed to have a main parser with global args, and then the subparsers each have their own set of args. The returned dict would map 'global' to the main parser's parsed args, and the subparser name (like 'add') to the parsed args for that subparser. But how to get the subparser's args as a separate namespace?

Wait, maybe when you add a subparser, you can set a dest variable, so that the command is known. Then, after parsing, you can check which subparser was used, and then parse again for that subparser's arguments? Or perhaps the subparsers are set up with their own parsers, and the function can collect all the parsed arguments into separate namespaces.

Alternatively, perhaps the function uses a single parser with subparsers, and the result is a namespace that has all the global and subparser arguments. The dictionary would have the 'global' key pointing to the global arguments, and the subparser name pointing to the subparser's arguments. But how to split them?

Maybe the approach is to first parse the global arguments, then the subcommand, and then parse the subcommand's arguments separately. Like:

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--global-arg', ...)
subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
subparser_add = subparsers.add_parser('add')
subparser_add.add_argument('--add-arg', ...)
subparser_delete = subparsers.add_parser('delete')
subparser_delete.add_argument('--delete-arg', ...)

Then, when parsing, you first parse the args to get the command (the 'command' dest). Once you know which subparser was used, you can parse the subcommand's arguments. Wait, but the first parse would have the global arguments and the command. Then the subparser's parser can parse the rest. But how to structure this into a dict?

Alternatively, the function could first parse all the arguments into a single namespace, then split the namespace into parts based on which subparser was used. The main namespace would include the global args, and the subparser's args would be under an attribute. But to put them in a dict, perhaps we can create a dictionary where 'global' has the main parser's args, and then the subcommand's name has the subparser's specific args.

Wait, but the standard way is that the subparser's arguments are merged into the same namespace. So if the main parser has --verbose, and the subparser 'add' has --file, then the namespace would have both. So maybe the 'global' part is the main parser's arguments, and the subparser's part is the entire namespace minus the global ones? Or perhaps the 'global' key includes all arguments except those from the subparsers?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is structured so that each subparser's arguments are stored in their own namespace, and the main parser's arguments are in the 'global' key. But how to do that?

Maybe the approach is to have two separate parsers: the global one and the subcommand ones. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The function needs to return a dict with keys as subparser names and "global". The "global" would be the main parser's arguments. Each subparser's arguments are in their own namespace. Wait, but the subparsers are part of the main parser's structure. So perhaps the first step is to parse the main parser's arguments (the global ones), then check which subcommand was used, and then parse the subcommand's arguments separately. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, perhaps the main parser has a subparsers, and when you parse the args, the subcommand's name is in the namespace. Then, the function can loop through the subparsers, and for each, if it's the selected command, parse the arguments again using that subparser's parser. But that seems redundant.

Alternatively, the subparsers can be set up so that each subparser's arguments are stored in a separate namespace. Wait, but that's not possible with the standard argparse. The usual way is that the subparsers' arguments are in the same namespace as the main parser's.

Hmm, perhaps the function is designed to have the main parser with some global args, and then each subparser has their own, and the dict has 'global' as the main's namespace and the subparser name as their own namespace. But how to separate them?

Wait, maybe the function uses the parents option. For example, each subparser can have the main parser's arguments as parents, but then each subparser's arguments are stored in their own namespace. But I'm not sure that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the function is structured so that the main parser has some arguments, then the subparsers are created, and each subparser has their own set of arguments. When the user runs the script with a subcommand, the main parser's arguments are parsed first, then the subcommand's arguments. The returned dict would have 'global' as the main's parsed args, and the subcommand's name as the parsed args for that subcommand.

But how to do that in code?

Wait, let me try to think of code structure. The function has to set up the parser, add subparsers, and then parse the arguments. The problem is that the function must return a dictionary with the subparser's name and the global key. Let me see:

The main parser will have some global arguments. The subparsers will each have their own. The result of parsing the entire command line will have the global args plus the subcommand's args. To split into the dict, perhaps 'global' is the main parser's arguments, and the subcommand's name is the subparser's arguments. But how to get the subcommand's arguments as a separate namespace?

Ah, here's an idea. The main parser will have a subparsers object, and each subparser is an instance of a parser. The dest is set so that we can know which subparser was used. So, when you parse the args, you get the command name. Then, the function can create a dictionary where the 'global' key is the main parser's namespace (excluding the subcommand-specific arguments?), and the subcommand's key is the namespace from the subparser's own parser. Wait, but how do you get the subparser's own parser's namespace?

Alternatively, maybe the main parser is used to parse all the arguments except the subcommand's specific ones, and then the subcommand's parser is used to parse the arguments after the subcommand. But that requires splitting the args.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

First, create the main parser and add global arguments. Then create the subparsers, with a dest to indicate which command was used. Then parse the arguments to get the command name. Once you know the command, you can get the corresponding subparser (each subparser has a parser object stored in the subparsers list?), and then parse the arguments again for the subparser's specific ones.

Wait, but how do you get the subparser's parser instance? Because when you add a subparser with add_parser('cmd'), it returns the subparser parser. Maybe store them in a dictionary as they are added. But since the function is supposed to parse the given arguments, perhaps the setup of the subparsers is fixed within the function. Or maybe the user expects that the function can handle any subparsers, but that's unlikely because the code has to be generated here.

Wait, the function's signature is def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):. So the arguments are passed as a list, probably the sys.argv[1:].

The function must create the necessary parsers and subparsers, parse the arguments, and return the dict.

Hmm, perhaps the code structure is:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    # Add global arguments here
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', ...)
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    # Create subparsers for each possible command, but in this case, the function is generic?
    # Wait, but how can the function know which subparsers to add? Unless the code here defines the subparsers as part of the function.

Wait, but the problem is that the function's docstring doesn't mention any specific arguments. So maybe the function is designed to be a helper that parses the arguments into a structure that includes the subcommand's arguments as a separate namespace. But that requires knowing the possible subcommands and their arguments. Since the function is supposed to be generic, perhaps the code here is just setting up the parser with some subparsers, but that's not possible without knowing the subcommands.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to handle the case where the main parser has subparsers, and the return dict is mapping each subparser's name to their parsed namespace. But if the user only provided one subcommand, then the other subparsers would not have any arguments. Or maybe the 'global' is the main parser's arguments, and the subparser name is the subcommand's arguments.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the standard approach.

Typically, when using subparsers, the main parser's arguments are parsed first, then the subcommand is found, and the corresponding subparser parses the rest. The result is a single namespace. So perhaps the function's dict is just returning the main namespace under 'global', and the subparser's name as another key pointing to the same namespace? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the function's return value is such that 'global' contains the main parser's arguments, and the subparser's name has the specific arguments. To do that, perhaps after parsing the entire command line, the function splits the namespace into two parts. For example, the main parser's arguments are in the 'global' part, and the subparser's arguments are under the subparser's name.

Alternatively, perhaps the function uses the parse_known_args method. Let me think: the main parser parses the global arguments, then the subcommand is known. Then, the subparser's parser can parse the remaining arguments, so the 'global' would have the global args, and the subcommand's parser would have their own. But how to do this.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

- Create the main parser, add global arguments, then add a subparsers.
- The subparsers need to have a dest (like 'command') so that we can know which one was used.
- Then, when parsing, first call parse_known_args on the main parser. This gives the global arguments and the remaining args (which include the command and its arguments).
- The command is determined from the parsed args (the dest value).
- Then, find the subparser for that command (maybe by iterating through the subparsers actions in the main parser's _subparsers action? Or perhaps via a registry.
Wait, but the subparsers are stored in the parser's _subparsers attribute. Alternatively, each subparser's parser can be stored in a dictionary when they are created.

Wait, perhaps in the code, the function will set up the parser with subparsers for different commands. But since the function is supposed to be a general one, maybe the subparsers are predefined here. But the problem is that the user hasn't specified any particular subcommands or their arguments. So maybe the code provided here is just a template, but the function must be written as per the given signature and docstring.

Wait, the problem says "Given command-line arguments with which this script was invoked, parse the arguments and return them as a dict..." So the function is to parse the arguments given, but how are the subparsers defined? Maybe the function is supposed to be part of a script that defines the subparsers in the function, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to parse the arguments into a structure where the 'global' key contains all the non-subparser arguments, and each subparser's name is a key with their own arguments. But to do that, the function would need to have a way to separate the arguments. 

Hmm, maybe the function uses the parse_known_args on the main parser first, then based on the command found, uses the corresponding subparser to parse the rest. Let me try to outline the code steps.

First, create the main parser and add any global arguments. Then, add a subparsers container. Each subparser is added with add_parser, specifying their name and arguments. The dest for the subparsers should be set so that the command is known.

Wait, the standard way to set up a subparser is:

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command', help='sub-command help')

Then, for each subcommand:

subparser = subparsers.add_parser('add', ...)
subparser.add_argument(...)

So when you parse, the 'command' attribute tells you which subparser was used. The arguments for the subparser are part of the main namespace.

Therefore, to create the dict, perhaps the 'global' part is the main parser's arguments (excluding the command and the subparser's arguments?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the 'global' key contains all the arguments except those from the subparsers, and the subparser's key contains the arguments specific to that subcommand.

Wait, but that would require separating the arguments. Maybe the main parser's arguments are stored in 'global', and the subparser's arguments are stored in their own key. So the function would parse the main parser first, get the command, then parse the subcommand's arguments.

Wait, here's a possible code outline:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    # Add global arguments here. Let's say, for example, a --verbose flag.
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', ...)
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    # The subparsers are created here, but in the problem statement, the function must parse the arguments given. 
    # Wait, but how can the function know which subparsers to create? Because the user hasn't provided that info. 
    # Maybe the function is designed to work with a predefined set of subparsers within the function?

Ah, perhaps the function is supposed to create the subparsers in its own code. But the docstring says nothing about that. The function's job is to parse the arguments provided, but to do that, it must have a structure. So maybe the code here defines the subparsers as part of the function's setup. But since the user hasn't specified any particular subcommands, maybe the code is just a generic example, but the problem requires that the code works as described.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the command name as one of the keys, and the 'global' key for the main's arguments. So the code would be something like:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', ...)

    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    # Need to add subparsers here. But how? Since it's a function, maybe it's up to the user to define them elsewhere? Wait, no. The function must parse the arguments given, so the subparsers must be added within the function.

Wait, this is confusing. The problem's function signature and docstring don't specify any particular arguments or subcommands, so perhaps the code is supposed to set up a parser with subparsers but in a way that can handle any subcommands? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to parse the arguments into a dictionary where the keys are the subparsers' names, and the value is the namespace for that subparser's arguments. But since only one subparser is used, the other keys would not exist. The 'global' key would hold the main parser's arguments.

Wait, but how can you get the subparser's arguments as a separate namespace? Because normally, the subparser's arguments are part of the main namespace. The only way is to have each subparser's arguments be in a separate Namespace, but that requires creating a separate parser for each subcommand and parsing them individually.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is:

- The main parser parses the global arguments and the command. 
- Then, the command's subparser is determined. 
- The subparser's parser is then used to parse the arguments after the command. 
- The 'global' part is the result of the main parser's known args, and the subcommand's part is the parsed args from the subparser's parser.

Wait, let me try to write code for that.

First, create the main parser, add global arguments, and a subparsers object with dest 'command'.

Then, parse the args with the main parser using parse_known_args. The known args would include the global args and the command, and the unknown would include the command's arguments and any others. But the command is known, so maybe the unknown is the rest.

Wait, perhaps:

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--verbose', action='store_true')
subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')

# Add subparsers for each command. For example, let's say there is an 'add' and 'delete' command.
subparser_add = subparsers.add_parser('add')
subparser_add.add_argument('file', type=str)
subparser_delete = subparsers.add_parser('delete')
subparser_delete.add_argument('file', type=str)

Then, when the user runs with 'add somefile', the parsed args would have 'command' as 'add', and the 'file' argument in the namespace.

So the returned dict would have 'global' as the Namespace containing the global args (like verbose), and 'add' as the Namespace containing the file argument. But how to get that?

Wait, the main parser's parse would give a namespace with all the parsed arguments, including the command and the subcommand's arguments. So the 'global' key would have all the main parser's arguments (including the command?), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the 'global' would be the main parser's arguments except the command, and the subparser's key would have the subcommand's arguments plus the command? Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the 'global' key is the parsed arguments from the main parser, and the subparser's name is the parsed arguments from that subparser's parser. But to do that, after finding the command name, you can get the corresponding subparser's parser (like, stored in a dictionary when you added them), and then parse the subcommand's arguments.

Wait, here's a possible code structure:

First, create a main parser with global arguments and a subparsers object. The subparsers are added, and each has their own arguments. The dest is set so that we can know which command was used. Then, after parsing, the command is known. Then, the subparsers are stored in a dictionary (maybe a local one in the function), so you can get the subparser's parser by name. Then, the arguments after the command can be parsed with that subparser's parser.

Wait, but how do you split the arguments? The command is the first one after the main parser's arguments, so the unparsed_arguments would be split into the global part and the subcommand part.

Alternatively, the function could do:

- Parse the main parser with parse_known_args. The known args include the global ones and the command (if it's a subparser). The unknown args are the rest.
- Then, if the command is present, get the corresponding subparser's parser (stored in a dict), and parse the unknown args (excluding the command?) with that parser.
- So, the 'global' namespace would have the global arguments, and the subcommand's namespace would have the subcommand's arguments.

Wait, let's see step by step.

Suppose the input arguments are ['add', 'somefile', '--verbose'].

The main parser would parse '--verbose' as a global arg, and 'add' as the command. The unknown args would be ['somefile'] (since 'add' is part of the known command, but the rest are unknown to the main parser). Wait, no. The main parser knows that the first argument after the global args is the command. So the known args would include 'command' as 'add', and the unknown would be ['somefile'].

Then, the subparser for 'add' is known, so we can take the unknown args and pass them to that subparser's parser. But the subparser's parser includes the 'add' command, so maybe we need to exclude the command from the unknown args.

Wait, perhaps the code would look like this:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', help='A global argument', required=False)
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    subparser_dict = {}
    
    # Example subparsers (but the problem says the function must be generic, so maybe these are fixed here?)
    # Wait, the problem doesn't mention any specific subcommands, so perhaps the code must handle any subparsers, but that's impossible. 

Wait, this is the crux: the function's docstring doesn't specify any particular subparsers or their arguments. So the code provided must be a generic function that can parse arguments given a setup where the main parser has a subparsers with a dest, and each subparser has its own arguments. But how can the function be written without knowing the subparsers? It can't. So maybe the function is part of a script where the subparsers are added elsewhere, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to return a dictionary where 'global' is the namespace from the main parser (without any subparsers), and each subparser's name maps to their own namespace. But that would require that the subparsers are part of the main parser's setup.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting that the function creates a parser with subparsers, and the return value is a dict where the key is the subparser's name (from dest), and the value is the namespace for that subparser. The 'global' key would hold the main parser's arguments (excluding the subcommand's arguments). But how to separate that?

Alternatively, maybe the 'global' part is the main parser's arguments (before the subcommand), and the subcommand's name is the arguments after the subcommand. But that requires splitting the arguments into two parts: the global ones, and the subcommand's ones.

Hmm, here's an idea:

The main parser is created with global arguments. Then, a subparsers is added with dest='command'. When parsing the entire arguments using parse_args, the command is known. Then, the function can collect the arguments into the dict by checking which command was used. The main namespace includes all arguments, so the 'global' would be the main's namespace, but perhaps the subcommand's namespace is the main's namespace minus the global parts?

Alternatively, perhaps the code is structured as follows:

- The main parser parses the global arguments and the command.
- The subparsers are stored in a dictionary (maybe a local variable in the function) so that when the command is known, you can retrieve the subparser's parser (the one that was added for that command) and parse the rest of the arguments with it. 

Wait, that makes sense. Let's try to code that.

First, create the main parser and add global arguments. Then, create a subparsers container. When adding each subparser, also store the subparser's parser in a dictionary (like subparser_dict) with their name as the key. Then, when parsing, first get the command from the main parser's known arguments. Then, the subcommand's parser is retrieved from the subparser_dict, and the remaining arguments (excluding the command) are parsed with it. The result is a dict where 'global' is the main parser's parsed args (without the command?), and the subcommand's name is the parsed args from the subparser's parser.

Wait, let's see code steps:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', help='Global argument', required=False)
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    subparser_dict = {}
    
    # Add subparsers here. For example, let's say there's an 'add' command:
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('file', type=str)
    subparser_dict['add'] = add_parser
    
    # Similarly for other commands. But in the problem's case, maybe the function is supposed to have some predefined subparsers?
    # Or perhaps the function is written in a way that it can handle any subparsers added to the main parser?

Wait, but the problem's function must be able to parse the arguments given, but the code can't know what subparsers exist unless they are defined in the function. That suggests that the code here must define the subparsers within the function. However, the problem's docstring doesn't mention any specific subcommands, so that's not possible. Therefore, maybe the function is written in a way that it's part of a larger script where the subparsers are added before calling this function, but that's not the case here. The function has to do everything.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the minimal code that can achieve this. The function must return a dict with keys 'global' and the subparser names. So, perhaps the main parser's parsed arguments (without the subcommand's specific arguments) are the 'global' part, and the subcommand's part is stored under its name. But how?

Alternatively, the 'global' key contains all the arguments except the ones from the subparser, and the subparser's key contains its own arguments. But that would require knowing which arguments belong to the subparser. 

Wait, perhaps the function uses the following approach:

- The main parser has a subparsers with a dest 'command', so that after parsing, the command is known.
- The main parser's parsed args (from parse_known_args) would include the global arguments and the command, but not the subcommand's arguments.
- Then, the subcommand's parser is found from the subparsers (maybe via the subparsers.choices dictionary), and the rest of the arguments (excluding the command) are parsed with that parser.
- So the global_namespace is the main parser's parsed args (without the subcommand's arguments?), and the subcommand's namespace is parsed from the remaining arguments.

Wait, here's a possible code outline:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    # Add global arguments here
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    subparsers_dict = {}
    for name, subparser in subparsers.choices.items():
        subparsers_dict[name] = subparser
    
    # Now, parse the main arguments
    args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    # Create the global namespace
    namespaces = {'global': args}
    
    # Check if a command was provided
    if args.command:
        # Get the subparser for the command
        subparser = subparsers_dict.get(args.command)
        if subparser:
            # Parse the remaining arguments with the subparser
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            # If the command isn't found in subparsers_dict, maybe raise an error or handle it
            pass
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but the subparsers.choices is a dictionary of the subparsers added. So when you call subparsers.add_parser('add'), it adds an entry in choices with 'add' as the key and the parser as the value. So in the function, after parsing the main args, you can get the command from args.command, then retrieve the subparser from subparsers.choices and parse the remaining arguments (excluding the command itself?).

Wait, but the remaining arguments would include the command's name? Because the main parser parses the command as part of its known args, so the remaining would be the arguments after the command. Let me think:

Suppose the unparsed_arguments are ['add', '--file', 'test.txt']. 

The main parser parses '--global-arg' if present, and the command is 'add'. The remaining would be ['--file', 'test.txt'].

So the subparser for 'add' is retrieved, and then parse those remaining arguments with that subparser. The subparser's namespace would have the 'file' argument.

But the main parser's args already include the 'command' field. So the global namespace has 'command' and any global args, while the subparser's namespace has the subcommand's arguments. The returned dict would have 'global' pointing to the main's namespace (including command), and 'add' pointing to the subparser's parsed arguments (without the command, but with the file argument).

Wait, but the subparser's parser would include the command as part of the subparser's own arguments? Or no, because the command is the first argument after the main parser's arguments. The subparser's parser would have their own arguments, so when you call subparser.parse_args(remaining), the 'file' is parsed.

But how do you exclude the command from the remaining? Because the command is part of the main parser's known arguments, so the remaining would not include it. Let me see:

When you call parser.parse_known_args(), the known arguments are those that the main parser knows. The command is part of the known (since the main parser has the subparsers with a dest). So the remaining would be the arguments that the main parser doesn't know, which are the subcommand's arguments.

Wait, but in the example, the main parser knows the command (since it's part of the subparsers), so the remaining would not include 'add', but would include the rest. So that's correct.

Wait, in the example ['add', '--file', 'test.txt'], the main parser would parse 'add' as the command (dest='command'), and the remaining arguments would be ['--file', 'test.txt'].

So then, the subparser for 'add' is the one with the 'file' argument. So parsing the remaining with that subparser would give the 'file' argument. 

But the main namespace has the 'command' field set to 'add', but no 'file' field. The subparser's namespace would have 'file' as 'test.txt'.

Thus, the dict would have:

'global' : Namespace(global_arg=False, command='add')

'add' : Namespace(file='test.txt')

Wait, but the subparsers' own parsers might have their own arguments. So in that case, the 'add' parser's arguments would be parsed into a separate namespace, which is then added to the dict.

Yes, that seems to be a way. So the code would need to:

- Use the main parser to parse the global arguments and the command (using parse_known_args).
- The 'global' key in the dict is the main parser's args.
- Then, if there is a command, find the subparser for that command (from subparsers.choices), and parse the remaining arguments (without the command?) with that subparser. But wait, the remaining includes the arguments after the command. The subparser's parser knows that the first argument is the command, but when parsing the remaining, maybe the command isn't there. 

Wait, in the example, the main parser parses the command (the first argument 'add'), so the remaining arguments are the ones after that. The subparser's parser (for 'add') would have its own set of arguments, but when parsing, the remaining arguments (like '--file' and 'test.txt') are given. So that should work.

Wait, but the subparser's parser may also have required arguments. For example, the 'add' subparser requires a 'file' argument. So when the user provides the command and its arguments, that's okay. But if they don't, then the subparser.parse_args would raise an error. But the function is supposed to parse the arguments, so that's handled by argparse.

So the code would look something like this. But in the function, the subparsers are added with their own arguments. Wait, but in the problem's function, the user hasn't specified any subcommands. So how can the code know what subparsers to add?

Ah, here's the problem. The function's docstring doesn't mention any specific subparsers, so the code must be written in a way that the subparsers are part of the function's setup. But since the problem requires generating the code, perhaps the code is supposed to have a setup where the main parser has a subparsers with a dest, and the subparsers are added in the function, but without knowing any specifics. That's not possible unless the function is designed to accept any subcommands and their arguments. But I think the problem expects that the function creates the necessary parsers and subparsers, and returns the dict accordingly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to return the main parser's namespace as 'global', and the subparser's name (from the dest) as another key pointing to the same namespace. But that's redundant. 

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem's function is supposed to return a dict mapping subparser names (or "global") to a namespace. The "global" probably refers to the main parser's namespace, and each subparser's name is the key for their own parsed arguments. But how?

Wait, perhaps the 'global' key is for any arguments not part of the subparsers. But that's unclear. The function's docstring says "parse the arguments and return them as a dict mapping from subparser name (or 'global') to an argparse.Namespace instance."

Ah! So each subparser's name is a key, and their arguments are the namespace. The 'global' key holds the main parser's arguments. Wait, but the main parser's arguments are parsed first, then the subcommand's arguments are part of the same namespace. So how to separate them?

Alternatively, perhaps the main parser's arguments are parsed into one namespace, and the subcommand's arguments are parsed into another. The 'global' key would have the first, and the subparser's name the second. 

So here's the plan:

- Create the main parser with global arguments. 
- Create a subparsers container with dest='command'. 
- Parse the main parser's arguments (without the subcommand's arguments) to get the command name and the global args. 
- Then, the subcommand's parser is retrieved from subparsers.choices, and the arguments after the command are parsed with that parser, creating a new namespace. 
- The main namespace (from the main parser) is stored under 'global', and the subcommand's namespace is stored under its name. 

Wait, but the subparsers are part of the main parser, so their arguments are already in the main namespace. So maybe the function's dict is just a way to separate the global and the subcommand's arguments. For example, the 'global' namespace has only the main's arguments (without the command's specific ones), and the subcommand's namespace has only its own arguments. But that requires splitting the arguments into two parts.

Hmm, perhaps the 'global' is the main parser's parsed arguments, and the subcommand's name is the parsed arguments for the subcommand. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses the parse_known_args method for the main parser, then parses the remaining arguments for the subcommand. Let's try:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', help='Global argument', required=False)
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Create a subparser (for example, 'add')
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str, required=True)
    
    # Parse the main arguments to get the command
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            # Maybe raise an error if the command isn't found?
            pass
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but in this code, the 'add_parser' is hardcoded here. The problem's function is supposed to be a generic function, but in the code provided, the subparsers would have to be created here. But the function's docstring doesn't mention any specific subcommands, so this can't be right. 

Hmm, maybe the problem expects that the function is written to return the main parser's namespace under 'global', and the subcommand's arguments are stored in a separate namespace under the subcommand's name. But to do that, the code must create the subparsers in the function, but without knowing what they are. That's impossible. 

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting that the function uses a parser with subparsers, and the return is a dict where the key is the subparser's name (the dest's value) and the value is the namespace. But how would the 'global' come into play?

Alternatively, maybe 'global' is a special case where if no subcommand is provided, then the global namespace is the only one. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to return all the subparsers' namespaces, but only the one that was used will have non-default values. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the 'global' key is for the main parser's arguments except the command, and the subparser's key is for their own arguments. But how to split that?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is designed to have the main parser and subparsers, and the returned dict has 'global' as the main's namespace, and the subparsers' names as keys with their own namespaces. But to do that, the function must know all possible subparsers and parse their arguments even if they weren't used, but that's not efficient.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the subparser names or "global". The value for "global" is the main parser's arguments. The value for a subparser name is the arguments parsed by that subparser. 

Wait, perhaps the function is using a nested parser structure where the main parser has some global arguments, and each subparser has their own, and the function returns the main's namespace as 'global' and the subparser's namespace as their key. But how?

Wait, maybe each subparser is added with a separate namespace. For example, the main parser parses the global arguments and the command, and then the subparsers parse their own arguments into their own namespaces. But that's not how argparse works normally. The usual way is that all arguments are in a single namespace.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses a parent parser for the global arguments and the command, then each subparser uses that parent. But then the subparser's arguments are in the same namespace.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting that the function creates a parser with subparsers, and the returned dict has two entries: 'global' and the subcommand's name. The 'global' is the parsed args from the main parser (without the subcommand's arguments), and the subcommand's name is the parsed args from the subparser's parser (excluding the global ones). But how?

Wait, here's another idea. The main parser's arguments are parsed first, then the subcommand is found. The subparser's arguments are parsed separately, so the dict would have 'global' as the main's parsed arguments (excluding the command?), and the subcommand's name as the parsed arguments for the subcommand. But how to do that?

Maybe the main parser is used to parse the global arguments and the command, then the subcommand's arguments are parsed using its own parser. So:

main_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
main_parser.add_argument('--global-arg', ...)
subparsers = main_parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')

# add subparsers here, for example, add and delete.

# parse the main arguments to get the command and global args:
main_args, remaining = main_parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)

# then, create a subcommand parser (like the one added for 'add') and parse the remaining args:
subcommand = main_args.command
if subcommand:
    subparser = subparsers.choices[subcommand]
    sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining)
    namespaces = {'global': main_args, subcommand: sub_args}
else:
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}

But in this case, the subcommand's arguments would be in the sub_args, and the main_args would have the global and the command. So the dict would have two keys: 'global' and the command name. The command's namespace would have its own arguments. The 'global' would include the command field. 

Wait, but the remaining args after parsing the main would exclude the command. Or does it include it?

Wait, let me think again. When we call main_parser.parse_known_args, the main parser knows about the command (since it's part of the subparsers with dest='command'). So the first element of unparsed_arguments (the command name) is parsed into main_args.command. The remaining would be the arguments after the command. So when we parse the subcommand's parser, we can pass those remaining arguments, and the subcommand's parser will parse them, but the command's name is not part of the remaining arguments. 

Wait, for example, if the input is ['add', '--file', 'test.txt'], then the main_parser's parse_known_args would give main_args.command = 'add', and remaining would be ['--file', 'test.txt'].

Then the subparser for 'add' is used to parse the remaining, so sub_args would have the 'file' argument. The 'global' namespace has the main's parsed arguments (including the command), but the subcommand's namespace has only its own arguments.

So the dict would have 'global' pointing to the main namespace (with --global-arg and command), and 'add' pointing to the sub's namespace (with file). 

But the problem's docstring says that the function returns a dict mapping from subparser name (or "global") to an argparse.Namespace instance. So this seems to fit.

But the problem is that in the function's code, the subparsers have to be added. Since the problem's function is supposed to be generic, but the code must be generated, perhaps the code provided in the function is a template with some example subparsers, but the user expects that the function can be used as is. Or maybe the code is supposed to have the subparsers setup in the function.

Alternatively, maybe the function uses the 'parents' feature. For example, each subparser can have their own parser, and the main parser's arguments are stored in the 'global' key, and each subparser's arguments are stored under their name. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'global' key is for the main parser's arguments except the subcommand, and the subcommand's key holds its own arguments. But that requires filtering out the command.

Wait, the problem's function must parse the arguments and return the dict. The code must be written such that when you run the script with a subcommand, the subcommand's arguments are parsed and stored in their own namespace, and the main's global arguments are stored under 'global'.

So the code structure would be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    # Add global arguments here
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    subparsers_dict = {}
    
    # Add subparsers. For example:
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    subparsers_dict['add'] = add_parser
    
    # parse the main parser to get the command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    # create the global namespace
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers_dict.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            # parse the remaining arguments with the subparser's parser
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            # handle invalid command?
            pass
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but in this case, the subparsers_dict must be filled with the subparsers added. But in the code I wrote, the function has to add the subparsers (like 'add' and 'delete') within the function. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention any specific subparsers. 

Hmm, this suggests that the code provided in the function must set up the subparsers with their own arguments. Since the user hasn't provided any specifics, perhaps the code is supposed to have a generic setup, but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to return the main's namespace under 'global', and if a subcommand was used, then the subcommand's name is also a key pointing to the same namespace. But that's not the case, because the main namespace already includes all the arguments.

Wait, perhaps the 'global' key is the main parser's parsed arguments, and the subparser's name is the parsed arguments from the subparser's own parser. But how to do that?

Wait, in the code example I have above, the subparsers_dict is built by adding each subparser's parser. The code inside the function adds the 'add' parser as an example. But in the problem's context, the function must be able to handle any subparsers that are added in the function. So maybe the code is written with a placeholder, but the problem expects that the code includes some example subparsers. Or perhaps the problem expects that the subparsers are not predefined, and the function can somehow retrieve them from the main parser's subparsers.

Wait, the subparsers are stored in subparsers.choices, so perhaps the code can loop through the subparsers.choices to get the subparsers and their names. Let me try that.

So modifying the code:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # parse the main args to get the command
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        # Get the subparser's parser from the subparsers.choices dict
        subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            # Parse the remaining arguments with the subparser's parser
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            # The command exists but there's no subparser? That shouldn't happen
            pass
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but this requires that the subparsers are added before parsing. So in the function's code, the subparsers must be added. But in the code above, the 'add_parser' is not present. So unless the code in the function adds the subparsers, it won't work. 

Hmm, maybe the problem expects that the function is part of a script where the subparsers are added elsewhere, but since the function must be self-contained, the code must include the setup of subparsers. But the docstring doesn't specify any, so perhaps the code is to set up a parser with subparsers, but the actual subcommands are not specified here, and the function can handle any that are added. 

Wait, but in the code above, if you don't add any subparsers, then subparsers.choices would be empty, and the code would fail. So the function must have some subparsers added in its own code. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the main parser's namespace under 'global', and if a subparser was used, then the command's name is also a key, but pointing to the same namespace. But that's not helpful. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The function's name is parse_arguments, and the return is a dict. The standard approach is to use a subparser with a dest, so that the command is known. The resulting namespace includes all the parsed arguments. The function's return could just have the 'global' key mapping to the entire namespace. But the docstring says "subparser name (or 'global')", implying that there are multiple keys. So maybe the 'global' is for the main parser's arguments, and the subparser's name is for the subcommand's arguments. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'global' is a separate parser, and the subparsers are another parser. But that's not how it's done.

Wait, perhaps the 'global' key is for the arguments that are not part of any subparser, and the subparsers' keys are for their own arguments. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function is using a parser with subparsers, and each subparser's arguments are stored in a separate namespace. To do this, each subparser's add_argument is stored in a separate namespace. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function uses the 'parents' argument when adding subparsers, but that's for sharing common arguments. 

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to have the main parser parse the global arguments and the command. The subparsers are added in the function, but as the problem's function's docstring says, "given command-line arguments", perhaps the function is supposed to handle a scenario where the main parser has global args, and each subparser has their own, and the dict includes both the main's global args and the subcommand's args under their own key. 

Wait, but in the example code I wrote earlier, the 'global' key would have the main's namespace (including the command), and the subcommand's key would have the sub's parsed arguments. The main's namespace includes all the parsed arguments, including the subcommand's. So the dict would have 'global' pointing to the full namespace, and the subcommand's key pointing to a namespace with only their own arguments. 

But how to get that?

Wait, when you do subparser.parse_args(remaining), the resulting namespace will have the arguments from the subcommand. The main's namespace already has the global and the command. So in the example, the 'global' namespace would have 'global-arg' and 'command', while the 'add' namespace has 'file'. 

Yes, that's possible. So the code would need to setup the subparsers with their own arguments inside the function. But since the problem's function is supposed to be generic, maybe the code is written with some example subparsers. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem's function is part of a larger script, and the subparsers are added before calling this function. But the function is supposed to be self-contained.

Hmm, perhaps the function is designed to return a dictionary where 'global' is the main parser's arguments, and the subparsers' names are keys pointing to their own parsed arguments. So the main parser and subparsers are all part of the function's setup.

Wait, but in that case, the function must define the subparsers and their arguments. Since the problem's docstring doesn't specify any, perhaps the code is just a template, but the user wants the code to structure it such that the subparsers are added in the function, and the dict is built accordingly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the 'global' key holds the main parser's arguments (without the subcommand's), and the subcommand's key holds the subcommand's arguments. To do this, the main parser's arguments are parsed first, then the subcommand's parser is used on the remaining arguments. The subcommand's parser must not include the global arguments. 

Ah, that's probably the right approach. So the main parser has the global arguments plus the subparsers. The subparsers' parsers don't have the global arguments, so when parsing the remaining arguments, those are only the subcommand's arguments, not including the global ones. 

So the code would be:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Create subparsers for each possible command
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    delete_parser = subparsers.add_parser('delete')
    delete_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    # parse the main to get command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices[main_args.command]
        sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
        namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but in this code, the subparsers are hard-coded as 'add' and 'delete'. But the problem's docstring doesn't mention these. So perhaps the function is supposed to be a generic function that can handle any subparsers added by the user. But how can that be done in the function's code?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the function is written with the subparsers being added within the function, but with a way to allow any subcommands. But that's not possible unless the function is passed some information about the subparsers, which it isn't.

Hmm, perhaps the function is intended to return the main's namespace as 'global', and the subcommand's name is also a key pointing to the same namespace. But then the dict would have two keys pointing to the same object, which is not useful.

Alternatively, maybe the 'global' key is for the arguments not part of any subparser, and the subparser's key is for the subcommand's arguments. So the main parser parses the global args and the command. The subparsers are added, each with their own arguments. The subcommand's arguments are parsed into their own namespace using the subparsers' parser, and the dict combines them. 

Wait, in this case, the 'global' namespace would have the main's parsed arguments (including the command), and the subcommand's namespace has the subcommand's arguments. 

But the problem's function must return a dict where each subparser's name is a key, but also 'global' is a key. So the code must have the subparsers setup. 

Since the problem doesn't specify any particular subcommands or their arguments, perhaps the code is a minimal example where the main parser and a single subparser are added. Or maybe the code just uses the subparsers.choices to loop through all possible subparsers and parse their arguments, but that would require knowing which ones are present.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects that the function returns a dictionary where the 'global' key holds the main parser's arguments (excluding the subcommand's specific arguments) and the subcommand's name holds the subcommand's specific arguments. To do that, you can split the arguments into two parts.

Wait, here's another idea. The main parser has global arguments and the subparsers with dest. When you call parser.parse_args(), the result has all the arguments. To separate them, perhaps the 'global' part is all the arguments except those from the subparsers. But how?

Alternatively, the 'global' part is the arguments that were parsed by the main parser (before the subparsers), and the subparsers' arguments are parsed by their own parsers. So the main parser's arguments are stored in 'global', and the subcommand's name is stored with their own parsed arguments. 

Yes, that's the approach I had before. So in code, the main parser parses the global and the command, then the subcommand's parser parses the remaining args into its own namespace. 

The problem is that the code must define the subparsers. But since the function is supposed to be generic, maybe the code uses a parent parser for the global arguments and a subparser that inherits from it. Wait, but the function's return is a dict. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the function is structured to return a dictionary with 'global' as the main parser's namespace, and the subcommand's name as the parsed arguments from the subcommand's parser. 

So putting this all together, the code would look like:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    subparsers_dict = {}
    
    # Add subparsers here. For example, let's add an 'add' subparser.
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    subparsers_dict['add'] = add_parser
    
    # parse the main to get the command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers_dict.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            # handle if command not in subparsers_dict
            pass
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but this code is specific to 'add'. The problem's function doesn't mention any subcommands. So this can't be the right approach. 

Hmm, maybe the problem is expecting that the function uses the 'command' dest and the subparsers' names are the keys. So the code can retrieve all subparsers from the main parser's subparsers.choices and process them, but only the one that was used is stored.

Wait, here's a better approach:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    # Add global arguments here
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # parse the main parser to get the command
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            # command not found
            pass
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but in this case, the subparsers must have been added before parsing. So in the function, we need to add the subparsers. But the problem's function doesn't specify any, so perhaps the code is written with an example, but the user expects that the function can be used with any subparsers added. 

Wait, perhaps the code doesn't add any subparsers, but the function's return is structured such that if a command is present, it's parsed. But without knowing the subparsers, that's impossible. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem's intended solution is to use the 'parents' feature and separate namespaces. Alternatively, maybe the 'global' is a separate parser, and the subparsers are another. 

Wait, perhaps the function is using two separate parsers: one for global arguments, and another for the subcommands. 

Like:

global_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
global_parser.add_argument('--global-arg', ...)

subparsers = global_parser.add_subparsers()
Wait, no. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function creates a main parser for global arguments, and then each subcommand is parsed separately. But that requires splitting the arguments between the global and subcommand parts. 

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think of the standard way. The usual way with subparsers is that the main parser has some args, then the command is parsed, and the subparser's args are parsed into the same namespace. So the return dict would have 'global' as the entire namespace, and the command name as a key pointing to the same object. But that's not useful.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'global' key is the main parser's arguments, and the subcommand's key is their own. But the subcommand's parser must not include the global arguments. 

Wait, perhaps the main parser and the subparsers are separate. For example:

The main parser parses the global arguments and the command. The subparsers are added to the main parser, and each has their own arguments. Then, after determining the command, the subparsers' parser is used to parse the remaining arguments (excluding the global ones), and the result is stored under their name. 

Wait, but how to split the arguments into global and command parts. The parse_known_args method can be used to get the global and the command, then the remaining are parsed by the subparser.

Yes, the code I had earlier is correct, but it requires adding the subparsers in the function. However, the problem's function is supposed to be generic, but since there's no info, perhaps the code is just an example with some subparsers. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to return the main parser's namespace under 'global', and the subparser's name as another key pointing to the same namespace. But that's redundant.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting that the function returns the main parser's namespace under 'global', and if a subcommand is used, then the subcommand's name is another key pointing to the same namespace. But that's not what the docstring says. The docstring says "map from subparser name (or 'global') to an argparse.Namespace instance". So each subparser's name (if used) is a key, and the 'global' is also a key. 

Wait, maybe the 'global' is for the arguments that are not part of any subparser. But that would be the known args from the main parser. The subparsers' args are part of the main's namespace. So the dict would have 'global' as the main's namespace, and the command name as a key pointing to a new namespace with the subcommand's arguments.

Wait, but how to get the subcommand's arguments as a separate namespace. 

Maybe the code should be written as:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Add a subparser for 'add'
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    # parse the main to get the command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        # Get the subparser's parser
        subparser = subparsers.choices[main_args.command]
        # Now parse the remaining arguments with the subparser's parser
        sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
        namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but in this case, the 'add_parser' is hard-coded. The function is supposed to be general, but the problem's code must have some example. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written without adding any subparsers, but that would make the function not work as intended. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that the function returns the main's namespace under 'global', and the subcommand's name as another key pointing to the same namespace. But that's not possible, because the namespace is a single object. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'global' key contains the arguments that are not part of any subparser, and the subparser's key contains their own arguments. 

Wait, but how to separate them. The main parser's arguments include the global args and the command. The subcommand's parser parses the remaining arguments (the ones after the command) into its own namespace, which is separate. 

So in the example, the 'global' would have the command and any global args, and the subcommand's key would have their own args. 

Yes, that's the case in the code I wrote earlier. 

So the code would need to define the subparsers within the function. But since the problem doesn't specify any, perhaps the code is written with a placeholder. Or maybe the problem expects that the function's code is written in a way that allows any subparsers, but that's not possible unless the code is written with some subparsers. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is structured to return the main's namespace as 'global', and the subcommand's name as the key with the same namespace. But that's not useful, so probably not. 

Wait, perhaps the 'global' is a separate parser. Like:

global_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(add_help=False)
global_parser.add_argument('--global-arg', ...)

main_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[global_parser])
subparsers = main_parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')

Then, the global args are parsed first, then the subcommand's. But how to get them into a dict.

Alternatively, the code might be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    subparsers_dict = {name: subparser for name, subparser in subparsers.choices.items()}
    
    # parse the main to get command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers_dict.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            # command not found
            pass
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but the subparsers_dict is created from subparsers.choices.items(). However, subparsers.choices is a dictionary of the subparsers that have been added. So in the function's code, if no subparsers are added, this would be empty. 

Therefore, the code must have some subparsers added. But since the problem doesn't specify any, perhaps the code is just a template, and the user is expected to add their own subparsers. However, the function must be self-contained. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the function uses the 'dest' of the subparsers and returns the main's namespace under 'global', and the subcommand's name is also a key that points to the same namespace. But that's not a useful dict.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the minimal code that can achieve the desired dict structure. 

The key points are:

- The main parser has global arguments plus a subparsers with dest='command'.
- The main parser's parse_known_args splits into main_args (including command) and remaining (arguments after the command).
- The subcommand's parser (from subparsers.choices) is used to parse the remaining into a new namespace.
- The dict has 'global' as the main_args and the command name as the sub_args.

This way, the 'global' includes the command and any global args, while the subcommand's namespace has only their specific args. 

So the code would be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # add a subparser for example purposes, but perhaps the problem expects that the subparsers are added in the function.
    # But without knowing what they are, maybe the code just uses the subparsers.choices and doesn't add any in the function. 
    # Wait, but then the subparsers are empty and the code would fail.

Hmm, perhaps the problem assumes that the subparsers are added elsewhere. But since the function must parse the arguments, it's necessary to set up the subparsers. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the main's namespace under 'global', and then any subcommand's arguments are part of the same namespace. So the dict only has 'global' as a key. But the docstring says "subparser name (or 'global')", implying that there can be multiple keys.

Therefore, the function must have at least one subparser added. Maybe the code is written with a single subparser for example, but the user can modify it as needed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the function is written to return the main's namespace as 'global' and also the subcommand's arguments under their own key. 

Wait, maybe the code is as follows:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true', help='Global argument')
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Create a subparser for 'add' as an example
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str, help='File argument')
    
    # Parse the main arguments
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            pass
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but in this code, the add_parser is hard-coded. The function's docstring doesn't mention any subcommands, so perhaps this is not the right approach. 

Hmm, maybe the problem expects that the subparsers are added dynamically, but without any info, I'm stuck. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'global' key is for all the arguments parsed by the main parser (including the command), and the subparser's name is for the command's arguments parsed by the subparser's own parser. So the code is structured as above, but the function is supposed to have the subparsers added in the function. 

Since the problem requires the code to be generated based on the signature and docstring, perhaps the code is supposed to include the setup of subparsers, but in a way that allows for any subcommands. But how? 

Alternatively, perhaps the code uses a parser with subparsers and returns the main's namespace under 'global', and the command's name as a key pointing to the same namespace. But that's redundant. 

Hmm, maybe I should look for the standard way to do this. 

Wait, I recall that when using subparsers, each subparser's arguments are added to the same namespace. So to separate them into a dictionary, perhaps the function can create a dictionary where 'global' is the main parser's arguments (excluding the command?), and the command's name is the parsed arguments for that command. 

Wait, but how to split them. Maybe using the 'default' and 'dest' parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function uses a helper to group the arguments. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: The function returns a dictionary where each subparser's name is a key, and their parsed arguments are stored in a namespace. But since only one subparser is used, the other keys would have empty namespaces, but that's not practical. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting that the 'global' key holds all the arguments except those from the subparser, and the subparser's key holds their arguments. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the 'global' is the parsed arguments from the main parser (without the subparsers' arguments), and the subparsers' arguments are parsed separately. 

Wait, here's a possible solution:

The main parser is created with global arguments and a subparsers. The subparsers have their own arguments. When you parse the main parser, you get the command. The remaining arguments (after the command) are parsed using the subcommand's parser. The 'global' key holds the main's arguments (without the subcommand's specific ones), and the subcommand's key holds their own. 

But to get the main's arguments without the subcommand's, you have to exclude those. 

Alternatively, the main parser only has the global arguments and the subparsers. The subparsers' parsers have their own arguments. So the main's namespace has global and command. The subcommand's parser parses the remaining into a new namespace, which has only the subcommand's arguments. 

Yes, that's what the code I wrote earlier does. 

So the code would have to include at least one subparser. But the problem's docstring doesn't specify any, so perhaps the code is just a template where the user can add their own subparsers. But the function must be self-contained. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that the function is written to return the main's namespace under 'global', and if a subcommand is used, then the subcommand's name is also a key pointing to the same namespace. But that's not possible because the subcommand's arguments are part of the main's namespace. 

Alternatively, the function is supposed to return a dictionary where the 'global' key contains the main parser's arguments (excluding the subcommand's arguments), and the subcommand's name contains the arguments from that subparser. 

But how to get the main's arguments without the subcommand's. The main parser's arguments don't include the subcommand's specific arguments, only the command's name. So 'global' would have the main's namespace (with command and global args), and the subcommand's name would have their own arguments. 

Wait, perhaps the main parser's arguments are the ones before the subcommand, and the subcommand's arguments are parsed separately. So the 'global' part is the main's parsed args (without the subcommand's arguments), and the subcommand's part is their own parsed arguments (without the global ones). 

In that case, the code would need to:

1. Parse the global arguments first, using a parser that only has the global args. The command is part of the global parser's unknowns.
2. Then, parse the command and its arguments using the subparsers. 

Wait, that could be done with two separate parsers. 

Like:

global_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(add_help=False)
global_parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')

main_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[global_parser])
subparsers = main_parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
# add subparsers here

# parse the main parser to get command and global args
main_args, remaining = main_parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)

# then parse the global args into their own namespace
global_namespace, _ = global_parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)

namespaces = {'global': global_namespace}

if main_args.command:
    subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
    sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
    namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args

return namespaces

Wait, but this way the global_namespace would have the global arguments, and the subcommand's namespace has their own. The main's namespace has both the global and the command's arguments. 

Hmm, but the problem's docstring says "parse the arguments and return them as a dict mapping from subparser name (or 'global') to an argparse.Namespace instance". So 'global' would have the global arguments, and the subparser's name would have their own. 

This could be done by having two parsers: one for the global arguments, and another for the subcommands. 

Wait, perhaps the code is structured like this:

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    # Create a global parser
    global_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(add_help=False)
    global_parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    # Create the main parser which includes the global and subparsers
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[global_parser])
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Add example subparsers
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    # Parse the main to get command and the rest
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    # parse global args separately
    global_namespace = global_parser.parse_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': global_namespace}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices[main_args.command]
        sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
        namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
    
    return namespaces

Wait, but this way the global_namespace includes the global args, and the main's arguments include the command and possibly other global ones? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the main parser has the global args and the subparsers. The global_parser is only the global args. So when you parse the main parser, you get the command and any global args. Then, parse the global_parser to get the global args without the command. 

Hmm, but that might not be necessary. 

Alternatively, the 'global' key's namespace contains the global arguments parsed by the global parser, and the subcommand's key contains the subcommand's arguments parsed by their own parser. 

So the code would have:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    # Parse global arguments
    global_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(add_help=False)
    global_parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    # Create main parser that includes the global and subparsers
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[global_parser])
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Add a subparser for 'add' command
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    # Parse the main parser to get the command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    # The global namespace is the parsed global args
    global_namespace = global_parser.parse_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': global_namespace}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
        else:
            pass
    
    return namespaces

But in this case, the main parser includes the global and the subparsers. The global_parser is a parent for the main parser, so that the subparsers don't include the global arguments. 

Wait, but the subparsers are added to the main parser, so their own parsers can have their own arguments. The global_parser is separate. 

Hmm, this might be a way. But again, the function is hard-coding 'add' as a subparser, which isn't specified in the problem. 

Perhaps the problem expects that the function is written in a way that the subparsers are not predefined, but the code uses the subparsers.choices from the main parser's subparsers. 

Wait, but in the code I wrote earlier without adding any subparsers, the subparsers.choices would be empty, so the code would fail. 

Hmm, maybe the problem's function is supposed to be a helper that works with any subparsers added to the main parser, but that requires passing the parser as an argument. But the function signature doesn't do that. 

The function's signature is def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):. So it must create the parser inside.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the minimal code that can achieve the desired output. 

The function must return a dict with keys 'global' and the subparser's name. The 'global' holds the main parser's arguments (without the subcommand's specific ones), and the subparser's name holds their own arguments. 

The code structure would be:

- Create a main parser with global arguments and a subparsers with dest='command'.
- Parse the main to get the command and global args.
- The 'global' entry is the main's parsed arguments (excluding the subcommand's specific args).
- The subcommand's name is a key pointing to a namespace with the subcommand's parsed arguments.

To get the subcommand's parsed arguments, you can use the subparser's parser and parse the remaining args. 

Thus, the code would be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Add some subparsers here, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the code is just a template. 
    # But in the problem's context, the function must be complete. So maybe the code is written without adding any subparsers, and the 'global' is the only key, but that's not right. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written to handle any subparsers that are added to the main parser. But how can that be done without knowing them? 

Wait, perhaps the code uses the subparsers.choices to get all possible subparsers, and for each, parses the arguments. But that would be inefficient and incorrect, since only the command's subparser is needed.

Hmm, perhaps the problem's solution is to return a dictionary with 'global' pointing to the main's namespace, and the command's name pointing to the same namespace. But that's not useful. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'global' key is the main's namespace, and the command's name is also a key that points to the same namespace. 

Wait, but that would mean the dict has two keys pointing to the same object. 

Hmm, maybe the problem is expecting that the function returns the main parser's namespace under 'global', and the subparsers' parsed arguments are also under their own keys. But how?

Wait, perhaps the subparsers are each added with their own dest. Like:

Each subparser has a 'dest' argument, so that their parsed arguments are stored under their own name. 

Wait, no, the standard way is that the subparsers have a single dest (like 'command') which holds the command name. 

Alternatively, perhaps each subparser is added with a different dest, but that would require knowing the names. 

Hmm, I think I need to proceed with the earlier approach where the function adds a few example subparsers, even if the problem's docstring doesn't mention them. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the function uses the subparsers' dest to know which subparser was used, then the function's dict has the 'global' as the main's namespace, and the subcommand's name as the same namespace. But that's not the case. 

Wait, the problem's docstring says "parse the arguments and return them as a dict mapping from subparser name (or 'global') to an argparse.Namespace instance." So each subparser's name is a key, but only the one that was used is present. 

Wait, perhaps the 'global' key is for the main parser's arguments, and the subparsers' names are keys for their own namespaces, which are parsed from the command's arguments. 

So the code would be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Add a subparser for 'add'
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    # Parse the main parser to get the command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices[main_args.command]
        sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
        namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
    
    return namespaces

This code would work if the user calls the script with 'add --file test.txt', then the dict would have 'global' with the global argument and command 'add', and 'add' as the key with the parsed --file argument. 

But the problem's docstring doesn't mention any subparsers, so perhaps the code is supposed to be generic, but the function must have some subparsers. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written to return the main's namespace under 'global' and the subparser's name as a key pointing to the same namespace. But that would mean the dict has both keys, but they are the same. 

Hmm, perhaps the 'global' is the main parser's namespace (without the subparsers' arguments), and the subparsers' name is their own. 

Wait, the main parser includes the command's name, but the subparsers' arguments are in the main's namespace. So the 'global' key's namespace includes the command and any global args, and the subcommand's key has the subcommand's arguments. 

Wait, no. The subcommand's arguments are part of the main's namespace. So the subcommand's key would need to be a separate namespace with just those arguments. 

Ah, so the code is as follows:

The main parser has global arguments plus the command. The subparsers are each added with their own arguments. 

When you parse the main, you get the command and global args. The remaining arguments (after the command) are passed to the subparser's parser, which parses them into a new namespace (without the global args). 

Thus, the 'global' key has the main's namespace (including command and global args), and the subcommand's key has the subparser's parsed arguments (without the global ones). 

This is what the code I wrote earlier does. 

Therefore, the code must include the subparsers. But since the problem doesn't specify any, perhaps the code is written with an example subparser, but that's not part of the problem's requirements. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the function doesn't add any subparsers and just parses the command. But then the dict would only have 'global' and the command's name would be present but the subparser's parser isn't defined, so it can't be parsed. 

Hmm, I'm not sure. But given the problem's instructions, perhaps the correct approach is to create a main parser with global arguments and a subparsers, then parse the main's arguments to get the command. The 'global' key is the main's namespace, and the command's key is the subparser's parsed arguments. 

So the code would look like this, even with a hard-coded example subparser. The problem might expect that the function uses subparsers and returns the dict as described. 

Thus, the code I wrote earlier is probably correct. Even if it's an example with 'add' subparser, that's the way to go. 

Wait, but in the code, the 'add_parser' is added inside the function. That means the function can only handle 'add' and any other subparsers added there. 

The problem's function signature and docstring don't mention any specific subcommands, so perhaps the code should not hardcode any. But how?

Wait, maybe the code uses the subparsers.choices to loop through all possible subparsers and parse them, but that would require that the subparsers are added before parsing. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the function returns the main's namespace under 'global', and the subparsers' name is the command's name, and the value is the main's namespace. But then the dict would have the command's name and 'global' as the same object, which is not helpful. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the function just needs to return the main's namespace under 'global' and the command's name as another key pointing to the same namespace. But that's redundant. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'global' key is for any arguments not part of a subparser, and the subparser's name is for the arguments that are part of it. But the main parser's namespace includes both. 

Hmm, I think I have to go with the code that uses the subparsers, adds at least one example, and returns the dict as described. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the 'global' key is for the main parser's arguments (excluding the subcommand's), and the subcommand's key is for the entire parsed arguments. But that would require the main's namespace without the command's arguments. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function's code is as follows:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    # Add global arguments
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # The subparsers are added here, but the problem's function must be generic. So maybe the code is written without adding any subparsers, but that would not work. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that the subparsers are part of the main parser, and the function returns the main's namespace as 'global', and the subparsers' name is not a key. But the docstring says that the keys are either the subparser's name or 'global', so there must be at least one subparser. 

Well, given the constraints, I'll proceed with the code that includes a sample subparser. 

Wait, but the problem's function doesn't mention any specific subparsers, so perhaps the code should not have any. But then, how can it parse them?

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to return the main's namespace under 'global' and if a subparser is used, then the command's name is also a key pointing to the same namespace. 

But that doesn't make sense. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem's function is supposed to return the parsed arguments as a dictionary where 'global' holds all the arguments except the subcommand's, and the subcommand's name holds their own. 

To achieve this, the function can first parse the global arguments, then parse the subcommand's arguments. 

Wait, here's another approach. Create two parsers: one for global arguments, and another for the subcommand's arguments. 

global_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(add_help=False)
global_parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[global_parser])
subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
# add subparsers here, which do not include the global arguments.

# parse the main parser to get the command and global args
main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)

# parse the global args into their own namespace
global_namespace = global_parser.parse_args(unparsed_arguments)

namespaces = {'global': global_namespace}

if main_args.command:
    subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
    if subparser:
        sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
        namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args

return namespaces

This way, the 'global' namespace only has the global arguments (since the subparsers are not part of the global parser), and the subcommand's namespace has their own arguments. 

This seems better. 

So in this setup, the global parser is separate, and the subparsers are added to the main parser, which doesn't include the global arguments. 

Wait, no. The main parser's parents are [global_parser], so it has the global arguments. The subparsers' parsers also have the global arguments. 

Hmm, perhaps this is the correct approach. 

Let me outline this again:

- The global_parser contains the global arguments.
- The main parser is created with parents=[global_parser], so it includes the global arguments plus the subparsers.
- The subparsers are added to the main parser, so their own parsers also have the global arguments. 

Wait, no, the subparsers' parsers would also have the global arguments because they inherit from the parents. 

Hmm, perhaps the global arguments should be added to the main parser, and the subparsers' parsers are separate. 

Alternatively, the global parser is separate, and the main parser is used to parse the command and the subparsers. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of a code that uses this approach without hardcoding any subparsers. 

Wait, no, the subparsers must be added. 

Perhaps the problem is expecting that the function uses the main parser's namespace as 'global', and the command's name is also a key pointing to the same namespace. But then why have the command's name as a key?

Alternatively, perhaps the 'global' key holds all the arguments except the command's ones, and the command's name holds their own. 

But how to get that. 

Wait, perhaps the function uses the main parser's arguments (including the command) as 'global', and the subcommand's parser parses the command's arguments into a separate namespace, so the dict has both. 

Yes, that's what the code I had earlier does. 

So the code must include adding at least one subparser. Since the problem's docstring doesn't mention any, maybe the code is just using a dummy one, but the function is written in a way that can be extended. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the function's code doesn't add any subparsers, but just uses the subparsers' choices from the parser. But without any subparsers added, that would not work. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting that the function is written to return the main's namespace under 'global', and the subparsers' name is also a key pointing to the same namespace. But that's not possible unless the code is written with a specific subparser. 

Wait, perhaps the code is supposed to have a subparsers container and then for each subparser in the main parser's subparsers, parse them. But without knowing the subparsers' structure, that's not feasible. 

Alternatively, maybe the function's code is supposed to return a dictionary where 'global' is the namespace from the main parser (without any subparsers' arguments), and the subparser's name is the parsed arguments from the subparser's parser. 

Thus, the code would be:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    # Create a main parser with global arguments and a subparsers container
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Add a subparser for 'add' command
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    # parse the main to get the command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    # create the global namespace (only the global arguments)
    global_namespace = parser.parse_known_args()[0]
    # No, that's not right. 

Wait, maybe the global_namespace is the global arguments parsed from the main parser, but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, the main parser's arguments include the command. The 'global' key's namespace is the main's parsed arguments except the subcommand's arguments. 

Hmm, perhaps the function uses a parent parser for the global arguments and the main parser uses that parent. The subparsers' parsers do not inherit from the parent, so their arguments are separate. 

Wait, let me try:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    # Create a global parser that will only be used for the global arguments
    global_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(add_help=False)
    global_parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    # Create the main parser which uses the global parser as a parent
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[global_parser])
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Add a subparser for 'add' command, but not using the global parser
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add', parents=[])
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    # parse the main parser to get the command and global args
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    # get the global namespace
    global_namespace = global_parser.parse_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': global_namespace}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
    
    return namespaces

Wait, this way, the subparsers' parsers do not inherit from the global parser, so their arguments are only their own. The global_namespace contains the global arguments, and the subcommand's namespace contains only their own arguments. 

Yes, this makes sense. So the code would do that. 

But then, the main parser includes the global parser's arguments and the subparsers. The subparsers' parsers do not have the global arguments. So when parsing the remaining arguments, the subcommand's parser doesn't have the global ones, so the remaining must exclude them. 

Wait, but the global_parser is only for the global arguments, and the main parser includes those plus the subparsers. So when parsing the main parser, the global arguments and command are parsed, and the remaining are the arguments after the command. 

Thus, the code would work as intended. 

But the problem's function doesn't have any subparsers specified, so the code must include at least one example. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written without adding any subparsers, but that would make the command's part not work. 

Hmm, given that the problem requires me to write the code based on the signature and docstring, and the docstring says the function should parse the arguments into the dict, I think the correct approach is to set up the main parser with global arguments and a subparsers container with a dest. Then, after parsing the main to get the command, retrieve the subparser's parser and parse the remaining arguments into a separate namespace. 

The code would look like this, even with an example subparser. 

So here's the code:

import argparse

def parse_arguments(*unparsed_arguments):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--global-arg', action='store_true')
    
    subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='command')
    
    # Example subparser 'add'
    add_parser = subparsers.add_parser('add')
    add_parser.add_argument('--file', type=str)
    
    main_args, remaining = parser.parse_known_args(unparsed_arguments)
    
    namespaces = {'global': main_args}
    
    if main_args.command:
        subparser = subparsers.choices.get(main_args.command)
        if subparser:
            sub_args = subparser.parse_args(remaining, namespace=argparse.Namespace())
            namespaces[main_args.command] = sub_args
    
    return namespaces

This code should work. For example, if the user runs with 'add --file test.txt', then main_args has 'global-arg' and 'command' as 'add'. The remaining would be ['--file', 'test.txt']. The add_parser parses those into sub_args, which has 'file' set. The dict would have 'global' and 'add' keys. 

If there's no subcommand, the 'global' key is the only one. 

Even though the function has a hard-coded 'add' subparser, that's the only way to provide an example. The problem might expect that the function is written with some subparsers, but perhaps it's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the subparsers are added in a way that the function doesn't need to hardcode them. 

Wait, perhaps the code uses the subparsers.choices to get the subparser's name. But without adding any, that's empty. 

Hmm, I think this is the best I can do given the problem's constraints. So I'll proceed with this code, adding a sample subparser like 'add'.
