Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _reset_logging based on the provided docstring. The function is a method of a class, as indicated by the cls parameter. The goal is to reset the logging system. 

Hmm, resetting logging usually involves removing all existing handlers and possibly formatters from the logger so that we can reconfigure it. Let me think about how to do that in Python.

First, the function is inside a class, so it's a class method. The standard way to reset logging would be to get the logger instance, then iterate over all its handlers and remove them. Also, maybe setting the level back to a default? Or perhaps just clearing the handlers?

Wait, the docstring just says "Reset the logging system". So perhaps the function is meant to reset the logger associated with the class. The cls parameter suggests that each class might have its own logger, maybe named after the class. 

So steps: Get the logger for the class. For example, using logging.getLogger(cls.__name__) or maybe the logger is stored as a class attribute. Then, remove all handlers attached to it. Also, maybe reset the logging level to NOTSET so it inherits from the root logger again. 

Wait, the function is called _reset_logging. So maybe the approach is to retrieve the logger, loop through its handlers and remove them. Let me recall the logging API. 

The Logger object has a handlers attribute which is a list. So to remove all handlers, you can iterate over the logger's handlers and call removeHandler on each. Or maybe just set the list to empty? No, because you need to actually remove them from the logger. 

Alternatively, perhaps the better way is:

logger = logging.getLogger(cls.logger_name)
for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
    logger.removeHandler(handler)

Also, maybe reset any custom attributes or the logging level. Like, setting the logger level back to default. 

Wait, the default level for a logger is WARNING, but if it was set to something else, maybe we should set it to NOTSET so that it's not blocking any logs from the root. Or perhaps just leave it as is, since removing handlers might be sufficient. 

Another point: If the logger has any filters, should those be removed too? The docstring doesn't specify, so maybe just handlers. 

So putting it all together, the code would be something like:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

Wait, but maybe the logger's name isn't cls.__name__. Maybe the class uses a specific logger name. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps using the class name is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the logger is stored as a class attribute. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a class that has a logger attribute. So maybe the code should use cls.logger instead. But the problem doesn't mention that. Since the function is called on the class, perhaps the standard way is to get the logger by the class's name. 

Another thing to consider: if there are any custom formatters or other settings, but the problem states to reset, so removing handlers should be enough. 

Wait, sometimes when you reset logging, you might also want to reset the propagate setting. But unless specified, maybe not necessary. 

So the code would start by importing logging. Then, in the method, get the logger for the class. Then loop through the handlers and remove each. 

Wait, the slice logger.handlers[:] creates a copy of the list, so that we can iterate and remove without modifying the list during iteration. That's important. 

Alternatively, another approach is to set the logger level to NOTSET, but removing all handlers is key here. 

So the code should be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    logger.handlers = []

Wait, but does that work? Because logger.handlers is a list, and assigning an empty list might directly clear them. But I think the proper way is to call removeHandler. 

Wait, actually, in the logging documentation, the correct way is to remove each handler individually. Because if you just set the list to empty, maybe it's not the same. Let me check. 

Looking up: The handlers attribute of a Logger is a list, but you shouldn't modify it directly. The proper way is to use addHandler and removeHandler. So in a loop, we need to remove each handler. 

So the code should be:

for handler in list(logger.handlers):
    logger.removeHandler(handler)

Using list() to get a copy of the handlers list so that we can safely remove them. 

So putting it all together:

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    while logger.handlers:
        logger.handlers.pop()
    # Or the for loop method.

Alternatively, the for loop with a copy:

handlers = logger.handlers.copy() but maybe list(logger.handlers) is better. 

Wait, in Python, logger.handlers is a list, so list(logger.handlers) creates a new list. So iterating over that and removing each handler. 

Wait, but for a list, the standard way is:

for h in logger.handlers[:]:
    logger.removeHandler(h)

This way, the slice creates a copy, and each handler is removed via the method. 

So which is better? Using the removeHandler method is the correct approach. 

So the code should be:

logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
    logger.removeHandler(handler)

That's probably the right way. 

Another thing to consider: if there are any filters or other attributes, but the problem doesn't mention that. So sticking to handlers. 

Wait, maybe the root logger or other loggers? But the function's docstring says "the logging system", but in Python, each logger is independent. So perhaps the function is meant to reset the logger for the class. 

Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to reset all loggers, but that's more complex. The presence of cls suggests that it's per class. 

So the code is as above. 

Wait, but the function is a class method, so maybe the logger is stored as a class variable. Like, maybe cls.logger? But the problem doesn't specify that. Since the function is called on the class, using cls.__name__ to get the logger name makes sense. 

Therefore, the code would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    while logger.handlers:
        logger.removeHandler(logger.handlers[0])
    # Or the for loop approach.

Wait, maybe the for loop is better. Let me write it:

for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
    logger.removeHandler(handler)

Yes, that's better. 

So putting it all together. Also, need to make sure that the function is part of a class. Since it's a method with cls, probably a class method. 

Wait, the function is defined as def _reset_logging(cls): which suggests it's a class method. So the code should be inside a class, but the problem only asks for the function itself. 

Wait, the user wants the code for the function, so the generated code should be the function's body. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate the Python code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is given as def _reset_logging(cls): with the docstring. So the code should start with that. 

Therefore, the code would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    while logger.handlers:
        logger.removeHandler(logger.handlers[0])

Alternatively, using a for loop. Let me see which is more standard. 

Looking at examples online, sometimes they use a loop over the list copy. 

Like:

for hndlr in logger.handlers:
    logger.removeHandler(hndlr)

Wait, no, that would modify the list while iterating, causing issues. So the correct way is to loop over a copy. 

So:

for handler in list(logger.handlers):
    logger.removeHandler(handler)

Wait, in Python, list(logger.handlers) creates a copy. So that's okay. 

Alternatively, using a slice:

for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
    logger.removeHandler(handler)

Either way works. 

So which is better? Probably the for loop over the copy. 

So the code would be:

def _reset_logging(cls):
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

Wait, but the function is supposed to reset the logging system. Maybe also resetting the logging level? 

Hmm, the problem's docstring is brief. The user didn't mention setting levels, so perhaps it's sufficient to just remove handlers. 

Alternatively, perhaps set the logger's level back to NOTSET. 

logger.setLevel(logging.NOTSET)

But maybe that's optional. Since the user didn't specify, perhaps just removing handlers is enough. 

So the code would be as above. 

Wait, but in some cases, if there are other loggers, maybe the root logger? But the function is per class. 

I think that's the correct approach. So the code is:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

Wait, but the first line must be the import. Oh, but the function is inside a class. Wait, the user provided the function signature, so the code should start with the function. 

Wait, the code needs to include the function. So the import must be at the top. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring, so the code should include the function and the necessary imports. 

Wait, but in the code block, the user wants the function. So the code would start with the import and then the function. 

Wait, the user's example shows the function with the docstring. The generated code must only have the code, not any explanations. 

Wait, the user's first message includes the function signature and docstring, so the code should be the function's body. But the function itself needs to have the import. 

Wait, no. The function is part of a class, so the import is needed outside. But the user's code should only include the function. Wait, perhaps the code is part of a class, so the function is inside the class. 

Wait, the function is defined with def _reset_logging(cls): so it's a method of a class. So the code would be part of the class. 

But in that case, the import should be at the top of the module. 

So the code that the user wants is the function's body. 

Wait, the user wants the code generated, in Python markdown format. So they probably want the code block with the function. 

Therefore, the code would be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    while logger.handlers:
        logger.removeHandler(logger.handlers[0])

Or using the for loop. 

Wait, which is better? The for loop is more straightforward. Let me check again. 

Suppose logger.handlers is [h1, h2, h3]. Then, looping over each in the list (using a copy) and remove each. 

Yes, that would work. 

Alternatively, maybe using list comprehension or something, but no, you have to call removeHandler. 

So the correct code is the for loop. 

Wait, in the code, the logger's name is cls.__name__? 

Wait, cls is the class, so cls.__name__ would get the class's name as a string, which is a common way to name loggers. 

Alternatively, maybe the logger is named after the module, but in a class method, using cls.__name__ makes sense. 

So I think that's the right approach. 

Therefore, the final code would be as written, with the for loop. 

Wait, but in the code, the function is part of a class, so perhaps the logger is stored as a class variable. But the problem doesn't state that. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should reset all loggers? But that's more complicated and probably not what the question wants. 

The problem says "reset the logging system", but in Python, the logging system is per-logger. So maybe the function is resetting the root logger? 

Hmm, that's a possibility. Wait, the function is called on the class, but maybe the logging system refers to the entire module's loggers. But that's more involved. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is intended to reset the logger for the class. 

Given the presence of cls, I think it's per-class. 

So the code is correct. 

Wait, another way: Maybe the logger is a class-level attribute. Like, cls.logger. But again, the problem's function doesn't mention that. 

The user's input only has the function signature and docstring, so I have to go with that. 

Thus, the code should be:

import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
        logger.removeHandler(handler)

Wait, but the first line must be the import. However, the user said to output the code generated based on the signature and docstring. The function is supposed to be part of a class, so the import is needed at the top of the module. 

But the user's code should include the function. So the code would start with the import, then the function. 

Alternatively, maybe the class already has a logger, so the code can just refer to it. But the problem doesn't say that. 

Therefore, the code I have is correct. 

Wait, but in the function, when you do logger.handlers[:] that creates a slice of the list. So looping through that slice and removing each handler. 

Wait, let me test this in my mind. Suppose logger has handlers. The loop goes through each handler in the slice (which is a copy of the list at that moment). So when you remove each, it's okay because the original list is not being modified during iteration. 

Yes, that's the correct approach. 

Alternatively, the code could be written as:

logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
handlers = logger.handlers.copy()
for h in handlers:
    logger.removeHandler(h)

Which is equivalent. 

Either way works. 

So the code is okay. 

Therefore, the generated code should be as above. 

Wait, but the user said to output the code in Python markdown format. So like putting it in triple backticks? 

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." 

Hmm, probably they mean to present the code as a code block with the proper syntax, but without any explanations. So the code should be enclosed in ```python ... ```? 

Wait, but the user's example shows that the code is written as the function, without the markdown. Wait, looking back. 

The user wrote: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring. Do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting. Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format."

Wait, perhaps they mean the code should be in a code block, using markdown syntax. 

So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks, with the language specified. 

Wait, but the user provided the function signature and docstring, so the code would start with the import and the function. 

So putting it all together, the code would be:

```python
import logging

def _reset_logging(cls):
    """
    Reset the logging system
    """
    logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
    for handler in logger.handlers[:]:
        logger.removeHandler(handler)
```

But I should check if there's another way. Maybe using a different approach. 

Another thought: Maybe the function is supposed to reset the entire logging configuration, not just the class's logger. In that case, perhaps using logging.basicConfig again? But that's not standard. 

Alternatively, using logging.shutdown and then re-initializing? But that's probably not what the user wants. 

The docstring says "Reset the logging system", but in the context of a class method, it's more likely to reset the logger associated with the class. 

Therefore, the code I have is correct. 

Wait, but in the function, the cls is a class, so when you call logging.getLogger(cls.__name__), that's getting a logger with the name of the class. 

Alternatively, perhaps the logger is named using the module, but without more info, I have to go with the class name. 

Yes, I think that's the way to go. 

So the final code is as above. 

Wait, but maybe the user expects using a different method. Let me think again. 

Another approach: 

logger = logging.getLogger(cls.__name__)
logger.handlers.clear()

But is that acceptable? The handlers list has a clear method in Python 3.3+, so that might be possible. 

However, using clear() is more direct. 

But is that the correct way? 

The Logger.removeHandler() method is the proper API to use. So modifying the handlers list directly (like using clear()) might not be the right way. Because the logging module might track handlers in another way. 

Wait, according to the logging documentation, you should use addHandler and removeHandler to manage handlers. So setting logger.handlers = [] or using clear() might not be the intended way. 

Therefore, the loop approach is better. 

So between the for loop and the while loop. 

The while loop approach would loop until the handlers list is empty, but each time removing the first element. That's O(n^2) time, which is less efficient than the for loop over the original list. 

Therefore, the for loop is better. 

So the code with the for loop is better. 

Hence, the code I wrote earlier is correct. 

I think that's the solution.
