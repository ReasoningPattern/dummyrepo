Okay, I need to generate Python code for the function _normalizeargs based on the given docstring. Let me start by understanding what the function is supposed to do. The docstring says it's to normalize declaration arguments. The arguments might include Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. The goal is to expand anything except individual interfaces or implements specs. 

Hmm, so the function takes a 'sequence' which can be a mix of these different types. The output parameter is optional and defaults to None. The first thing I should do is check what the input is. If the output is None, maybe we need to create a new list to collect the results. 

The key point is to process each element in the sequence. For each element, if it's a Declaration (assuming that's a class or type we have), then we need to expand it. Wait, but what's a Declaration here? Maybe it's an object that has its own list of interfaces or implements specifications. So if an element is a Declaration instance, we should add its bases to the output list. Or maybe the Declaration has some attributes that need to be flattened.

Alternatively, if the element is a tuple, perhaps that's part of the implements spec. The function might need to unpack tuples but leave individual interfaces as they are. Wait, the doc mentions "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded." So implements specs are probably the tuples, and those shouldn't be expanded. So the function should iterate through each item in the sequence, and for each item, if it's a Declaration, expand it into its constituent parts (like interfaces or bases), but if it's a tuple, treat it as an implements spec and leave it as is. Single interfaces (like classes or interface objects) should be added directly to the output.

Wait, the function's parameters are 'sequence' and 'output'. So the function is probably designed to be recursive. Let me think of the steps:

1. If output is None, create a new list to collect the normalized arguments.
2. Iterate over each element in the sequence.
3. For each element:
   a. If it's a Declaration, expand its contents. Maybe check if it has a __bases__ attribute or something similar, and then process those bases?
   b. If it's a tuple, add it to the output as a single element (since they are implements specs and shouldn't be expanded).
   c. If it's an individual interface (not a Declaration or a tuple), add it directly to the output.
4. Return the output list.

Wait, but how do I distinguish between a Declaration and an interface? The problem is that without knowing the specific classes involved, maybe the code can check if the element is an instance of a Declaration class. But since the code is supposed to be general, perhaps the function is part of a framework where Declaration is a known type. So assuming that Declaration is a class that we can import, maybe from somewhere else. But in the code, since I can't import, perhaps the code just checks if the element has a certain attribute, like 'bases' or 'interfaces'? Or maybe the code is supposed to handle any object that is a Declaration by expanding its __bases__ or similar?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that a Declaration is an object that can be part of the sequence, and when encountered, it should be replaced by its bases. Let's think of an example. Suppose the input is [DeclarationA, (InterfaceB, InterfaceC), InterfaceD]. Then the normalized output would be [DeclarationA's bases (maybe InterfaceX, InterfaceY), the tuple (InterfaceB, InterfaceC), InterfaceD]. Wait, but the doc says to expand anything except individual interfaces or implements specs. So implements specs are probably the tuples, so they stay as tuples. The Declarions (like DeclarationA) would be expanded into their component interfaces, perhaps by getting their bases. So the function needs to check if the element is a Declaration, and if so, process each of its bases. If it's a tuple, add it as a single element. Otherwise, add the element itself.

Wait, but how does the function know which elements are Declarions? Maybe the code is written in a context where Declarion is a specific class, so we can check using isinstance. Let me proceed under that assumption. 

The function's parameters are sequence and output. The output is passed so that maybe it can be used in a recursive way. So the base case is when the sequence is exhausted, return the output. But in this case, the function is called with a sequence, and it's processing each element. 

Wait, perhaps the function is supposed to process each element in the sequence, and if an element is a list or a tuple (except when it's an implements spec?), then it should be expanded. Wait the doc says: "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So, implements specs are the tuples. So any element that is not an individual interface (like a class) and not a tuple (implement spec) should be expanded. So for example, if the element is a list, then we need to process its elements recursively. If it's a Declaration, perhaps we should process its bases, which might be a list or something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Declaration has an __interfaces__ attribute or similar. Let me think. 

The function's name is _normalizeargs, which is a helper function, so it's probably part of a larger system. Let me consider that the sequence can be a list of elements, some of which are Declarions (which need to be unpacked into their bases), or other sequences (like lists) that need to be flattened, except for tuples which are kept as is. 

Wait the doc says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So "implements specs" are things like tuples. So any element that is not an individual interface (like a class or interface object) nor an implements spec (a tuple) should be expanded. So if an element is a list, that's not an interface or a tuple, so it should be flattened. Similarly, a Declaration instance would not be an interface (assuming that interfaces are separate), so it should be expanded. 

Wait, but how to differentiate between a Declaration and an interface? Maybe the interface is a class, and the Declaration is a different class. So for example, if the element is an instance of Declaration, then we process its bases. But for an interface (a class), we just add it as is. 

Alternatively, maybe the function treats any non-interface and non-tuple as something to be expanded. Like, perhaps the sequence can contain nested lists, and the function needs to flatten all the lists except when they are part of an implements spec (which are tuples). 

Let me try to outline the steps again:

The function _normalizeargs takes a sequence (which is an iterable) and an output list (default is a new list). It processes each element in the sequence:

- If the element is a Declaration instance, then we need to process its bases (or whatever attributes contain the interfaces) recursively. So we call _normalizeargs on the bases of the Declaration and add those to the output.

- If the element is a tuple, add it to the output as a single element (since it's an implements spec and shouldn't be expanded).

- If the element is an individual interface (like a class or some object that is not a Declaration or a tuple), add it to the output.

Wait, but what about other iterables? Like if the element is a list, not a Declaration, then we should flatten it? Because the doc says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So if the element is an iterable (like a list) that's not an implements spec (tuple), then it's to be expanded. So the function needs to check if the element is an instance of an iterable (excluding strings, since they are iterable but individual elements). 

Wait, in Python, strings are also iterable, so we need to make sure that we don't treat them as sequences. So perhaps we check if the element is an instance of a Declaration, or a tuple, or a string. Otherwise, if it's an iterable, we process it by expanding its elements. 

Alternatively, the code may have to consider that any element that is a list (or other sequence type except tuples) should be flattened. Let me think of possible examples:

Suppose the input is [A, [B, C], D], where A, B, C, D are interfaces. Then the normalized args should be [A, B, C, D], since the list [B,C] is not an implements spec (a tuple), so it's expanded. 

But if the input is [ (B, C), D ], then the tuple is kept as is, so the output would be [ (B,C), D ].

Another example: a Declaration instance in the sequence. Let's say the Declaration has bases [X, Y], then when we encounter it in the sequence, we should process those bases. So the Declaration is replaced by its bases. 

So the code would need to loop over each element in the input sequence. For each element:

- If it's a Declaration instance: recursively process its bases (or some attribute) and add the results to the output list.

- Else, if it's a tuple: add it to the output as a single element.

- Else, if it's an instance of a list or other iterable (but not a string), then process each of its elements, expanding them.

- Else, add the element itself to the output.

Wait, but the problem states that "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So "individual interfaces" are added as is. Implements specs (tuples) are added as is. So anything else (like a list, or a Declaration) must be expanded. 

So the code should check each element. 

First, handle the case where output is None. Then, create a new list. 

Then, for each element in the sequence:

Check if it's a Declaration instance. If yes, then process its bases (or whatever the bases are stored in). Maybe the Declaration has a __bases__ attribute like a class. Or perhaps it's stored in an attribute like .interfaces. Let's assume that the Declaration has a .bases attribute. 

Wait, but maybe the Declaration is an instance of a class that has a __bases__ attribute, but in Python, user-defined classes have __bases__ as a tuple of their base classes. But maybe in this context, the Declaration is a class that contains the interfaces it's supposed to implement. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to treat any object that is not a tuple or a string or an interface as needing to be expanded. But how do we know if it's an interface? Well, perhaps interfaces are classes, so if the element is a class, then it's an interface. 

Wait, maybe the code is supposed to treat anything that is an instance of Declaration as needing to be expanded, while tuples are left as is, and other objects (like classes) are added directly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written such that it checks if the element is an instance of a type that is considered a "Declaration" (maybe a specific class), and then expand its contents. 

The code structure would be something like this:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for item in sequence:
        if isinstance(item, Declaration):
            # expand its bases or whatever
            _normalizeargs(item.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(item, tuple):
            output.append(item)
        elif hasattr(item, '__iter__') and not isinstance(item, str):
            # it's an iterable, not a string or a tuple, so expand it
            _normalizeargs(item, output)
        else:
            output.append(item)
    return output

Wait, but the problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So individual interfaces (like a class) are added as is. Implements specs are the tuples. So any other iterable (like a list) should be expanded. So the code above would handle lists by expanding them. But what about the Declaration? The code treats Declaration instances by expanding their bases. So that's correct. 

But maybe the Declaration has a method or attribute that gives the interfaces it contains. For example, perhaps each Declaration has an attribute called 'interfaces' which is a list. So the code would process that list. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to check if the item is a class (so an interface), then add it. But how to distinguish between a class and a Declaration? That's a bit ambiguous. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written to check if the item is an instance of a certain type. For example, if the item has a '__bases__' attribute (like a class), then perhaps it's a Declaration. Wait, but a class's __bases__ is a tuple of its base classes. So maybe in this case, the function is designed to process classes as well, but that would conflict with the 'individual interfaces' part. 

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the sequence can contain elements which are either instances of Declaration (which should be expanded into their bases), or tuples (which are implement specs and kept), or individual interfaces (like classes) which are added directly. So the code would need to check for each element:

If it is a Declaration instance, then we need to process its bases (maybe via item.bases) and add those to the output, recursively. 

If it is a tuple, add it as is. 

Otherwise, if it's an iterable (like a list), then we process its elements. 

Wait, but the problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So the "individual interfaces" are not expanded, but the other things (like lists, Declaration instances) are. 

So, perhaps:

For each item in the sequence:

- if it's a Declaration instance: expand it (process its bases)

- elif it's a tuple: add to output as is

- elif it's an instance of an iterable (but not a string), then expand it (process each element in the iterable)

- else (it's an individual interface, like a class), add to output.

Wait, but how do we check if it's an individual interface? Maybe the individual interfaces are classes, so if it's not a tuple, not an instance of Declaration, and not an iterable, then it's an interface. 

Wait, but in Python, a class is an instance of type. So perhaps if the item is a class (type), then it's an interface. So:

if isinstance(item, Declaration):

elif isinstance(item, tuple):

elif isinstance(item, (list, set, etc.)) but not a string, then expand it.

else (if it's not any of those, then it's an individual interface, like a class?), so add to output.

Alternatively, maybe the code treats any non-iterable as an individual interface. So, for example, if the item is a string, it's an individual interface. But the problem says "anything but individual interfaces...", so perhaps strings are considered individual interfaces. 

Hmm, perhaps the code needs to check if the item is a string and treat it as an individual interface. So in the code, when checking for iterables, we have to exclude strings. 

Putting this together, here's the plan:

Initialize the output list if necessary.

Loop over each item in the sequence.

For each item:

- if it's a Declaration instance: process its bases (i.e., call _normalizeargs on its bases, appending to output).

- elif it's a tuple: append to output as is.

- elif it's an iterable (like list, but not string), then process each element of that iterable (recursively). 

- else: append to output as an individual interface.

Wait, but how do we get the bases from a Declaration? Maybe the Declaration has a __bases__ attribute, but that's usually for classes. Alternatively, perhaps the code uses item.__class__.__bases__? That might not be right. Maybe the function is designed to work with a custom Declaration class that has an 'interfaces' attribute. 

The problem's docstring doesn't give specifics, so perhaps I can proceed by assuming that a Declaration has a 'bases' attribute (like a list) that contains the interfaces to be added. So when we encounter a Declaration instance, we process its bases. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to treat any class (type instance) as an interface, so if the item is a type, then it's an interface. But then, how do we handle a class that is a Declaration? 

Hmm, perhaps the code's logic is:

Check if the item is a subclass of Declaration (but that would be for classes, not instances). Or maybe it's checking the instance type. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is written in a way that the Declaration is an instance, and the code uses 'isinstance(item, Declaration)' to detect it. 

Assuming that the code can use that, here's the code structure:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for elem in sequence:
        if isinstance(elem, Declaration):
            # expand the Declaration's bases
            _normalizeargs(elem.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            output.append(elem)
        elif hasattr(elem, '__iter__') and not isinstance(elem, (str, bytes)):
            # it's an iterable (like a list) but not a string, so flatten it
            _normalizeargs(elem, output)
        else:
            output.append(elem)
    return output

Wait, but the 'hasattr(elem, '__iter__')' would check if it's an iterable. So for example, a list, set, etc. But we need to exclude strings and bytes, as they are iterables but individual elements. 

Wait, but in the problem's context, maybe the sequence is only composed of elements that are either Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces (like classes). So the code can handle that. 

Wait, let's think of some test cases:

Case 1: sequence is [A, (B, C), D], where A is a class (interface), B, C, D are classes. Then the output should be [A, (B,C), D].

Case 2: sequence is [A, [B, C], D], then the [B,C] is a list, so it's expanded into B and C. So the output would be [A,B,C,D].

Case 3: sequence is [DeclarationInstance], where DeclarationInstance has .bases = [X, Y]. Then the output would be [X,Y].

Another case: a nested list like [[E], F], so the outer list is processed, then the inner list is expanded, leading to E and F.

So the code above would work for that. 

Wait, but how do we handle the case where the elem is a Declaration, which has its own bases (like a list or a tuple). So the code would call _normalizeargs on elem.bases, appending the results to output. 

Yes, that's right. 

So putting this into code. Now, the problem says "generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring". The function is named _normalizeargs, and the parameters are sequence and output. 

Wait, but the function is supposed to return the normalized list. So the code should build the output list by appending to it, and then return it. 

Another point: in the code, when we process the Declaration's bases, we need to pass the bases as the sequence to the recursive call, and the existing output. 

Wait, the code as written would do that. 

Wait, but what if the bases of a Declaration is a tuple? Then when processing that, the code would first check if it's a Declaration (no, because it's a tuple), so it would check if it's a tuple, and add it as is. But that's probably not intended. Wait, the bases of a Declaration might be a list, but if it's a tuple, then the code would add the tuple as an element, but according to the problem statement, the Declaration's bases are part of the things to expand except for implements specs (tuples). Wait, but the Declaration's bases themselves are a list of interfaces. So when expanding the Declaration, the bases should be processed, so any nested sequences in there (like a list) would be flattened, but tuples would remain as implements specs. 

So for example, if a Declaration has bases [ (B, C), D ], then the normalized args would include (B,C) as a tuple and D as an interface. 

Yes, the code would handle that because when the bases are processed recursively, the (B,C) tuple is added as a single element. 

So this code should work. 

Wait, but the code uses 'hasattr(elem, '__iter__')', which may not be the best approach. Because some objects may not have __iter__ but are still iterable. The better way might be to check if it's an instance of a collections.abc.Iterable. But that requires importing from collections.abc. Since the problem doesn't mention any imports, maybe it's better to use a try-except block. Alternatively, perhaps the code expects that the elements are either lists, tuples, or Declaration instances, and uses isinstance checks. 

Alternatively, maybe the code is supposed to only process lists and Declaration instances, but not other iterables. The problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So maybe the 'anything' refers to any sequence (like lists) or Declarions. So perhaps the code should check if the element is a list (or a Declaration instance) and then expand it, otherwise, if it's a tuple, add it, else add it as an individual interface. 

So changing the code to check for list instances instead of general iterables:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for elem in sequence:
        if isinstance(elem, Declaration):
            _normalizeargs(elem.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            output.append(elem)
        elif isinstance(elem, list):
            _normalizeargs(elem, output)
        else:
            output.append(elem)
    return output

Wait, but then if the elem is a tuple, it's added as is, but if it's a list, then we expand it. That would make sense. So in this case, the code would flatten lists and expand Declarions, but leave tuples as is. 

Wait, but in the problem statement, the 'anything' includes Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces. Wait the first sentence says "Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces." So the sequence can contain any of those. The expansion is for anything except individual interfaces or implements specs (the tuples). So Declarions must be expanded. 

So the code above would work. 

Wait, but what if the bases of a Declaration is a tuple? Then, in that case, when we process the Declaration's bases (the tuple), the code would check if it's a Declaration (no), a tuple (yes), so it would append the tuple to the output. So that's correct. 

Another scenario: if the sequence has a nested list, like [ [ [A], (B, C) ] ], then the outer list is processed, the inner list is processed, but the inner list's elements are a list and a tuple. The list [A] is expanded, so A is added, and the tuple (B,C) is added as is. 

Wait, let's walk through this example:

Original sequence: [ [[A], (B,C)] ]

Processing the first element (the outer list's first item is the inner list [[A], (B,C)].

So, since it's a list, we process it recursively. 

In the recursive call, the sequence is the inner list. 

The first element is [A], another list. So again, process it recursively. 

The next element is (B,C), which is a tuple, so added to output. 

The inner [A] is a list, so processing it again. 

The A is not a list, Declaration, or tuple. So it's added as an individual interface. 

So the final output would be [A, (B,C)], which is correct. 

So this code should work. 

Wait, but in the code above, the third condition is checking for lists. So if the sequence is a tuple, then we process each element. But the function's parameter 'sequence' can be any iterable, so maybe it's better to check for lists only. 

Wait, the function's parameter is called 'sequence', which could be a list, a tuple, or any other sequence type. But according to the problem, the tuples are the implement specs and should not be expanded. So when the function is called with a sequence (could be a list or a tuple), the elements are processed. 

Wait, in the code, the first check is for Declaration instances. Then, if it's a tuple, append it. Then, check if it's a list, and if so, process recursively. 

Wait, but if the element is a tuple, we add it directly. If it's a list, we process it (expanding it). 

So that's correct. 

So the code should work. 

Another test case: if the element is a string. Let's say the sequence is ['A', 'B', (C, D)]. The code would check 'A' is not a Declaration, not a tuple, not a list. So it would be treated as an individual interface and added to the output. But is a string considered an interface here? The problem says "individual interfaces", so maybe the interfaces are classes, and the strings are something else. But the code can't know that. So perhaps the code should treat strings as individual elements. 

Wait, the problem says "single interfaces" so maybe strings are not interfaces here, but in the code, they would be added unless they are part of a list. 

Hmm, but according to the code above, if the element is a string, it's not a list, Declaration, or tuple, so it's added as an individual element. 

The problem's docstring doesn't mention handling strings, so perhaps that's acceptable. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should treat any non-iterable (except strings) as an interface. Wait, but strings are iterables. 

The problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So if a string is an individual interface (maybe as a name?), then it should be added. Otherwise, if it's part of a list, then the list is expanded, so the string would be added as an individual. 

So the code is okay with that. 

Now, assuming that the code is correct, but the problem is that the user might have intended that the Declaration has a different way to get its bases. For example, maybe the Declaration has a method called 'get_bases()' or something. But since the problem's docstring doesn't specify, I have to make an assumption here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check for the presence of an '__iter__' method, but I think the approach of checking for lists and Declaration instances is better here. 

Wait, perhaps the code is supposed to handle any sequence (like lists, tuples, etc.) except the tuples that are implements specs. Wait, but the code currently treats tuples as implements specs. So if the sequence contains a tuple, it's added as a tuple. But if the sequence is a list, then it's processed. 

Wait, the parameter 'sequence' can be a list or a tuple? The function is called with a sequence, so in the code, when we call _normalizeargs recursively, we can pass any sequence (like a list or a tuple). 

Wait, in the code above, when we process a list, we call the function recursively on that list, but when processing a Declaration, we pass its bases (which could be a list or a tuple?), then the code would process the bases. 

So, I think the code is okay. 

Now, putting this into code. The code must be in Python, and the function is named _normalizeargs. The output is initially None, so when the function is called, it creates a new list. 

Wait, but the code uses 'elem.bases' — how do I know that the Declaration has a 'bases' attribute? The problem's docstring says "Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces". So perhaps each Declaration has a list of bases (interfaces) that it should contribute. 

Assuming that's the case, the code is correct. 

Another possible point: the function should not modify the output list in place but return a new one? But the function is written with output as a parameter, which suggests that it's using a helper function with an accumulator. 

Yes, the code uses a default parameter for output, which is None. When called, it creates a new list, then processes each element. 

So the code should be as written. 

Wait, but in the case of a Declaration, the code calls _normalizeargs with elem.bases as the sequence. So if the bases is a list, then it would process each element of that list. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Another possible scenario: the sequence is a single element, not in a list. Wait, but the function is called with a sequence. So perhaps the function expects that the input is a list-like object. 

Overall, the code seems to handle the cases. 

So I think that's the code. Let me write it out now. 

Wait, but in the code, if the elem is a list, we call the function again with that list and the output. So that would process the list's elements. So the code is flattening lists, expanding Declarions (by their bases), and leaving tuples as is. 

Yes. 

Now, the code. Let me make sure to use the correct variable names. 

The function is called _normalizeargs, takes 'sequence' and 'output' (default None). 

The code:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for elem in sequence:
        if isinstance(elem, Declaration):
            _normalizeargs(elem.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            output.append(elem)
        elif isinstance(elem, list):
            _normalizeargs(elem, output)
        else:
            output.append(elem)
    return output

Wait, but what if the bases of the Declaration is a tuple? Then, in that case, when processing the Declaration's bases (the tuple), the code would check each element in the tuple. Since the elements are not Declaration, not list, and perhaps are interfaces (like classes), they would be added as individual elements. 

Wait, no. Because the bases would be passed as the sequence. Let's say the Declaration's bases is a tuple (B, C). Then, when we call _normalizeargs on that tuple, the first elem is B (assuming B is not a Declaration or list), so added to output. Then C similarly. 

Wait, but the tuple is the sequence here, so in the loop over the tuple's elements, each element is considered individually. 

Wait, in the code, the first check is for Declaration instances, then tuples (as elements), then lists. So the elements of the tuple would be processed as individual elements. So if the bases is a tuple, then the code would break it down into individual elements. 

But according to the problem's docstring, implements specs (tuples) should not be expanded. But in this case, the bases of the Declaration are part of the Declaration's contents, so they are not implements specs. 

Hmm, so maybe the Declaration's bases can include tuples (as implement specs), but those tuples should be kept as is. 

Wait, but in the code above, when processing the Declaration's bases, the code would call _normalizeargs on that bases sequence. So if bases is a tuple, then each element of the tuple would be processed. 

Wait, let's say the Declaration has bases = ( (B, C), D ), where (B,C) is an implement spec. Then when processing the Declaration's bases, the code would first check each element in (B,C,D?), no. Let me think:

The bases is a tuple containing (B,C) and D. 

Wait, the bases would be the tuple ( (B,C), D ). 

Processing each elem in that tuple:

First element is (B,C), which is a tuple. So in the code, when we process that element (since it's a tuple), we append it to the output. So the implement spec (B,C) would be added as a tuple, and D as an individual. 

So that's correct. 

So the code is okay. 

I think this should work. Let me see if I can think of any edge cases. 

What if the sequence is empty? Then it returns an empty list. 

What if the sequence has a mix: [Declaration, (A,B), [C], D]. Then the Declaration's bases are processed, the tuple is added, the [C] is expanded into C, and D added. 

Yes. 

Another case: a Declaration whose bases is another list. 

So the code would flatten that. 

I think this code meets the requirements. 

Now, I need to write this code. The problem says to output only the code in Python markdown format. Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." Wait, maybe they mean to put the code within triple backticks as a code block? 

The example given in the problem shows a function with a docstring, so perhaps the code should be exactly that, but the function's body filled in. 

So the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    """
    Normalize declaration arguments

Normalization arguments might contain Declarions, tuples, or single
interfaces.

Anything but individial interfaces or implements specs will be expanded.
    """
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for elem in sequence:
        if isinstance(elem, Declaration):
            _normalizeargs(elem.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            output.append(elem)
        elif isinstance(elem, list):
            _normalizeargs(elem, output)
        else:
            output.append(elem)
    return output

Wait, but the problem mentions "Declarions" (probably a typo for Declarations). So assuming that the Declaration class is already defined elsewhere. 

So this code should be correct. 

Wait, but what if the elem is another type of iterable, like a generator or a set? The code currently only checks for lists. So in that case, the code would not expand sets. 

Hmm. The problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So perhaps the 'anything' includes all iterables except those two. 

So maybe the code should check for any iterable except strings and tuples. 

In that case, perhaps using a more general approach:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for elem in sequence:
        if isinstance(elem, Declaration):
            _normalizeargs(elem.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            output.append(elem)
        else:
            try:
                iter(elem)
                if not isinstance(elem, (str, bytes, bytearray)):
                    _normalizeargs(elem, output)
                else:
                    output.append(elem)
            except TypeError:
                output.append(elem)
    return output

Wait, but this uses the iter function to check if it's an iterable, excluding strings. 

This way, any iterable (like lists, sets, generators, etc.) except for strings and bytes would be treated as sequences to be expanded. 

But in the original problem's code, the function's docstring says "Declarions, tuples, or single interfaces". Maybe the user intended that only lists and Declarions are expanded, and other iterables (like sets) are treated as individual elements? 

Alternatively, the problem might consider that the sequence only contains lists, tuples, and Declaration instances. 

But to cover all possible iterables, the second approach is better. 

Hmm. The problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". So anything that is not an individual interface (so, not a non-iterable or a string) or not a tuple (implement spec), then it must be an iterable to be expanded. 

Wait, the 'individual interfaces' are the elements that are not iterables (or are strings). So the code would check if elem is an instance of Declaration: yes, then process its bases. 

Else, check if it's a tuple: add as is. 

Else, check if it's an iterable (excluding strings, bytes, etc.), then expand it. 

Else, add as individual. 

So the code using the try-except would be better. 

Let me adjust the code accordingly. 

So, the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for elem in sequence:
        if isinstance(elem, Declaration):
            _normalizeargs(elem.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            output.append(elem)
        else:
            try:
                iter(elem)
                if not isinstance(elem, (str, bytes, bytearray)):
                    _normalizeargs(elem, output)
                else:
                    output.append(elem)
            except TypeError:
                output.append(elem)
    return output

Wait, but using 'iter' might raise an exception if the element is not iterable. So the try-except is there. 

So, this code would handle any iterable except strings, and Declarions, by expanding them. 

Yes, this approach is more robust. 

Testing the code again. 

Take the case where elem is a set {X, Y} in the sequence. 

Processing that elem would be an iterable (since sets are iterable), not a string or tuple. So the code would call _normalizeargs on the set, which loops through each element in the set, adding them as individual elements (assuming they are not Declarions or tuples). 

So the set would be flattened. 

That's correct per the problem's statement. 

Another case: a generator. 

The code would process it as an iterable, so its elements would be expanded. 

Yes. 

So this code is better. 

But in the code above, the 'elem' is passed to _normalizeargs, which is a sequence. 

Wait, when we call _normalizeargs with elem (the iterable), like a set, then in the next iteration, each element in the set would be processed. 

Yes. 

So, this code should work. 

Now, I need to decide which approach to take. 

The problem might not expect the code to handle arbitrary iterables, but just lists and Declarions. 

But since the problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded", perhaps the 'anything' includes all other iterables. 

So I think the second approach is better. 

But the problem may have intended that the code only processes lists and Declaration instances, but not other iterables. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a framework where the sequence is a list, and the elements can be Declaration instances, tuples (implement specs), or other lists. 

In that case, the first code (checking for lists) is sufficient. 

The problem is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the first approach is better. 

Alternatively, maybe the code should check for list or Declaration instances. 

Wait, the first code handles lists, but not other iterables. 

Hmm. Since the problem's example mentions tuples and single interfaces, maybe the code is intended to handle lists as the only other iterables. 

So perhaps the first code is okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should treat any sequence (like lists, tuples, etc.) except the tuples that are implements specs. 

Wait, but tuples are the implements specs, so they should not be expanded. 

Wait, in the first code, the code checks if the elem is a list, then processes it. So a tuple would be added as is. 

But if the elem is a list, it's processed. 

So that's correct. 

Hmm. 

Well, given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the first code that checks for lists and Declaration instances. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to treat any non-string, non-tuple, non-Declaration iterable as needing to be expanded. 

The second code does that. 

But the problem may expect the first approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check if the element is an instance of a sequence (like a list) or a Declaration, then expand. 

So, the code using the first approach would be more straightforward. 

But since the problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded", then "anything" would refer to any element that is a container (like a list, Declaration, etc.) except tuples. 

So perhaps the better way is to check if the element is an iterable (excluding strings and tuples), then expand it. 

So let's go with the second code. 

Wait, but in the code above, the 'elem' could be any iterable except a string or tuple. 

Wait, in the code:

if the elem is a Declaration, process its bases (which is an iterable, perhaps a list or a tuple). 

Else, if it's a tuple: add as is. 

Else, check if it's an iterable (via try-except). 

If it is, and not a string, then process it (i.e., expand it). 

Else (non-iterable), add to output. 

Yes. 

So this code should work. 

Now, in the code, the Declaration is referenced. But since the user hasn't provided the Declaration class, perhaps in the function's context, Declaration is a known type. 

The code should be as written. 

Wait, but in the first code, the code uses 'elem.bases', so I need to make sure that the Declaration has a 'bases' attribute. 

Assuming that's the case. 

So the code would be:

def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for elem in sequence:
        if isinstance(elem, Declaration):
            _normalizeargs(elem.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            output.append(elem)
        else:
            try:
                iter(elem)
                if not isinstance(elem, (str, bytes, bytearray)):
                    _normalizeargs(elem, output)
                else:
                    output.append(elem)
            except TypeError:
                output.append(elem)
    return output

Hmm, but in the case where the elem is an instance of a class that is not a Declaration, but has an __iter__ method, like a custom iterable. 

Then the code would expand it. 

Which aligns with the problem's requirement. 

Yes. 

This code should work. 

Now, let me think if there's any other edge cases. 

What if the sequence contains a Declaration whose bases is a string? Like elem.bases is "SomeBase". 

Then, in that case, the string is not an iterable (except for characters), so when processing that Declaration's bases (the string), since it's not a Declaration or a tuple, the code would check if it's an iterable. 

Yes, the string is iterable, so the code would call _normalizeargs on it. 

Wait, but the string is a str, so in the try block, iter works, but then since it's a str, the code would check 'isinstance(elem, (str, ...))' and append it as a string. 

Wait, in the code above, after the try:

if not isinstance(elem, (str, bytes, bytearray)):

then, call _normalizeargs on the elem. 

Wait, the elem here is the element being processed. For example, if the element is a string, then iter works, but the code would check if it's a string, and then append it. 

Wait, the code is inside the else clause. Let me retrace:

The code loops over each elem in the sequence. 

The first check: if it's a Declaration instance → process its bases. 

Else, check if it's a tuple → append. 

Else, try to get an iterator for elem. 

If that succeeds, then check if it's a string-like → if yes, append it. 

If not, then it's an iterable (like list, set, etc.), so call _normalizeargs recursively, passing the elem (the iterable) and the output. 

If the try block fails (i.e., not iterable), then append the element as is. 

Wait, so in the case of a string (which is iterable), the code would reach the else clause of the first two conditions. Then, the try would pass (since a string is iterable), then check if it's a str. Since it is, then we append it to output. 

Yes, so strings are added as individual elements. 

So the code is correct. 

Another case: a generator. 

Suppose elem is a generator. Then iter(elem) is okay, and it's not a string, so the code would call _normalizeargs on the generator. 

But when you pass a generator to the function, the next loop would process each element of the generator. 

So that's correct. 

Okay, I think this code should handle all cases. 

Therefore, I'll write the code as above. 

Wait, but in the code, the 'elem.bases' is passed. What if the bases is a single element, not an iterable? Like a Declaration's bases is X, which is a class. 

Then, when processing the Declaration, we call _normalizeargs on X (the bases). 

Wait, but 'X' is a class (so an instance of type). 

In the function call, X is not a Declaration (assuming it's an interface), so the code would check if it's a tuple (no), then see if it's an iterable. 

If X is a class, then it's an instance of type, which is not an iterable. So the try block would raise a TypeError (since type has no __iter__ method?), so it would append X to the output. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Another case: the Declaration's bases is a list. 

Processing that would expand the list into its elements. 

So the code is correct. 

Therefore, the code is as above. 

Wait, but in the code, the 'elem' is passed as the sequence in the recursive call. 

Yes. 

Now, I'll write the code. 

But the user wants only the code in Python markdown format, so within triple backticks. 

Wait, the user says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." 

So perhaps:

```python
def _normalizeargs(sequence, output=None):
    if output is None:
        output = []
    for elem in sequence:
        if isinstance(elem, Declaration):
            _normalizeargs(elem.bases, output)
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            output.append(elem)
        else:
            try:
                iter(elem)
                if not isinstance(elem, (str, bytes, bytearray)):
                    _normalizeargs(elem, output)
                else:
                    output.append(elem)
            except TypeError:
                output.append(elem)
    return output
```

Yes, that's the code. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the code to treat the sequence as a list, and only process elements which are lists or Declaration instances. 

But the problem says "anything but individual interfaces or implements specs will be expanded". 

The 'anything' refers to any elements that are not individual interfaces (non-iterables) or tuples (implement specs). So any other iterable (like a list, tuple's elements, etc.) must be expanded. 

Wait, but the code's first condition is checking for Declaration instances, which are to be expanded. 

Then, any other iterable (not string or bytes) would be expanded. 

Yes, that's correct. 

So I think this code should work. 

Now, I need to make sure that I'm not adding any explanations. The user wants only the code, in Python markdown format (so within ```python ... ```).

Wait, the user also said "do NOT include any explanation, reasoning, or markdown formatting". 

Wait, the problem says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." 

Hmm, perhaps they mean to put the code in a code block. So the triple backticks with 'python' are part of the markdown format. 

Therefore, the code should be enclosed in ```python ... ```.

So the final code as above in the Python code block. 

Yes, that's the code.
