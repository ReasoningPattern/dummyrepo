Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called _parse_image_ref that takes an image_href string and returns a tuple with image_id, netloc, and a boolean use_ssl. The docstring mentions raising a ValueError, so I should handle cases where the input isn't properly formatted.

First, I remember that the image_href probably follows a URL structure. The function needs to parse out the image ID, the network location (netloc), and determine if SSL is used (like https). 

Hmm, the user mentioned using urllib. Oh right, the standard library's urlparse can help here. So I should import urlparse from urllib.parse. Wait, the docstring says "import urllib" but maybe they meant to use urlparse. Let me make sure.

The steps I need to take are: parse the URL, extract the path to get the image ID, check the scheme to see if it's https. Let's think about the URL structure. For example, a URL like https://example.com/images/12345 might have the scheme as https, netloc as example.com, and the path would be /images/12345. The image ID here is 12345, so I need to split the path and take the last part.

Wait, but what if the path ends with a slash? Like https://example.com/images/12345/ then the split might give an empty string. So I should make sure to take the second to last part in that case. Maybe split on '/' and get the non-empty last element.

Also, the netloc is straightforward from the parsed URL. The use_ssl is True if the scheme is https, else False. But what if there's no scheme specified? Like if the image_href is just "//example.com/images/12345", which is protocol-relative. Then the scheme is empty, but the netloc is example.com. In that case, should we assume SSL? The problem says to return use_ssl, so maybe if the scheme is https, then True, else False. But the input might not have a scheme. The docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the function requires the scheme to be present. Otherwise, it should raise a ValueError.

So the plan is: parse the image_href with urlparse. Check if the scheme is http or https. If not, maybe raise an error. Wait, the function's return includes use_ssl, which is a boolean. So if the scheme is http, use_ssl is False. If https, then True. But if there's no scheme, like a relative URL, that's a problem. The function should raise ValueError in such cases.

Wait, the parameters are supposed to be the href of an image. So maybe the image_href is a full URL. Let's think of possible valid formats. The function might need to handle URLs like "http://site.com/id123", "https://site.com/id456", or maybe "https://site.com/some/path/with/id/1234/image.jpg" where the image ID is 1234 or "image.jpg"? The problem isn't clear. The example in the docstring's return is (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So perhaps the image ID is the last part of the path after the last slash. Like in "https://example.com/images/12345", the image_id is "12345". If the path ends with a slash, maybe the ID is the previous part.

Alternatively, maybe the image_href is structured in a specific way. Like the path is something like "/images/{id}", so splitting by '/' and taking the third part? Not sure. The problem's example isn't given, so perhaps the image ID is the final path segment, regardless of what comes before. So I'll split the path into parts, take the last part that's not empty. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Use urlparse to parse the image_href. 

2. Check if the scheme is either http or https. If not, raise ValueError.

3. Extract the netloc from the parsed URL. That's easy.

4. Determine use_ssl: True if scheme is https, else False.

5. For the image_id: take the path, split by '/', filter out empty strings (since splitting a path starting or ending with '/' gives empty elements), then take the last element. So for example, the path "/a/b/c/" would split into ['', 'a', 'b', 'c', ''], but after filtering, it's ['a', 'b', 'c'], so last element is 'c'. If the path is "/a/b/c", then after split and filtering, it's ['a','b','c'], so image_id is 'c'.

But what if the path is just "/"? Then the image_id would be empty. That's an invalid case. So maybe the path must have at least two parts (after splitting and filtering) to extract an image ID. Otherwise, raise ValueError?

Wait, the function's return is supposed to have image_id as a string. So if the path doesn't have a final segment (like the root path), then perhaps that's an error. So the function should check that the path has at least one non-empty part after splitting. 

Wait, let's think of some examples. Suppose the input is "http://example.com/1234" — the path is "/1234", split gives ['', '1234'], filtered would be ['1234'], so image_id is '1234'. 

Another example: "https://example.com/images/5678/" — the path is "/images/5678/", split into ['', 'images', '5678', ''], so after filtering, the last element is '5678'. That works. 

But if the path is just "/images/", then after filtering, the parts would be ['images'], so last part is 'images'? Or maybe that's not acceptable. The function might require that the path has at least two segments. Like, the image ID must be present. So maybe if the path parts (after filtering) have less than two elements, then it's invalid. Wait, not sure. The problem's docstring doesn't specify the exact format of image_href. So perhaps the function just takes the last part of the path, even if it's empty? No, that would return an empty string. So the function should check that the path isn't empty and that the last part is not empty. 

Alternatively, maybe the image_href is something like a URL where the image ID is the last segment. So in cases where there is no such segment, we raise an error. 

So steps again:

Parse the URL. 

Check that the scheme is http or https. If not, raise ValueError. 

Check that the path is not empty. Also, after splitting, the parts must have at least one element. 

Wait, let's code this step by step. 

First, import the necessary modules. The function's return is a tuple of strings and a bool. So need to import urlparse from urllib.parse. 

Wait, the function signature says to return a tuple (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So netloc is the domain, image_id is the last part of the path. 

So code steps:

from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed_url = urlparse(image_href)
    if parsed_url.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid scheme; must be http or https")
    
    netloc = parsed_url.netloc
    use_ssl = parsed_url.scheme == 'https'
    
    path = parsed_url.path.strip('/')
    parts = path.split('/')
    if not parts or not parts[-1]:
        raise ValueError("Invalid path; must have an image ID")
        
    image_id = parts[-1]
    
    return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but urlparse might split the path into something. Let me test the urlparse behavior. 

For example, if image_href is "http://example.com/images/123", then parsed_url.path is "/images/123". So stripping the '/' gives "images/123", then splitting by '/' gives ['images', '123'], so image_id is '123'. 

But in the code above, after stripping, the path becomes "images/123", then split on '/' gives exactly the parts. So parts[-1] is '123'. 

Wait, but if the path is "/images/123/", stripping the leading and trailing '/' would leave "images/123", so split into parts would be ['images', '123'], so image_id is '123'. 

Wait, the code above uses path.strip('/') to remove leading and trailing slashes. Then split by '/'. 

Wait, let me see: 

Suppose the path is "/abc/def/". Stripping the '/' gives "abc/def", splitting by '/' gives ['abc', 'def']. So the last part is 'def', which is correct. 

Another case: path is "/". Stripping the '/' leaves an empty string, so parts would be ['']? Wait no, if path is '/', then parsed_url.path is '/', so stripping gives empty string. So parts = empty list. 

In that case, the code checks if not parts (which would be True) or not parts[-1] (but parts is empty, so accessing parts[-1] would cause an error). So maybe I need to handle that. 

Alternatively, maybe the path should be split and filtered. Let me think of another approach. 

Take the path, split by '/', then filter out empty strings. So for example, parsed_url.path.split('/') gives a list where empty elements are the start (if path starts with /) and the end (if ends with /). So using list comprehension to filter out empty strings. 

Like parts = [p for p in parsed_url.path.split('/') if p]

Then, if len(parts) == 0, that means the path was just a single slash (like "/"), so that's invalid. 

If parts has at least one element, then image_id is parts[-1]. 

So that would be better. 

So modifying the code:

path_parts = parsed_url.path.split('/')
non_empty = [p for p in path_parts if p]
if len(non_empty) < 1:
    raise ValueError("Path must contain image ID")

Wait, but the path could be empty. Like if the URL is "http://example.com", then the path is empty. So the non_empty list would be empty, so that's invalid. 

So the function would need to ensure that the path has at least one non-empty part. 

So the code would be:

parsed = urlparse(image_href)
scheme = parsed.scheme
if not scheme or scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
    raise ValueError("Invalid scheme; must be http or https")

netloc = parsed.netloc
use_ssl = (scheme == 'https')

path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
non_empty_path = [p for p in path_parts if p]
if not non_empty_path:
    raise ValueError("Path is empty, must have image ID")

image_id = non_empty_path[-1]

return (image_id, netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the netloc could also be empty? Like if the URL is just "http://", then netloc is empty. So we need to check that netloc is not empty as well. 

Wait, the problem's docstring doesn't mention that, but maybe that's part of the error checking. 

So perhaps the code should check that netloc is not empty. So adding:

if not netloc:
    raise ValueError("Missing netloc in URL")

Also, what if the path is something like "/images/someimage.jpg"? Then image_id would be "someimage.jpg". That's acceptable. 

So putting all that together:

Wait, but in the code, the parsed.scheme would be 'http' or 'https', but if the URL is given as "//example.com/path", then the scheme is empty, but the netloc is example.com. So in that case, the first check would fail, because scheme is empty. So the function requires that the URL has a scheme. 

So the code would proceed as:

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    from urllib.parse import urlparse
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid scheme; must be http or https")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Missing netloc in URL")
    path_parts = parsed.path.strip('/').split('/')  # Wait, maybe better to split and filter as before. 

    non_empty = [p for p in parsed.path.split('/') if p]
    if not non_empty:
        raise ValueError("Invalid path; must have an image ID")
    image_id = non_empty[-1]
    use_ssl = (parsed.scheme == 'https')
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the netloc is a string like 'example.com:80' if there's a port. But the problem's return is netloc as a string, so that's okay. 

Another possible case: the path is empty. Like "http://example.com" — then the path is "/", so stripping would make it empty. So non_empty would be empty, so that's invalid. 

So the code above would raise an error in that case. 

What about if the path is just "/id123"? Then non_empty is ['id123'], so image_id is that. 

So that should work. 

Now, the function's docstring says it raises ValueError, so all the cases where the URL is missing scheme, missing netloc, or path without image ID should trigger that. 

Wait, but in the code above, the first check is for parsed.scheme in ('http', 'https'). If the scheme is empty (like if the URL is missing it), then that condition would fail, so the code raises ValueError. 

So that's covered. 

The netloc check is also covered. 

So putting it all together. Also, need to import the necessary modules. But the function is supposed to have the import inside? Wait, the user's docstring says "import urllib" but that's probably a typo. Because urlparse is in urllib.parse, but the standard way is to do from urllib.parse import urlparse. 

Wait, the code inside the function can have the import? Well, in Python, you can import inside a function, but it's not common. But the user's docstring includes "import urllib" — maybe they want to have that line inside? 

Hmm, the function's docstring has a line "import urllib". So perhaps the code should include that. But then, urlparse would be in urllib.parse. So maybe the code should do:

import urllib
from urllib.parse import urlparse

Wait, but if I do "import urllib" and then use urlparse, that's not correct. Because urlparse is in the parse submodule. So perhaps the code should import the parse module, but that's less efficient. 

Alternatively, maybe the user just wants the import statement as part of the function. 

Wait, perhaps the user intended that. Let me see. The function's docstring says "import urllib" — maybe that's part of the code. 

So in the code, inside the function, do:

import urllib
parsed = urllib.parse.urlparse(image_href)

But that would work. Although, importing inside the function every time it's called is a bit inefficient, but for the problem's sake, maybe that's required. 

Wait, but the function's signature is given, so perhaps the code should have the import inside the function? 

Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the docstring, but I have to follow exactly. 

The docstring says "import urllib" in the first line. So perhaps the code should include that import statement. 

Wait, but in the function, to parse the URL, you have to use urlparse from urllib.parse. So maybe the code should start with importing that. 

But the problem says to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The docstring's first line says "Parse an image href into composite parts import urllib." Oh wait, maybe that's a mistake, and the actual line is part of the function's docstring. Like the user might have intended to write "Parse an image href into composite parts. Import urllib." but it's all in one line. 

Alternatively, perhaps the "import urllib" is part of the function's instructions. Like, the function should use urllib. So I can structure the code as:

Inside the function, first do:

from urllib.parse import urlparse

But since the function is part of a module, the import would be at the top. However, if the code is supposed to include the import inside, then perhaps the user wants that. 

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The standard practice is to have the import at the top, but the problem says to generate code based on the given docstring. The docstring includes "import urllib" as part of its text. Wait, looking back at the problem's description:

The user provided the function signature and docstring. The docstring starts with:

Parse an image href into composite parts import urllib.

Ah, that's probably a typo. They meant to say "Parse an image href into composite parts. Import urllib." So perhaps the code should include the import statement. But in a Python function, you can't have an import inside the function's docstring. Wait, no, the import is part of the code, not the docstring. The docstring's first line has a typo. 

So I should proceed to use the urlparse function from urllib.parse. So the code would need to have that imported. But since the function is supposed to be self-contained (maybe), perhaps the code should include the necessary imports inside the function. But that's not typical. Alternatively, the code will have the import at the top. 

Wait the problem says to output the code generated, in Python markdown format, but the code must be inside the function? Or no. The code should be the function, but the imports would be outside. 

Wait, but the user's instruction says: "Generate Python code based on the following function signature and docstring." So the code should include the function and any necessary imports. 

But the function's docstring includes "import urllib" — perhaps that's a mistake. So I should include the proper import at the top. 

Wait, the user might have intended that the code should use urllib, so the correct way is to import from urllib.parse. 

So, putting it all together, the code would start with:

from urllib.parse import urlparse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid scheme; must be http or https")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Missing netloc in URL")
    path_parts = parsed.path.strip('/').split('/')
    non_empty = [p for p in path_parts if p]
    if not non_empty:
        raise ValueError("Invalid path; must have an image ID")
    image_id = non_empty[-1]
    use_ssl = (parsed.scheme == 'https')
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but I think the path_parts is redundant. Let me see:

parsed.path is something like "/a/b/c/". Splitting on '/' gives ['', 'a', 'b', 'c', '']. 

Then, stripping the leading and trailing '/' gives "a/b/c", then splitting on '/' gives ['a', 'b', 'c']. So that way, the last part is 'c', which is correct. 

Alternatively, using the list comprehension [p for p in parsed.path.split('/') if p] would give ['a', 'b', 'c'] from the same example. 

So either approach works. 

Wait, perhaps the code can be simplified. Let's try this:

path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
non_empty = [p for p in path_parts if p]
if len(non_empty) < 1:
    raise ValueError("Path must contain image ID")

image_id = non_empty[-1]

So that's better. 

Wait, in the first code I thought of, the path was stripped of leading/trailing '/', then split, but that might be error-prone. 

So the list comprehension is better. 

So the code steps would be:

Parse the URL.

Check scheme is http or https. 

Check netloc is not empty. 

Check that the path has at least one non-empty part. 

Take the last non-empty part as the image_id. 

Set use_ssl based on the scheme. 

So putting it all together. 

Wait, what about if the path is empty (like the URL is "http://example.com")? Then parsed.path is "/", so splitting gives ['', ''], and the list comprehension would have non_empty = [p for p in ['', ''] if p], which is empty. So that triggers the error. 

Another case: "https://example.com/some/image123" — the path is "/some/image123", split into ['', 'some', 'image123'], so non_empty is ['some', 'image123'], so image_id is 'image123'.

That's correct. 

What about "http://example.com/123"? The path is "/123" → split into ['', '123'], so non_empty is ['123'] → image_id is '123'.

Yes. 

So the code should do:

from urllib.parse import urlparse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid scheme; must be http or https")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Missing netloc in URL")
    path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
    non_empty = [part for part in path_parts if part]
    if not non_empty:
        raise ValueError("Path must contain an image ID")
    image_id = non_empty[-1]
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)

Wait, but the function's return is (image_id, netloc, use_ssl). So the netloc is correct as parsed.netloc. 

This should cover the cases. 

Now, possible edge cases:

- image_href is "http://example.com/": path is "/" → non_empty is empty → error.

- image_href is "https://example.com/abc": path is "/abc" → parts are ['', 'abc'] → non_empty is ['abc'], so image_id is 'abc'.

- "http://example.com/abc/def" → non_empty is ['abc', 'def'] → image_id is 'def'.

- "http://example.com/abc/def/" → path is "/abc/def/" → split into ['', 'abc', 'def', ''] → non_empty is ['abc', 'def'] → image_id 'def'.

All correct. 

Another case: "http://example.com/abc/def/ghi.jpg" → non_empty parts are abc, def, ghi.jpg → image_id is ghi.jpg. 

That's acceptable. 

Now, what if the path is empty (like "http://example.com") → parsed.path is "/" → so non_empty is empty → error. 

Another possible error: if the image_href is missing the path? Like "http://example.com" → the path is "/", so it's okay as long as there's something after the domain. 

Wait, no, in that case, the path is just "/", so the non_empty list would be empty. So that's invalid. 

So the code is correct. 

What about if the URL has query parameters? Like "http://example.com/1234?size=large" → the path is "/1234" → so image_id is '1234' which is correct. 

The query part is ignored, which is fine because the function only cares about the path. 

So that's okay. 

Now, the function must return a tuple of (str, str, bool). So all parts are correct. 

Now, the docstring mentions raises ValueError, so the function must have those raise statements. 

Therefore, the code should be as above. 

Wait, but in the code, after the first two checks, the path parts are split. 

Wait, in the code I wrote, the first check is on parsed.scheme. So if the URL is missing the scheme, like "www.example.com/123", then urlparse would parse it as scheme empty, so that would raise ValueError. 

Yes. 

Another possible case: the URL is "http://example.com:8080/path/id" → netloc is 'example.com:8080', but that's okay. The netloc is returned as a string. 

So the code should work. 

I think that's the code. Let me make sure to include the necessary imports. The function uses urlparse, so from urllib.parse import urlparse. Also, the return type is a tuple, so from typing import Tuple. 

The user's function signature includes the return type, so those imports are needed. 

Therefore, the code should start with the imports, then the function. 

Wait, but the problem says to output only the code generated, in Python markdown format. So perhaps they want the code enclosed in triple backticks? 

Wait the user's instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." 

Ah, so the code should be written with the markdown code block syntax. 

So the final code would be:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from typing import Tuple

def _parse_image_ref(image_href: str) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
    parsed = urlparse(image_href)
    if parsed.scheme not in ('http', 'https'):
        raise ValueError("Invalid scheme; must be http or https")
    if not parsed.netloc:
        raise ValueError("Missing netloc in URL")
    path_parts = parsed.path.split('/')
    non_empty = [part for part in path_parts if part]
    if not non_empty:
        raise ValueError("Path must contain an image ID")
    image_id = non_empty[-1]
    use_ssl = parsed.scheme == 'https'
    return (image_id, parsed.netloc, use_ssl)
```

Wait, but in the list comprehension, path_parts is split on '/', then non_empty is the filtered list. 

Wait, I think that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the path_parts is not needed. Let me see:

non_empty = [part for part in parsed.path.split('/') if part]

Yes, that's the same. 

Another possible error: if the path is empty (but the URL has a scheme and netloc). For example, "http://example.com" → path is "/" → split into ['', ''] → non_empty is empty → error. 

So that's handled. 

I think this code should work. Let me check if the parameters are properly handled. 

The function takes image_href as a string, parses it, and returns the three parts. 

Yes. 

Now, what if the image_href is "https://example.com//id123"? The path is "//id123", split into ['', '', 'id123'] → non_empty is ['id123'] → image_id is correct. 

Yes. 

Another case: "https://example.com/id123?query=1" → the path is "/id123", so image_id is 'id123'. 

That's correct. 

I think that's it. The code should work as required.
