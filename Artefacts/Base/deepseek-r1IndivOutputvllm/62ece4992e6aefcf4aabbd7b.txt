To generate Python code based on the provided function signature and docstring, we need to handle file operations safely. The function should check if the target file exists and decide whether to create it, truncate it, or proceed without writing if it exists. Additionally, it should set the appropriate file permissions using the given mode.

Here is the code:

```python
import os
import yaml

def write_configuration(config_filename, rendered_config, mode=0o600, overwrite=False):
    """
    Given a rendered config YAML, write it out to target file.
    But if the file already exists and overwrite is False,
    abort before writing anything.
    If the file does not exist, create it.
    Write to the file otherwise.

    Returns: None
    """
    if os.path.exists(config_filename):
        if not overwrite:
            raise ValueError("File exists and overwrite is False, cannot proceed")
        else:
            with open(config_filename, 'wb') as f:
                f.write(rendered_config)
    else:
        with open(config_filename, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(rendered_config)
    os.chmod(config_filename, mode)
```
