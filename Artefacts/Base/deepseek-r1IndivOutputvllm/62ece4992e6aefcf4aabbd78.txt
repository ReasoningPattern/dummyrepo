To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given host is the local host, which can be represented in several forms such as 'localhost', '127.0.0.1', or a combination of a username and domain name (e.g., 'user@localhost'). The function should return `True` if the host is the local host and `False` otherwise.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1. **Check if the host is an integer**: If the host is an integer, we attempt to convert it to an IPv4 address. If it matches `127.0.0.1`, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

2. **Check if the host is a string**: If the host is a string, we perform several checks:
   - Use `socket.gethostbyname` to resolve the hostname. If it resolves to `127.0.0.1`, we return `True`.
   - Directly check if the string is exactly 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'.
   - Split the string at '@' to separate the username and hostname. If the hostname part is 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1', we return `True`.
   - Check if the string contains a '.', indicating an IPv4 address. If it does, attempt to convert it to an IPv4 address and compare it to `127.0.0.1`.

### Solution Code
```python
import ipaddress
import socket

def is_local(host):
    if isinstance(host, int):
        try:
            ip = ipaddress.IPv4Address(str(host))
            return ip == ipaddress.IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
        except ValueError:
            return False
    elif isinstance(host, str):
        try:
            resolved = socket.gethostbyname(host)
            if resolved == '127.0.0.1':
                return True
        except socket.error:
            pass
        
        if host == 'localhost' or host == '127.0.0.1':
            return True
        
        if '@' in host:
            parts = host.split('@')
            if len(parts) != 2:
                return False
            _, hostname = parts
            return hostname == 'localhost' or hostname == '127.0.0.1'
        
        if '.' in host:
            try:
                ip = ipaddress.IPv4Address(host)
                return ip == ipaddress.IPv4Address('127.0.0.1')
            except ValueError:
                pass
        
        return False
    else:
        return False
```

### Explanation
- **Integer Check**: If the host is an integer, it is converted to a string and checked against `127.0.0.1` using IPv4 address conversion.
- **String Check**: For string hosts, the function first tries to resolve the hostname using `socket.gethostbyname`. If this fails, it directly checks for 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. If the host contains '@', it splits the string and checks the hostname part. Additionally, if the string contains '.', it is treated as an IPv4 address and checked against `127.0.0.1`.

This approach ensures that all valid forms of the local host are correctly identified, covering cases such as direct strings, IPv4 addresses, and username:hostname pairs.
