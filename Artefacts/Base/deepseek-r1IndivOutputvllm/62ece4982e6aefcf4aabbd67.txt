To solve this problem, we need to generate a list of tuples where each tuple represents a vertex of a polygon along with its two adjacent vertices. The vertices are given in a list, and if the subscript is out of bounds, we treat it as 0.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: Each vertex in a polygon has two adjacent vertices. For example, the first vertex has the last vertex and the second vertex as its neighbors, and the last vertex has the second-to-last vertex and the first vertex as its neighbors.

2. **Handling Out-of-Bounds Indices**: If the index calculation for the left or right neighbor results in an out-of-bounds value, we treat it as 0. This ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the polygon's vertices.

3. **Circular Indexing**: To correctly handle the neighbors of the first and last vertices, we use modulo arithmetic to wrap around the list. This way, the left neighbor of the first vertex is the last vertex, and the right neighbor of the last vertex is the first vertex.

### Solution Code

```python
def vertex3tuple(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        left = vertices[(i - 1) % n]
        current = vertices[i]
        right = vertices[(i + 1) % n]
        result.append((left, current, right))
    return result
```

### Explanation
- **Circular Indexing**: The code uses modulo arithmetic to handle the neighbors of the first and last vertices. For each vertex at index `i`, the left neighbor is found using `(i - 1) % n` and the right neighbor using `(i + 1) % n`. This ensures that the indices wrap around correctly within the bounds of the list.
- **Result Construction**: For each vertex, the code constructs a tuple containing the left neighbor, the current vertex, and the right neighbor. These tuples are collected into a list which is returned as the result.

This approach efficiently handles the circular nature of polygon vertices and ensures that each vertex is correctly paired with its adjacent vertices, even when the indices are out of bounds.
