```python
def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in reversed(nodes):
        for k, v in node.items():
            if k in result:
                existing = result[k]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(v, dict):
                    merged = deep_merge_nodes([v, existing])
                    result[k].update(merged)
            else:
                result[k] = v
    return result
```

Wait, I just realized there's a mistake here. In the code I outlined earlier, when merging two dictionaries, the code calls deep_merge_nodes with [v, existing], then assigns the merged result to existing. But in the code above, the line `result[k].update(merged)` would modify the existing value in-place, which is not correct. The original code I thought of was to assign `result[k] = merged`, but in the code above, there's a mistake. 

Let me correct that. The code should replace the existing value with the merged value, not update it in place. Because in-place update might not handle all the merging steps properly. 

So the correct code should be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in reversed(nodes):
        for k, v in node.items():
            if k in result:
                existing = result[k]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(v, dict):
                    merged = deep_merge_nodes([v, existing])
                    result[k] = merged
            else:
                result[k] = v
    return result

Wait, but in this case, when merging two dictionaries, the merged is the result of merging the list [v, existing], so the existing (the later one in original list) is the second element, so its values take precedence. 

Therefore, the code is correct. 

But in my first written code, I had an error where I used .update, which is incorrect. 

The correct code is as above. 

So the final code should be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in reversed(nodes):
        for k, v in node.items():
            if k in result:
                existing = result[k]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(v, dict):
                    merged = deep_merge_nodes([v, existing])
                    result[k] = merged
            else:
                result[k] = v
    return result

Wait, but in the case of merging two dictionaries, the code would call deep_merge_nodes with [v, existing], which are the two dictionaries. 

The function would process those two, returning their merged result. 

Thus, the code is correct. 

Ah, okay, so the correct code is the one I initially thought of. 

Therefore, the final code should be:

def deep_merge_nodes(nodes):
    result = {}
    for node in reversed(nodes):
        for k, v in node.items():
            if k in result:
                existing = result[k]
                if isinstance(existing, dict) and isinstance(v, dict):
                    merged = deep_merge_nodes([v, existing])
                    result[k] = merged
            else:
                result[k] = v
    return result

Wait, but in this code, the first call for the 'a' key in the example of two dictionaries would return the correct merged value. 

Yes. 

So I think the code is correct now. 

The previous mistake was using .update, which is incorrect because the existing value is part of the result and merging should replace it with a new dict. 

Thus, the correct code is the one above without the .update. 

Wait, but in the code above, when merging the two dictionaries, the merged is assigned to result[k], so that's correct. 

Therefore, the final code is as written.
