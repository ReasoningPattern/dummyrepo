Okay, I need to write a Python function called _resolve_string based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what it does. The docstring says it gets a value from the environment using a matcher that has a name and an optional default value in its group dict. If the variable isn't in the environment and there's no default, it raises an error.

First, the function takes a matcher as an argument. I assume that the matcher is some object that has a group dict. Maybe it's a regex match object? Like from re module. So, the group dict would have keys like 'name' and possibly 'default'.

So, the steps are: extract the name from the matcher's group dict. Check if there's a default value. Then, look up the environment variable with that name. If it exists, return its value. If not, check if a default is provided. If yes, return the default. If no, raise an error.

Wait, how do I access the environment variables? Using os.environ.get. But if the variable isn't present, that returns None. So, I need to check if the value is None. But if there's a default in the group dict, use that. Otherwise, raise an error.

So, let's break it down. The matcher's group dict probably has a key for the variable name. Let's say the name is in group('name'). Then, the default might be in group('default') or something similar. But the exact keys depend on how the matcher is structured. The problem statement says the matcher contains a name and an optional default in its group dict. So maybe the group dict has 'name' and 'default' keys.

So, first get the name: name = matcher.groupdict()['name']. Then check if 'default' is in the group dict. If it is, get the default value. Then check if the environment variable exists. If not and no default, raise an error. Otherwise, return the environment value or the default.

Wait, but the default in the group dict might be a string, like the value from a regex group. So, perhaps the matcher is a regex match where the name is captured in a group, and the default is another group. For example, a pattern like r'(\w+)(?:=(.*))?' where the first group is the name and the second is the default.

So, the code would be something like:

import os

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    group_dict = matcher.groupdict()
    name = group_dict['name']
    default = group_dict.get('default')
    value = os.environ.get(name)
    if value is None:
        if default is not None:
            return default
        else:
            raise Error("Variable not found in environment and no default provided")
    else:
        return value

Wait, but the Error mentioned in the docstring—is that a specific exception? Like KeyError or ValueError? The user probably expects a specific error. But the original code might use a custom exception. However, since the user didn't specify, maybe using a ValueError or KeyError is acceptable. But the docstring says "an Error is raised"—maybe they meant a general exception. However, in Python, it's better to use specific exceptions. Let me check the standard practice. For environment variables, if not found, usually KeyError is raised, but os.environ.get returns None. So perhaps the function should raise a KeyError if the variable is not present and no default is given.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects a custom error. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'll use KeyError. Or perhaps the original code uses a different exception. Hmm, but the docstring says "Error", which is a general term. However, in Python, the standard would be to use KeyError or ValueError. Let me think. If the variable is not found, and no default is provided, it's an error condition. So maybe raise a ValueError with a message.

Wait, the user's docstring says "an Error is raised"—maybe they want a specific exception. But since the code is to be generated, perhaps the user expects using a KeyError. Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a larger system where a specific exception is used. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps using a ValueError is safer, but I need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the matcher's group dict has a 'default' key, and if that's present, use it. Otherwise, check the environment. If the environment doesn't have it, raise an error.

So, the code would be:

import os

def _resolve_string(matcher):
    group_dict = matcher.groupdict()
    name = group_dict['name']
    default = group_dict.get('default')
    value = os.environ.get(name)
    if value is None:
        if default is not None:
            return default
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Environment variable '{name}' not found and no default provided")
    return value

But wait, maybe the matcher is from a regex that captures the name and default. For example, if the regex is something like r'\$(\w+)(?::\$(.*))?', then groupdict would have 'name' and 'default' keys. So, the code would extract those.

Another thing: the function is named _resolve_string, which suggests it's a helper function. The user might be using it in a context where the matcher is a regex match object. So, the code should assume that matcher.groupdict() exists and has the necessary keys.

But what if the 'name' key is not present in the group dict? The problem says the matcher contains a name, so perhaps it's guaranteed. But maybe the code should handle that? However, the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps it's assumed that the matcher has the 'name' key.

So, the code as above should work. Let me test it in my mind. If the matcher's group dict has 'name' as 'FOO' and no 'default', then it checks os.environ.get('FOO'). If that's None, raises ValueError. If the group dict has 'default' as 'bar', then returns 'bar' if FOO isn't in the environment.

Yes, that seems to fit the docstring. So the code would be as written.
