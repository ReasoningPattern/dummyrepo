Okay, I need to write a Python function called string_to_int that converts a string into an integer based on a given alphabet. Let me think about how to approach this.

The function takes two parameters: a string and a list of letters called alphabet. The string is made up of characters from the alphabet. The goal is to convert this string into a number. Hmm, probably similar to how numbers are represented in different bases. Like, each character in the string represents a digit in a base equal to the length of the alphabet.

Wait, right. For example, if the alphabet has 10 letters, it's like base 10. Each position in the string is a digit, and the value is the sum of each character's index multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position. But how exactly?

Let me think. Let's say the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], so base 3. The string 'ba' would be 'b' (index 1) followed by 'a' (index 0). So the calculation would be 1 * 3^1 + 0 * 3^0 = 3 + 0 = 3. That makes sense. So each character's value is its index in the alphabet, and the total is the sum of each digit multiplied by the base to the power of its position from the right, starting at 0.

So the steps are: For each character in the string, find its index in the alphabet. Then, treat the string as a number in base len(alphabet), converting it to an integer.

But how to implement this in Python. Let's see. The function needs to process each character. Let's start with initializing the result as 0. Then, for each character in the string, multiply the current result by the length of the alphabet and add the index of the current character.

Wait, that's the standard way to convert a string to a number in a given base. Like, for each digit, you do result = result * base + digit_value.

Yes. So for the string 'abc' with alphabet ['a', 'b', 'c'], the base is 3. The first character 'a' is 0, then result becomes 0*3 + 0 = 0. Next 'b' is 1: 0*3 +1 =1. Then 'c' is 2: 1*3 +2 =5. So the total is 5. But wait, if the string is longer, like 'ba', then it's 1*3 +0 =3. That seems correct.

So the algorithm is:

Initialize num = 0

For each char in the string:

    num = num * len(alphabet) + index_of_char_in_alphabet

But I need to make sure that each character is present in the alphabet. The docstring says the string consists of letters in the alphabet, so maybe we don't need to handle invalid characters. But perhaps the code should check for that? The problem statement says the string is made of letters in the alphabet, so maybe it's safe to assume that all characters are valid.

So, first, get the base as the length of the alphabet. Then, iterate over each character in the string. For each character, find its index in the alphabet. Then apply the formula.

Now, code-wise, the alphabet is a list. So for a given character, we can use the list's index method. But what if the alphabet has duplicate letters? The problem says the string consists of letters in the alphabet, but the alphabet is a list. However, in typical scenarios, the alphabet would be unique, like a list of distinct characters. So assuming that each character in the alphabet is unique, and the index method will return the correct position.

So the code would be:

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    base = len(alphabet)
    num = 0
    for char in string:
        num = num * base + alphabet.index(char)
    return num

Wait, but what about the order? Let's say the alphabet is ['a', 'b', 'c'], then 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, 'c' is 2. The string is processed left to right, so each time, multiply by base and add the next digit. That should work.

Testing with 'ba' would be:

num starts at 0.

First char 'b' → index 1 → num = 0 * 3 + 1 = 1.

Second char 'a' → index 0 → num = 1 * 3 + 0 = 3. Which is correct.

Another example: 'abc' with base 3. The result would be 0*3 +0 =0, then 0*3 +1=1, then 1*3 +2=5. Which is 5, which is correct for the string 'abc' in base 3.

Yes, that seems right. So the code should be straightforward. But need to import List from typing. Oh, the function signature uses List[str], so the code should have from typing import List at the top.

But the user didn't mention including imports. However, the code needs to be valid. So in the generated code, I should include the necessary import.

Wait, the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring, but the function signature uses List from typing. So the code must have the import statement.

So the code would start with:

from typing import List

def string_to_int(string: str, alphabet: List[str]) -> int:
    base = len(alphabet)
    num = 0
    for char in string:
        num = num * base + alphabet.index(char)
    return num

But wait, what if the alphabet is empty? Well, the function's parameters probably assume that the alphabet is non-empty and contains the characters of the string. But since the problem says that the string consists of letters in the alphabet, maybe the alphabet is guaranteed to be non-empty and contain all the characters. So no need to handle that case.

Another thing: the index method is O(n) for each character. If the alphabet is large, this could be inefficient. But for the scope of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, we could create a dictionary for O(1) lookups. But the problem didn't mention performance, so the straightforward approach is probably okay.

So the code should be as written. Let me check for edge cases. For example, empty string? The problem says the string consists of letters in the alphabet. But if the string is empty, what's the return value? The function returns 0, which is correct since an empty string would represent zero in any base.

Another edge case: single character. For example, string is 'a', alphabet is ['a'], then base is 1. But in base 1, the number would be 0 (since 'a' is index 0). But base 1 is a unary system, but maybe the code handles that. However, in practice, base 1 is not standard, but the code would still compute it as 0.

But according to the problem statement, the string is made of letters in the alphabet, so if the alphabet is of length 1, the string can only be that single character. So the code would return 0 for that.

I think that's acceptable. So the code is correct.
