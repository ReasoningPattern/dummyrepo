Okay, I need to write a Python function called subclasses that returns all subclasses of a given class recursively. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in Python, a class can have subclasses, and those subclasses can have their own subclasses. So the function needs to collect all of them, not just the direct ones. How do I get all subclasses of a class?

The built-in function getattr might be useful here. Oh right, the __subclasses__ method of a class returns its direct subclasses. But to get all subclasses recursively, I need to go through each of those and their subclasses as well.

So maybe I can use a recursive approach. Start with the direct subclasses, then for each of those, get their subclasses, and so on. But how to avoid duplicates? Like, if a subclass is already added, I don't want to add it again. So perhaps using a set to collect all the subclasses would help.

Wait, but the __subclasses__ method might not return all possible subclasses if they're not directly derived. Hmm, but according to the Python documentation, the __subclasses__() method returns all direct subclasses. So to get all subclasses recursively, I need to iterate through each direct subclass and then their subclasses, etc.

So here's the plan: Use a set to store all subclasses. Start with the direct subclasses of the given class. Then for each subclass in that set, recursively get their subclasses and add them to the set. Finally, return the set.

But wait, how do I handle the recursion? Maybe a helper function that adds all subclasses of a given class to the set. Let me think about the steps.

Initialize an empty set. Then, for the initial class, get its direct subclasses and add them to the set. Then for each of those subclasses, do the same. But I need to make sure I don't process the same class multiple times. Oh right, because once a subclass is added to the set, processing it again would just add its subclasses again, which might already be in the set. So using a set will automatically handle duplicates.

Wait, but the initial call to __subclasses__ might not capture all possible subclasses if they are not directly derived. But the helper function should handle that by recursively checking each subclass.

Let me outline the code structure. The function subclasses takes a class cls. Then, we can use a set to collect all subclasses. We can start by getting the direct subclasses with cls.__subclasses__(), then for each of those, we call the same function again and add their results to the set.

Wait, but that would be a recursive approach. However, if I do that, I need to make sure that the function doesn't include the original class itself. Also, the __subclasses__ method returns the direct subclasses, so the helper function should process each of them.

Alternatively, maybe using a loop and a queue or stack to process each class level by level. Like a breadth-first search approach. But recursion might be simpler here.

Wait, here's an example. Suppose cls is A, which has subclass B, which has subclass C. The function should return [B, C]. So starting with A's direct subclasses (B), then for B, get its direct subclasses (C), add them. So the set would accumulate all of them.

So the code could be:

def subclasses(cls):
    result = set()
    for subcls in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.add(subcls)
        result.update(subclasses(subcls))
    return result

Wait, but this would collect all subclasses recursively. However, what about multiple inheritance? For example, if a class has multiple subclasses, each of which might have their own. But the __subclasses__ method returns all direct subclasses regardless of inheritance, so this should handle that.

But wait, the __subclasses__ method returns all immediate subclasses. So the recursive approach would collect all descendants. However, the initial code might miss some subclasses if they are not directly derived. No, because the recursion would go through each subclass's own subclasses.

Wait, let me test this logic. Suppose I have a class hierarchy like A -> B -> C. When I call subclasses(A), it first adds B, then calls subclasses(B), which adds C. So the result is {B, C}. That seems correct.

Another case: A has B and C as direct subclasses. B has D as a subclass. Then subclasses(A) would collect B, C, D. Because when processing B, we add D, and then process D's subclasses (none), so it's correct.

But what about if a subclass is added multiple times through different paths? For example, if there's a class D that is a subclass of both B and C. But in Python, a class can't have multiple base classes in a way that would cause it to be listed multiple times in the __subclasses__ of different parents. Wait, no. If D is a subclass of B, then B's __subclasses__ includes D. If D is also a subclass of C, then C's __subclasses__ includes D. So in the case where A has B and C as subclasses, and D is a subclass of both, then when we call subclasses(A), we first add B and C. Then, when processing B, we add D. When processing C, we add D again. But since result is a set, duplicates are automatically handled. So the set will contain B, C, D once.

But the problem is that the __subclasses__ method returns all direct subclasses, so even if D is a subclass of both B and C, it would be added once when processing B and once when processing C. However, the set will take care of that.

But wait, the __subclasses__ method is part of the class's internal structure. So when you call cls.__subclasses__(), it returns all the classes that directly inherit from cls. So the recursive approach should work.

But what about classes that are not yet loaded? For example, if a subclass is defined later. But the __subclasses__ method returns all known subclasses at the time of the call. So if the code is run before those subclasses are defined, they might not be found. However, the function is supposed to return all subclasses, and in Python, the __subclasses__ method returns all subclasses that have been registered up to that point. So this is a limitation, but perhaps that's acceptable for the function's purpose.

Another thing to note is that the function returns a set, but the order might not be preserved. However, the problem says to return all subclasses, and sets are unordered. If the user expects a list, maybe they should convert it to a list. But the docstring says "return all subclasses", and the example code uses a set. However, the original problem didn't specify whether the order matters. The function signature doesn't mention returning a list, but perhaps the user expects a list. Wait, looking back, the function signature says "return all subclasses of a class, recursively" but doesn't specify the data structure. The initial code example I thought of uses a set, but maybe the user expects a list. However, the problem says to return all, and sets are more appropriate for avoiding duplicates. But maybe the user wants a list. Hmm, but the original code example in the problem's docstring doesn't specify, so perhaps the user is okay with a set. However, in Python, the __subclasses__ returns a list, but when you add them to a set, it's unordered.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects a list. But the problem says to return all, and the function can return a set or a list. However, the initial code example I wrote returns a set. Let me check.

The problem says to return all subclasses recursively. So the function could return a list or a set. But in Python, the __subclasses__ method returns a list of direct subclasses. However, using a set ensures that duplicates are not present. But if the user wants a list, perhaps with duplicates removed, but the order is not important. However, the function's return type isn't specified, but the example code uses a set. Let me proceed with that.

Wait, but in the code I wrote, the function returns a set. However, the initial call to cls.__subclasses__() returns a list. So when adding to the set, it's okay. But the code may need to handle that.

Another thing: The function is supposed to return all subclasses, but what about the class itself? The docstring says "subclasses", so the original class should not be included. For example, if you call subclasses(A), it should not include A. So the code is correct in that aspect.

So putting it all together, the code would be:

def subclasses(cls):
    """
    Return all subclasses of a class, recursively
    """
    result = set()
    for subcls in cls.__subclasses__():
        result.add(subcls)
        result.update(subclasses(subcls))
    return result

Wait, but this code might not capture all subclasses if they are not directly derived. Wait, no. Because for each subclass found, it recursively checks their subclasses. So even if a subclass is two levels deep, it will be added.

But let me test with an example. Suppose:

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class C(B):
    pass

Then, subclasses(A) should return {B, C}.

When we call subclasses(A), the first loop adds B to the result. Then, recursively call subclasses(B), which adds C. So the result is {B, C}.

Yes, that works.

Another example: class D(A), class E(D), class F(E). Then subclasses(A) would return {D, E, F}.

But what about if there's a class that is a subclass of multiple classes? Like class G(B, D). Then, when we call subclasses(B), it would include G, and subclasses(D) would include G as well. But since the set is used, it would only be added once.

But the function is supposed to return all subclasses of the original class. So in this case, G is a subclass of B, which is a subclass of A. So it should be included in subclasses(A). The code would add B, then process B's subclasses (G), then process G's subclasses. So yes.

But what about if a subclass is added dynamically? For example, if someone adds a subclass after the initial call. But the __subclasses__ method returns all subclasses known at the time of the call, so that's a limitation of the approach. However, that's how Python works, so the function can't do anything about that.

Another thing: The function may not capture all subclasses if they are not directly derived. But with recursion, it should. For example, if a class has a subclass that has another subclass, the recursion will handle it.

So the code seems correct. However, I need to make sure that it's handling all possible subclasses. Also, note that the __subclasses__ method returns all immediate subclasses, so the recursion is necessary.

But wait, the code as written would not include the subclasses of the subclasses. Let me see. The code adds subcls to the result, then calls subclasses(subcls) and updates the result with that. So for each subcls, it adds all of its subclasses recursively. So yes, that should collect all descendants.

So the code seems correct. Now, I need to write it in Python, making sure that the function is properly defined. Also, the docstring is provided, so the code should have that.

But the user said to generate the code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature is def subclasses(cls):, and the docstring is as given. So the code I wrote should fit.

Wait, but in Python, the __subclasses__ method is a method of the type, not the class instance. So when you call cls.__subclasses__(), it's correct. For example, for a class A, A.__subclasses__() returns all direct subclasses.

So the code should work. Let me check for edge cases. What if the class has no subclasses? Then the function returns an empty set. That's correct.

Another case: if a subclass is added after the initial call. But again, that's a limitation of the method. The function can't track that unless it's called again.

So the code seems to meet the requirements. Therefore, the generated code should be as follows.
