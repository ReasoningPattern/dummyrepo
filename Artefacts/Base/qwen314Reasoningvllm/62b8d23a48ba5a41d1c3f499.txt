Okay, I need to generate Python code for the popitem method based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring says it removes and returns the least recently used (key, value) pair. That makes me think of an LRU cache, where the least recently used items are evicted first.

So, the method is part of a class, probably something that manages a cache. The standard library has an OrderedDict which has a move_to_end method and popitem that can remove the least recently used item. But maybe the user wants a custom implementation?

Wait, the function signature is def popitem(self), so it's a method of a class. The docstring mentions LRU, so the class likely maintains a list or some structure to track the usage order of keys.

Let me think about how to implement this. If I were to create a class that keeps track of the order of insertion or access, perhaps using a dictionary and a list. But for efficiency, maybe using an OrderedDict from the collections module. However, the user might not want to use external modules, so maybe a custom approach.

Alternatively, if this is part of a class that's supposed to mimic an LRU cache, then the popitem method would need to remove the least recently used item. In that case, the class might have a dictionary to store the items and a list or deque to track the order of usage.

Wait, but the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. It doesn't specify whether to use existing data structures or implement from scratch. Since the user is a Python software engineer, maybe they expect using the built-in OrderedDict's popitem method which can be set to pop the least recently used item.

But the default popitem for OrderedDict removes the last inserted item, but if you use the 'last=False' argument, it removes the first inserted. However, in Python 3.7+, regular dicts maintain insertion order, but they don't have a built-in way to track least recently used without additional code.

Alternatively, maybe the class is using a list to keep track of the order of keys. When a key is accessed, it's moved to the end of the list. Then, when popitem is called, it removes the first item in the list.

So, the class would have a dictionary and a list. The popitem method would pop the first element of the list and remove it from the dictionary. But how to handle the order when items are accessed?

Wait, the docstring says "least recently used", which implies that when items are accessed (get or set), their position in the order is updated. So, maybe the class is a cache where each access moves the key to the end, making it the most recently used. Then, the least recently used is the first element in the list.

So, the popitem method would remove the first element. Let me outline the steps:

The class should have a dictionary (self.cache) and a list (self.order) to track the order of keys. When a key is accessed (via __getitem__), it's moved to the end of the order list. When a new key is added, it's appended to the order list. When popitem is called, it removes the first element from the order list and deletes it from the cache, then returns the (key, value) pair.

But the problem is only to implement the popitem method. However, the class's other methods (like __setitem__ and __getitem__) would need to manage the order list. But since the user hasn't provided the full class, maybe I should assume that the class has already maintained the order, and the popitem is just removing the first item.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the OrderedDict's popitem method. Let me check the OrderedDict's documentation. OrderedDict.popitem(last=False) removes and returns the least recently inserted item. So if the class is an OrderedDict, then the popitem method can be implemented as:

def popitem(self):
    return super().popitem(last=False)

But the user's docstring says "least recently used", which is the same as the least recently inserted if the cache is using insertion order. However, in an LRU cache, the least recently used is determined by access times, not just insertion. So maybe the class is maintaining a list where each access moves the key to the end, and popitem removes the first one.

But again, without knowing the full context of the class, perhaps the user expects a simple implementation using a standard data structure. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Let's assume the class has a dictionary and a list. The popitem method would remove the first element of the list and the corresponding key from the dictionary. But how to handle when the list is empty? Also, the method should return the (key, value) pair.

So, here's a possible code structure:

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.order = []

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.order.remove(key)
        self.cache[key] = value
        self.order.append(key)

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.order.remove(key)
            self.order.append(key)
            return self.cache[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self.order:
            raise KeyError("Cache is empty")
        key = self.order.pop(0)
        value = self.cache.pop(key)
        return key, value

But this is a possible implementation. However, the problem is that the user hasn't provided the full class, so maybe they expect that the class already has the necessary structures. But since the question is to generate the code for the popitem method, perhaps the rest of the class is already in place, and the popitem is to be written.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a class that uses a deque or another structure. However, the code above is a basic approach. But the problem is that in the __setitem__ method, if the key is already present, we remove it from the order list and append it again. Similarly, in __getitem__, we move the key to the end. Then, popitem removes the first element of the order list, which is the least recently used.

But this code has some inefficiencies. For example, removing from the middle of a list is O(n), which could be slow for large caches. However, perhaps the user is looking for a simple implementation rather than an optimized one.

Another approach is to use collections.OrderedDict, which has move_to_end and popitem methods. For example, in an LRU cache, when a key is accessed, it's moved to the end. When popitem is called, it removes the first item (least recently used).

So, the class could be:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)
        self.cache[key] = value
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)
            return self.cache[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self.cache:
            raise KeyError("Cache is empty")
        return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But this uses OrderedDict. However, the original question didn't mention using OrderedDict. But the user is a Python software engineer, so they might be familiar with that.

But the problem says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function is part of a class, but the class isn't provided. So maybe the user expects that the class is using an OrderedDict, and the popitem method is simply calling the OrderedDict's popitem with last=False.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a custom implementation without using OrderedDict. But given that the function is named popitem and the docstring refers to LRU, the OrderedDict approach is more likely.

But the original code's function is def popitem(self), and the docstring says it removes the least recently used. So the code would be as in the OrderedDict example.

But the user might not want to import OrderedDict. However, the problem doesn't specify any constraints on that. So, assuming that the class is using OrderedDict, the popitem method can be implemented as shown.

Alternatively, if the class is a regular dictionary with an order list, then the code would be as I first wrote.

But since the user hasn't provided the class's other methods, perhaps they just want the popitem method that uses the OrderedDict's functionality.

But the question says to generate Python code based on the function signature and docstring. So perhaps the class is already defined, and the popitem method is to be written. However, without knowing the class's internal structure, it's hard to implement.

Wait, the initial code given is just the function signature and docstring. So the user is expecting me to write the code for the popitem method. But the method's implementation depends on how the class tracks the least recently used item.

If the class is an OrderedDict, then the code would be as simple as returning super().popitem(last=False). But if the class is a regular dictionary with an order list, then the code would involve popping from the order list and the dictionary.

But since the user hasn't provided any context about the class's structure, perhaps the answer is to use the OrderedDict's popitem method. However, the problem might be expecting a custom implementation.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the popitem method of the OrderedDict, which is part of the standard library. But the question says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. So perhaps the answer is to use the OrderedDict's popitem method with last=False.

But the user might not want to use external modules. However, the problem doesn't specify that. So, given that, I think the most accurate answer is to implement the popitem method using OrderedDict's built-in functionality, as that's the standard way to handle LRU in Python.

So the code would be:

from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = OrderedDict()

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        return self.cache.popitem(last=False)

But wait, the __init__ method might need a capacity, but the original question doesn't mention that. However, the function signature is just for popitem. So maybe the class is an OrderedDict, and the popitem is just calling the OrderedDict's method.

But the user's code might be part of a class that's not using OrderedDict. But without more context, it's hard to know. However, given the docstring, the most straightforward way is to use OrderedDict's popitem with last=False.

Alternatively, if the class is a regular dictionary with an order list, then the code would be:

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.order = []

    def popitem(self):
        """
        Remove and return the `(key, value)` pair least recently used.
        """
        if not self.order:
            raise KeyError("Cache is empty")
        key = self.order.pop(0)
        value = self.cache.pop(key)
        return (key, value)

But this would require that the order list is maintained properly in other methods. However, the user hasn't provided those, so maybe they just want the popitem method as per the docstring, assuming that the order list is maintained elsewhere.

But the problem is to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. Since the user hasn't provided the rest of the class, perhaps they expect that the code is part of a class that uses an OrderedDict, and the popitem is implemented as such.

But I need to make sure that the code is correct. The OrderedDict's popitem with last=False removes the first inserted item, which in the case of an LRU cache would be the least recently used. However, in an LRU cache, when items are accessed, they are marked as recently used. So the OrderedDict's move_to_end method is used when accessing items.

But again, the user's question is only about the popitem method. So perhaps the answer is to use OrderedDict's popitem with last=False, and the rest of the class is assumed to handle the ordering.

Alternatively, if the class is not using OrderedDict, but a regular dict and a list, then the code I wrote earlier.

But since the user is a Python software engineer, they might be aware of OrderedDict. However, the problem says to generate code based on the given function signature and docstring. The docstring is similar to OrderedDict's popitem method.

So, considering that, the correct code would be using OrderedDict's popitem with last=False. Therefore, the code would be as follows.
