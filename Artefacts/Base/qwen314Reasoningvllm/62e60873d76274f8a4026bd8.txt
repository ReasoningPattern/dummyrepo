Okay, I need to generate Python code for the protocol_handlers function based on the given signature and docstring. Let me think about what this function does.

The function is a method of a class, probably related to handling different versions of a protocol, like Bolt. The docstring says it returns a dictionary of available handlers keyed by version tuples. If a protocol_version is provided, the dict should have zero or one entries depending on support. Otherwise, all versions are returned.

First, I should check the parameters. The protocol_version is a tuple or None. The function needs to validate that if it's provided, it's indeed a tuple. If not, raise a TypeError. So, the first step is to check the type of protocol_version. If it's not None and not a tuple, raise the error.

Next, how to get the available handlers. The function is probably part of a class that has some registered handlers. Maybe there's a class-level dictionary or a list of supported versions. But the code isn't provided, so I need to make assumptions here.

Looking at the return type: a dictionary mapping version tuples to handler classes. So, the function needs to collect all supported versions and their corresponding handlers. If a specific version is given, check if it's supported and include it in the dict.

Wait, the docstring mentions that if protocol_version is provided, the dict will have zero or one items. So, if the version is not supported, return an empty dict. Otherwise, return the handler for that version.

So, the function needs to know which versions are supported. Maybe the class has a class variable like SUPPORTED_VERSIONS, which is a list of tuples. Then, for each version in that list, map to the corresponding handler class.

But how to map versions to handlers? Perhaps each handler is a subclass of a base class, and the class has a way to determine the handler for each version. Alternatively, there might be a registry.

Alternatively, maybe the class itself is a handler, and different versions are handled by different classes. But the function is returning a dictionary of version to handler class. So perhaps the cls is the base class, and the function is supposed to collect all subclasses that handle specific versions.

Wait, the function is called on a class (cls), so maybe it's a class method. The docstring says "available Bolt protocol handlers", so perhaps the class has a way to know which versions it supports.

But without more context, I need to make some assumptions. Let's think of a common pattern. Maybe there's a class-level dictionary that maps version tuples to handler classes. For example, something like:

class SomeClass:
    _handlers = {
        (3, 5): HandlerClass3_5,
        (4, 0): HandlerClass4_0,
    }

Then, the protocol_handlers method would check if protocol_version is provided. If it is, check if it's in _handlers and return a dict with that entry. If not, return all entries in _handlers.

But the function is called with 'cls' as the first parameter, which suggests it's a class method. So, maybe the code is part of a base class, and the handlers are registered in a class variable.

So, the steps for the code:

1. Check if protocol_version is not None and not a tuple. If so, raise TypeError.
2. If protocol_version is provided, check if it's in the supported versions. If yes, return {protocol_version: handler_class}, else return empty dict.
3. If not provided, return all supported versions mapped to their handlers.

But how to get the handler classes? Maybe the class has a class variable called HANDLERS which is a dictionary. Then, the function can just return that, filtered based on the protocol_version.

Wait, the function's name is protocol_handlers, and it's returning a dict of version to handler class. So perhaps the cls has a way to know which versions it supports. For example, maybe each handler class has a VERSION attribute, and the function collects all subclasses of cls that have this attribute.

Alternatively, the class might have a registry of versions. Let me think of a possible implementation.

Assuming that the class has a class variable named SUPPORTED_VERSIONS, which is a list of tuples, and another variable HANDLERS which maps each version to the corresponding handler class. But maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, the SUPPORTED_VERSIONS could be a list, and for each version in that list, the handler is determined by some logic, like a mapping.

But since the code is supposed to be generated, maybe the function is part of a base class, and the handlers are registered in a module or through some other mechanism. However, without more context, perhaps the code is using a class-level dictionary.

Another possibility: the function is part of a metaclass or a registry system where each handler class registers itself with a version. But again, without knowing the exact setup, I need to make a standard approach.

Let me think of a simple example. Suppose the class has a class variable called _HANDLERS which is a dictionary. Then, the function can return that dictionary, possibly filtered.

But the function is called as cls.protocol_handlers(), so it's a class method. So, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    # Now, get the handlers
    if protocol_version is None:
        return cls._HANDLERS.copy()
    else:
        return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS.get(protocol_version, None)}

Wait, but the return type is a dictionary of version to handler class. So, if the protocol_version is not supported, return an empty dict. So, in the else clause, check if protocol_version is in _HANDLERS. If yes, return {protocol_version: ...}, else empty.

But where is _HANDLERS defined? The code would need to have that. However, the user hasn't provided that, so perhaps the code is incomplete. But the user wants the function based on the signature and docstring. So maybe the code is supposed to assume that the class has a certain structure.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a system where each handler class is registered with a version. For example, using a decorator or a registry.

But given the lack of context, perhaps the code is supposed to be a stub or a skeleton. However, the user wants the code that implements the function.

Wait, the function is supposed to return the dictionary. So, the code must have access to the available handlers. Since the user hasn't provided any code, perhaps the code is supposed to be a class method that accesses a class-level variable.

So, assuming that the class has a class variable named _HANDLERS which is a dictionary mapping version tuples to handler classes. Then, the code would be:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    if protocol_version is None:
        return dict(cls._HANDLERS)
    else:
        return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)}

But wait, the docstring says that if protocol_version is provided, the dict will contain either zero or one items. So, if the version is not supported, return empty dict. So, in the else clause, check if protocol_version is in cls._HANDLERS. If it is, return {protocol_version: ...}, else return {}.

But how to structure that? Maybe:

handlers = {}
if protocol_version in cls._HANDLERS:
    handlers[protocol_version] = cls._HANDLERS[protocol_version]
return handlers

But then, the code would need to have cls._HANDLERS defined. However, the user hasn't given that, so perhaps that's part of the code that's expected to be written.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a base class, and the handlers are determined by checking subclasses. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, the code could be using a module-level registry. But again, without knowing, perhaps the simplest approach is to assume that the class has a class variable called _HANDLERS which is a dictionary of supported versions.

So, the code would look like this:

def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    if protocol_version is None:
        return dict(cls._HANDLERS)
    else:
        return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)}

But then, the class needs to have _HANDLERS defined. However, the user hasn't provided that. So maybe the code is supposed to be a class method that is part of a class that has such a variable.

But since the user hasn't given any other code, perhaps the code is incomplete. However, the user is asking to generate the function based on the signature and docstring. So the function is supposed to return the dictionary, and the actual data is elsewhere.

But the user's instruction says to generate the code based on the given function signature and docstring. So the code should include the function, but the rest of the code (like the _HANDLERS) is not provided. Therefore, the code would be the function as written, assuming that the class has a _HANDLERS attribute.

But the user might expect that the code includes the _HANDLERS as part of the class. However, the original code provided by the user only includes the function definition. So perhaps the code is supposed to be a class method that is part of a class that has a _HANDLERS class variable.

But the user hasn't provided that. Therefore, the code generated should just implement the function, assuming that the class has the necessary data.

Another thing: the function is called with 'cls' as the first parameter. That suggests it's a class method, so the code should be decorated with @classmethod.

Wait, the original code shows def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):, which is a class method. So the code should have @classmethod decorator.

So, the code would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    ...
    """
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    if protocol_version is None:
        return dict(cls._HANDLERS)
    else:
        return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)}

But again, the _HANDLERS is assumed to be a class variable.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that uses a different approach. For example, using a registry of subclasses. Suppose that each handler class is a subclass of cls, and each has a VERSION attribute. Then, the function would collect all subclasses and check their VERSION.

But that's more involved. Let me think. For example:

class BaseHandler:
    @classmethod
    def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
        # collect all subclasses that have a VERSION attribute
        handlers = {}
        for subclass in cls.__subclasses__():
            if hasattr(subclass, 'VERSION'):
                version = subclass.VERSION
                if protocol_version is None or version == protocol_version:
                    handlers[version] = subclass
        return handlers

But this approach would recursively check all subclasses. However, the original docstring says "available Bolt protocol handlers", which might be a fixed set, not dynamically discovered.

But the user hasn't specified, so perhaps the first approach with a class variable is better.

So, putting it all together, the code would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    if protocol_version is None:
        return dict(cls._HANDLERS)
    else:
        return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)}

But then, the class needs to have _HANDLERS defined. However, the user hasn't provided that, so perhaps the code is incomplete. But the user's request is to generate the function based on the given signature and docstring, so the rest of the code (like the _HANDLERS) is not part of this function's code.

Wait, the user provided the function signature and docstring, and wants the code generated. So the code should be the function, but the actual data (like the handlers) is not part of this function. Therefore, the code would be as above, assuming that the class has a _HANDLERS attribute.

But the user might not have mentioned that. However, the function's docstring says it returns the available handlers, so the code must have a way to access them. Therefore, the code would need to have that.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a list of supported versions, and for each version, the handler is the class itself. But that doesn't make sense if there are multiple versions.

Another approach: Maybe the function is part of a base class, and each subclass is responsible for a specific version. For example, the base class has a class method that returns all subclasses that have a VERSION attribute. But again, without knowing the exact setup, it's hard to say.

But given the parameters, the most straightforward implementation is to check if protocol_version is a tuple, then return the corresponding entry in a class-level dictionary. So the code would be as above, with the @classmethod decorator.

Wait, the original code provided by the user doesn't have the @classmethod decorator. The function is defined as def protocol_handlers(cls, ...):, which is a class method. So in Python, that's correct. But the user's code may or may not have the decorator. However, the user's provided code doesn't include it. But in Python, if you have a method that takes 'cls' as the first parameter, it's a class method, so the decorator is needed. However, maybe the user's code is using a different approach, like a static method or something else. But given the parameters, it's a class method.

So, the generated code should include the @classmethod decorator.

But the user's original code didn't have it. Wait, looking back: the user provided the function signature as def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):. In Python, that's a class method, but the decorator is not present. However, in Python, you can have a method that takes 'cls' as the first parameter without the decorator, but that's not standard. So perhaps the user's code is missing the decorator, but the correct code should have it.

But the user's instruction says to generate code based on the function signature and docstring. The function signature shows 'cls' as the first parameter, which implies it's a class method, so the code should have @classmethod.

Therefore, the code should start with @classmethod.

So, putting all together, the code would be:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    Return a dictionary of available Bolt protocol handlers,
    keyed by version tuple. If an explicit protocol version is
    provided, the dictionary will contain either zero or one items,
    depending on whether that version is supported. If no protocol
    version is provided, all available versions will be returned.

    :param protocol_version: tuple identifying a specific protocol
        version (e.g. (3, 5)) or None
    :return: dictionary of version tuple to handler class for all
        relevant and supported protocol versions
    :raise TypeError: if protocol version is not passed in a tuple
    """
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    if protocol_version is None:
        return dict(cls._HANDLERS)
    else:
        return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS.get(protocol_version)}

But then, the class must have a _HANDLERS class variable. However, the user hasn't provided that. But the user's request is to generate the function, not the entire class. So the code is correct as per the given function signature and docstring.

Another thing: the return statement for the case when protocol_version is provided. If the version is not in _HANDLERS, then the get returns None, so the dictionary would have the key with None as the value. But the docstring says that if the version is not supported, return zero items. So in that case, we should check if the version is present and return it, else return empty dict.

So, modifying the else part:

else:
    if protocol_version in cls._HANDLERS:
        return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS[protocol_version]}
    else:
        return {}

But how to implement that? Let me adjust the code:

@classmethod
def protocol_handlers(cls, protocol_version=None):
    """
    ...
    """
    if protocol_version is not None and not isinstance(protocol_version, tuple):
        raise TypeError("Protocol version must be a tuple")
    if protocol_version is None:
        return dict(cls._HANDLERS)
    else:
        if protocol_version in cls._HANDLERS:
            return {protocol_version: cls._HANDLERS[protocol_version]}
        else:
            return {}

But then, the code assumes that cls._HANDLERS is a dictionary. So the class must have that variable.

Alternatively, maybe the function is part of a class that has a list of supported versions, and each version maps to the same class. But that's not likely.

So, the code I have now should be correct. Let me check the docstring again.

The docstring says that if protocol_version is provided, the dict will contain zero or one items. So if the version is not supported, return empty dict. If it is, return the one item.

So the code in the else clause should check if the protocol_version is in the _HANDLERS, and return the corresponding entry, else return empty dict.

Yes. So the code would be as above.

But the user's original code didn't have the @classmethod decorator. However, in Python, the function is a class method if it takes 'cls' as the first parameter. But to make it a class method, the decorator is needed. So the generated code should include that.

Therefore, the final code would have the @classmethod decorator, the type check, and the logic to return the appropriate dictionary.
