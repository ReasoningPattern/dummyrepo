Okay, let's see. I need to generate Python code for the validate_from_content function based on the given signature and docstring. The function is supposed to validate that the spec content (which is YAML) has all required fields. If any mandatory data is missing, it should raise an IRValidatorException. And it returns a dictionary with the data loaded from the spec file.

First, I need to figure out what the required fields are. The problem is, the original code isn't provided, so I have to make assumptions here. Maybe the class 'cls' has some predefined required fields? Or perhaps the function is part of a class that handles validation, and the required fields are known within that context.

The function takes spec_content as a parameter. If it's None, maybe it's supposed to load from a file? Wait, the docstring says it's the content of the spec file, so perhaps the function is supposed to process that content. But the return is a dictionary with data loaded from the spec. So maybe the function is parsing the YAML content into a dictionary and then checking for required keys.

But how does the function know which fields are required? The original code might have a list of required fields defined somewhere. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe I need to include a placeholder for required fields. Alternatively, maybe the class has a class variable that lists the required fields.

Assuming that the class 'cls' has a class variable called REQUIRED_FIELDS which contains the list of mandatory keys. Then, the function would check if all those keys are present in spec_content. If any are missing, it raises the exception.

Wait, but the function is a class method, as it's defined with 'cls' as the first parameter. So, perhaps the class has a list of required fields. Let me think about the steps:

1. Parse the spec_content (which is a YAML string) into a Python dictionary. So I need to use a YAML parser, like PyYAML's yaml.safe_load.

2. Check if all required fields are present in the parsed dictionary. If any are missing, raise IRValidatorException.

3. Return the parsed dictionary.

But the user hasn't specified what the required fields are. So maybe in the code, the required fields are defined as a class-level attribute. For example, the class might have something like REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2', ...].

So the function would first load the YAML content into a dict. Then, iterate over the required fields and check if each exists in the dict. If any are missing, raise the exception.

Also, need to handle the case where spec_content is None. But according to the docstring, it's the content of the spec file. So maybe if it's None, the function should load it from a default source? Wait, the parameters say spec_content is optional, but the function's purpose is to validate the content. If spec_content is None, perhaps it's an error? Or maybe the function is designed to take the content, and if it's not provided, it might read from a file? But the docstring doesn't mention that. Hmm.

Wait, the function's name is validate_from_content, which suggests that it's validating based on the provided content. So if spec_content is None, maybe it's invalid? But the docstring doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to load the content from a file if spec_content is None. But the parameters don't mention a filename. The original code might have a different approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is part of a larger system where spec_content is passed in, and if it's None, maybe it's an error. But the user hasn't given more details. Since the docstring says it raises an exception when mandatory data is missing, maybe the function expects spec_content to be provided. However, the parameter is optional, so maybe the function can handle cases where it's not provided, but that's unclear.

Wait, the return is a dictionary with data loaded from a spec file. So maybe the function is supposed to parse the YAML content into a dict, regardless of whether it's provided or not. But if spec_content is None, how can it parse? Maybe the function is intended to be called with spec_content already provided, and if it's None, perhaps it's an error. But the docstring doesn't mention that. This is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read the spec file from somewhere else if spec_content is None. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, the user's docstring says that the function validates the spec content, so perhaps the spec_content is expected to be provided. But the parameter is optional. Hmm.

Well, given the ambiguity, perhaps the function is supposed to parse the spec_content into a dictionary, and if it's None, maybe it's a default case. But the problem is that without knowing the required fields, I can't proceed. So maybe I need to include a placeholder for the required fields. For example, the class might have a list of required fields, and the function checks against that.

So, here's a possible approach:

- Use yaml.safe_load to parse spec_content into a dict. If spec_content is None, maybe the function can't proceed, but perhaps the user expects that the function is called with the content already loaded. Or maybe the function is supposed to read from a file, but that's not indicated here.

Wait, the function is named validate_from_content, which suggests that it's validating based on the content provided. So maybe the spec_content is a string that's the YAML content. So the first step is to parse that string into a dictionary.

But if spec_content is None, then parsing would fail. However, the parameter is optional, so maybe the function is designed to handle cases where it's not provided. But the docstring says that it raises an exception when mandatory data is missing. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that the spec_content is not None, and also that the required fields are present.

Alternatively, maybe the spec_content is a file path, but the name suggests it's the content itself. So I think the first step is to parse the YAML content into a dictionary. Then check for required fields.

So, the code would look something like:

import yaml

class SomeClass:
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2', ...]

    @classmethod
    def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
        if spec_content is None:
            # Maybe raise an error here?
            # But the docstring doesn't mention that. Hmm.
            # Or maybe it's supposed to load from a default file?
            # Without more info, perhaps assume that spec_content is provided.
            # But the parameter is optional. Maybe the function is supposed to read from a file if spec_content is None?
            # However, the user hasn't provided that info. Maybe the original code had that, but the user didn't include it.

            # Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps the function expects spec_content to be provided. So if it's None, maybe raise an error?
            # But the docstring doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to load from a file, but the parameter is named spec_content, which is confusing.

            # This is a problem. Without knowing how spec_content is handled when None, I can't proceed. But the user hasn't given more details. Maybe the original code had a way to load it, but the user only provided the function signature.

            # Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to be called with spec_content already loaded, and if it's None, it's considered invalid. But that's just a guess.

            # For the purpose of generating code, perhaps the function is supposed to parse the YAML content. If spec_content is None, maybe it's an error. But the docstring doesn't mention that. Hmm.

            # Let me check the original function signature again. The parameters say spec_content is the content of the spec file. So maybe the function is supposed to process that content, which is a string. If it's None, perhaps it's invalid. But the user hasn't specified that, so maybe the function is designed to have spec_content passed in, and if it's None, maybe it's a default case. However, the return is a dictionary with data loaded from the spec, so if spec_content is None, maybe it returns an empty dict? But that doesn't make sense.

            # Given the ambiguity, perhaps proceed under the assumption that spec_content is a string that needs to be parsed into a dict. If it's None, then maybe the function can't validate and raises an error. But the docstring doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to load the content from a file, but the parameter is named spec_content, which is confusing.

            # Maybe the original code had a way to load the spec_content from a file if it's None. But since the user hasn't provided that, perhaps I should assume that the spec_content is provided as a string, and if it's None, then the function can't proceed. However, the function's docstring says it raises an exception when mandatory data is missing. So perhaps the function is supposed to check that the content is not None and that the required fields are present.

            # Let me proceed with the following steps:

            # 1. Check if spec_content is None. If so, raise an exception? Or maybe the function is supposed to read from a file? But without knowing the filename, that's not possible. So maybe the function is designed to take the content as input, and if it's None, then it's invalid. But the user's docstring doesn't mention that. Hmm.

            # Maybe the original code had a different approach, but since I don't have that, I have to make assumptions. Let's assume that spec_content is a string that needs to be parsed. If it's None, perhaps the function returns an empty dict? But that's not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the function is supposed to read from a default location, but again, no info.

            # Given that the function returns a dictionary with data loaded from the spec, perhaps the first step is to parse the YAML content into a dict. If spec_content is None, then maybe it's an error. But the user's docstring doesn't specify that. However, the function's parameters say spec_content is optional, so maybe it's allowed to be None. But then, how can you validate it? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the function is intended to be called with spec_content provided, and if it's None, maybe it's a mistake. But the user hasn't specified.

            # Maybe the original code had a default value, but the user's code snippet shows spec_content=None. So perhaps the function is supposed to handle cases where it's not provided, but without knowing the required fields, I can't proceed. So perhaps the required fields are part of the class, and the function checks those.

            # Let me proceed with the following code structure:

            # Parse the YAML content into a dict. If spec_content is None, maybe raise an error?

            # Then check for required fields.

            # Also, need to import yaml and define the exception.

            # So here's the code:

            # import yaml
            # from some_module import IRValidatorException

            # Then, in the function:

            # if spec_content is None:
            #     raise IRValidatorException("spec_content cannot be None")

            # data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)

            # for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            #     if field not in data:
            #         raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")

            # return data

            # But since the user hasn't provided the required fields, perhaps the code should have a placeholder for them. However, the user's docstring says that the function validates that the spec has all required fields, but doesn't specify which ones. So maybe the required fields are defined in the class, and the function uses that.

            # So the code would need to have a class variable REQUIRED_FIELDS in the class that this method belongs to. But since the user hasn't provided that, I have to include it in the code.

            # However, the user's code is supposed to be generated based on the function signature and docstring. Since the required fields are not specified, perhaps the code is incomplete. But the user might expect that the code includes the validation logic, even if the required fields are placeholders.

            # Alternatively, maybe the required fields are known in the context of the class. For example, if this is part of a class that represents a spec, then the required fields would be specific to that class.

            # Given that, I'll proceed to write the code with the assumption that the class has a REQUIRED_FIELDS attribute, and the function checks for that.

            # Also, the exception IRValidatorException is not defined in the code. So perhaps it's a custom exception that needs to be imported or defined.

            # So the code would be:

            # import yaml
            # from some_module import IRValidatorException

            # class SomeClass:
            #     REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2', ...]

            #     @classmethod
            #     def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
            #         if spec_content is None:
            #             raise IRValidatorException("No spec content provided")
            #         data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
            #         for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            #             if field not in data:
            #                 raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
            #         return data

            # But since the user hasn't provided the required fields, perhaps the code is incomplete. However, the user might expect that the code includes the logic, even with placeholders.

            # Alternatively, maybe the required fields are determined by the structure of the YAML. But without knowing that, it's impossible to code.

            # Given the ambiguity, but the user's instruction to generate code based on the function signature and docstring, I'll proceed with the code that parses the YAML content, checks for required fields defined in the class, and raises the exception if any are missing. The required fields would need to be defined in the class, but since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps I can leave them as a placeholder.

            # Also, the function is a class method, so it's probably part of a class that has the required fields. So the code would look like this:

            # import yaml
            # from .exceptions import IRValidatorException  # Assuming the exception is in a module

            # class SpecValidator:
            #     REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['required_field1', 'required_field2']

            #     @classmethod
            #     def validate_from_content(cls, spec_content=None):
            #         if spec_content is None:
            #             raise IRValidatorException("Spec content is required")
            #         data = yaml.safe_load(spec_content)
            #         if not data:
            #             raise IRValidatorException("Failed to parse spec content")
            #         for field in cls.REQUIRED_FIELDS:
            #             if field not in data:
            #                 raise IRValidatorException(f"Missing required field: {field}")
            #         return data

            # But the user's function is called validate_from_content, and the class is not specified. So perhaps the code should be written in a way that the class has the required fields, and the function checks against them.

            # Therefore, the generated code would include the parsing of YAML, checking for required fields in the class, and raising the exception if missing. The required fields are left as a placeholder, perhaps as a list in the class.

            # Also, need to make sure that the code is in Python markdown format, but the user says to output only the code in Python markdown format. Wait, the user says "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be written with triple backticks and the python language specified.

            # But the user's instruction says to generate Python code, not markdown. Wait, the original instruction says: "Output ONLY the code generated, in python markdown format." So the code should be enclosed in triple backticks with the python language specified.

            # So putting it all together, the code would be:

            # import yaml
            # from some_module import IRValidatorException

            # class SomeClass:
            #     REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['field1', 'field2']

            #     @classmethod

            # However, the user's original code may have different handling. For example, maybe the spec_content is a file path, and the function reads from that file. But the parameter is named spec_content, which suggests it's the content string, not the file path.

            # Also, the exception IRValidatorException is not defined here. The user might have it in their codebase, so the code should import it. But since the user hasn't provided that, I'll assume it's imported from somewhere.

            # So the generated code would include the parsing, checking required fields, and raising exceptions. The required fields are a class-level list. The function is a class method.

            # Therefore, the code should be as follows, with placeholders for the required fields and the exception.
