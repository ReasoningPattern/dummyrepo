Okay, I need to generate Python code for the status_str method based on the given function signature and docstring. The method is part of a class, probably something that has a log attribute with a status_str property. The docstring says it returns the string representation of self.log.status_str with an optional prefix.

So the function takes a prefix parameter, which defaults to an empty string. The return value should be the prefix concatenated with self.log.status_str. But wait, maybe the prefix is added before the status string? Like, if the prefix is provided, it's placed at the beginning.

I should check if self.log has a status_str attribute. Assuming that's the case, the code would be straightforward. The method just returns the prefix plus self.log.status_str. But maybe there's a need to handle cases where self.log is None? However, the docstring doesn't mention that, so perhaps it's assumed that self.log is always present.

So the code would be:

def status_str(self, prefix=''):
    """
    Return string representation with self.log.status_str, with optional prefix.
    """
    return f"{prefix}{self.log.status_str}"

Wait, but maybe the prefix is meant to be a separator or something else. Like, maybe it's adding a prefix such as "Status: " before the status string. But the docstring says "with optional prefix", so the prefix is just prepended as is. The user probably wants the method to return the prefix followed by the status string from self.log.

I think that's the correct approach. Just combine the prefix and the status_str attribute of self.log. No other processing is mentioned. So the code is simple. Make sure to use an f-string or concatenation. Also, ensure that the prefix is properly handled as a default parameter. Oh, and the method is part of a class, so self is the first parameter. The code seems correct as written.
