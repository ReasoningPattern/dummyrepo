Okay, I need to write a Python function called merge_extra_vars that takes a vars_dict and an optional extra_vars parameter. The goal is to extend vars_dict with the extra_vars. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the parameters: vars_dict is a dictionary, and extra_vars is a list. The function should merge the extra variables into vars_dict. Wait, but how exactly? The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars", but it's not clear if extra_vars is a list of key-value pairs or something else. Maybe the extra_vars are additional variables to add as key-value pairs to the vars_dict.

Assuming that extra_vars is a list of tuples or a list of dictionaries. Wait, maybe the function is meant to take a list of variables, each being a key-value pair. For example, if extra_vars is a list like [('key1', 'value1'), ('key2', 'value2')], then we need to add these to vars_dict.

Alternatively, maybe extra_vars is a dictionary, but the parameter is listed as a list. The docstring says "List of extra-vars", so probably each element in the list is a variable. But what's the structure of each element? Maybe each element is a tuple of (key, value), or perhaps a dictionary with multiple keys. Hmm, the function's name suggests that it's merging variables, so perhaps each entry in extra_vars is a key-value pair.

Wait, looking at the parameters again: the function's second parameter is extra_vars, which is a list. So, if extra_vars is provided, it's a list of variables. But how are these variables structured? Maybe each variable is a tuple (key, value), and we need to add them to vars_dict. Or maybe the list contains dictionaries, and we need to merge each into vars_dict.

But the function's docstring doesn't give examples, so I need to make an assumption here. Let me think of a common scenario. In some contexts, like in Ansible or configuration management, extra_vars might be a list of key-value pairs. So perhaps each element in extra_vars is a tuple with two elements: the key and the value. Then, the function would iterate over each tuple and add them to vars_dict.

Alternatively, if extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, then we could merge each dict into vars_dict. But the parameter is called extra_vars, which might imply individual variables. So maybe the first approach is correct.

Wait, the function's name is merge_extra_vars. So maybe the extra_vars is a list of variables, each being a key-value pair. So, for each var in extra_vars, we add it to vars_dict. But how? If each var is a tuple, then we can do vars_dict.update({key: value}).

But the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. Let me check the default value. The default is None, so if extra_vars is not provided, we do nothing. Otherwise, we need to merge them.

Wait, but the function's parameters are vars_dict and extra_vars. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". So perhaps the extra_vars is a list of variables, each of which is a key-value pair. For example, if extra_vars is [('a', 1), ('b', 2)], then we add those to vars_dict.

So the function would loop through each item in extra_vars and add them to vars_dict. But how to handle if extra_vars is not a list? Well, the parameter is specified as a list, so maybe we can assume that if it's provided, it's a list. But perhaps we should check if it's None, and if not, process it.

So the code would be something like:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    if extra_vars is not None:
        for key, value in extra_vars:
            vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

Wait, but what if the extra_vars are not in tuples? Like, if they are strings or something else. But given the parameter description, it's a list of extra-vars, which probably are key-value pairs. So the code would iterate over each element in extra_vars, assuming each is a (key, value) pair.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary is merged into vars_dict. But that's less likely. The function's name suggests adding variables, not merging dictionaries.

Another possibility: if extra_vars is a list of strings, each string is a variable name, and then we need to do something else. But without more context, it's hard to tell.

But looking at the parameters again, the function's second parameter is called extra_vars, which is a list. The docstring says "extend vars_dict with extra-vars". Maybe the extra_vars are variables that need to be added as keys to vars_dict. But how are they structured? If each element in the list is a key, then perhaps the value is None, but that's not typical.

Alternatively, maybe the function is intended to take a list of variables, each being a dictionary with a single key-value pair. But again, without examples, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the original function is inspired by something like Ansible's extra_vars, which are usually key-value pairs. So in that case, the extra_vars could be a list of tuples, or a list of dictionaries. For example, in Ansible, you can pass extra_vars as a list of key-value pairs, but in code, they might be represented as a list of dictionaries. However, the function's parameter is a list, and the docstring doesn't specify, so maybe the user expects that each element in extra_vars is a key-value pair, and we need to add them to vars_dict.

But the code would need to handle that. Let's proceed with the assumption that extra_vars is a list of (key, value) tuples. Then, the function would loop through each tuple and add them to vars_dict. However, if the user passes a list of dictionaries, this code would throw an error. But given the information, that's the best assumption.

Another thing: the function is supposed to extend vars_dict. So, perhaps it's modifying the original dictionary. But in Python, dictionaries are mutable, so if we pass vars_dict, the changes will be in-place. However, the function returns vars_dict, which is the same object. But maybe the user expects a new dictionary. Wait, the function's docstring doesn't mention returning a new dict, so probably it's modifying in-place.

But sometimes, functions that modify in-place might not be ideal. However, given the parameters, it's possible that the function is intended to modify the original vars_dict. So the code would be as I wrote before.

Wait, but what if extra_vars is None? Then, the function does nothing. So the code checks if extra_vars is not None, then processes each item.

But perhaps the function should handle cases where extra_vars is not a list. But according to the function signature, the parameter is a list. So maybe we can assume that extra_vars is either None or a list of (key, value) pairs.

So the code would be:

def merge_extra_vars(vars_dict, extra_vars=None):
    """
    Extend ``vars_dict`` with ``extra-vars``

    :param vars_dict: Dictionary to merge extra-vars into
    :param extra_vars: List of extra-vars
    """
    if extra_vars is not None:
        for key, value in extra_vars:
            vars_dict[key] = value
    return vars_dict

Wait, but if extra_vars is a list of something else, like a list of strings, this would cause an error. However, given the problem statement, the user probably expects that each element in extra_vars is a key-value pair. So this code should work.

Alternatively, maybe the extra_vars is a dictionary, but the parameter is named as a list. But the function's parameter says it's a list, so that's probably not the case.

Another possibility: the function is supposed to merge multiple dictionaries. But the parameter is a list, so maybe each element is a dictionary. Then, the code would loop through each dict in extra_vars and update vars_dict. But the docstring says "List of extra-vars", which might not be dictionaries. Hmm.

But without more information, the initial approach is the best. Let me proceed with that.
